23975,open ocean deep convection dc forming a link between the upper and the deep ocean dynamics is observed in a few localized sites of the world ocean in the present paper we further develop an analytical model of isolated vertically homogenized water columns up to a few kilometers deep usually referred to as convective chimneys we derive analytical solutions for evolution of a chimney during its deepening phase as well as during its subsequent restratification phase the initial deepening stage is considered to be primarily driven by the buoyancy loss at the sea surface while the final deepening stage and the restratification phase are affected by a buoyancy transfer through the lateral surface of the chimney by baroclinic eddies for the deepening phase analytical solutions for evolution of the depth of a chimney are derived for a constant sea surface buoyancy loss with or without synoptic perturbations and for a case of the sea surface buoyancy loss growing in time for the restratification phase time evolution of the chimney radius and an analytical expression for duration of this phase are obtained the exact solutions and their asymptotic approximations are in good agreement with the scaling laws and with model studies reported in earlier works the theoretical results also agree with an evolution of a chimney in the greenland sea derived from glorys high resolution ocean reanalysis for a given set of the background conditions a chimney can be considered a mature one after two characteristic time scales of the deepening phase are reached a mature chimney needs a longer time for its formation but decays more rapidly than a pre mature one the minimum overall chimney lifetime corresponds to the case when at about one characteristic time scale of the deepening phase the sea surface buoyancy loss abruptly drops down and the restratification phase begins keywords convection chimney baroclinic instability restratification 1 introduction deep

bashmachnikov and kovalevsky 2019 kovalevsky 2002 revealed the main physical properties and dynamics of the convective chimneys and plumes in sub polar regions deepening of the upper mixed layer begins during late autumn and continues to early spring when the deepest convection is detected marshall and schott 1999 gladyshev et al 2016 bashmachnikov et al 2018 the dc chimneys in a quasi stable state typically stay open for 1 3 months in spring when the vertical buoyancy flux from the ocean weakens and reverses restoration of the stable stratification starts from the upper ocean a dc chimney can collapse within a few weeks marshall and schott 1999 formation of the dc chimneys is preconditioned by two main processes strong heat fluxes from the sea surface and existence of a cyclonic circulation reducing the thickness of the upper layer with a higher buoyancy bailey et al 2005 falina and sarafanov 2015 yang et al 2016 buckley and marshall 2016 other parameters as oceanic advective

glessmer et al 2014 deshayes et al 2014 moore et al 2015 böning et al 2016 dukhovskoy et al 2019 laboratory and high resolution numerical experiments supported by in situ observations show that initially buoyant convective plumes of 0 1 1 km in diameter break through the stratified deeper ocean garwood 1991 jones and marshall 1993 paluszkiewicz et al 1994 paluszkiewicz and romea 1997 marshall and schott 1999 garwood et al 2013 johannessen et al 2005 reaching their neutral buoyancy levels lateral mixing with the surrounding stratified fluid further limits the plume penetration depth but increases its volume due to entrainment jones and marshall 1993 marshall and schott 1999 the entrainment rate is a function of the vertical velocity of the plume garwood 1991 simple scaling arguments jones and marshall 1993 suggest that horizontal scales of the plumes their vertical and horizontal velocities as well as the buoyancy anomaly all are functions of the duration of the surface buoyancy flux b and of its intensity it takes about one day for the mixed water tube to undergo the geostrophic adjustment forming a heton vortex with the cyclonic circulation above and anticyclonic below legg and marshall 1993 the horizontal scale of such tube is proportional to the internal rossby radius of deformation being of order of 1 km for the weakly stratified convective tube several times less than in the ambient ocean under favorable conditions the joint effect of a number of plumes forms a mesoscale convection chimney 10 to 50 km in diameter and one two thousands of meters deep gsp group 1990 johannessen et al 1991 send and marshall 1995 yashayaev 2007 for a chimney to be formed a relatively strong buoyancy flux from the ocean should persist at least 1 to 3 days jones and marshall 1993 the depth of the chimney its diameter and time of its development are a function of b and stratification of the surrounding ocean jones and marshall 1993 legg et al 1996 rossby number of the chimney typically 0 1 0 3 increases with increasing b and the chimney boundary becomes dynamically unstable the generated sub mesoscale eddies of radii 1 5 km chu and gascard 1991 johannessen et al 2005 the life times of which are apparently short jones and marshall 1993 are thought to be the main mechanism of the buoyancy exchange of a chimney with the surrounding ocean with an increase of the chimney depth this lateral exchange becomes increasingly efficient and finally balances the surface buoyancy loss the sub mesoscale size of the dc vertical mixing cells during their deepening stage as well as of eddies governing the decay of dc chimneys creates difficulties for the in situ observations of the structures as well as correctly reproducing the dc intensity in climate models some of the most popular vertical mixing schemes timmermann and beckmann 2004 show in a severe underestimation of the dc intensity while others a spurious generation of an unrealistically strong dc an extra fine resolution in the dc areas 1 3 km or less is needed to approach an adequate representation of the main physical processes governing its dynamics androsov et al 2005 böning et al 2016 the integral chimney parameters were theoretically obtained for the stable state when a constant vertical buoyancy loss b const is balanced by a lateral buoyancy flux through the chimney side walls chu and gascard 1991 visbeck et al 1996 kovalevsky 2002 in the present paper we derive analytical expressions for the time evolution of the chimney deepening and of the subsequent restratification phases the paper is organized as the following we derive the general equation governing the chimney evolution in section 2 based on this equation we consider the chimney evolution during its deepening phase for several scenarios of time variation of the sea surface buoyancy flux section 3 and further of the chimney restratification phase section 4 the developed theory is tested against observations in the greenland sea in section 5 section 6 sums up the results 2 the chimney evolution equation following visbeck et al 1996 consider a chimney of radius r deepening in a stratified fluid with a constant buoyancy frequency n 2 g ρ d ρ d z where ρ is the potential water density g is the gravity acceleration and z is the vertical coordinate directed downwards fig 1 the driving force of the chimney deepening is the surface buoyancy loss b t which causes convective overturning leading to homogeneously mixed fluid in the interior of the chimney assuming that the density at the base of the chimney is continuous the buoyancy anomaly b inside the chimney at depth z is 1 b z t n 2 z h t 0 z h t where h t is the time dependent depth of the base of the chimney the buoyancy loss from the sea surface in the chimney is partially compensated by lateral buoyancy exchange through its side walls with baroclinic eddies following visbeck et al 1996 and jones and marshall 1997 we write the buoyancy budget equation as 2 d d t v t b d v s up b t d s s lat t v b d s where the volume integral in the left hand side represents the total buoyancy anomaly accumulated in the time dependent chimney volume v t the integral over the area of the chimney at the sea surface s up is equal to the total buoyancy loss from the sea surface over the chimney and the integral over the time dependent area of the lateral surface of the chimney s lat t stands for the buoyancy transfer by baroclinic eddies v represents the pulsations of the horizontal current velocity component perpendicular to the side walls of the chimney it takes a certain time for the baroclinic instability to develop at the periphery of the chimney so the last term in eq 2 would not appear immediately after switching on the surface buoyancy loss in fact the analysis performed in section 3 1 shows that under a plausible buoyancy loss scenario at the initial stage of the convective chimney deepening the eddy transfer term on the right hand side of eq 2 is small compared to the surface buoyancy loss therefore at small t the solution of eq 2 indeed does not feel this effect 1 1 furthermore the validity of eq 2 is justified by a reasonable agreement of the analytical solution presented in section 3 1 with the numeric solution plotted in visbeck et al 1996 for a particular case of a constant buoyancy flux basing on a suggestion by green 1970 and stone 1972 visbeck et al 1996 parameterized the eddy flux v b appearing in eq 2 as 3 v b α b 2 n where α is a constant of proportionality to be determined from observations laboratory modeling or numerical simulations further following visbeck et al 1996 we assume that in eq 3 b 2 n 4 h 2 which is in agreement with eq 1 being integrated over the layer h up to the scaling factor which is irrelevant for further analysis then all terms of eq 2 are straightforwardly estimated as 4 v t b d v 1 2 π r 2 n 2 h 2 t 5 s up b t d s π r 2 b t 6 s lat t v b d s 2 π r α n 3 h 3 t here to derive eq 4 eq 1 is used substituting eqs 4 6 into eq 2 and dividing the result by π n 2 2 we get the dynamic equation 7 d d t r 2 h 2 2 b t n 2 r 2 4 α n r h 3 during the chimney deepening phase we assume that the radius of the chimney is constant 8 r const r 0 deepening then from eq 7 time variation of the single unknown variable h t can be derived after the sea surface cooling substantially weakens so that we can consider it to be switched off the restratification phase starts in the decaying chimney the buoyancy transfer through the lateral boundary becomes dominating hence we describe the restratification phase with the same eq 7 but now assuming 9 b t 0 h const restratification r t being the unknown variable in visbeck et al 1996 the final asymptotic depth of the convective chimney is obtained under the assumption b t const b 0 and when the left hand side of eq 7 equals to zero 10 h final γ b 0 r 0 1 3 n where γ is a constant defined as 11 γ 1 2 α 1 3 our further analysis of eq 7 extends the results by visbeck et al 1996 and jones and marshall 1997 in two respects i we consider the explicit solution of variation of the convection depth in time and ii the analytical solution can include a time varying sea surface buoyancy loss b t in the following it will be convenient to set eq 7 in the non dimensional form let b t be a non dimensional sea surface buoyancy loss 12 b t b t b 0 normalized by a characteristic sea surface buoyancy flux b 0 the definition of b 0 depends on a particular buoyancy loss evolution scenario during the chimney deepening phase for instance the results of section 3 1 are obtained for the constant sea surface buoyancy loss b t const b 0 so that b t 1 in section 3 2 synoptic perturbations superimposed on a constant buoyancy loss are considered so its unperturbed value is chosen as b 0 finally in section 3 3 we present an example with the sea surface buoyancy loss gradually increasing in time and converging at large times to its saturation value b 0 the non dimensional depth of the chimney h t is normalized by the depth scale h final given by eq 10 thus it implicitly depends on b 0 13 h t h t h final similarly r t is a non dimensional chimney radius normalized by its initial value 14 r t r t r 0 obviously in the chimney deepening phase 15 r t const 1 deepening while in the restratification phase 16 h t const 1 restratification finally we introduce the non dimensional time 17 t t t where the time scale t is given by 18 t γ 2 r 0 2 b 0 1 3 in the non dimensional form eq 7 becomes 19 d d t r 2 h 2 2 r r b t h 3 3 chimney deepening phase 3 1 constant buoyancy loss in the chimney deepening phase in view of eq 15 the evolution equation 19 is simplified to 20 d h d t b t h 3 h for the constant buoyancy loss as in visbeck et al 1996 21 b t const b 0 22 b t const 1 eq 20 is then reduced to 23 d h d t 1 h 3 h or equivalently 24 d t d h h 1 h 3 instead of integrating eq 24 we integrate a more general expression as we will further need this result in section 3 2 25 t q h 0 h h q 3 h 3 d h 1 q 1 6 ln q 2 q h h 2 q h 2 1 3 π 6 arctan q 2 h 3 q when integrating over h we keep in mind that at the initial moment t 0 the depth of the chimney is zero h 0 for the particular case of q 1 we get the analytical solution of eq 23 26 t h 1 6 ln 1 h h 2 1 h 2 1 3 π 6 arctan 1 2 h 3 let us examine the asymptotic behavior of this solution 26 at small and large times the initial deepening stage when deepening has just started the depth of the chimney h is still small then we can expand the right hand side of eq 26 in taylor series keeping up to the quadratic terms we obtain 27 t h 2 2 h 0 or 28 h 2 t t 0 note that eq 27 can be easily obtained directly from eq 24 if neglecting the term h 3 in the denominator of its r h s as we consider only small h we can return back to the dimensional variables making use of eqs 10 13 17 18 then we get the classical result for the one dimensional nonpenetrative deepening of the upper mixed layer see e g turner 1973 29 h 2 b 0 t n the solution at small times eq 27 or equivalently eq 29 is obtained when in the r h s of eq 19 only the sea surface buoyancy loss term is retained while at this initial stage of the intensive deepening of the chimney the baroclinic instability effects are assumed to be unimportant the final deepening stage the right hand side of eq 26 is singular when h is approaching unity which has a clear physical meaning the final depth of the chimney h 1 is achieved only asymptotically at the infinite time from eq 26 it follows that as h approaches unity the time grows as 30 t 1 6 ln 3 π 3 2 ln 1 h h 1 which can be also re written as 31 h 1 3 exp π 2 3 3 t 1 0 7 exp 3 t the exact analytical solution 26 the initial stage asymptotics 27 valid at small times and depths as well as the final stage asymptotics 31 valid for large times t h 1 are presented in fig 2 the arc of the initial stage asymptotics and the arc of the final stage asymptotics before and after their intersection point jointly provide a very good approximation of the exact analytical solution the maximum chimney depth is approached with the non dimensional e folding time scale of 1 3 eq 31 the two asymptotic solutions intersect at about half time of one e folding time scale as the convection barely exceeds 50 of its maximum depth it is instructive to compare the final stage asymptotics 31 with the estimates obtained by visbeck et al 1996 if we approximate the chimney deepening time t final with two e folding time scales from eq 31 fig 2 then 32 t final 2 3 in dimensional units this gives see eqs 17 18 33 t final 2 3 t 2 3 γ 2 r 0 2 b 0 1 3 the lower bound estimate of the chimney deepening time by visbeck et al 1996 lies between our one and two e folding time scales of a chimney deepening phase 34 t final vmj γ 2 2 r 0 2 b 0 1 3 based on this result visbeck et al 1996 suggested an empirical approximation 35 t final vmj β r 0 2 b 0 1 3 to further derive β and γ from laboratory or numerical experiments 2 2 eqs 34 and 35 are eqs 21 and 22 in visbeck et al 1996 respectively our estimate of β eq 33 36 β 2 3 γ 2 is slightly higher than the theoretical lower bound estimate by visbeck et al 1996 based on a number of laboratory and numerical experiments visbeck et al 1996 report the following estimates γ 3 9 0 9 β 12 3 our estimate of β for the same average γ 3 9 is β 5 1 when using one e folding time scale of t final β 10 1 when using two e folding time scales as the time of the chimney development eq 36 the latter is close to β 12 experimentally obtained in visbeck et al 1996 fig 2 demonstrates that one e folding time scale is still quite far from the maximum convection depth while the two time scales can already be interpreted in the numerical experiments as the end of the deepening phase see figure 6 in visbeck et al 1996 3 2 synoptic perturbations of the buoyancy loss the approach developed in the previous section for the case of constant buoyancy loss can be generalized for more complex scenarios in this section we consider the case when the constant buoyancy loss is disturbed by a synoptic perturbation this can model a passing cyclone or a cold warm air outbreak the simplest way to model such perturbation is to assume a localized stepwise increase of buoyancy loss with a subsequent return to its initial value 37 b t 1 ξ b 0 if t 1 t t 2 b 0 otherwise where ξ const the buoyancy flux perturbation can be either positive ξ 0 or negative 1 ξ 0 we define the parameter q as 38 q 3 1 ξ which for these relatively small perturbations is positive or zero estimates of the heat fluxes from the sea surface in the central greenland sea show that about 85 of winter variations in the related buoyancy loss remain within the suggested limits although episodically the buoyancy loss may exceed the mean by the factor of two or three in the non dimensional variables the buoyancy loss scenario defined by eq 37 is 39 b t q 3 if t 1 t t 2 1 otherwise before the perturbation starts 0 t t 1 the chimney evolution is described by eq 23 with the solution t p h t h given by eq 26 during the perturbation t 1 t t 2 the depth of chimney obeys eq 20 with b q 3 the general solution of which is given by eq 25 plus a constant dependent on the initial conditions at t t 1 t p h t q h c 1 finally after the perturbation ends t t 2 the depth of the chimney is again described by eq 23 with the general solution given by eq 26 plus another constant dependent on the initial conditions at t t 2 t p h t h c 2 the constants c 1 c 2 can be derived from the conditions of continuity of the solution at t t 1 t t 2 the final form of the solution for this scenario is 40 t p h t h 0 t t 1 t 1 t q h t q h 1 t 1 t t 2 t 2 t h t h 2 t t 2 where the depths h 1 h 2 are archived at times t 1 t 2 respectively 41 t 1 t h 1 t 2 t 1 t q h 2 t q h 1 the solutions above are shown in fig 3 where the buoyancy perturbation is 50 of the reference value ξ 0 5 the duration of the buoyancy perturbation is δ t 0 25 with the parameters observed in the greenland sea the buoyancy flux b 0 8 1 0 8 m 2 s 3 the chimney radius r 0 10 km and γ 2 5 3 0 see section 5 we get the dimensional duration of the buoyancy perturbation δ t t 2 3 days this is close to a typical time scale of synoptic perturbations in fig 3b the dynamics of chimney deepening are shown for the forcing scenarios provided in fig 3a for both perturbation scenarios the slope of chimney depth curve changes discontinuously when the perturbation starts t t 1 and also when it ends t t 2 for the upward step a higher buoyancy loss the chimney expectedly deepens faster than under the reference scenario the deepening is less intensive for the downward step after the end of perturbation the chimney depth variations can be obtained from the unperturbed curve simply by making a proper shift to the left a temporal increase of the buoyancy loss or to the right a temporal decrease of the buoyancy loss along the time axis 3 3 transition to saturation of buoyancy loss in this section we consider the particular case when the chimney deepening is driven by gradual change in the buoyancy flux the system may model the autumn winter heat release from the ocean which corresponds to an increase in the maximum mixed layer depth in the greenland sea fig 4a the heat release leads to a gradual increase of the intensity of deep convection typically having maximum in april bashmachnikov et al 2019 consider the chimney deepening phase when 42 b t tanh t t 0 at small t b t grows linearly b t t t 0 while at large t it converges to unity this means that we have a scenario of transition to saturation of buoyancy loss where the parameter t 0 can be regarded as the relaxation time scale from eq 20 the chimney depth evolves as 43 d h d t tanh t t 0 h h 2 in fig 4a scenarios 42 of surface buoyancy loss for several values of parameter t 0 are shown while the related dynamics of the chimney deepening provided by eq 43 are shown in fig 4b the general form of eq 43 has to be integrated numerically however in the particular case of t 0 1 or in dimensional variables t 0 t where t is provided by eq 18 the surface buoyancy flux is expressed as 44 b t tanh t and the evolution of the non dimensional chimney depth can be derived analytically 45 h t tanh t the obtained solution 45 which is identical to the forcing function 44 at small t contradicts the familiar 1 2 power law 28 derived for deepening of the mixed layer turner 1973 however the latter relation see eq 28 is derived for the constant buoyancy loss and is not directly applicable to the scenario of the buoyancy loss growing from the initial zero level fig 4 shows seasonal variability of the normalized buoyancy flux from the ocean and the monthly maximum mixed layer depth in the central greenland sea assuming the unit of the non dimensional time to be 4 months the simple model catches the main features of the seasonal growth of the mixed layer depth from august to may although the model exaggerates the rate of the mixed layer deepening for the time normalization used the buoyancy flux changes as t 0 0 5 but the mixed layer depth changes much slower as t 0 2 this may be a result of existence of other important processes which may delay the deepening of the mixed layer for example the deepening may be delayed due to precipitation and ice melt formation on average ice melts in the central greenland sea even in winter selyuzhenok et al 2020 due to oceanic advection of heat and freshwater etc 4 restratification in this section we examine the situation when after a certain time t d h convection reaches the level h 1 ϵ separated from the final depth h 1 by a value ϵ 0 as strictly speaking reaching h 1 happens at infinitely large time the deepening stage obeys ode 20 for which we obtained analytical solutions for several buoyancy loss scenarios in section 3 at time t t d the surface cooling is switched off b t 0 and the restratification phase starts as discussed before we now assume that for t t d the level h 0 h 1 in eq 19 remains constant then we immediately come to the equation 46 d r d t h the solution of eq 46 predicts that in the restratification phase the radius of a chimney linearly decreases in time at time t the radius becomes zero and the chimney disappears we will call t the chimney lifetime the chimney lifetime depends on the depth h reached at the end of deepening phase i e at t t d overall the chimney evolution described can be visualized in the phase plane radius depth shown in fig 5 the evolution starts at the point with coordinates r 0 0 during the chimney deepening phase its radius is constant and the phase trajectory is a vertical segment at some point where the chimney depth h is less than h final the restratification phase starts then the chimney depth is constant and the phase trajectory becomes a horizontal segment the phase trajectory ends at a point where the chimney disappears given that the chimney radius during its deepening phase is r t const 1 eq 15 the solution of eq 46 becomes 47 r t 1 h t t d t d t t it follows immediately from eq 47 that 48 t t d t r where the restratification time t r is equal to 49 t r 1 h in particular if chimney starts decaying from its asymptotic final state h 1 the restratification time t r 1 in dimensional units according to eq 18 t r t this means that the restratification time of a mature chimney is equal to its characteristic deepening time t the estimate above 49 can be compared to the restratification timescale derived from numerical experiments by jones and marshall 1997 in the cited paper the parametrization in our notations is 50 t restrat jm 56 r 0 n h by substituting h h h final eq 13 into eq 50 and making use of eq 10 we get 51 t restrat jm 56 γ h r 0 2 b 0 1 3 eq 49 suggests that 52 t restrat t h γ 2 h r 0 2 b 0 1 3 substituting the typical γ 3 9 visbeck et al 1996 into eq 51 we get 53 t restrat jm 14 4 h r 0 2 b 0 1 3 while our estimate 52 suggests 54 t restrat 15 2 h r 0 2 b 0 1 3 therefore our results are in a close agreement with the numerical results by jones and marshall 1997 however we will see in section 5 that for the greenland sea the deepening and the restratification phases are better approximated when γ 2 5 3 0 in this case the multiple above h becomes 6 2 9 0 the inverse relation 49 suggests that the shallower is the chimney i e the lesser is h the larger is its restratification time t r in other words the radius of a mature chimney h 1 decays substantially more rapidly than of a chimney in its initial formation stage h 1 this in particular justifies the assumption 8 as the chimney deepening time t d h obviously grows with h eq 30 one might ask on how the overall chimney lifetime t eq 48 depends on h below we consider the case when the surface buoyancy loss during the deepening phase is constant section 3 1 the derivative d t d h is the sum of d t d h d h that eq 24 is 55 d t d d h h h 1 h 3 and of d t r h d h that eq 49 is 56 d t r d h h 1 h 2 then 57 d t d h h d t d d h h d t r d h h 2 h 3 1 h 2 1 h 3 the minimum possible chimney lifetime t min is achieved at h 1 2 3 0 79 when the numerator of eq 57 equals zero in accordance with eqs 26 48 49 58 t min 2 3 1 2 ln 2 3 1 1 3 π 6 arctan 1 4 3 3 1 67 for 0 h h the overall chimney lifetime is higher due to a long restratification phase and it decreases with h while for h h 1 the overall chimney lifetime is higher due to a long deepening phase and it increases with h fig 6 formally both at h 0 and h 1 the lifetime is infinite 5 deep convection in the greenland sea in this section we test the theory against observations in the greenland sea the theory by visbeck et al 1996 has already been tested against several model and laboratory studies as well as against observations in the northwestern mediterranean sea nowadays with the development of argo profiling drifter array observations in the nordic seas become more abundant and evenly distributed throughout a year for further analysis we have chosen winter 2012 2013 when the maximum number of temperature salinity vertical profiles 30 to 40 casts per month are available in the central greenland sea fig 7 as it follows from analysis of various data sets fedorov et al 2018 bashmachnikov et al 2018 2019 during winter 2012 2013 deep convection in the greenland sea exceeded 2000 m however the number of available casts is still insufficient to study an evolution of a single convection chimney which has a typical radii of order of 10 50 km for testing the theoretical results from the previous sections we use daily global ocean physical reanalysis glorys distributed by http marine copernicus eu with 1 1 2 spatial resolution and 50 vertical levels the reanalysis is based on lim2 evp nemo 3 1 general circulation ocean model with an active ice block the model is forced with 3 hour era interim atmospheric reanalysis the glorys model assimilates all available vertical temperature and salinity profiles satellite derived sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration as well as the absolute dynamic topography from the satellite altimetry in the central greenland sea glorys shows two deep convection chimneys developing from december 2012 to january 2013 and reaching 2000 m depth fig 8 the one to the south marked with the red circle in fig 8a is chosen for comparison with the theory this chimney remains a single localized structure for more than two months a comparatively large number of in situ profiles are assimilated in the reanalysis in this area fig 7a c adding robustness to the results the mixed layer depth is detected in glorys data set using the method by kara et al 2003 at every the 100 m depth level the chimney radial scale is computed as the mean of the distances of all data points with the mixed layer depth falling within the corresponding 50 m depth range from the chimney center the mode of the radial scales at all the depth levels is taken as the chimney radius fig 8b during the initial stage of the chimney development the chimney maximum depth and radius fig 9a b show a relatively monotonic growth the developed theory does not take into account the growth of the chimney radius however we may think this latter effect to be a result of development of an increasing number of individual plumes marshall and schott 1999 deepening of each of which is described by eqs 28 31 for the specific heat capacity of the seawater c p 3900 j kg 1 c 1 the mean water density ρ 1028 kg m 3 the gravity acceleration g 9 8 m s 2 the thermal expansion coefficient α 0 9 1 0 4 c 1 and the mean thermal heat flux from the ocean during the first 8 days of the deepening fig 9c of q 350 w m 2 we get the buoyancy flux from the sea surface b 0 g α q c p ρ 8 1 0 8 m 2 s 3 for comparison with the theory we take radius of the chimney r 0 10 km and the maximum chimney depth h final 2100 m the chimney depth and time variables are further normalized using eqs 13 17 the resulting non dimensional parameters are plotted against the theoretical values derived for a constant buoyancy flux fig 2 section 3 1 the best fit to the observations is obtained with the parameter γ 2 5 0 5 the confidence intervals come from the repeated computations with varying r 0 5 20 km and q 250 450 w m 2 the obtained γ is less than the previously adopted central value of 3 9 0 9 visbeck et al 1996 the difference between the results should arise from a known decrease of γ with the decrease of n f ratio visbeck et al 1996 visbeck et al 1996 compared their theoretical results with the parameters of deep convection chimneys in the mediterranean sea where n f 6 while for the less stratified subpolar greenland sea n f 2 however the lower limit of γ 3 0 for the same n f ratio in visbeck et al 1996 reasonably well fits the glorys results fig 2 the linear decay of the chimney radius during the restratification phase eq 46 is also tested against temporal evolution of the parameters of the selected chimney derived from glorys reanalysis fig 9d f the radius of the decaying chimney is well approximated with the linear function during the initial stage of the restratification phase here as well as for the deepening phase a good approximation of the glorys results is obtained for γ varying between 2 5 and 3 0 the discrepancies with the theory arise after about half time of the expected decay period 49 up to that moment the chimney depth stays constant well consistent with the assumptions made in section 4 after 0 5 t r the chimney suddenly collapses within 2 days showing a rapid decrease of both the chimney s radius and maximum depth overall the glorys estimates suggest of the chimney decay time to be 10 15 days against about 30 days predicted by eq 54 with γ 2 5 and 40 50 days with γ 3 0 therefore the theoretical decay time might be exaggerated by the factor of two or more at least for deep and narrow chimneys often observed in the greenland sea gsp group 1990 johannessen et al 1991 wadhams et al 2004 the radii of mesoscale submesoscale eddies through which a deep convection chimney decays depends on the radius of the chimney and at least should not significantly exceed the first rossby radius of deformation chelton et al 1998 in glorys reanalysis the rossby radii of deformation inside and outside the chimney are 3 and 4 km respectively this corresponds to the climatic estimates by nurser and bacon 2014 analysis of winter 2013 in situ vertical profiles from the en4 data base suggests the rossby radii of deformation to be around 1 km for the profiles with the mixed layer depth over 1000 m in deep convection chimneys and 1 5 2 km for the profiles with the mixed layer depth less than 500 m outside of the chimneys the difference is due to glorys showing 1 5 times higher mean buoyancy frequency below 200 400 m compared to the in situ data in any case the relatively small rossby radii of deformation raises the question of the insufficient spatial resolution of the glorys reanalysis 3 8 km in the study region by the beginning of the collapse the radius of the chimney decreases to 20 km or less and the model resolution may start distorting the chimney dynamics on the other hand a sudden collapse of mesoscale hetons is regularly observed in idealized model studies sokolovskiy and verron 2014 as the chimney becomes thinner its rossby number grows which makes the non linear behavior and a rapid collapse more probable an interaction with a shear flow or an energetic eddy will further facilitate the possible collapse 6 conclusions in the present paper we obtained analytical solutions for the dynamic equation 7 of evolution of a chimney that takes into account two processes affecting its buoyancy budget the buoyancy loss through the sea surface and the buoyancy transfer across the lateral boundary of the chimney by baroclinic eddies eq 7 has the form of an ordinary differential equation but it describes a simultaneous evolution of two geometrical parameters of the chimney the chimney depth and its radius separation of the chimney evolution into two subsequent phases the deepening phase and the restratification phase allows us considering as the unknown only one of the parameters for each of the phases during the deepening phase the chimney radius is assumed constant and the analytical solution for time variations of the chimney depth is obtained for several scenarios of the sea surface buoyancy loss the assumption of the constant chimney radius is not truly confirmed with the results of the ocean reanalysis glorys showing radius of the chimney to increase during the deepening phase nevertheless the obtained theoretical results permit making reasonable predictions on evolution of the chimney depth this suggests that the lateral buoyancy exchange is relatively small during the chimney deepening phase while with the persistent strong buoyancy flux from the sea surface the lateral expansion may be a result of generation of additional buoyancy plumes around the newly formed chimney for a constant surface buoyancy loss main geometric parameters of a fully developed mature chimney have been derived in several studies visbeck et al 1996 jones and marshall 1997 1993 legg et al 1996 analytical solutions for the chimney deepening and decay phases obtained in this paper permit to study chimney evolution to from its mature state following evolution of a chimney depth in the central greenland sea during its deepening phase we get the chimney formation time of about one week consistent with the theoretical estimates the observed mean for buoyancy loss during this period of 350 w m 2 used in the computations was relatively strong for the region under the constant surface buoyancy loss scenario a somewhat complex solution derived for the deepening phase can be well approximated during the initial deepening stage by a traditional one dimensional nonpenetrative deepening of the upper mixed layer and during the subsequent final deepening stage by an exponential convergence to the maximum possible depth for a given b 0 fig 2 jointly these two asymptotics provide a very close approximation of the whole deepening phase that formally takes an infinitely long time the transition from one asymptotics to another takes place at approximately half of the maximum possible depth which for a given value of b 0 and of the background stratification in autumn can be estimated using eq 10 originally derived by visbeck et al 1996 the chimney reaches the mature state when b 0 remains sufficiently strong at least during two e folding time scales in this study we also describe variations of the convection depth for two scenarios for a step like and for an increasing buoyancy loss with its further saturating the first scenario models a synoptic perturbation of the mean buoyancy loss the variation of the sea surface buoyancy flux by 50 over 25 of the deepening time 2 days for the 8 day deepening time of the studied chimney results in the variation in the deepening time scale 2 t by 25 30 a much stronger increases in the sea surface buoyancy loss often occurring in the greenland sea may result in a faster deepening of a chimney fig 9c d the second scenario with the increasing buoyancy loss section 3 3 models an increasing buoyancy loss in autumn and its further winter saturation typical for the subpolar seas the simple model results adequately represent the typical seasonal variation of the maximum mixed layer depth in the greenland sea during the restratification phase the chimney depth is assumed to be constant the evolution equation leads to a simple inverse law for a chimney shrinking time this means that the more mature is the chimney the faster it decays a chimney evolution in glorys reanalysis confirms the theoretically predicted quasi linear decrease of a chimney radius during the initial stages of the restratification phase however after about a half of the theoretical restratification time scale t restrat given by eq 54 the chimney collapses in two three days therefore the restratification time scale derived in section 4 seems to be exaggerated by the factor of two or more the collapse can be a result of the baroclinic instability of the heton which is a dynamic manifestation of the chimney and is not described by the simple 1d model however the collapse may also be an artifact of the glorys spatial resolution which is on the limit of that needed for reproducing the mesoscale dynamics of the medium size chimney a finer model resolution is needed to clarify this issue for a given constant buoyancy flux b 0 during the deepening phase the minimum chimney lifetime corresponds to the case when the buoyancy flux is switched off at approximately the first e folding time scale of the deepening process a less mature shallower chimney is lasting longer due to its longer decay phase a more mature deeper chimney is lasting longer due to its longer deepening phase fig 6 both the deepening and the restratification stages of the chimney in the glorys reanalysis are better described by the theory with a lower value of γ 2 5 3 0 compared to 3 9 0 9 obtained in visbeck et al 1996 we suppose this is due to the lower n f ratio in the subpolar study region which is three time smaller than that used by visbeck et al 1996 on the other hand there is a luck of observations to obtain statistics on chimney dynamics in the greenland sea and the example in section 5 is rather an illustrative one credit authorship contribution statement dmitry v

23975,open ocean deep convection dc forming a link between the upper and the deep ocean dynamics is observed in a few localized sites of the world ocean in the present paper we further develop an analytical model of isolated vertically homogenized water columns up to a few kilometers deep usually referred to as convective chimneys we derive analytical solutions for evolution of a chimney during its deepening phase as well as during its subsequent restratification phase the initial deepening stage is considered to be primarily driven by the buoyancy loss at the sea surface while the final deepening stage and the restratification phase are affected by a buoyancy transfer through the lateral surface of the chimney by baroclinic eddies for the deepening phase analytical solutions for evolution of the depth of a chimney are derived for a constant sea surface buoyancy loss with or without synoptic perturbations and for a case of the sea surface buoyancy loss growing in time for the restratification phase time evolution of the chimney radius and an analytical expression for duration of this phase are obtained the exact solutions and their asymptotic approximations are in good agreement with the scaling laws and with model studies reported in earlier works the theoretical results also agree with an evolution of a chimney in the greenland sea derived from glorys high resolution ocean reanalysis for a given set of the background conditions a chimney can be considered a mature one after two characteristic time scales of the deepening phase are reached a mature chimney needs a longer time for its formation but decays more rapidly than a pre mature one the minimum overall chimney lifetime corresponds to the case when at about one characteristic time scale of the deepening phase the sea surface buoyancy loss abruptly drops down and the restratification phase begins keywords convection chimney baroclinic instability restratification 1 introduction deep

bashmachnikov and kovalevsky 2019 kovalevsky 2002 revealed the main physical properties and dynamics of the convective chimneys and plumes in sub polar regions deepening of the upper mixed layer begins during late autumn and continues to early spring when the deepest convection is detected marshall and schott 1999 gladyshev et al 2016 bashmachnikov et al 2018 the dc chimneys in a quasi stable state typically stay open for 1 3 months in spring when the vertical buoyancy flux from the ocean weakens and reverses restoration of the stable stratification starts from the upper ocean a dc chimney can collapse within a few weeks marshall and schott 1999 formation of the dc chimneys is preconditioned by two main processes strong heat fluxes from the sea surface and existence of a cyclonic

glessmer et al 2014 deshayes et al 2014 moore et al 2015 böning et al 2016 dukhovskoy et al 2019 laboratory and high resolution numerical experiments supported by in situ observations show that initially buoyant convective plumes of 0 1 1 km in diameter break through the stratified deeper ocean garwood 1991 jones and marshall 1993 paluszkiewicz et al 1994 paluszkiewicz and romea 1997 marshall and schott 1999 garwood et al 2013 johannessen et al 2005 reaching their neutral buoyancy levels lateral mixing with the surrounding stratified fluid further limits the plume penetration depth but increases its volume due to entrainment jones and marshall 1993 marshall and schott 1999 the entrainment rate is a function of the vertical velocity of the plume garwood 1991 simple scaling arguments jones and marshall 1993 suggest that horizontal scales of the plumes their vertical and horizontal velocities as well as the buoyancy anomaly all are functions of the duration of the surface buoyancy flux b and of its intensity it takes about one day for the mixed water tube to undergo the geostrophic adjustment forming a heton vortex with the cyclonic circulation above and anticyclonic below legg and marshall 1993 the horizontal scale of such tube is proportional to the internal rossby radius of deformation being of order of 1 km for the weakly stratified convective tube several times less than in the ambient ocean under favorable conditions the joint effect of a number of plumes forms a mesoscale convection chimney 10 to 50 km in diameter and one two thousands of meters deep gsp group 1990 johannessen et al 1991 send and marshall 1995 yashayaev 2007 for a chimney to be formed a relatively strong buoyancy flux from the ocean should persist at least 1 to 3 days jones and marshall 1993 the depth of the chimney its diameter and time of its development are a function of b and stratification of the surrounding ocean jones and marshall 1993 legg et al 1996 rossby number of the chimney typically 0 1 0 3 increases with increasing b and the chimney boundary becomes dynamically unstable the generated sub mesoscale eddies of radii 1 5 km chu and gascard 1991 johannessen et al 2005 the life times of which are apparently short jones and marshall 1993 are thought to be the main mechanism of the buoyancy exchange of a chimney with the surrounding ocean with an increase of the chimney depth this lateral exchange becomes increasingly efficient and finally balances the surface buoyancy loss the sub mesoscale size of the dc vertical mixing cells during their deepening stage as well as of eddies governing the decay of dc chimneys creates difficulties for the in situ observations of the structures as well as correctly reproducing the dc intensity in climate models some of the most popular vertical mixing schemes timmermann and beckmann 2004 show in a severe underestimation of the dc intensity while others a spurious generation of an unrealistically strong dc an extra fine resolution in the dc areas 1 3 km or less is needed to approach an adequate representation of the main physical processes governing its dynamics androsov et al 2005 böning et al 2016 the integral chimney parameters were theoretically obtained for the stable state when a constant vertical buoyancy loss b const is balanced by a lateral buoyancy flux through the chimney side walls chu and gascard 1991 visbeck et al 1996 kovalevsky 2002 in the present paper we derive analytical expressions for the time evolution of the chimney deepening and of the subsequent restratification phases the paper is organized as the following we derive the general equation governing the chimney evolution in section 2 based on this equation we consider the chimney evolution during its deepening phase for several scenarios of time variation of the sea surface buoyancy flux section 3 and further of the chimney restratification phase section 4 the developed theory is tested against observations in the greenland sea in section 5 section 6 sums up the results 2 the chimney evolution equation following visbeck et al 1996 consider a chimney of radius r deepening in a stratified fluid with a constant buoyancy frequency n 2 g ρ d ρ d z where ρ is the potential water density g is the gravity acceleration and z is the vertical coordinate directed downwards fig 1 the driving force of the chimney deepening is the surface buoyancy loss b t which causes convective overturning leading to homogeneously mixed fluid in the interior of the chimney assuming that the density at the base of the chimney is continuous the buoyancy anomaly b inside the chimney at depth z is 1 b z t n 2 z h t 0 z h t where h t is the time dependent depth of the base of the chimney the buoyancy loss from the sea surface in the chimney is partially compensated by lateral buoyancy exchange through its side walls with baroclinic eddies following visbeck et al 1996 and jones and marshall 1997 we write the buoyancy budget equation as 2 d d t v t b d v s up b t d s s lat t v b d s where the volume integral in the left hand side represents the total buoyancy anomaly accumulated in the time dependent chimney volume v t the integral over the area of the chimney at the sea surface s up is equal to the total buoyancy loss from the sea surface over the chimney and the integral over the time dependent area of the lateral surface of the chimney s lat t stands for the buoyancy transfer by baroclinic eddies v represents the pulsations of the horizontal current velocity component perpendicular to the side walls of the chimney it takes a certain time for the baroclinic instability to develop at the periphery of the chimney so the last term in eq 2 would not appear immediately after switching on the surface buoyancy loss in fact the analysis performed in section 3 1 shows that under a plausible buoyancy loss scenario at the initial stage of the convective chimney deepening the eddy transfer term on the right hand side of eq 2 is small compared to the surface buoyancy loss therefore at small t the solution of eq 2 indeed does not feel this effect 1 1 furthermore the validity of eq 2 is justified by a reasonable agreement of the analytical solution presented in section 3 1 with the numeric solution plotted in visbeck et al 1996 for a particular case of a constant buoyancy flux basing on a suggestion by green 1970 and stone 1972 visbeck et al 1996 parameterized the eddy flux v b appearing in eq 2 as 3 v b α b 2 n where α is a constant of proportionality to be determined from observations laboratory modeling or numerical simulations further following visbeck et al 1996 we assume that in eq 3 b 2 n 4 h 2 which is in agreement with eq 1 being integrated over the layer h up to the scaling factor which is irrelevant for further analysis then all terms of eq 2 are straightforwardly estimated as 4 v t b d v 1 2 π r 2 n 2 h 2 t 5 s up b t d s π r 2 b t 6 s lat t v b d s 2 π r α n 3 h 3 t here to derive eq 4 eq 1 is used substituting eqs 4 6 into eq 2 and dividing the result by π n 2 2 we get the dynamic equation 7 d d t r 2 h 2 2 b t n 2 r 2 4 α n r h 3 during the chimney deepening phase we assume that the radius of the chimney is constant 8 r const r 0 deepening then from eq 7 time variation of the single unknown variable h t can be derived after the sea surface cooling substantially weakens so that we can consider it to be switched off the restratification phase starts in the decaying chimney the buoyancy transfer through the lateral boundary becomes dominating hence we describe the restratification phase with the same eq 7 but now assuming 9 b t 0 h const restratification r t being the unknown variable in visbeck et al 1996 the final asymptotic depth of the convective chimney is obtained under the assumption b t const b 0 and when the left hand side of eq 7 equals to zero 10 h final γ b 0 r 0 1 3 n where γ is a constant defined as 11 γ 1 2 α 1 3 our further analysis of eq 7 extends the results by visbeck et al 1996 and jones and marshall 1997 in two respects i we consider the explicit solution of variation of the convection depth in time and ii the analytical solution can include a time varying sea surface buoyancy loss b t in the following it will be convenient to set eq 7 in the non dimensional form let b t be a non dimensional sea surface buoyancy loss 12 b t b t b 0 normalized by a characteristic sea surface buoyancy flux b 0 the definition of b 0 depends on a particular buoyancy loss evolution scenario during the chimney deepening phase for instance the results of section 3 1 are obtained for the constant sea surface buoyancy loss b t const b 0 so that b t 1 in section 3 2 synoptic perturbations superimposed on a constant buoyancy loss are considered so its unperturbed value is chosen as b 0 finally in section 3 3 we present an example with the sea surface buoyancy loss gradually increasing in time and converging at large times to its saturation value b 0 the non dimensional depth of the chimney h t is normalized by the depth scale h final given by eq 10 thus it implicitly depends on b 0 13 h t h t h final similarly r t is a non dimensional chimney radius normalized by its initial value 14 r t r t r 0 obviously in the chimney deepening phase 15 r t const 1 deepening while in the restratification phase 16 h t const 1 restratification finally we introduce the non dimensional time 17 t t t where the time scale t is given by 18 t γ 2 r 0 2 b 0 1 3 in the non dimensional form eq 7 becomes 19 d d t r 2 h 2 2 r r b t h 3 3 chimney deepening phase 3 1 constant buoyancy loss in the chimney deepening phase in view of eq 15 the evolution equation 19 is simplified to 20 d h d t b t h 3 h for the constant buoyancy loss as in visbeck et al 1996 21 b t const b 0 22 b t const 1 eq 20 is then reduced to 23 d h d t 1 h 3 h or equivalently 24 d t d h h 1 h 3 instead of integrating eq 24 we integrate a more general expression as we will further need this result in section 3 2 25 t q h 0 h h q 3 h 3 d h 1 q 1 6 ln q 2 q h h 2 q h 2 1 3 π 6 arctan q 2 h 3 q when integrating over h we keep in mind that at the initial moment t 0 the depth of the chimney is zero h 0 for the particular case of q 1 we get the analytical solution of eq 23 26 t h 1 6 ln 1 h h 2 1 h 2 1 3 π 6 arctan 1 2 h 3 let us examine the asymptotic behavior of this solution 26 at small and large times the initial deepening stage when deepening has just started the depth of the chimney h is still small then we can expand the right hand side of eq 26 in taylor series keeping up to the quadratic terms we obtain 27 t h 2 2 h 0 or 28 h 2 t t 0 note that eq 27 can be easily obtained directly from eq 24 if neglecting the term h 3 in the denominator of its r h s as we consider only small h we can return back to the dimensional variables making use of eqs 10 13 17 18 then we get the classical result for the one dimensional nonpenetrative deepening of the upper mixed layer see e g turner 1973 29 h 2 b 0 t n the solution at small times eq 27 or equivalently eq 29 is obtained when in the r h s of eq 19 only the sea surface buoyancy loss term is retained while at this initial stage of the intensive deepening of the chimney the baroclinic instability effects are assumed to be unimportant the final deepening stage the right hand side of eq 26 is singular when h is approaching unity which has a clear physical meaning the final depth of the chimney h 1 is achieved only asymptotically at the infinite time from eq 26 it follows that as h approaches unity the time grows as 30 t 1 6 ln 3 π 3 2 ln 1 h h 1 which can be also re written as 31 h 1 3 exp π 2 3 3 t 1 0 7 exp 3 t the exact analytical solution 26 the initial stage asymptotics 27 valid at small times and depths as well as the final stage asymptotics 31 valid for large times t h 1 are presented in fig 2 the arc of the initial stage asymptotics and the arc of the final stage asymptotics before and after their intersection point jointly provide a very good approximation of the exact analytical solution the maximum chimney depth is approached with the non dimensional e folding time scale of 1 3 eq 31 the two asymptotic solutions intersect at about half time of one e folding time scale as the convection barely exceeds 50 of its maximum depth it is instructive to compare the final stage asymptotics 31 with the estimates obtained by visbeck et al 1996 if we approximate the chimney deepening time t final with two e folding time scales from eq 31 fig 2 then 32 t final 2 3 in dimensional units this gives see eqs 17 18 33 t final 2 3 t 2 3 γ 2 r 0 2 b 0 1 3 the lower bound estimate of the chimney deepening time by visbeck et al 1996 lies between our one and two e folding time scales of a chimney deepening phase 34 t final vmj γ 2 2 r 0 2 b 0 1 3 based on this result visbeck et al 1996 suggested an empirical approximation 35 t final vmj β r 0 2 b 0 1 3 to further derive β and γ from laboratory or numerical experiments 2 2 eqs 34 and 35 are eqs 21 and 22 in visbeck et al 1996 respectively our estimate of β eq 33 36 β 2 3 γ 2 is slightly higher than the theoretical lower bound estimate by visbeck et al 1996 based on a number of laboratory and numerical experiments visbeck et al 1996 report the following estimates γ 3 9 0 9 β 12 3 our estimate of β for the same average γ 3 9 is β 5 1 when using one e folding time scale of t final β 10 1 when using two e folding time scales as the time of the chimney development eq 36 the latter is close to β 12 experimentally obtained in visbeck et al 1996 fig 2 demonstrates that one e folding time scale is still quite far from the maximum convection depth while the two time scales can already be interpreted in the numerical experiments as the end of the deepening phase see figure 6 in visbeck et al 1996 3 2 synoptic perturbations of the buoyancy loss the approach developed in the previous section for the case of constant buoyancy loss can be generalized for more complex scenarios in this section we consider the case when the constant buoyancy loss is disturbed by a synoptic perturbation this can model a passing cyclone or a cold warm air outbreak the simplest way to model such perturbation is to assume a localized stepwise increase of buoyancy loss with a subsequent return to its initial value 37 b t 1 ξ b 0 if t 1 t t 2 b 0 otherwise where ξ const the buoyancy flux perturbation can be either positive ξ 0 or negative 1 ξ 0 we define the parameter q as 38 q 3 1 ξ which for these relatively small perturbations is positive or zero estimates of the heat fluxes from the sea surface in the central greenland sea show that about 85 of winter variations in the related buoyancy loss remain within the suggested limits although episodically the buoyancy loss may exceed the mean by the factor of two or three in the non dimensional variables the buoyancy loss scenario defined by eq 37 is 39 b t q 3 if t 1 t t 2 1 otherwise before the perturbation starts 0 t t 1 the chimney evolution is described by eq 23 with the solution t p h t h given by eq 26 during the perturbation t 1 t t 2 the depth of chimney obeys eq 20 with b q 3 the general solution of which is given by eq 25 plus a constant dependent on the initial conditions at t t 1 t p h t q h c 1 finally after the perturbation ends t t 2 the depth of the chimney is again described by eq 23 with the general solution given by eq 26 plus another constant dependent on the initial conditions at t t 2 t p h t h c 2 the constants c 1 c 2 can be derived from the conditions of continuity of the solution at t t 1 t t 2 the final form of the solution for this scenario is 40 t p h t h 0 t t 1 t 1 t q h t q h 1 t 1 t t 2 t 2 t h t h 2 t t 2 where the depths h 1 h 2 are archived at times t 1 t 2 respectively 41 t 1 t h 1 t 2 t 1 t q h 2 t q h 1 the solutions above are shown in fig 3 where the buoyancy perturbation is 50 of the reference value ξ 0 5 the duration of the buoyancy perturbation is δ t 0 25 with the parameters observed in the greenland sea the buoyancy flux b 0 8 1 0 8 m 2 s 3 the chimney radius r 0 10 km and γ 2 5 3 0 see section 5 we get the dimensional duration of the buoyancy perturbation δ t t 2 3 days this is close to a typical time scale of synoptic perturbations in fig 3b the dynamics of chimney deepening are shown for the forcing scenarios provided in fig 3a for both perturbation scenarios the slope of chimney depth curve changes discontinuously when the perturbation starts t t 1 and also when it ends t t 2 for the upward step a higher buoyancy loss the chimney expectedly deepens faster than under the reference scenario the deepening is less intensive for the downward step after the end of perturbation the chimney depth variations can be obtained from the unperturbed curve simply by making a proper shift to the left a temporal increase of the buoyancy loss or to the right a temporal decrease of the buoyancy loss along the time axis 3 3 transition to saturation of buoyancy loss in this section we consider the particular case when the chimney deepening is driven by gradual change in the buoyancy flux the system may model the autumn winter heat release from the ocean which corresponds to an increase in the maximum mixed layer depth in the greenland sea fig 4a the heat release leads to a gradual increase of the intensity of deep convection typically having maximum in april bashmachnikov et al 2019 consider the chimney deepening phase when 42 b t tanh t t 0 at small t b t grows linearly b t t t 0 while at large t it converges to unity this means that we have a scenario of transition to saturation of buoyancy loss where the parameter t 0 can be regarded as the relaxation time scale from eq 20 the chimney depth evolves as 43 d h d t tanh t t 0 h h 2 in fig 4a scenarios 42 of surface buoyancy loss for several values of parameter t 0 are shown while the related dynamics of the chimney deepening provided by eq 43 are shown in fig 4b the general form of eq 43 has to be integrated numerically however in the particular case of t 0 1 or in dimensional variables t 0 t where t is provided by eq 18 the surface buoyancy flux is expressed as 44 b t tanh t and the evolution of the non dimensional chimney depth can be derived analytically 45 h t tanh t the obtained solution 45 which is identical to the forcing function 44 at small t contradicts the familiar 1 2 power law 28 derived for deepening of the mixed layer turner 1973 however the latter relation see eq 28 is derived for the constant buoyancy loss and is not directly applicable to the scenario of the buoyancy loss growing from the initial zero level fig 4 shows seasonal variability of the normalized buoyancy flux from the ocean and the monthly maximum mixed layer depth in the central greenland sea assuming the unit of the non dimensional time to be 4 months the simple model catches the main features of the seasonal growth of the mixed layer depth from august to may although the model exaggerates the rate of the mixed layer deepening for the time normalization used the buoyancy flux changes as t 0 0 5 but the mixed layer depth changes much slower as t 0 2 this may be a result of existence of other important processes which may delay the deepening of the mixed layer for example the deepening may be delayed due to precipitation and ice melt formation on average ice melts in the central greenland sea even in winter selyuzhenok et al 2020 due to oceanic advection of heat and freshwater etc 4 restratification in this section we examine the situation when after a certain time t d h convection reaches the level h 1 ϵ separated from the final depth h 1 by a value ϵ 0 as strictly speaking reaching h 1 happens at infinitely large time the deepening stage obeys ode 20 for which we obtained analytical solutions for several buoyancy loss scenarios in section 3 at time t t d the surface cooling is switched off b t 0 and the restratification phase starts as discussed before we now assume that for t t d the level h 0 h 1 in eq 19 remains constant then we immediately come to the equation 46 d r d t h the solution of eq 46 predicts that in the restratification phase the radius of a chimney linearly decreases in time at time t the radius becomes zero and the chimney disappears we will call t the chimney lifetime the chimney lifetime depends on the depth h reached at the end of deepening phase i e at t t d overall the chimney evolution described can be visualized in the phase plane radius depth shown in fig 5 the evolution starts at the point with coordinates r 0 0 during the chimney deepening phase its radius is constant and the phase trajectory is a vertical segment at some point where the chimney depth h is less than h final the restratification phase starts then the chimney depth is constant and the phase trajectory becomes a horizontal segment the phase trajectory ends at a point where the chimney disappears given that the chimney radius during its deepening phase is r t const 1 eq 15 the solution of eq 46 becomes 47 r t 1 h t t d t d t t it follows immediately from eq 47 that 48 t t d t r where the restratification time t r is equal to 49 t r 1 h in particular if chimney starts decaying from its asymptotic final state h 1 the restratification time t r 1 in dimensional units according to eq 18 t r t this means that the restratification time of a mature chimney is equal to its characteristic deepening time t the estimate above 49 can be compared to the restratification timescale derived from numerical experiments by jones and marshall 1997 in the cited paper the parametrization in our notations is 50 t restrat jm 56 r 0 n h by substituting h h h final eq 13 into eq 50 and making use of eq 10 we get 51 t restrat jm 56 γ h r 0 2 b 0 1 3 eq 49 suggests that 52 t restrat t h γ 2 h r 0

results are in a close agreement with the numerical results by jones and marshall 1997 however we will see in section 5 that for the greenland sea the deepening and the restratification phases are better approximated when γ 2 5 3 0 in this case the multiple above h becomes 6 2 9 0 the inverse relation 49 suggests that the shallower is the chimney i e the lesser is h the larger is its restratification time t r in other words the radius of a mature chimney h 1 decays substantially more rapidly than of a chimney in its initial formation stage h 1 this in particular justifies the assumption 8 as the chimney deepening time t d h obviously grows with h eq 30 one might ask on how the overall chimney lifetime t eq 48 depends on h below we consider the case when the surface buoyancy loss during the deepening phase is constant section 3 1 the derivative d t d h is the sum of d t d h d h that eq 24 is 55 d t d d h h h 1 h 3 and of d t r h d h that eq 49 is 56 d t r d h h 1

26 48 49 58 t min 2 3 1 2 ln 2 3 1 1 3 π 6 arctan 1 4 3 3 1 67 for 0 h h the overall chimney lifetime is higher due to a long restratification phase and it decreases with h while for h h 1 the overall chimney lifetime is higher due to a long deepening phase and it increases with h fig 6 formally both at h 0 and h 1 the lifetime is infinite 5 deep convection in the greenland sea in this section we test the theory against observations in the greenland sea the theory by visbeck et al 1996 has already been tested against several model and laboratory studies as well as against observations in the northwestern mediterranean sea nowadays with the development of argo profiling drifter array observations in the nordic seas become more abundant and evenly distributed throughout a year for further analysis we have chosen winter 2012 2013 when the maximum number of temperature salinity vertical profiles 30 to 40 casts per month are available in the central greenland sea fig 7 as it follows from analysis of various data sets fedorov et al 2018 bashmachnikov et al 2018 2019 during winter 2012 2013 deep convection in the greenland sea exceeded 2000 m however the number of available casts is still insufficient to study an evolution of a single convection chimney which has a typical radii of order of 10 50 km for testing the theoretical results from the previous sections we use daily global ocean physical reanalysis glorys distributed by http marine copernicus eu with 1 1 2 spatial resolution and 50 vertical levels the reanalysis is based on lim2 evp nemo 3 1 general circulation ocean model with an active ice block the model is forced with 3 hour era interim atmospheric reanalysis the glorys model assimilates all available vertical temperature and salinity profiles satellite derived sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration as well as the absolute dynamic topography from the satellite altimetry in the central greenland sea glorys shows two deep convection chimneys developing from december 2012 to january 2013 and reaching 2000 m depth fig 8 the one to the south marked with the red circle in fig 8a is chosen for comparison with the theory this chimney remains a single localized structure for more than two months a comparatively large number of in situ profiles are assimilated in the reanalysis in this area fig 7a c adding robustness to the results the mixed layer depth is detected in glorys data set using the method by kara et al 2003 at every the 100 m depth level the chimney radial scale is computed as the mean of the distances of all data points with the mixed layer depth falling within the corresponding 50 m depth range from the chimney center the mode of the radial scales at all the depth levels is taken as the chimney radius fig 8b during the initial stage of the chimney development the chimney maximum depth and radius fig 9a b show a relatively monotonic growth the developed theory does not take into account the growth of the chimney radius however we may think this latter effect to be a result of development of an increasing number of individual plumes marshall and schott 1999 deepening of each of which is described by eqs 28 31 for the specific heat capacity of the seawater c p 3900 j kg 1 c 1 the mean water density ρ 1028 kg m 3 the gravity acceleration g 9 8 m s 2 the thermal expansion coefficient α 0 9 1 0 4 c 1 and the mean thermal heat flux from the ocean during the first 8 days of the deepening fig 9c of q 350 w m 2 we get the buoyancy flux from the sea surface b 0 g α q c p ρ 8 1 0 8 m 2 s 3 for comparison with the theory we take radius of the chimney r 0 10 km and the maximum chimney depth h final 2100 m the chimney depth and time variables are further normalized using eqs 13 17 the resulting non dimensional parameters are plotted against the theoretical values derived for a constant buoyancy flux fig 2 section 3 1 the best fit to the observations is obtained with the parameter γ 2 5 0 5 the confidence intervals come from the repeated computations with varying r 0 5 20 km and q 250 450 w m 2 the obtained γ is less than the previously adopted central value of 3 9 0 9 visbeck et al 1996 the difference between the results should arise from a known decrease of γ with the decrease of n f ratio visbeck et al 1996 visbeck et al 1996 compared their theoretical results with the parameters of deep convection chimneys in the mediterranean sea where n f 6 while for the less stratified subpolar greenland sea n f 2 however the lower limit of γ 3 0 for the same n f ratio in visbeck et al 1996 reasonably well fits the glorys results fig 2 the linear decay of the chimney radius during the restratification phase eq 46 is also tested against temporal evolution of the parameters of the selected chimney derived from glorys reanalysis fig 9d f the radius of the decaying chimney is well approximated with the linear function during the initial stage of the restratification phase here as well as for the deepening phase a good approximation of the glorys results is obtained for γ varying between 2 5 and 3 0 the discrepancies with the theory arise after about half time of the expected decay period 49 up to that moment the chimney depth stays constant well consistent with the assumptions made in section 4 after 0 5 t r the chimney suddenly collapses within 2 days showing a rapid decrease of both the chimney s radius and maximum depth overall the glorys estimates suggest of the chimney decay time to be 10 15 days against about 30 days predicted by eq 54 with γ 2 5 and 40 50 days with γ 3 0 therefore the theoretical decay time might be exaggerated by the factor of two or more at least for deep and narrow chimneys often observed in the greenland sea gsp group 1990 johannessen et al 1991 wadhams et al 2004 the radii of mesoscale submesoscale eddies through which a deep convection chimney decays depends on the radius of the chimney and at least should not significantly exceed the first rossby radius of deformation chelton et al 1998 in glorys reanalysis the rossby radii of deformation inside and outside the chimney are 3 and 4 km respectively this corresponds to the climatic estimates by nurser and bacon 2014 analysis of winter 2013 in situ vertical profiles from the en4 data base suggests the rossby radii of deformation to be around 1 km for the profiles with the mixed layer depth over 1000 m in deep convection chimneys and 1 5 2 km for the profiles with the mixed layer depth less than 500 m outside of the chimneys the difference is due to glorys showing 1 5 times higher mean buoyancy frequency below 200 400 m compared to the in situ data in any case the relatively small rossby radii of deformation raises the question of the insufficient spatial resolution of the glorys reanalysis 3 8 km in the study region by the beginning of the collapse the radius of the chimney decreases to 20 km or less and the model resolution may start distorting the chimney dynamics on the other hand a sudden collapse of mesoscale hetons is regularly observed in idealized model studies sokolovskiy and verron 2014 as the chimney becomes thinner its rossby number grows which makes the non linear behavior and a rapid collapse more probable an interaction with a shear flow or an energetic eddy will further facilitate the possible collapse 6 conclusions in the present paper we obtained analytical solutions for the dynamic equation 7 of evolution of a chimney that takes into account two processes affecting its buoyancy budget the buoyancy loss through the sea surface and the buoyancy transfer across the lateral boundary of the chimney by baroclinic eddies eq 7 has the form of an ordinary differential equation but it describes a simultaneous evolution of two geometrical parameters of the chimney the chimney depth and its radius separation of the chimney evolution into two subsequent phases the deepening phase and the restratification phase allows us considering as the unknown only one of the parameters for each of the phases during the deepening phase the chimney radius is assumed constant and the analytical solution for time variations of the chimney depth is obtained for several scenarios of the sea surface buoyancy loss the assumption of the constant chimney radius is not truly confirmed with the results of the ocean reanalysis glorys showing radius of the chimney to increase during the deepening phase nevertheless the obtained theoretical results permit making reasonable predictions on evolution of the chimney depth this suggests that the lateral buoyancy exchange is relatively small during the chimney deepening phase while with the persistent strong buoyancy flux from the sea surface the lateral expansion may be a result of generation of additional buoyancy plumes around the newly formed chimney for a constant surface buoyancy loss main geometric parameters of a fully developed mature chimney have been derived in several studies visbeck et al 1996 jones and marshall 1997 1993 legg et al 1996 analytical solutions for the chimney deepening and decay phases obtained in this paper permit to study chimney evolution to from its mature state following evolution of a chimney depth in the central greenland sea during its deepening phase we get the chimney formation time of about one week consistent with the theoretical estimates the observed mean for buoyancy loss during this period of 350 w m 2 used in the computations was relatively strong for the region under the constant surface buoyancy loss scenario a somewhat complex solution derived for the deepening phase can be well approximated during the initial deepening stage by a traditional one dimensional nonpenetrative deepening of the upper mixed layer and during the subsequent final deepening stage by an exponential convergence to the maximum possible depth for a given b 0 fig 2 jointly these two asymptotics provide a very close approximation of the whole deepening phase that formally takes an infinitely long time the transition from one asymptotics to another takes place at approximately half of the maximum possible depth which for a given value of b 0 and of the background stratification in autumn can be estimated using eq 10 originally derived by visbeck et al 1996 the chimney reaches the mature state when b 0 remains sufficiently strong at least during two e folding time scales in this study we also describe variations of the convection depth for two scenarios for a step like and for an increasing buoyancy loss with its further saturating the first scenario models a synoptic perturbation of the mean buoyancy loss the variation of the sea surface buoyancy flux by 50 over 25 of the deepening time 2 days for the 8 day deepening time of the studied chimney results in the variation in the deepening time scale 2 t by 25 30 a much stronger increases in the sea surface buoyancy loss often occurring in the greenland sea may result in a faster deepening of a chimney fig 9c d the second scenario with the increasing buoyancy loss section 3 3 models an increasing buoyancy loss in autumn and its further winter saturation typical for the subpolar seas the simple model results adequately represent the typical seasonal variation of the maximum mixed layer depth in the greenland sea during the restratification phase the chimney depth is assumed to be constant the evolution equation leads to a simple inverse law for a chimney shrinking time this means that the more mature is the chimney the faster it decays a chimney evolution in glorys reanalysis confirms the theoretically predicted quasi linear decrease of a chimney radius during the initial stages of the restratification phase however after about a half of the theoretical restratification time scale t restrat given by eq 54 the chimney collapses in two three days therefore the restratification time scale derived in section 4 seems to be exaggerated by the factor of two or more the collapse can be a result of the baroclinic instability of the heton which is a dynamic manifestation of the chimney and is not described by the simple 1d model however the collapse may also be an artifact of the glorys spatial resolution which is on the limit of that needed for reproducing the mesoscale dynamics of the medium size chimney a finer model resolution is needed to clarify this issue for a given constant buoyancy flux b 0 during the deepening phase the minimum chimney lifetime corresponds to the case when the buoyancy flux is switched off at approximately the first e folding time scale of the deepening process a less mature shallower chimney is lasting longer due to its longer decay phase a more mature deeper chimney is lasting longer due to its longer deepening phase fig 6 both the deepening and the restratification stages of the chimney in the glorys reanalysis are better described by the theory with a lower value of γ 2 5 3 0 compared to 3 9 0 9 obtained in visbeck et al 1996 we suppose this is due to the lower n f ratio in the subpolar study region which is three time smaller than that used by visbeck et al 1996 on the other hand there is a luck of observations to obtain statistics on chimney dynamics in the greenland sea and the example in section 5 is rather an illustrative one credit authorship contribution statement dmitry v

23976,representing the net freshwater flux at river mouths is challenging for global and regional scale ocean modelling although rivers are well known to affect both the coastal and basin wide circulation and dynamics coarse resolution ocean models cannot resolve the estuarine dynamics and are usually forced at river outlets in a simplistic way with climatological runoff and zero or constant salinity values the aim of this study is to provide a more realistic representation of the estuarine water inputs to a coarse but eddy resolving regional model first the river volume transport and salinity values at the outlets are modelled with three different estuary box models ebms for stratified estuaries the knudsen relations model a published ebm called uconn ncar ebm which parameterizes the tidal inflow and mixing inside the estuary and a new model called cmcc ebm the cmcc ebm has been conceived to represent the estuarine processes coupled to a mesoscale resolving hydrodynamic model that resolves the entering flow field at the estuary mouth and it offers a new representation of the tidal inflow and a new salinity tidal mixing parameterization via horizontal diffusive processes the ofanto and po rivers flowing into the adriatic sea northern part of the central mediterranean sea are selected as case studies the coupling of the eddy resolving ocean model to the cmcc ebm is found to outperform the one with the uconn ncar ebm in the region of freshwater influence on the shelf areas keywords estuarine dynamics river plume dynamics river ocean interface estuary box model eddy resolving ocean model 1 introduction over the past decades several theoretical as well as modeling studies e g chapman and beardsley 1989 simpson et al 1993 kourafalou et al 1996 yankovsky and chapman 1997 kourafalou 1999 garvine 1999 schiller and kourafalou 2010 maccready and geyer 2010 among the others have highlighted that the freshwater discharge dominates the dynamics of the shelf areas adjacent to estuaries known as regions of freshwater influence rofis by producing a buoyant river plume which consists of an offshore bulge and a coastal alongshore current due to the geostrophic adjustment more recent studies e g garvine and whitney 2006 hordoir et al 2008 maccready et al 2009 maccready and geyer 2010 among others have examined the role played by the ocean salty waters intruding into the estuaries demonstrating that this intrusion drives the estuarine water exchange thus affecting the net estuarine outflow and salinity values the connection of the estuary stratification with the coastal dynamics has been investigated and the forcings that determine the shape and intensity of the buoyant plume have been identified the plume dynamics were found to be strongly tidal in the near field plume jirka et al 1981 which is the area immediately outside of the river mouth corresponding to the excursion length of the ebb tides winds also affect the river plume downwelling winds facilitate the homogenization of the water column and tend to turn the plume into an along shore current while upwelling winds promote the water stratification and offshore drift chao 1987 the role of wind stress is demonstrated to prevail over tides as the buoyant river inflow moves far from the outlet in the so named far field plume maccready et al 2009 previous studies have focused on the effects of the freshwater discharge on the shelf and coastal circulation and dynamics while fewer show their basin wide effects among them rahmstorf 1995 speculated that an increasing freshwater inflow in the northern atlantic is potentially able to reduce or even shut down the local overturning circulation skliris et al 2007 demonstrated that the salinity increase observed in the western mediterranean dense water during 1965 2005 can be explained by about 50 from the salinity increase of the levantine intermediate water due to damming of black sea and the nile river the remaining part is explained locally and due to the reduction of the ebro river runoff coles et al 2013 showed that the amazon river release has pathways into the western tropical and subtropical gyres of the north atlantic verri et al 2018 showed that river runoff affects the strength of the overturning circulation of the central mediterranean sea enhancing the amplitude of the secondary estuarine cells and reducing the intensity of the dominant anti estuarine cell rivers are also demonstrated to reduce the volume of adriatic dense water in the southern adriatic sea of about 20 as a result of increased water stratification moreover tseng et al 2016 and sun et al 2019 showed the impacts of different choices of freshwater inputs in an earth system climate model concluding that river salinity effects are important at basin scale the above mentioned studies indicate that global and regional ocean models require a good representation of the net freshwater release at river outlets global and regional ocean models cannot resolve the estuarine dynamics due to low resolutions that cannot reach the spatial scales of the estuarine geometry and processes recently the university of connecticut uconn and the national center for atmospheric research ncar have jointly developed a reduced order estuary box model ebm which interfaces the upstream river runoff with the ocean through a two layer box model which represents the estuarine dynamics sun et al 2017 in this paper we compare the uconn ncar ebm to a new estuary box model the so called cmcc ebm we developed at cmcc foundation euro mediterranean center on climate change to be coupled explicitly with an eddy resolving mesoscale ocean general circulation model as described below the latter offers a new representation of the volume and salt conservation equations for three main reasons 1 the cmcc ebm is conceived for coupling with regional eddy resolving models which are expected to represent the advective dynamics near the river mouths better than low resolution o 10 100 km climate models which have been used with the uconn ncar ebm 2 the mixing due to tidal processes is parameterized by a turbulent salt diffusion parameter 3 the tidal pumping enters both the volume and salt conservation equations through the flood tide inflow and the ebb tide outflow the latter is embedded in the unknown estuarine outflow to show the impact of the ebm volume flux and salinity values on the quality of an ocean simulation we applied the results of the ebms to a regional ocean model in the central mediterranean sea and in particular to two estuaries in this area the first is the highly stratified estuary of the ofanto river which flows through apulia in southern italy and ends in the southern adriatic sea the second is the partially mixed delta of the po river one of the main rivers in europe which discharges into the northern adriatic sea for the ofanto test case we compare an explicitly resolved estuary with the results of the two ebms for the po test case we compare with open and free access observations of opportunity this comparison is capable to differentiate among the two ebms and the climatological fixed salinity approach with respect to simulating the river discharge and its associated salinity the final aim was to show that ebm inputs can in fact improve the shelf salinity in the vicinity of estuaries with respect to climatological fixed salinity simulations the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the three estuarine models the method used to couple them to the regional ocean model is introduced in section 3 section 4 presents the selected case studies the results of both the estuarine dynamics and the coastal dynamics are discussed in sections 5 and 6 the summary and the conclusions are presented in section 7 2 the estuary box modelling the presented study is placed in the framework of developing a conceptual and numerical modelling approach to simulate the effects of rivers on the coastal circulation in eddy resolving general circulation models the km scale models cannot explicitly resolve the estuary dynamics thus the idea of an estuary box model which transforms freshwaters and river discharges into estuary mouth volume and salinity fluxes was developed by sun et al 2017 the concept is as follows at the river mouth stratification can be relevant and the discharge is different from the river runoff far upstream where the dynamics are driven by precipitation hydrology and river geometry the stratification and transport field at the estuary mouth can be approximated by two layer flow in several cases where the lower layer enters the estuary and the upper layer discharges into the coastal area the ebm gives the values of water volume flux and salinity at the river mouth which in turn affects the coastal ocean dynamics the precise analytical and numerical formulation of the boundary conditions in the ocean general circulation model are given in section 3 three approaches for representing the estuary dynamics are considered the simplest model is based on knudsen s relation knudsen 1900 the second on the uconn ncar ebm sun et al 2017 and the last on a new box model developed at cmcc and presented in this paper the cmcc ebm all the ebms assume that the estuary region is a two layer rectangular box with constant width l y depth h and length l x as shown in fig 1 the estuary head is considered as the last section along the river network moving in the downstream direction where the salinity is still equal to zero and the estuary length l x is set as the distance between the estuary head and the mouth the estuary width l y is the approximate estuary width or the width of the delta area if several mouths are present for the same upstream conditions the estuary depth h is chosen as a compromise between the river depth and the near mouth shelf bathymetry the cross sections at the estuary mouth and the estuary head are open all the models are laterally and along channel averaged steady state and tidally averaged the tidal cycle i e the lunar day includes both the flood tide and the ebb tide phases it is about 50 min longer than the solar day thus we approximate with the solar day in this study the average over the tidal cycle is fully consistent with the estuaries classified as highly stratified or partially mixed fischer et al 1979 in fact these estuaries maintain the stratification over the tidal cycle they may become unstable and mix only during the late ebb tide phase geyer and smith 1987 a different treatment will be required in the future to consider well mixed estuaries which might produce a destratified water column over the tidal cycle maccready and geyer 2010 the heat flux precipitation and wind stress are not considered at this stage although we know that their effects are relevant for some rivers chen and sanford 2009 scully et al 2005 schroeder and wiseman jr 1986 furthermore in this work we do not consider temperature effects because the estuary dynamics is to the first order dominated by salinity exchanges the knudsen s model the knudsen s relation consists of two conservation equations for the volume and salt fluxes under the assumptions of i a rigid lid and ii incompressible fluid the model sketch is drawn in the top panel of fig 1 we hereafter refer to this model as knudsen ebm the knudsen s relation considers the following physical processes the riverine water inflow at the estuary head the ocean water inflow through the lower layer at the estuary mouth and the estuarine water outflow through the upper layer the tidal effects and mixing processes are ignored in the equations the upper layer salinity is generated instantaneously by unresolved processes in order to balance the salt inflow in the lower layer the conservation equations for the volume flux m 3 s and the salinity averaged over the box and in time are as follows 1 q u l e b m q r i v e r q l l o c e a n 2 s u l e b m q u l e b m s l l o c e a n q l l o c e a n quantities in 1 and 2 are distinguished between inputs and unknowns the subscripts ll and ul stand for lower layer and upper layer respectively the volume flux and salinity of the outflowing estuarine water q u l e b m and s u l e b m are considered as unknowns while the q r i v e r the volume flux of the river inflow at the estuary head q l l o c e a n and s l l o c e a n the volume flux and salinity of the ocean water inflow through the lower layer at the estuary mouth are inputs eq 1 is obtained starting from the continuity equation with a rigid lid assumption and eq 2 is derived from the salinity equation under steady state conditions without considering diffusion the uconn ncar ebm the 2 layer steady state uconn ncar ebm sun et al 2017 is based on the concept of the potential energy anomaly proposed by garvine and whitney 2006 the model assumptions are i no surface layer forcing ii incompressibility and iii hydrostatic balance a sketch of the model is shown in the middle panel of fig 1 the physical processes described are the riverine water inflow at the estuary head the ocean water inflow through the lower layer at the estuary mouth the estuarine water outflow through the upper layer at the mouth the tidal pumping over a whole tidal cycle including the flood and the ebb tide the tidal mixing at the bottom and the shear mixing at the layer interface the model consists of four equations the continuity equation for the volume flux the salinity equation which includes a parametrization of the tidal pumping a potential energy pe equation and a linear equation of state for seawater the equations averaged over the tidal cycle are 3 q u l e b m q r i v e r q l l o c e a n 4 ρ u l e b m q u l e b m ρ l l o c e a n q l l o c e a n ρ 0 q r i v e r ρ l l o c e a n ρ u l e b m m t i d e s

represents the shear mixing term q u l t i d e s is the tidal volume flux that exits the upper layer during the ebb tide m t i d e s is the ratio between the areas of advected volumes during ebb or flood tide k s 7 7 1 0 4 psu 1 is the haline contraction coefficient garvine 1999 and ρ 0 1000 kg m 3 is the freshwater reference density using eq 6 the upper and lower layer densities are defined ρ u l e b m ρ 0 1 k s s u l e b m and ρ l l o c e a n ρ 0 1 k s s l l o c e a n the uconn ncar ebm formula for the average tidal volume flux during half a tidal cycle reads q u l t i d e q t i d e f o c e a n 2 u t i d e π l y h 2 with u t i d e a g h where a is the tidal amplitude the potential energy flux terms pef units of j s are detailed in sun et al 2017 and are not reproduced here the outflowing volume flux through the upper layer q u l e b m the salinity of outflowing water s u l e b m and the volume flux of the ocean water entering the lower layer q l l o c e a n are the unknowns for this model while the river volume flux at the estuary head q r i v e r and the salinity of inflowing ocean water through the lower layer s l l o c e a n are provided as inputs the tidal pumping effects are inserted in the last term of the rhs of eq 4 and the third term of the rhs of eq 5 the tidal mixing is included in the fourth term of the rhs of eq 5 and the shear mixing is represented in the last term of the rhs of eq 5 the detailed explanation of each of them can be found in sun et al 2017 here it is only important to recall that the flood tide is considered to enter the estuary through both layers while the ebb tide outflow involves the upper layer only simpson et al 1990 moreover the volume fluxes at the mouth during flood and ebb tides are also simplified as in stommel and farmer 1995 this means that there is no net volume flux due to tides in the continuity equation while ebb and flood tides have a specific effect in the salinity and pe equations because of the density differences between waters removed and introduced at ebb and flood times the assumption of a net tidal volume flux equal to zero is not necessarily true moreover the empirical formula used to represent the flood tide inflow and the ebb tide outflow generalize the ones proposed by stommel and farmer 1995 the flood tide inflow can vary from a semi ellipse to a semi circle form while the ebb tide outflow has a rectangular jet like form the coefficient m t i d e s in eq 4 comes out from this geometrical simplification and require a quite complex calibration these assumptions on the tidal pumping limit the performance of the model when applied to poorly monitored estuaries in addition present day tidal models such as the oregon state university tidal prediction software otps egbert and erofeeva 2002 used in this study to force the cmcc ebm resolve the tidal coastal dynamics up to few km a new representation of the flood tide inflow and the ebb tide outflow without any parameterization is then introduced in the cmcc ebm as described in the following section the cmcc ebm a new ebm is developed in this paper from the basic assumption that the lower layer salinity and volume inflow are specified by the eddy resolving ocean model near the coasts the barotropic volume inflow due to tides comes from the otps egbert and erofeeva 2002 barotropic model because the eddy resolving ocean model used here does not include tides the basic equations used are the continuity equation within the incompressible assumption and the salinity conservation equation as in the case of the uconn ncar ebm however we do not need a third equation for the potential energy as in the uconn ncar ebm because we have a total of two unknowns the upper layer volume flux and the upper layer salinity furthermore we add the tidal inflow in the continuity equation and in the salinity conservation equation and we parameterize the tidal mixing in the salinity equation in a different way of uconn ncar ebm the model sketch is drawn in the bottom panel of fig 1 the tidally averaged equations are as follows 7 q u l e b m q r i v e r q l l o c e a n h l y u t i d e f 8 s u l e b m q u l e b m s l l o c e a n q l l o c e a n s o c e a n h l y u t i d e f k s h h l y s o c e a n l x the inputs are the volume flux q l l o c e a n and salinity s l l o c e a n the depth averaged ocean salinity s o c e a n at the estuary mouth the tidal velocity normal to the estuary mouth u t i d e f and the river volume flux q r i v e r at the estuary head the volume flux q u l e b m and salinity s u l e b m of the outflowing estuarine water through the upper layer are the model unknowns we describe the ocean water inflow as a baroclinic bottom inflow second term on the rhs of eq 7 and first term on the rhs of eq 8 and a barotropic tidal inflow during the flood tide phase third term on the rhs of eq 7 and second term on the rhs of eq 8 we describe the tidal mixing by considering that the horizontal diffusion of salt along the estuary last terms on the rhs of eq 8 is driven by the tides we represent the river inflow at the estuary head as a volume flux first term on the rhs of eq 7 with zero salinity appendix a provides a comprehensive demonstration of the governing equations of the cmcc ebm unlike in the uconn ncar ebm the q l l o c e a n h 2 l y u l l o c e a n is treated as an input variable calculated from the daily ocean velocity provided by the eddy resolving ocean model u l l o c e a n considered to be positive if it is landward oriented and equal to zero if seaward oriented thus u l l o c e a n is the averaged horizontal velocity component in a box next to the river mouth as detailed in section 4 with regard to the tidal pumping we follow the theoretical approach proposed by simpson et al 1990 with a barotropic tidal inflow during the flood tide q t i d e f o c e a n h l y u t i d e f and a stratified outflow through the upper layer during the ebb tide as done in the uconn ncar ebm however we do not assume that the tidal pumping inflow outflow has the same amplitude thus there is a tidal pumping term in the continuity equation we also physically solve the tidal pumping with no empirical formula the full derivation is shown in appendix a and we provide the barotropic velocity corresponding to the flood tide u t i d e f while the outgoing tidal velocity during the ebb tide is embedded in the unknown estuarine water outflow q u l e b m the u t i d e f is computed from the hourly outputs of the otps egbert and erofeeva 2002 considered as flood tide values if landward oriented and averaged daily the flood tide volume flux is thus given by q t i d e f o c e a n h l y u t i d e f the horizontal mixing coefficient for salt is computed following banas et al 2004 k s h 0 035 l y u t i d e f it is worth to point out again that the cmcc ebm receives as input the lower layer transport from the mesoscale resolving general circulation model thus it does not need a third conservation equation to solve for the lower layer volume inflow in cmcc ebm only four parameters the geometry coefficients l y l x h and the turbulent diffusion coefficient k s h need to be calibrated 3 coupling the estuary box model with an eddy resolving regional ocean model fig 2 shows the computational domain of the regional ocean model verri et al 2018 used in this study based on the three dimensional finite difference code nemo v3 4 madec 2008 the model grid covers the central mediterranean sea with a horizontal resolution of about 2 2 km 2 5 km in the meridional direction and 1 7 2 2 km in the zonal direction the vertical discretization consists of 121 unevenly spaced z levels with increased resolution at the top and the bottom and partial cells at the bottom the eddy resolving regional model is one way nested in a 1 16 resolution 72 levels numerical ocean analysis and forecasting model of the mediterranean sea oddo et al 2009 the robustness of this model has been demonstrated in verri et al 2018 who provide an interannual comparison with in situ and satellite observations in the open sea verri et al 2018 follow oddo et al 2005 approach where the runoff salinity is taken to have ad hoc values based upon heuristic reasoning in this paper we remove the ad hoc assumptions about the salinity at the river mouth as the rivers are not explicitly represented as lateral open boundary conditions due to the coarse resolution of the eddy resolving regional ocean model the riverine inputs of volume and salinity are treated as boundary conditions for the vertical velocity and the vertical diffusive salinity flux at the sea surface beron vera et al 1999 tseng et al 2016 a detailed explanation of the formulation used by nemo for the riverine release as surface boundary conditions is provided in appendix b given the upper layer volume outflow q u l e b m and the upper layer salinity s u l e b m both computed by the ebms the surface boundary conditions for the vertical velocity and the diffusive salt flux are written as 9 w z η η t u h z η h η e p q u l e b m a 10 k v s z z η e p s η q u l e b m a s u l e b m where w z η is the vertical velocity at the sea surface η is the sea surface elevation u h is the horizontal velocity at the sea surface e is the evaporation rate units of m s p is the precipitation rate units of m s a is the horizontal area of the sea grid cell corresponding to the river mouth and k v is the vertical diffusivity coefficient the s u l e b m and the q u l e b m are prescribed at river mouth grid points which approximate the river mouth positions 4 case studies the ofanto river highly stratified estuary we chose the funnel shaped estuary of the ofanto river as our first case study this semi perennial river flows through southern italy and ends in the southern adriatic sea fig 2 and top panel fig 3 the mean annual runoff is 14 92 m 3 s 1 raicich 1996 and the mean annual tidal amplitude recorded at the tidal gauge closest to the river mouth is 0 04 m guarnieri et al 2013 we performed several experiments using the three ebms with river runoff q r i v e r from a simulation performed with the wrf hydro model verri et al 2017 as no observations were available at the estuary head the period of interest chosen was january march 2011 which was characterized by a high river discharge and two flooding events bottom panel of fig 3 in order to characterize the stratification of the ofanto river we estimated the flow ratio parameter f fischer et al 1979 for the period of simulation 11 f u t i d e f u r i v e r 0 02 where u t i d e f is the averaged flood tide velocity computed by the otps system and u r i v e r is the mean river streamflow modelled at the estuary head values of f less than 0 1 are classified as highly stratified thus the ofanto estuary is a sharply stratified estuary the geometrical parameters of the ofanto estuary are the estuary width l y 25 m the estuary depth h 5 m and the estuary length l x 1 km which are kept equal for all the three ebms the estuary length l x complies with the results of a monitoring campaign that estimated the length of the salt intrusion to be about 1 km upstream of the ofanto mouth personal communication of the water research institute of the national research council cnr irsa the uconn ncar ebm requires additional parameters we extracted the tidal period t and the tidal amplitude a t i d e from guarnieri et al 2013 while the bottom drag coefficient c d the tidal mixing efficiency ϵ the shear mixing efficiency γ and the entrainment constant at the layer interface α are the values used in the literature sun et al 2017 the salt and volume of the inflowing ocean water i e s l l o c e a n and q l l o c e a n are computed as volume weighted averages of the ocean model grid points three by three grid points in the horizontal and three vertical grid levels from the bottom surrounding the approximate position of the ofanto river mouth in detail the mesoscale general circulation model considers a minimum depth at the coasts of 5 meters and it considers six levels for this depth the lowest three model levels are inside the lower layer of the ebm model i e from 2 5 m to 5 m depth two additional fields are required by the cmcc ebm i e the flood tide velocity u t i d e f and the depth averaged ocean salinity s o c e a n the former is provided by the otps system as described in section 2 the latter is a spatially weighted average covering all the vertical levels in a three by three grid point area an overview of the ebms settings for the ofanto estuary case is provided in table 1 the po river partially mixed delta the second case study is the delta shaped estuary of the po river this is the main freshwater source of the central mediterranean sea and the second in the whole mediterranean basin the mean annual runoff is 1492 m 3 s 1 ludwig et al 2009 and the mean annual tidal amplitude recorded at the tidal gauge closest to the river mouth is 0 09 m guarnieri et al 2013 near the mouth the river network creates a wide delta with hundreds of small channels and nine main branches the map of the river delta is given in fig 4 a set of experiments to represent both the estuarine dynamics and the rofi dynamics of the po river were performed from january to june 2009 this period was chosen according to the observation availability close to the river mouths the estuary head runoff q r i v e r is provided by the observations at the pontelagoscuro station this time range includes a major flood event on may 2nd with a recorded runoff exceeding 8000 m 3 s fig 4 fischer s flow ratio 11 for the po river is 0 43 this means that the po estuary is a partially mixed estuary the tidal flow is comparable with the river flow and the induced vertical mixing smooths the salinity gradient although the stratification of the exchange flow persists over a whole tidal cycle the representation of the estuarine dynamics as a two layer exchange flow is therefore still reasonable we considered the inflowing tidal velocity at the river mouth u t i d e f as given by otps and the river streamflow velocity at the estuary head u r i v e r as provided by pontelagoscuro station given the relatively coarse resolution of our ocean model it is not really possible to distinguish u l l o c e a n affecting one mouth with respect to the other thus we decided to take a box model for all the po river mouths together in the future if the resolution of the regional model will increase u l l o c e a n will be different at different po river branches and different ebms could be applied to each of them the simplified set up of the po delta consists of an estuary box with length l x 20 km width l y 20 km and depth h 5 m the estuary length l x complies with the results of a monitoring campaign that estimated the length of the salt intrusion to be about 20 km upstream of po di dritta mouth i e the easternmost mouth at the delta personal communication of the regional agency for the environmental protection arpae the estuary width l y is taken as a combined width of all of the po mouths the estuary depth h is calculated as the bathymetry of the surrounding sea cells of our eddy resolving regional ocean model regarding the uconn ncar ebm the tidal coefficients i e the tidal period t and the tidal amplitude a t i d e are based on observations following guarnieri et al 2013 the other coefficients follow the reference values given by sun et al 2017 as in the ofanto river case the salt and volume flux of the inflowing ocean water s l l o c e a n and q l l o c e a n are computed as volume weighted averages for the lowest 3 vertical levels of the ocean model and a three by three grid point area around the mouth of po di dritta the additional fields required by the cmcc ebm i e the flood tide velocity u t i d e f and the depth averaged ocean salinity s o c e a n are computed as with the ofanto river the upper layer volume flux from the ebm q u l e b m is distributed among the delta mouths following the percentages in provini et al 1992 which correspond to different grid points in the ocean model an overview of the ebms settings for the po delta case is provided in table 1 5 salinity and volume flux estimates from the ebms in this section the experiments performed with the three ebms are compared and evaluated for the ofanto and po river study cases table 2 summarizes the order of magnitude of the volume fluxes entering the estuary box the cmcc ebm shows the largest ocean water intrusion for the ofanto and po rivers due to the calculation of q l l o c e a n from the ocean model velocities for the q t i d e f o c e a n differences are evident only for the ofanto fig 5 shows the salinity top panel and volume flux bottom panel of the outflowing estuarine waters for the ofanto similarly fig 6 refers to the po in all the panels of figs 5 and 6 the green line time series show the salinity and the volume flux used in verri et al 2018 to force the eddy resolving regional ocean model at the river mouths the water volume fluxes are monthly climatologies for the ofanto river raicich 1996 and daily means observed at pontelagoscuro station for the po river the salinity values are taken to be constant i e 15 psu for the ofanto and 17 psu for the po river we call both the salinity and volume fluxes from verri et al 2018 climatological estimates the salinity computed by knudsen s ebm blue lines in the top panels of figs 5 and 6 often drops to zero over several days for both case studies this is an unreasonable result and reveals the major weakness in knudsen s model which does not include tidal effects the outflowing water salinity is equal to the zero salinity values at the estuary head if there is no lower layer inflow of salty waters from the ocean for the ofanto fig 5 there are no significant differences between uconn and cmcc ebms in both discharge and outflowing salinity except for a few days to note that the discharge time series of knudsen and cmcc ebm are nearly overlapped as the tidal volume flux is not relevant for this case study moreover the discharge time series of uconn ncar ebm almost overlaps the inflowing volume flux at the estuary head the orange line this is due to the fact that the lower layer ocean volume inflow and the tidal volume flux are both found to be small in uconn ncar ebm see table 2 on the other hand the uconn ncar ebm shows a relevant role of the tidal pumping parameterization which ensures the outflowing salinity is not far from the cmcc ebm one despite the orders of magnitude difference in the ocean volume inflows for the po fig 6 uconn ncar and cmcc ebms radically differ in terms of both salinity and discharge a higher salinity and volume flux of the outflowing estuarine water was simulated by the cmcc ebm the cmcc ebm shows a stronger intrusion of the salty waters at the bottom of the estuary mouth as shown in table 2 moreover the two models solve the tidal pumping and the tidal mixing processes in different ways which become particularly evident in the po as this is a partially mixed estuary with strong tidal effects the additional comparison with the observed salinity black timeseries in fig 6 shows that the cmcc ebm outperforms the other models to note that the observations refer to a gauge station located close to the po di goro outlet fig 4 but in a secondary channel starting from the definition of the gradient richardson number r i n 2 d u d z 2 g ρ 0 d ρ d z d u d z 2 the time series of r i has been computed as follows r i e b m g ρ 0 d ρ d z d u d z 2 g k s ρ 0 s l l o c e a n s u l e b m h 2 u l l o c e a n 2 u t i d e f u u l e b m h 2 2 with the assumption that the density is a linear function of the salinity and k s 7 7 1 0 4 psu 1 the time series of r i e b m in fig 7 shows that in both the po and ofanto uconn ncar ebm reaches higher values than cmcc ebm thus suggesting that turbulent mixing across the stratification is weaker in uconn ncar than in the cmcc ebm 6 effects of the different ebms on the rofi the river volume fluxes and salinities computed by uconn ncar and cmcc ebm were imposed in two simulations of our eddy resolving regional ocean model one focused on the ofanto rofi area and the other in the po rofi in both cases the model covers the whole area depicted in fig 2 however the timing of the experiments is different as explained in the previous section for the ofanto rofi four experiments were carried out a climatological experiment based on the ocean model forced at river mouths by climatological runoff and a constant salinity of 15 psu two other experiments were performed by coupling the ocean model with the cmcc ebm and the uconn ncar ebm volume and salinity fluxes fig 5 a fourth experiment referred to as the explicit estuary was performed with the eddy resolving regional ocean model by modifying the model coastline to include 10 km inlet simulating the ofanto estuary this explicit estuary experiment is forced at the inlet head with the runoff computed by the hydrological modelling system described by verri et al 2017 and with salinity equal to zero this experiment is a coarse representation of the ofanto estuary geometry and it allows for the salt intrusion to occur due to the physics of the eddy resolving model it is indeed a coarsely resolved estuary the horizontal model resolution is around 2 km but it contains 6 vertical levels where the salt intrusion can develop thus it is considered our control or most realistic scenario for the ofanto estuary to be used for comparison with the other three experiments because no observational data were available in the rofi area fig 8 shows the daily sea surface salinity in the ofanto rofi during an upwelling wind regime for the western coast of the adriatic basin which promotes the development of the ofanto plume the coupled ebms and ocean models represent a well defined river plume are close to the benchmark experiment and outperform the climatological experiment which is unable to reproduce the plume moreover the estimate of the q l l o c e a n from the explicit estuary experiment has been computed table 2 it shows the same order of magnitude of the cmcc ebm one not uconn ncar for the po rofi three experiments were carried out a climatological experiment with the eddy resolving regional ocean model forced by the pontelagoscuro runoff and a constant salinity of 17 psu and two experiments with the ocean model forced by the outflowing salinity and volume outflow computed by the cmcc and uconn ncar ebms fig 6 fig 9 shows the daily sea surface salinity during an upwelling wind event which supports the offshore spreading of the po plume the experiments performed by coupling the ebms with the eddy resolving regional ocean model represent a well defined plume while the climatological approach shows a much weaker development the validity of the model was evaluated by comparing the modelled salinity with the observed salinity at two buoys maintained by the institute of marine sciences ismar and the emilia romagna environmental protection agency arpae the arpae buoy is located 7 km offshore of the po di goro mouth at a 1 m depth the ismar buoy ravaioli et al 2016 is 5 km offshore at a 1 7 m depth the buoys are indicated in the top panel of fig 4 and in the middle panel of fig 9 the time series in figs 10 and 11 show the comparisons the coupled system with cmcc ebm was found to provide the lowest root mean square errors as reported in tables 3 and 4 conversely the climatological experiment gave the largest errors at the ismar buoy the salinity skill of uconn ncar ebm was similar to cmcc ebm however for the arpae buoy the cmcc ebm was better in order to understand some of the discrepancies between the model and the observations shown in fig 10 we modified the vertical mixing parametrization near the river mouth the development of river plumes is due to the outflowing river runoff and salinity and to a combination of wind forcing tidal forcing coriolis effect and vertical mixing next to the river mouth kourafalou 1999 in order to show the sensitivity of the po plume to the vertical mixing in the rofi area we produced a specific analysis around may 2nd when both ebms failed to reproduce a correct value for the salinity in the plume with respect to the observed value fig 10 the vertical mixing at the river mouth was increased for the cmcc ebm case an additional vertical eddy mixing coefficient is prescribed and in fig 12 we show the new time series which better reproduces the salinity for may 2nd with respect to the observed value the lesson learned is that if we want to reproduce properly the river plume dynamics at least specific parametrizations of vertical mixing are required especially during large runoff events 7 summary and conclusions the aim of this study was the development of proper interfaces between mesoscale eddy resolving models and estuaries in order to simulate the rofi dynamics sun et al 2017 have already shown the importance of using an estuary box model ebm to estimate outflowing salinities in this study we presented a new ebm and we compared it with sun et al 2017 we have proposed three different approaches for representing the estuarine dynamics the knudsen relations model the uconn ncar ebm and our new model called cmcc ebm the first two are a benchmark for representing the estuarine dynamics and we use them as the starting point of our investigation the cmcc ebm aims at representing the estuarine processes in a different way than the uconn ncar ebm because it is developed for coupling with an eddy resolving ocean numerical model which could resolve the subsurface flow input to the estuary furthermore tidal volume flux contributes to the volume conservation equation and tidal mixing is parameterized in a different way to allow for partially mixed estuaries to be modelled we tested the coupling of the different ebms with an eddy resolving regional ocean model covering the adriatic sea and for two different river dominated shelf areas the highly stratified estuary of the ofanto river and the partially mixed delta of the po river the experiments prove that i knudsen s relation is a too simple approach ii the cmcc ebm results are close to the uconn ncar ebm for the ofanto but differ for the po where tides play a more significant role the two ebms are based on a different set of equations and one of the most important differences is the representation of the tidal effects in terms of both tidal pumping and tidal mixing processes one of the strengths of the cmcc ebm is that it includes only 4 tunable parameters less than in uconn ncar which is desirable as most estuaries are poorly monitored the coupled ebm and ocean model experiments show how the coastal dynamics are affected by the volume outflow q u l e b m and outflowing salinity s u l e b m estimated by the ebms they prove that i the cmcc ebm and uconn ncar ebm coupled to a regional eddy resolving model are capable of reconstructing river plumes and they both outperform the climatological approach ii the cmcc ebm coupled system shows the lowest statistical errors compared to the observed salinity at two buoys located off the mouths of the po these findings encourage us to use the ebms as main forcing submodels in shelf areas instead of the classical climatological imposition of an ad hoc salinity value overall we conclude that modelling the estuarine dynamics as a 2 layer exchange flow with tidally averaged conservation equations is a relatively good representation of the exchange flow at the river mouth the results of the ebms could thus be used to appropriately force global regional ocean models on a daily scale however a weakness of all the ebms discussed is the assumed steady estuarine dynamics the reconstruction of the intrusion of the salt wedge in short temporal scales or the prediction of extreme events e g the blocking effect in both directions due to storm surges or river flooding and the mascaret occurring during the flood tide phase requires a more sophisticated unsteady dynamics box model or the direct modeling of the river estuary to further develop the estuarine box approach the next step would be to consider the estuary length as a time varying function of the river discharge and the tidal mixing we plan to evaluate the role of the heat flux in the estuary water exchange by adding a temperature equation in the cmcc ebm and the wind forcing finally the near mouth mixing processes as currently parameterized by the ocean eddy resolving model deserve a dedicated study in order to get the maximum benefit from the coupled ebm and ocean model system credit authorship contribution statement giorgia verri conceptualization methodology

the cmcc ebm we deduce 7 starting from the incompressible continuity equation 12 u 0 considering the volume integral over the estuary box we obtain 13 v u d v s u n ˆ d s 0 where n ˆ is unit normal field pointing outward the surface s bounding the estuary volume in the box model the sections at the estuary mouth and head are the only open lateral boundaries as shown in fig a 1 we assume the estuarine box to have equal layer thicknesses between the surface and h depth furthermore we assume that the river inflow occurs only in the upper layer at the head section thus 13 becomes h 2 h d y u

considered as flood tide values if landward oriented and daily averaged the outgoing tidal velocity during the ebb tide is embedded into the unknown estuarine water outflow q u l e b m thus it does not appear explicitly in the equations eq 14 is the final volume conservation equation for the cmcc ebm together with the definitions 15 16 17 and 18 the salinity equation considered at steady state is written 19 u s k s x 2 s x 2 k s y 2 s y 2 k s z 2 s z 2 where k s x k s y and k s z are the horizontal and vertical diffusivity coefficients respectively the volume integral of 19 reads 20 v u s d v v k s x 2 s x 2 d v the across estuary and vertical diffusive salt flux does not appear explicitly in the volume averaged salinity equation as a result of the insulated boundaries at the surface bottom and side walls we assume that the along estuary diffusion of salinity is driven by the barotropic tidal inflow thus the volume integral of 20 reduces to 21 ω u s n ˆ d ω l y h x 0 x l x k s x 2

upstream river freshwaters and the marine waters entering the estuary as computed by the box models of this paper the surface salinity values at the river mouth are then different from the values in areas just offshore the river mouth in a lateral open boundary condition framework rivers have a net dilution effect because the entering surface waters have lower salinities than in the offshore in a

23976,representing the net freshwater flux at river mouths is challenging for global and regional scale ocean modelling although rivers are well known to affect both the coastal and basin wide circulation and dynamics coarse resolution ocean models cannot resolve the estuarine dynamics and are usually forced at river outlets in a simplistic way with climatological runoff and zero or constant salinity values the aim of this study is to provide a more realistic representation of the estuarine water inputs to a coarse but eddy resolving regional model first the river volume transport and salinity values at the outlets are modelled with three different estuary box models ebms for stratified estuaries the knudsen relations model a published ebm called uconn ncar ebm which parameterizes the tidal inflow and mixing inside the estuary and a new model called cmcc ebm the cmcc ebm has been conceived to represent the estuarine processes coupled to a mesoscale resolving hydrodynamic model that resolves the entering flow field at the estuary mouth and it offers a new representation of the tidal inflow and a new salinity tidal mixing parameterization via horizontal diffusive processes the ofanto and po rivers flowing into the adriatic sea northern part of the central mediterranean sea are selected as case studies the coupling of the eddy resolving ocean model to the cmcc ebm is found to outperform the one with the uconn ncar ebm in the region of freshwater influence on the shelf areas keywords estuarine dynamics river plume dynamics river ocean interface estuary box model eddy resolving ocean model 1 introduction over the past decades several theoretical as well as modeling studies e g chapman and beardsley 1989 simpson et al 1993 kourafalou et al 1996 yankovsky and chapman 1997 kourafalou 1999 garvine 1999 schiller and kourafalou 2010 maccready and geyer 2010 among the others have highlighted that the freshwater discharge dominates the dynamics of the shelf areas adjacent to estuaries known as regions of freshwater influence rofis by producing a buoyant river plume which consists of an offshore bulge and a coastal alongshore current due to the geostrophic adjustment more recent studies e g garvine and whitney 2006 hordoir et al 2008 maccready et al 2009 maccready and geyer 2010 among others have examined the role played by the ocean salty waters intruding into the estuaries demonstrating that this intrusion drives the estuarine water exchange thus affecting the net estuarine outflow and salinity values the connection of the estuary stratification with the coastal dynamics has been investigated and the forcings that determine the shape and intensity of the buoyant plume have been identified the plume dynamics were found to be strongly tidal in the near field plume jirka et al 1981 which is the area immediately outside of the river mouth corresponding to the excursion length of the ebb tides winds also affect the river plume downwelling winds facilitate the homogenization of the water column and tend to turn the plume into an along shore current while upwelling winds promote the water stratification and offshore drift chao 1987 the role of wind stress is demonstrated to prevail over tides as the buoyant river inflow moves far from the outlet in the so named far field plume maccready et al 2009 previous studies have focused on the effects of the freshwater discharge on the shelf and coastal circulation and dynamics while fewer show their basin wide effects among them rahmstorf 1995 speculated that an increasing freshwater inflow in the northern atlantic is potentially able to reduce or even shut down the local overturning circulation skliris et al 2007 demonstrated that the salinity increase observed in the western mediterranean dense water during 1965 2005 can be explained by about 50 from the salinity increase of the levantine intermediate water due to damming of black sea and the nile river the remaining part is explained locally and due to the reduction of the ebro river runoff coles et al 2013 showed that the amazon river release has pathways into the western tropical and subtropical gyres of the north atlantic verri et al 2018 showed that river runoff affects the strength of the overturning circulation of the central mediterranean sea enhancing the amplitude of the secondary estuarine cells and reducing the intensity of the dominant anti estuarine cell rivers are also demonstrated to reduce the volume of adriatic dense water in the southern adriatic sea of about 20 as a result of increased water stratification moreover tseng et al 2016 and sun et al 2019 showed the impacts of different choices of freshwater inputs in an earth system climate model concluding that river salinity effects are important at basin scale the above mentioned studies indicate that global and regional ocean models require a good representation of the net freshwater release at river outlets global and regional ocean models cannot resolve the estuarine dynamics due to low resolutions that cannot reach the spatial scales of the estuarine geometry and processes recently the university of connecticut uconn and the national center for atmospheric research ncar have jointly developed a reduced order estuary box model ebm which interfaces the upstream river runoff with the ocean through a two layer box model which represents the estuarine dynamics sun et al 2017 in this paper we compare the uconn ncar ebm to a new estuary box model the so called cmcc ebm we developed at cmcc foundation euro mediterranean center on climate change to be coupled explicitly with an eddy resolving mesoscale ocean general circulation model as described below the latter offers a new representation of the volume and salt conservation equations for three main reasons 1 the cmcc ebm is conceived for coupling with regional eddy resolving models which are expected to represent the advective dynamics near the river mouths better than low resolution o 10 100 km climate models which have been used with the uconn ncar ebm 2 the mixing due to tidal processes is parameterized by a turbulent salt diffusion parameter 3 the tidal pumping enters both the volume and salt conservation equations through the flood tide inflow and the ebb tide outflow the latter is embedded in the unknown estuarine outflow to show the impact of the ebm volume flux and salinity values on the quality of an ocean simulation we applied the results of the ebms to a regional ocean model in the central mediterranean sea and in particular to two estuaries in this area the first is the highly stratified estuary of the ofanto river which flows through apulia in southern italy and ends in the southern adriatic sea the second is the partially mixed delta of the po river one of the main rivers in europe which discharges into the northern adriatic sea for the ofanto test case we compare an explicitly resolved estuary with the results of the two ebms for the po test case we compare with open and free access observations of opportunity this comparison is capable to differentiate among the two ebms and the climatological fixed salinity approach with respect to simulating the river discharge and its associated salinity the final aim was to show that ebm inputs can in fact improve the shelf salinity in the vicinity of estuaries with respect to climatological fixed salinity simulations the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the three estuarine models the method used to couple them to the regional ocean model is introduced in section 3 section 4 presents the selected case studies the results of both the estuarine dynamics and the coastal dynamics are discussed in sections 5 and 6 the summary and the conclusions are presented in section 7 2 the estuary box modelling the presented study is placed in the framework of developing a conceptual and numerical modelling approach to simulate the effects of rivers on the coastal circulation in eddy resolving general circulation models the km scale models cannot explicitly resolve the estuary dynamics thus the idea of an estuary box model which transforms freshwaters and river discharges into estuary mouth volume and salinity fluxes was developed by sun et al 2017 the concept is as follows at the river mouth stratification can be relevant and the discharge is different from the river runoff far upstream where the dynamics are driven by precipitation hydrology and river geometry the stratification and transport field at the estuary mouth can be approximated by two layer flow in several cases where the lower layer enters the estuary and the upper layer discharges into the coastal area the ebm gives the values of water volume flux and salinity at the river mouth which in turn affects the coastal ocean dynamics the precise analytical and numerical formulation of the boundary conditions in the ocean general circulation model are given in section 3 three approaches for representing the estuary dynamics are considered the simplest model is based on knudsen s relation knudsen 1900 the second on the uconn ncar ebm sun et al 2017 and the last on a new box model developed at cmcc and presented in this paper the cmcc ebm all the ebms assume that the estuary region is a two layer rectangular box with constant width l y depth h and length l x as shown in fig 1 the estuary head is considered as the last section along the river network moving in the downstream direction where the salinity is still equal to zero and the estuary length l x is set as the distance between the estuary head and the mouth the estuary width l y is the approximate estuary width or the width of the delta area if several mouths are present for the same upstream conditions the estuary depth h is chosen as a compromise between the river depth and the near mouth shelf bathymetry the cross sections at the estuary mouth and the estuary head are open all the models are laterally and along channel averaged steady state and tidally averaged the tidal cycle i e the lunar day includes both the flood tide and the ebb tide phases it is about 50 min longer than the solar day thus we approximate with the solar day in this study the average over the tidal cycle is fully consistent with the estuaries classified as highly stratified or partially mixed fischer et al 1979 in fact these estuaries maintain the stratification over the tidal cycle they may become unstable and mix only during the late ebb tide phase geyer and smith 1987 a different treatment will be required in the future to consider well mixed estuaries which might produce a destratified water column over the tidal cycle maccready and geyer 2010 the heat flux precipitation and wind stress are not considered at this stage although we know that their effects are relevant for some rivers chen and sanford 2009 scully et al 2005 schroeder and wiseman jr 1986 furthermore in this work we do not consider temperature effects because the estuary dynamics is to the first order dominated by salinity exchanges the knudsen s model the knudsen s relation consists of two conservation equations for the volume and salt fluxes under the assumptions of i a rigid lid and ii incompressible fluid the model sketch is drawn in the top panel of fig 1 we hereafter refer to this model as knudsen ebm the knudsen s relation considers the following physical processes the riverine water inflow at the estuary head the ocean water inflow through the lower layer at the estuary mouth and the estuarine water outflow through the upper layer the tidal effects and mixing processes are ignored in the equations the upper layer salinity is generated instantaneously by unresolved processes in order to balance the salt inflow in the lower layer the conservation equations for the volume flux m 3 s and the salinity averaged over the box and in time are as follows 1 q u l e b m q r i v e r q l l o c e a n 2 s u l e b m q u l e b m s l l o c e a n q l l o c e a n quantities in 1 and 2 are distinguished between inputs and unknowns the subscripts ll and ul stand for lower layer and upper layer respectively the volume flux and salinity of the outflowing estuarine water q u l e b m and s u l e b m are considered as unknowns while the q r i v e r the volume flux of the river inflow at the estuary head q l l o c e a n and s l l o c e a n the volume flux and salinity of the ocean water inflow through the lower layer at the estuary mouth are inputs eq 1 is obtained starting from the continuity equation with a rigid lid assumption and eq 2 is derived from the salinity equation under steady state conditions without considering diffusion the uconn ncar ebm the 2 layer steady state uconn ncar ebm sun et al 2017 is based on the concept of the potential energy anomaly proposed by garvine and whitney 2006 the model assumptions are i no surface layer forcing ii incompressibility and iii hydrostatic balance a sketch of the model is shown in the middle panel of fig 1 the physical processes described are the riverine water inflow at the estuary head the ocean water inflow through the lower layer at the estuary mouth the estuarine water outflow through the upper layer at the mouth the tidal pumping over a whole tidal cycle including the flood and the ebb tide the tidal mixing at the bottom and the shear mixing at the layer interface the model consists of four equations the continuity equation for the volume flux the salinity equation which includes a parametrization of the tidal pumping a potential energy pe equation and a linear equation of state for seawater the equations averaged over the tidal cycle are 3 q u l e b m q r i v e r q l l o c e a n 4 ρ u l e b m q u l e b m ρ l l o c e a n q l l o c e a n ρ 0 q r i v e r ρ l l o c e a n ρ u l e b m m t i d e s

represents the shear mixing term q u l t i d e s is the tidal volume flux that exits the upper layer during the ebb tide m t i d e s is the ratio between the areas of advected volumes during ebb or flood tide k s 7 7 1 0 4 psu 1 is the haline contraction coefficient garvine 1999 and ρ 0 1000 kg m 3 is the freshwater reference density using eq 6 the upper and lower layer densities are defined ρ u l e b m ρ 0 1 k s s u l e b m and ρ l l o c e a n ρ 0 1 k s s l l o c e a n the uconn ncar ebm formula for the average tidal volume flux during half a tidal cycle reads q u l t i d e q t i d e f o c e a n 2 u t i d e π l y h 2 with u t i d e a g h where a is the tidal amplitude the potential energy flux terms pef units of j s are detailed in sun et al 2017 and are not reproduced here the outflowing volume flux through the upper layer q u l e b m the salinity of outflowing water s u l e b m and the volume flux of the ocean water entering the lower layer q l l o c e a n are the unknowns for this model while the river volume flux at the estuary head q r i v e r and the salinity of inflowing ocean water through the lower layer s l l o c e a n are provided as inputs the tidal pumping effects are inserted in the last term of the rhs of eq 4 and the third term of the rhs of eq 5 the tidal mixing is included in the fourth term of the rhs of eq 5 and the shear mixing is represented in the last term of the rhs of eq 5 the detailed explanation of each of them can be found in sun et al 2017 here it is only important to recall that the flood tide is considered to enter the estuary through both layers while the ebb tide outflow involves the upper layer only simpson et al 1990 moreover the volume fluxes at the mouth during flood and ebb tides are also simplified as in stommel and farmer 1995 this means that there is no net volume flux due to tides in the continuity equation while ebb and flood tides have a specific effect in the salinity and pe equations because of the density differences between waters removed and introduced at ebb and flood times the assumption of a net tidal volume flux equal to zero is not necessarily true moreover the empirical formula used to represent the flood tide inflow and the ebb tide outflow generalize the ones proposed by stommel and farmer 1995 the flood tide inflow can vary from a semi ellipse to a semi circle form while the ebb tide outflow has a rectangular jet like form the coefficient m t i d e s in eq 4 comes out from this geometrical simplification and require a quite complex calibration these assumptions on the tidal pumping limit the performance of the model when applied to poorly monitored estuaries in addition present day tidal models such as the oregon state university tidal prediction software otps egbert and erofeeva 2002 used in this study to force the cmcc ebm resolve the tidal coastal dynamics up to few km a new representation of the flood tide inflow and the ebb tide outflow without any parameterization is then introduced in the cmcc ebm as described in the following section the cmcc ebm a new ebm is developed in this paper from the basic assumption that the lower layer salinity and volume inflow are specified by the eddy resolving ocean model near the coasts the barotropic volume inflow due to tides comes from the otps egbert and erofeeva 2002 barotropic model because the eddy resolving ocean model used here does not include tides the basic equations used are the continuity equation within the incompressible assumption and the salinity conservation equation as in the case of the uconn ncar ebm however we do not need a third equation for the potential energy as in the uconn ncar ebm because we have a total of two unknowns the upper layer volume flux and the upper layer salinity furthermore we add the tidal inflow in the continuity equation and in the salinity conservation equation and we parameterize the tidal mixing in the salinity equation in a different way of uconn ncar ebm the model sketch is drawn in the bottom panel of fig 1 the tidally averaged equations are as follows 7 q u l e b m q r i v e r q l l o c e a n h l y u t i d e f 8 s u l e b m q u l e b m s l l o c e a n q l l o c e a n s o c e a n h l y u t i d e f k s h h l y s o c e a n l x the inputs are the volume flux q l l o c e a n and salinity s l l o c e a n the depth averaged ocean salinity s o c e a n at the estuary mouth the tidal velocity normal to the estuary mouth u t i d e f and the river volume flux q r i v e r at the estuary head the volume flux q u l e b m and salinity s u l e b m of the outflowing estuarine water through the upper layer are the model unknowns we describe the ocean water inflow as a baroclinic bottom inflow second term on the rhs of eq 7 and first term on the rhs of eq 8 and a barotropic tidal inflow during the flood tide phase third term on the rhs of eq 7 and second term on the rhs of eq 8 we describe the tidal mixing by considering that the horizontal diffusion of salt along the estuary last terms on the rhs of eq 8 is driven by the tides we represent the river inflow at the estuary head as a volume flux first term on the rhs of eq 7 with zero salinity appendix a provides a comprehensive demonstration of the governing equations of the cmcc ebm unlike in the uconn ncar ebm the q l l o c e a n h 2 l y u l l o c e a n is treated as an input variable calculated from the daily ocean velocity provided by the eddy resolving ocean model u l l o c e a n considered to be positive if it is landward oriented and equal to zero if seaward oriented thus u l l o c e a n is the averaged horizontal velocity component in a box next to the river mouth as detailed in section 4 with regard to the tidal pumping we follow the theoretical approach proposed by simpson et al 1990 with a barotropic tidal inflow during the flood tide q t i d e f o c e a n h l y u t i d e f and a stratified outflow through the upper layer during the ebb tide as done in the uconn ncar ebm however we do not assume that the tidal pumping inflow outflow has the same amplitude thus there is a tidal pumping term in the continuity equation we also physically solve the tidal pumping with no empirical formula the full derivation is shown in appendix a and we provide the barotropic velocity corresponding to the flood tide u t i d e f while the outgoing tidal velocity during the ebb tide is embedded in the unknown estuarine water outflow q u l e b m the u t i d e f is computed from the hourly outputs of the otps egbert and erofeeva 2002 considered as flood tide values if landward oriented and averaged daily the flood tide volume flux is thus given by q t i d e f o c e a n h l y u t i d e f the horizontal mixing coefficient for salt is computed following banas et al 2004 k s h 0 035 l y u t i d e f it is worth to point out again that the cmcc ebm receives as input the lower layer transport from the mesoscale resolving general circulation model thus it does not need a third conservation equation to solve for the lower layer volume inflow in cmcc ebm only four parameters the geometry coefficients l y l x h and the turbulent diffusion coefficient k s h need to be calibrated 3 coupling the estuary box model with an eddy resolving regional ocean model fig 2 shows the computational domain of the regional ocean model verri et al 2018 used in this study based on the three dimensional finite difference code nemo v3 4 madec 2008 the model grid covers the central mediterranean sea with a horizontal resolution of about 2 2 km 2 5 km in the meridional direction and 1 7 2 2 km in the zonal direction the vertical discretization consists of 121 unevenly spaced z levels with increased resolution at the top and the bottom and partial cells at the bottom the eddy resolving regional model is one way nested in a 1 16 resolution 72 levels numerical ocean analysis and forecasting model of the mediterranean sea oddo et al 2009 the robustness of this model has been demonstrated in verri et al 2018 who provide an interannual comparison with in situ and satellite observations in the open sea verri et al 2018 follow oddo et al 2005 approach where the runoff salinity is taken to have ad hoc values based upon heuristic reasoning in this paper we remove the ad hoc assumptions about the salinity at the river mouth as the rivers are not explicitly represented as lateral open boundary conditions due to the coarse resolution of the eddy resolving regional ocean model the riverine inputs of volume and salinity are treated as boundary conditions for the vertical velocity and the vertical diffusive salinity flux at the sea surface beron vera et al 1999 tseng et al 2016 a detailed explanation of the formulation used by nemo for the riverine release as surface boundary conditions is provided in appendix b given the upper layer volume outflow q u l e b m and the upper layer salinity s u l e b m both computed by the ebms the surface boundary conditions for the vertical velocity and the diffusive salt flux are written as 9 w z η η t u h z η h η e p q u l e b m a 10 k v s z z η e p s η q u l e b m a s u l e b m where w z η is the vertical velocity at the sea surface η is the sea surface elevation u h is the horizontal velocity at the sea surface e is the evaporation rate units of m s p is the precipitation rate units of m s a is the horizontal area of the sea grid cell corresponding to the river mouth and k v is the vertical diffusivity coefficient the s u l e b m and the q u l e b m are prescribed at river mouth grid points which approximate the river mouth positions 4 case studies the ofanto river highly stratified estuary we chose the funnel shaped estuary of the ofanto river as our first case study this semi perennial river flows through southern italy and ends in the southern adriatic sea fig 2 and top panel fig 3 the mean annual runoff is 14 92 m 3 s 1 raicich 1996 and the mean annual tidal amplitude recorded at the tidal gauge closest to the river mouth is 0 04 m guarnieri et al 2013 we performed several experiments using the three ebms with river runoff q r i v e r from a simulation performed with the wrf hydro model verri et al 2017 as no observations were available at the estuary head the period of interest chosen was january march 2011 which was characterized by a high river discharge and two flooding events bottom panel of fig 3 in order to characterize the stratification of the ofanto river we estimated the flow ratio parameter f fischer et al 1979 for the period of simulation 11 f u t i d e f u r i v e r 0 02 where u t i d e f is the averaged flood tide velocity computed by the otps system and u r i v e r is the mean river streamflow modelled at the estuary head values of f less than 0 1 are classified as highly stratified thus the ofanto estuary is a sharply stratified estuary the geometrical parameters of the ofanto estuary are the estuary width l y 25 m the estuary depth h 5 m and the estuary length l x 1 km which are kept equal for all the three ebms the estuary length l x complies with the results of a monitoring campaign that estimated the length of the salt intrusion to be about 1 km upstream of the ofanto mouth personal communication of the water research institute of the national research council cnr irsa the uconn ncar ebm requires additional parameters we extracted the tidal period t and the tidal amplitude a t i d e from guarnieri et al 2013 while the bottom drag coefficient c d the tidal mixing efficiency ϵ the shear mixing efficiency γ and the entrainment constant at the layer interface α are the values used in the literature sun et al 2017 the salt and volume of the inflowing ocean water i e s l l o c e a n and q l l o c e a n are computed as volume weighted averages of the ocean model grid points three by three grid points in the horizontal and three vertical grid levels from the bottom surrounding the approximate position of the ofanto river mouth in detail the mesoscale general circulation model considers a minimum depth at the coasts of 5 meters and it considers six levels for this depth the lowest three model levels are inside the lower layer of the ebm model i e from 2 5 m to 5 m depth two additional fields are required by the cmcc ebm i e the flood tide velocity u t i d e f and the depth averaged ocean salinity s o c e a n the former is provided by the otps system as described in section 2 the latter is a spatially weighted average covering all the vertical levels in a three by three grid point area an overview of the ebms settings for the ofanto estuary case is provided in table 1 the po river partially mixed delta the second case study is the delta shaped estuary of the po river this is the main freshwater source of the central mediterranean sea and the second in the whole mediterranean basin the mean annual runoff is 1492 m 3 s 1 ludwig et al 2009 and the mean annual tidal amplitude recorded at the tidal gauge closest to the river mouth is 0 09 m guarnieri et al 2013 near the mouth the river network creates a wide delta with hundreds of small channels and nine main branches the map of the river delta is given in fig 4 a set of experiments to represent both the estuarine dynamics and the rofi dynamics of the po river were performed from january to june 2009 this period was chosen according to the observation availability close to the river mouths the estuary head runoff q r i v e r is provided by the observations at the pontelagoscuro station this time range includes a major flood event on may 2nd with a recorded runoff exceeding 8000 m 3 s fig 4 fischer s flow ratio 11 for the po river is 0 43 this means that the po estuary is a partially mixed estuary the tidal flow is comparable with the river flow and the induced vertical mixing smooths the salinity gradient although the stratification of the exchange flow persists over a whole tidal cycle the representation of the estuarine dynamics as a two layer exchange flow is therefore still reasonable we considered the inflowing tidal velocity at the river mouth u t i d e f as given by otps and the river streamflow velocity at the estuary head u r i v e r as provided by pontelagoscuro station given the relatively coarse resolution of our ocean model it is not really possible to distinguish u l l o c e a n affecting one mouth with respect to the other thus we decided to take a box model for all the po river mouths together in the future if the resolution of the regional model will increase u l l o c e a n will be different at different po river branches and different ebms could be applied to each of them the simplified set up of the po delta consists of an estuary box with length l x 20 km width l y 20 km and depth h 5 m the estuary length l x complies with the results of a monitoring campaign that estimated the length of the salt intrusion to be about 20 km upstream of po di dritta mouth i e the easternmost mouth at the delta personal communication of the regional agency for the environmental protection arpae the estuary width l y is taken as a combined width of all of the po mouths the estuary depth h is calculated as the bathymetry of the surrounding sea cells of our eddy resolving regional ocean model regarding the uconn ncar ebm the tidal coefficients i e the tidal period t and the tidal amplitude a t i d e are based on observations following guarnieri et al 2013 the other coefficients follow the reference values given by sun et al 2017 as in the ofanto river case the salt and volume flux of the inflowing ocean water s l l o c e a n and q l l o c e a n are computed as volume weighted averages for the lowest 3 vertical levels of the ocean model and a three by three grid point area around the mouth of po di dritta the additional fields required by the cmcc ebm i e the flood tide velocity u t i d e f and the depth averaged ocean salinity s o c e a n are computed as with the ofanto river the upper layer volume flux from the ebm q u l e b m is distributed among the delta mouths following the percentages in provini et al 1992 which correspond to different grid points in the ocean model an overview of the ebms settings for the po delta case is provided in table 1 5 salinity and volume flux estimates from the ebms in this section the experiments performed with the three ebms are compared and evaluated for the ofanto and po river study cases table 2 summarizes the order of magnitude of the volume fluxes entering the estuary box the cmcc ebm shows the largest ocean water intrusion for the ofanto and po rivers due to the calculation of q l l o c e a n from the ocean model velocities for the q t i d e f o c e a n differences are evident only for the ofanto fig 5 shows the salinity top panel and volume flux bottom panel of the outflowing estuarine waters for the ofanto similarly fig 6 refers to the po in all the panels of figs 5 and 6 the green line time series show the salinity and the volume flux used in verri et al 2018 to force the eddy resolving regional ocean model at the river mouths the water volume fluxes are monthly climatologies for the ofanto river raicich 1996 and daily means observed at pontelagoscuro station for the po river the salinity values are taken to be constant i e 15 psu for the ofanto and 17 psu for the po river we call both the salinity and volume fluxes from verri et al 2018 climatological estimates the salinity computed by knudsen s ebm blue lines in the top panels of figs 5 and 6 often drops to zero over several days for both case studies this is an unreasonable result and reveals the major weakness in knudsen s model which does not include tidal effects the outflowing water salinity is equal to the zero salinity values at the estuary head if there is no lower layer inflow of salty waters from the ocean for the ofanto fig 5 there are no significant differences between uconn and cmcc ebms in both discharge and outflowing salinity except for a few days to note that the discharge time series of knudsen and cmcc ebm are nearly overlapped as the tidal volume flux is not relevant for this case study moreover the discharge time series of uconn ncar ebm almost overlaps the inflowing volume flux at the estuary head the orange line this is due to the fact that the lower layer ocean volume inflow and the tidal volume flux are both found to be small in uconn ncar ebm see table 2 on the other hand the uconn ncar ebm shows a relevant role of the tidal pumping parameterization which ensures the outflowing salinity is not far from the cmcc ebm one despite the orders of magnitude difference in the ocean volume inflows for the po fig 6 uconn ncar and cmcc ebms radically differ in terms of both salinity and discharge a higher salinity and volume flux of the outflowing estuarine water was simulated by the cmcc ebm the cmcc ebm shows a stronger intrusion of the salty waters at the bottom of the estuary mouth as shown in table 2 moreover the two models solve the tidal pumping and the tidal mixing processes in different ways which become particularly evident in the po as this is a partially mixed estuary with strong tidal effects the additional comparison with the observed salinity black timeseries in fig 6 shows that the cmcc ebm outperforms the other models to note that the observations refer to a gauge station located close to the po di goro outlet fig 4 but in a secondary channel starting from the definition of the gradient richardson number r i n 2 d u d z 2 g ρ 0 d ρ d z d u d z 2 the time series of r i has been computed as follows r i e b m g ρ 0 d ρ d z d u d z 2 g k s ρ 0 s l l o c e a n s u l e b m h 2 u l l o c e a n 2 u t i d e f u u l e b m h 2 2 with the assumption that the density is a linear function of the salinity and k s 7 7 1 0 4 psu 1 the time series of r i e b m in fig 7 shows that in both the po and ofanto uconn ncar ebm reaches higher values than cmcc ebm thus suggesting that turbulent mixing across the stratification is weaker in uconn ncar than in the cmcc ebm 6 effects of the different ebms on the rofi the river volume fluxes and salinities computed by uconn ncar and cmcc ebm were imposed in two simulations of our eddy resolving regional ocean model one focused on the ofanto rofi area and the other in the po rofi in both cases the model covers the whole area depicted in fig 2 however the timing of the experiments is different as explained in the previous section for the ofanto rofi four experiments were carried out a climatological experiment based on the ocean model forced at river mouths by climatological runoff and a constant salinity of 15 psu two other experiments were performed by coupling the ocean model with the cmcc ebm and the uconn ncar ebm volume and salinity fluxes fig 5 a fourth experiment referred to as the explicit estuary was performed with the eddy resolving regional ocean model by modifying the model coastline to include 10 km inlet simulating the ofanto estuary this explicit estuary experiment is forced at the inlet head with the runoff computed by the hydrological modelling system described by verri et al 2017 and with salinity equal to zero this experiment is a coarse representation of the ofanto estuary geometry and it allows for the salt intrusion to occur due to the physics of the eddy resolving model it is indeed a coarsely resolved estuary the horizontal model resolution is around 2 km but it contains 6 vertical levels where the salt intrusion can develop thus it is considered our control or most realistic scenario for the ofanto estuary to be used for comparison with the other three experiments because no observational data were available in the rofi area fig 8 shows the daily sea surface salinity in the ofanto rofi during an upwelling wind regime for the western coast of the adriatic basin which promotes the development of the ofanto plume the coupled ebms and ocean models represent a well defined river plume are close to the benchmark experiment and outperform the climatological experiment which is unable to reproduce the plume moreover the estimate of the q l l o c e a n from the explicit estuary experiment has been computed table 2 it shows the same order of magnitude of the cmcc ebm one not uconn ncar for the po rofi three experiments were carried out a climatological experiment with the eddy resolving regional ocean model forced by the pontelagoscuro runoff and a constant salinity of 17 psu and two experiments with the ocean model forced by the outflowing salinity and volume outflow computed by the cmcc and uconn ncar ebms fig 6 fig 9 shows the daily sea surface salinity during an upwelling wind event which supports the offshore spreading of the po plume the experiments performed by coupling the ebms with the eddy resolving regional ocean model represent a well defined plume while the climatological approach shows a much weaker development the validity of the model was evaluated by comparing the modelled salinity with the observed salinity at two buoys maintained by the institute of marine sciences ismar and the emilia romagna environmental protection agency arpae the arpae buoy is located 7 km offshore of the po di goro mouth at a 1 m depth the ismar buoy ravaioli et al 2016 is 5 km offshore at a 1 7 m depth the buoys are indicated in the top panel of fig 4 and in the middle panel of fig 9 the time series in figs 10 and 11 show the comparisons the coupled system with cmcc ebm was found to provide the lowest root mean square errors as reported in tables 3 and 4 conversely the climatological experiment gave the largest errors at the ismar buoy the salinity skill of uconn ncar ebm was similar to cmcc ebm however for the arpae buoy the cmcc ebm was better in order to understand some of the discrepancies between the model and the observations shown in fig 10 we modified the vertical mixing parametrization near the river mouth the development of river plumes is due to the outflowing river runoff and salinity and to a combination of wind forcing tidal forcing coriolis effect and vertical mixing next to the river mouth kourafalou 1999 in order to show the sensitivity of the po plume to the vertical mixing in the rofi area we produced a specific analysis around may 2nd when both ebms failed to reproduce a correct value for the salinity in the plume with respect to the observed value fig 10 the vertical mixing at the river mouth was increased for the cmcc ebm case an additional vertical eddy mixing coefficient is prescribed and in fig 12 we show the new time series which better reproduces the salinity for may 2nd with respect to the observed value the lesson learned is that if we want to reproduce properly the river plume dynamics at least specific parametrizations of vertical mixing are required especially during large runoff events 7 summary and conclusions the aim of this study was the development of proper interfaces between mesoscale eddy resolving models and estuaries in order to simulate the rofi dynamics sun et al 2017 have already shown the importance of using an estuary box model ebm to estimate outflowing salinities in this study we presented a new ebm and we compared it with sun et al 2017 we have proposed three different approaches for representing the estuarine dynamics the knudsen relations model the uconn ncar ebm and our new model called cmcc ebm the first two are a benchmark for representing the estuarine dynamics and we use them as the starting point of our investigation the cmcc ebm aims at representing the estuarine processes in a different way than the uconn ncar ebm because it is developed for coupling with an eddy resolving ocean numerical model which could resolve the subsurface flow input to the estuary furthermore tidal volume flux contributes to the volume conservation equation and tidal mixing is parameterized in a different way to allow for partially mixed estuaries to be modelled we tested the coupling of the different ebms with an eddy resolving regional ocean model covering the adriatic sea and for two different river dominated shelf areas the highly stratified estuary of the ofanto river and the partially mixed delta of the po river the experiments prove that i knudsen s relation is a too simple approach ii the cmcc ebm results are close to the uconn ncar ebm for the ofanto but differ for the po where tides play a more significant role the two ebms are based on a different set of equations and one of the most important differences is the representation of the tidal effects in terms of both tidal pumping and tidal mixing processes one of the strengths of the cmcc ebm is that it includes only 4 tunable parameters less than in uconn ncar which is desirable as most estuaries are poorly monitored the coupled ebm and ocean model experiments show how the coastal dynamics are affected by the volume outflow q u l e b m and outflowing salinity s u l e b m estimated by the ebms they prove that i the cmcc ebm and uconn ncar ebm coupled to a regional eddy resolving model are capable of reconstructing river plumes and they both outperform the climatological approach ii the cmcc ebm coupled system shows the lowest statistical errors compared to the observed salinity at two buoys located off the mouths of the po these findings encourage us to use the ebms as main forcing submodels in shelf areas instead of the classical climatological imposition of an ad hoc salinity value overall we conclude that modelling the estuarine dynamics as a 2 layer exchange flow with tidally averaged conservation equations is a relatively good representation of the exchange flow at the river mouth the results of the ebms could thus be used to appropriately force global regional ocean models on a daily scale however a weakness of all the ebms discussed is the assumed steady estuarine dynamics the reconstruction of the intrusion of the salt wedge in short temporal scales or the prediction of extreme events e g the blocking effect in both directions due to storm surges or river flooding and the mascaret occurring during the flood tide phase requires a more sophisticated unsteady dynamics box model or the direct modeling of the river estuary to further develop the estuarine box approach the next step would be to consider the estuary length as a time varying function of the river discharge and the tidal mixing we plan to evaluate the role of the heat flux in the estuary water exchange by adding a temperature equation in the cmcc ebm and the wind forcing finally the near mouth mixing processes as currently parameterized by the ocean eddy resolving model deserve a dedicated study in order to get the maximum benefit from the coupled ebm and ocean model system credit authorship contribution statement giorgia verri conceptualization methodology

field pointing outward the surface s bounding the estuary volume in the box model the sections at the estuary mouth and head are the only open lateral boundaries as shown in fig a 1 we assume the estuarine box to have equal layer thicknesses between the surface and h depth furthermore we assume that the river inflow occurs only in the upper layer at the head section thus 13 becomes h 2 h d y u

considered as flood tide values if landward oriented and daily averaged the outgoing tidal velocity during the ebb tide is embedded into the unknown estuarine water outflow q u l e b m thus it does not appear explicitly in the equations eq 14 is the final volume conservation equation for the cmcc ebm together with the definitions 15 16 17 and 18 the salinity equation considered at steady state is written 19 u s k s x 2 s x 2 k s y 2 s y 2 k s z 2 s z 2 where k s x k s y and k s z are the horizontal and vertical diffusivity coefficients respectively the volume integral of 19 reads 20 v u s d v v k s x 2 s x 2 d v the across estuary and vertical diffusive salt flux does not appear explicitly in the volume averaged salinity equation as a result of the insulated boundaries at the surface bottom and side walls we assume that the along estuary diffusion of salinity is driven by the barotropic tidal inflow thus the volume integral of 20 reduces to 21 ω u s n ˆ d ω l y h x 0 x l x k s x 2

upstream river freshwaters and the marine waters entering the estuary as computed by the box models of this paper the surface salinity values at the river mouth are then different from the values in areas just offshore the river mouth in a lateral open boundary condition framework rivers have a net dilution effect because the entering surface waters have lower salinities than in the offshore in a

23977,in this study we investigated the short term dynamics of upwelling off the west coast of hainan island uwh by combining moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis infrared sea surface temperature sst images and regional ocean modeling system roms simulations modis observations showed that the uwh could exhibit rapid temporal variations where the sst could increase or decrease by more than 1 c within 3 h further investigations based on roms simulations suggested that flood tides could rapidly intensify the uwh whereas ebb tides could rapidly weaken the uwh strong horizontal advection by intense tidal currents and high vertical velocity due to divergence convergence triggered by progressive tidal waves were identified as the intrinsic physical mechanisms responsible for the rapid sst variations in the uwh these findings were verified based on a modis observed fast cooling uwh event and a modis observed fast warming uwh event analyses of the timing of occurrence tidal phase and spatial patterns of the significant variations in the sst for these events all agreed with the hypothesis stated above model data fusion analysis indicated that when a neap tide or transition period for tidal currents occurs the influence of the tidal flow on the uwh is weak because of the associated weak horizontal advection and divergence convergence keywords hainan island

producers to benefit the growth of fish strong coastal upwelling systems are usually hot spots for fisheries e g the peru upwelling pauly and christensen 1995 as a vital component of the nearshore current system and a key mechanism responsible for the transport of various substances coastal upwelling significantly affects the physicochemical environment ianson et al 2009 neumann et al 2016

attracted extensive attention in general ekman transport forced by wind stress and ekman pumping due to wind stress curl are recognized as the dominant drivers of most coastal upwelling systems e g castelao and barth 2006 jing et al 2009 albert et al 2010 however topography can significantly modify the coastal upwelling dynamics song et al 2001 demonstrated that variable alongshore bathymetry facilitates the development of upwelling centers along the coast by enhancing attenuating upwelling on the downslope upslope sides of topographic highs the uneven upwelling distribution induced by the topography then leads to a horizontal pressure gradient which drives the meandering currents to modulate the upwelling structure song and chao 2004 numerical investigations by chen et al 2013 suggested that a steeper shelf slope corresponds to a narrower cross shore width for the surface ekman divergence as well as greater vertical velocity in addition changes in the relative vorticity due to the existence of a headland or a canyon dominate the vertical motion nearby to modulate the local upwelling intensity chen et al 2014 in addition to the wind driven mechanism the combined effect of topography and currents can also trigger coastal upwelling under certain conditions e g lee et al 1999 allen and hickey 2010 in coastal zones wave mixing or tide mixing can promote the uplift of lower layer cold waters to enhance the upwelling intensity wang et al 2015 when a river discharges into an upwelling zone the water column will be stabilized by the freshwater which then suppresses the growth of upwelling hickey et al 2005 wang et al 2015 moreover coastal upwelling supplies a cold bottom boundary layer to the local atmosphere which enhances the land sea temperature gradient and adjusts the sea breeze circulation and thus the upwelling varies with the changing winds thereby resulting in feedback franchito et al 2008 alves et al 2018 in the boreal summer coastal upwellings that develop off the east and west coasts of hainan island are among the most distinctive hydrodynamic phenomena found in the northwestern south china sea scs fig 1a to the north of hainan island a deep narrow channel with an intense tidal flow shi et al 2002 called the qiongzhou strait separates the island from the chinese mainland to the west the beibu gulf is a semi enclosed bay adjacent to the central basin of the scs a broad continental shelf of the scs is present off the east coast of hainan island with a depth less than 200 m and isobaths approximately parallel to the coastline fig 1a as shown in fig 1a two upwelling zones are found around the coasts of hainan island the upwelling off the east coast of hainan island ueh and the upwelling off the west coast of hainan island uwh the ueh has received extensive attention in previous investigations which demonstrated that the ueh is primarily a wind driven phenomenon and it is also modulated by topography river runoff tides wave

2016a b the prevailing southerly winds lead to shoreward ekman transport off the west coast of hainan island thereby resulting in downwelling however remarkable upwelling also occurs according to both the sea surface temperature sst fig 1a and the observed vertical temperature structure fig 1b i e the uwh lü et al 2008 proposed that the uwh is tidally driven and fig 1c shows a schematic illustration of this upwelling during the summer a strong tidal mixing front is established because of the intense tidal currents off the west coast of hainan island hu et al 2003 the entire water column to the right of the front is filled with well mixed warm water whereas stratification still exists on the left side therefore a density difference exists across the tidal mixing front which then generates a pressure gradient force due to the topography slope the pressure gradient force drives an upward motion and the uwh finally develops the southerly winds have an inhibitory effect on the development of the uwh but they are not sufficiently strong to suppress the uwh completely wang et al 2015 and bai et al 2019 also provided support for this theory regarding the development of the uwh and suggested that wave mixing might play a sensitive role in this upwelling system despite these studies the short term dynamics of the uwh remain unknown because previous investigations focused mainly on its mean state characteristics thus in order to explore the short term dynamics of the uwh we conducted a data model fusion investigation based mainly on satellite remote sensing data and simulations of the regional ocean modeling system roms the fast changing feature of the uwh and the associated physical mechanisms were clarified in detail in this study the remainder of this article is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the data and tools employed in sections 3 4 5 and 6 we present the evidence simulations mechanisms and a discussion of the fast changing feature respectively finally we give our conclusions in section 7 2 data and tools 2 1 satellite observed sst moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sst data http oceancolor gsfc nasa gov were used to capture and analyze uwh events the terra and aqua satellites are both equipped with modis and the minimum interval between their transit times over uwh events is approximately 3 h which was suitable for determining the short term dynamics of the uwh to better capture the detailed structure of the uwh we used modis level 2 sst data with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km modis cannot operate in the presence of heavy clouds so we examined modis infrared sst images taken over the northwestern scs during june to august 2001 2017 and selected the images with high quality observations furthermore we excluded sst data with low retrieval quality flags data with qual sst 1 were removed to ensure the reliability of the analysis in addition we also used modis level 3 monthly averaged sst data to determine the climatological pattern for the uwh as presented in fig 1a 2 2 era interim winds we used the 3 h era interim winds data set http apps ecmwf int datasets to capture the wind pattern that accompanied the sst results sensed by aqua or terra the era interim data set is a global atmospheric reanalysis data set produced by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf dee et al 2011 and this product has been used extensively because of its good quality this product was also used to analyze the climatological summer monsoon over the northwestern scs fig 1a 2 3 tide model driver to efficiently hindcast the sea surface elevation and tidal currents we used the tide model driver tmd package supplied by oregon state university egbert and erofeeva 2002 the regional tidal solutions for the china seas model ind 2016 with a spatial resolution of 1 30 were utilized with the tmd toolbox both the tmd toolbox and tidal solutions used in this study are available from http volkov oce orst edu tides 3 evidence of fast changing uwh based on modis infrared sst images 3 1 normal diurnal variations in sst in the beibu gulf due to the significant variations in daytime nighttime surface solar radiation the diurnal cycle is one of the most important components of the variability of the sst gentemann et al 2003 kennedy et al 2007 figs 2a 2c present the 25 h sst variations at stations 6215 6238 and 6252 locations in fig 1a based on observations acquired by the general oceanographic survey of china during the summer of 1960 figs 2a 2c illustrate the typical diurnal cycle of the sst in the central beibu gulf during the summer in particular the sst started to increase at 6 00 9 00 when the ocean began to receive sunlight and as more solar radiation was absorbed the sst reached a peak at 16 00 17 00 before then decreasing into the evening and the night until a new cycle started figs 2d 2e show successive sst images acquired by modis on terra at 3 35 utc and aqua at 6 40 utc on june 2 2016 respectively the differences in the sst sst a q u a sst t e r r a between these two observations are presented in fig 2f as shown in fig 2f the seas off the west coast of hainan island warmed up during the local daytime which was consistent with the diurnal variation in the sst furthermore figs 2g and 2h show successive sst images captured by modis on terra at 15 35 utc and aqua at 18 20 utc on june 29 2015 during local nighttime respectively and their differences are shown in fig 2i the seas had just cooled down fig 2i which also agreed well with the diurnal variations in the sst however the modis infrared sst images suggested that the variations in the sst in the uwh disrupted the normal diurnal variations in some situations as described in the following 3 2 fast changing uwh observed by modis sst figs 3a 3b and 3c show successive infrared sst images captured by modis on terra at 3 00 utc and aqua at 6 10 utc on july 4 2011 and their differences respectively figs 3a 3c clearly indicate that the uwh intensified significantly within 3 h and that the sst decreased by more than 1 c these results contrast with the diurnal sst variations in the beibu gulf as discussed in section 3 1 the corresponding local times utc 8 for these two sst observations were 11 00 and 14 10 when the solar radiation should have increased the sst during this period another example is illustrated in figs 3d 3e and 3f which show successive sst images captured by modis on terra at 15 20 and on aqua at 18 05 utc on july 16 2003 and their differences respectively remarkably figs 3d 3f indicate that a fast warming uwh event increased by more than 1 c within 3 h occurred during the local nighttime when the ocean lost heat to the atmosphere and the sst should have decreased hence fig 3 demonstrates that the uwh could exhibit fast cooling as well as fast warming i e the uwh could change rapidly figs 3a and 3b also show the era interim winds at the nearest moments associated with the sst images where they suggest that minor changes occurred in the winds during the fast cooling uwh event similarly the era interim wind vectors shown in figs 3d and 3e indicate that a quasi constant wind field accompanied the fast warming uwh event previous investigations proposed that the response time for upwelling to changing winds occurs on a scale of several days gu et al 2012 chen et al 2013 moreover the fast cooling and fast warming uwh events both contradicted the normal diurnal variations in the sst therefore air sea heat exchange or winds did not trigger these fast changing uwh events 4 modeling the fast changing uwh 4 1 model configuration the modis sst images were not sufficient to determine the three dimensional 3 d structure of the fast changing uwh thus in order to better determine the intrinsic physics of this phenomenon we used the roms model shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 to simulate the 3 d dynamics of the uwh the rectangular model grid extended from 105 5 e to 113 5 e in the zonal direction and from 15 n to 23 n in the meridional direction horizontally the model had a resolution of 4 km in the vertical direction we applied a 20 level stretched terrain following coordinate moreover theta s and theta b were set to 5 0 and 0 4 respectively to enhance the resolution near the surface and the bed the topography originated from hybrid data based on the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco provided by the british oceanographic data centre bodc https www bodc ac uk and a local electronic navigation chart two model runs were executed to explore the short term dynamics of the uwh baroclinic and barotropic cases for the baroclinic model the boundary and initial conditions were both interpolated from the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom database https www hycom org dataserver tidal harmonic constants of 10 tidal constituents m 2 s 2 n 2 k 2 k 1 o 1 p 1 q 1 m f and m m derived from the tpxo7 product egbert and erofeeva 2002 were also added to the open boundaries as tidal forcing the comprehensive ocean atmosphere data set coads05 da silva et al 1994 was used to generate the monthly mean surface heat and freshwater fluxes for the baroclinic model most importantly we imposed a constant northward wind force of 0 035 n m2 over the sea surface this design was mainly based on the climatological wind pattern shown in fig 1a and the fact that winds should play a weak role in the fast changing uwh as explained in section 3 2 which also simplified the discussion the baroclinic time step was set to 120 s with a model splitting ratio of 30 and the data output frequency was every 3 h we examined the performance of the baroclinic model at modeling the uwh not shown after comparing the results produced by the baroclinic model with those reported by lü et al 2008 and wang et al 2015 we confirmed that the baroclinic model reliably simulated the 3 d dynamic structure of the uwh the barotropic model shared the same tidal forcing and integration setups as the baroclinic model but the salinity and temperature were kept constant throughout the integration the baroclinic run and barotropic run both lasted for 120 days from their initialization and we only used the outputs for the last 30 days when the model was stable 4 2 tidally induced fast changing uwh diurnal tidal signals are dominant in the beibu gulf minh et al 2014 figs 4a 4i show the evolution of the sst and sea surface currents during an entire tidal period based on the baroclinic model according to the simulation the intensity of the uwh changed remarkably and rapidly where it intensified during flood tides and weakened under ebb tidal flows fig 4j shows a time series of the sst along section ab marked in fig 4a which clearly indicates the presence of a fast changing uwh as well as suggesting that the fast changing feature occurred during the representative tidal period as shown in figs 4a 4i and that it was also a recurrent phenomenon fig 4 suggests that the fast changing uwh is closely associated with the local tidal phase moreover the baroclinic model was run under the force of constant winds and monthly averaged heat fluxes and thus fig 4 strongly suggests that the fast changing feature of the uwh is tidally induced 5 mechanism responsible for the fast changing uwh 5 1 vertical structure of uwh the fast changing surface structure of the uwh suggests that a corresponding 3 d dynamic adjustment occurs in the entire water column we defined period t9 6 h t9 12 h shown in fig 4 as the flood tides and t9 18 h t9 24 h as the ebb tides based on the baroclinic model we examined the vertical distribution of the temperature and u w vectors along section ab fig 4a during flood tides fig 5a and ebb tides fig 5b the differences in w and temperature between the flood tides and the entire tidal period t9 t9 24 h are shown in fig 5c and the ebb tides and the entire tidal period are compared in fig 5d during the flood tides the vertical velocity in the uwh was remarkably intensified with an enhancement of approximately 1 1 0 4 m s and thus the sst in the uwh zone decreased by approximately 1 c fig 5c during the ebb tides the vertical velocity exhibited an abnormal downward pattern fig 5b which constrained the intensity of the uwh compared with the average vertical velocity during the entire tidal period the vertical velocity decreased by approximately 1 1 0 4 m s in the uwh under the ebb tidal flow thereby leading to an increase of 1 c in the sst fig 5d as noted in section 1 the tidal mixing front is established by intense tidal currents over the western coastal seas of hainan island and the density difference across the tidal mixing front then drives the upward motion with the help of the topographic slope lü et al 2008 however fig 5b suggests that some mechanism must have competed with the pressure gradient force originating from the density difference and triggered a downward motion in uwh the u w vectors along section ab produced by the barotropic model are shown in figs 5e and 5f for the same periods as those shown in figs 5a and 5b respectively figs 5e and 5f indicate that tides led to an upward motion in the entire water column during the flood tides and a downward motion during the ebb tides therefore this effect should account for or partly explain the intensified and suppressed upwellings shown in figs 5a and 5b respectively however how can tides significantly affect the vertical motion throughout the entire water column 5 2 progressive tidal wave induced convergence and divergence based on the barotropic experiment fig 6a shows the depth averaged horizontal flood tidal flow and its divergence field which is defined as div v h v h x y u v u x v y where v h u v is the horizontal velocity vector and x y is the two dimensional differential operator fig 6a suggests that the progressive tidal wave could trigger a divergence convergence train off the west coast of hainan island and the location nearly overlapped with the uwh strong divergence convergence of the horizontal currents led to a high upward downward vertical velocity in the entire water column as shown in fig 6c which is also illustrated in figs 5e and 5f the conditions were similar during the ebb tides but the opposite of those during the flood tides as suggested in figs 6a 6d furthermore we examined the depth averaged horizontal currents the divergence field and the depth mean vertical velocity for the baroclinic case during flood and ebb tides where the results are shown in figs 6e 6h respectively the results differed for the baroclinic case and the barotropic case because of the introduction of baroclinic effects but the divergence convergence train induced by tidal waves still existed and it induced strong upward downward motion as shown in figs 6c 6d 6g and 6h the flood tides had a positive effect on upward motion rather than downward motion because the former had a stronger intensity and covered a broader area i e the flood tides promoted the uwh by contrast the ebb tides had an inhibitory effect 5 3 horizontal advection by tidal currents the long band shaped uwh stretches from the southwest coast to the northwest coast of hainan island figs 1 3 and 4 this band connects with cold waters toward the southern end of the uwh region because of upwelling off the southwest coast of hainan island li et al 2018 whereas warm gulf waters exist toward the northern end of the uwh figs 1a and 4a 4i this difference is also illustrated in figs 6i and 6j which show the temperatures along section cd fig 6c during the flood and ebb tides section cd was specified to cross the central axis of the divergence convergence train also the uwh region given the intense tidal currents during both the flood tides and the ebb tides the flood tidal currents northward could transport the southern cold waters toward the uwh region thereby helping to enhance the uwh it should be noted that a topographic slope is present at the 18 4 18 6 n segment of section cd and this slope helps to elevate the cold water carried by the flow when the flood tidal currents pass thereby enhancing the uwh under ebb tidal currents this process transports the northern warm waters southwardly to the uwh area thereby suppressing the uwh 5 4 temperature diagnosis to further understand this fast changing uwh we diagnosed the temperature dynamics of the uwh based on the heat budget equation 1 t t rate u t x v t y hadv w t z vadv z k t t z

seawater and h is the water depth the time rate of change in the temperature rate is on the left hand side of eq 1 whereas the horizontal advection term hadv vertical advection term vadv vertical diffusivity term vdif and horizontal diffusivity term hdif are on the right hand side according to the model diagnostics the magnitudes of the vertical and horizontal diffusivity terms are at least one order smaller than those of the other terms and thus they were not considered in this study we selected two representative stations e and f fig 7a which were located adjacent to each other within the region of the divergence convergence train the sst diagnostic terms at stations e and f are shown in figs 7d and 7e respectively the time series of the horizontal velocity vectors at station e during the same period is presented in fig 7c the complete tidal period t9 t9 24 h is denoted by red shading and green shading for the flood and ebb tidal phases respectively in figs 7c 7f at station e the vadv mainly helped to reduce the sst during the flood tides and to warm the sea surface during the ebb tides figs 7c and 7d which agreed well with the vertical velocity patterns shown in figs 6c and 6g and figs 6d and 6h respectively the variations in the sst were basically determined by the balance between the vadv and hadv and these two terms generally had contrasting effects on the uwh figs 7d and 7e the magnitude of rate at point e alternated between positive and negative values regardless of the presence of flood or ebb tides thereby indicating that the relative contributions of the hadv and vadv were unclear the temperature diagnostic results at station f were similar to those at station e but the hadv and vadv had opposite signs compared with those at station e because these two stations had opposite convergent signals figs 7a and 7b the temperature diagnostic results were relatively chaotic at a single station so we also examined the results for the entire uwh region dashed lined box in fig 7a as shown in fig 7f fig 7f demonstrates that flood tides intensified the uwh whereas ebb tides suppressed the uwh thereby agreeing with figs 4a 4i moreover as shown in figs 10a 10c the areal mean sst in the uwh domain decreased during the flood tidal period marked in red and then gradually increased during the following ebb tidal period marked in green which are also consistent with fig 7f the hadv continued to decrease during the flood tides which facilitated the development of the uwh and this supported the proposal in section 5 3 as shown in fig 7f the vadv decreased from the maximum ebb flow to the maximum flood flow and then increased until a new cycle began the phase difference between the vadv and hadv was approximately one quarter that of the entire tidal period therefore the vadv had both facilitatory and inhibitory effects on the uwh during flood tides and ebb tides which were related to the dynamic adjustment of the intensity of the divergence convergence train near the maximum flood flow the hadv and vadv both contributed to cooling down the uwh and the sst decreased at the fastest rate whereas the sst increased more rapidly during the maximum ebb flow fig 7f in addition the changes in the rate hadv and vadv were not strictly synchronous with the variations in the tidal currents probably due to the remaining influence of the last flood tides or ebb tides 6 discussion 6 1 times when fast cooling and fast warming uwh events occurred as described in section 3 we identified fast cooling and fast warming uwh events based on modis sst observations fig 3 for simplicity we defined the start and end times of the observed fast cooling event as t5 and t6 respectively and those of the fast warming event as t7 and t8 for the period from t5 to t6 the tidal elevations and tidal currents hindcasted by the tmd at station e fig 7a are shown in figs 8e and 8f where the locations of t5 and t6 are also marked figs 8e and 8f indicate that the fast cooling uwh event occurred near the maximum flood flow which is consistent with our hypothesis and in agreement with the results shown in figs 6i and 7f near the maximum flood northward tidal currents transported the southern cold waters to the uwh region and helped to increase its intensity negative hadv by contrast the vigorous upward velocity due to strong divergence caused more cold water to upwell from the lower layer which also enhanced the uwh negative vadv finally the uwh cooled down rapidly under the joint effect of these two factors furthermore figs 8g and 8h show that the fast warming event occurred near the maximum ebb flow which is consistent with the discussions in sections 5 2 5 4 the ebb tidal flow carried the warm waters southward to the uwh region and suppressed the upwelling intensity positive hadv and the downward velocity due to the convergence of the ebb tidal flow inhibited the upwelling positive vadv and thus the uwh warmed up significantly in the related regions 6 2 spatial distribution of the variations in sst fig 3c shows that the negative differences in the sst δ sst during the fast cooling uwh event were located in isolated patches rather than distributed continuously to understand this distribution fig 9a shows the locations of the uwh at t5 and t6 by plotting the sst below 28 0 c according to fig 9a the flood tidal currents moved the location of the uwh toward the northeast which was consistent with the flow pattern as a consequence the hot water in area a1 blue ellipse in figs 3c and 9a at t5 was replaced by the cold upwelling water at t6 which partly explains the significantly negative δ sst within area a1 as shown in fig 3c in addition area a1 matched well with the convergent divergent area ca black rectangle in figs 7a 7b and 9a 9d and fig 7d indicates that the vadv was negative and this helped to intensify the uwh near the maximum flood therefore the upward motion in area ca due to the locally divergent flow also contributed to the cold patch in area a1 moreover the flow divergence exhibited an alternating train like pattern figs 6a and 6b and in the areas adjacent to the north and south of area ca the downward motion caused by the locally convergent flow suppressed the upwelling which might explain the isolated patchy pattern for the negative δ sst in area a2 red ellipse in figs 3c and 9a the cold upwelling waters at t5 were replaced by the adjacent hot water at t6 under the influence of flood tidal currents thereby resulting in the significantly positive δ sst in area a2 fig 3c similarly δ sst was significantly positive in area a3 red ellipse in figs 3f and 9b which was due to the joint influence of the horizontal advection of the strong ebb flow and the downward motion associated with local convergence the significantly negative δ sst in area a4 blue ellipse in figs 3f and 9b was mainly due to the change in the location of the uwh caused by the ebb tidal flow fig 9b in addition the fast cooling uwh event was observed during the local daytime when the ocean warmed up and thus solar radiation may have also contributed to the significantly positive δ sst in area a2 fig 3c similarly the heat exchange between the ocean and atmosphere loss of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere may have contributed to the negative δ sst within area a4 fig 3f during the local nighttime we examined the variations in the sst during the flood and ebb tides for the selected tidal period presented in fig 4 fig 9c shows the modeled 29 0 c isotherm at t9 6 h red contour and t9 9 h green contour and it demonstrates that the location of the uwh moved northeastwardly under the flood tidal currents which is in good agreement with the satellite observations presented in fig 9a moreover fig 9d shows that the ebb tidal flow moved the uwh southwestward which is also consistent with the modis observations presented in fig 9b in general the modeled uwh intensified under northward tidal currents whereas it attenuated under a southward tidal flow figs 9c and 9d however significantly positive δ sst and negative δ sst values occurred near the southwest edge of the uwh as shown in figs 9c and 9d which approximately agreed with the variations in the sst in area a2 fig 3c and area a4 fig 3f respectively and they were mainly due to the change in the location of the uwh caused by tidal currents figs 9c and 9d also show that the most significant δ sst was found in area ca which contrasted with the normal diurnal variation in the sst this result is consistent with figs 3c and 3f and it indicates that the strong vertical velocity due to the convergence divergence of the tidal flow contributed to the variations in the sst in addition the modeling results showed that the δ sst values north and south of area ca had an opposite sign compared with that in area ca figs 9c and 9d possibly due to the opposite divergence in the different areas thereby facilitating the formation of the isolated δ sst patches shown in figs 3c and 3f 6 3 limitations of the tidal influence on uwh the results presented above demonstrate the fast changing feature of uwh and they suggest that the strong vertical velocity and horizontal advection triggered by progressive tidal waves might explain this fast changing upwelling however these suggestions are based mainly on the premise that strong tidal currents act off the west coast of hainan island the intensity of the tides varies with time so we examined the influence of weak tidal flow on the uwh figs 10a and 10b present time series of the sea level height and surface velocity at station e fig 7a over approximately 30 days where the neap tide and spring tide are highlighted by cyan shading and yellow shading respectively the area averaged sst in the uwh domain dashed line box in fig 7a was used as an intensity index for the uwh and the time series is presented in fig 10c according to figs 10a 10c the neap tide could not trigger remarkable adjustments of the uwh in the short term this is easy to understand because during a neap tide the tidal currents and divergence convergence of the flow are both weak and thus the neap tide cannot contribute significantly to changes in the short term dynamics of the uwh figs 2d and 2e show a normal warming event in the seas off the west coast of hainan island during the local daytime whereas figs 2g and 2h present a normal cooling event during the local nighttime both events followed a diurnal sst variation pattern for simplicity we defined the start and end times of the observed normal warming event as t1 and t2 respectively and those for the normal cooling event as t3 and t4 respectively for the period from t1 to t2 the tidal elevations and tidal currents hindcasted by the tmd at station e fig 7a are shown in figs 8a and 8b respectively similarly time series for the tidal elevations and tidal velocity vectors during the period from t3 to t4 are presented in figs 8c and 8d respectively according to figs 8a 8d modis observed a normal warming event and a normal cooling event that occurred during neap tides when the tidal currents were very weak as also indicated by the modeling results fig 10 as shown in fig 11a the sst time series observed at station 6223 during the general oceanographic survey of china on may 30 1959 also demonstrated that neap tides could not significantly alter the short term dynamics of the uwh fig 11a also shows time series for the tidal velocity and sea level height hindcasted by the tmd during the observation period according to fig 11a the weak flood ebb tidal currents 0 4 m s during neap tides fig 11b could not break the normal diurnal sst variation pattern and lead to abnormal cooling warming of the sea surface during the local day night thereby demonstrating the weak role of neap tides in the uwh as also shown by the modeling results fig 10 furthermore based on these findings we suggest that the influence of the tides on the uwh will also be weak during or near the transition period of the tidal flow when the tidal currents are weak and the flow direction could even experience a reversal figs 12a 12b and 12c show the successive sst observations acquired by modis on terra at 3 15 utc and aqua at 6 15 utc on august 2 2005 and their differences sst a q u a sst t e r r a respectively for simplicity we defined the start and end times of this event as t10 and t11 respectively the time series produced by tmd for the tidal elevations and tidal velocity vectors are presented in figs 12d and 12e respectively which show that t10 to t11 was in the transition period for the tidal currents during the spring tide figs 12f and 12g therefore figs 12a 12g suggest that even during the spring tide the tidal currents in the transition period could not alter the normal warming of the sea surface in the uwh possibly due to the weak intensity of the tidal currents and the opposite effects of flood and ebb tidal flows in addition for the entire uwh domain the numerical results shown in fig 7f indicate that the rate already changed sign from negative to positive before the minimum flood which also indicates the weak role of weak tidal currents during the transition period 7 summary and conclusion the uwh is a special upwelling system given its tidally driven mechanism lü et al 2008 wang et al 2015 bai et al 2019 however previous studies of the uwh focused mainly on its mean state characteristics and its short term dynamics were not investigated in this study we conducted a model data fusion study using modis infrared sst images and roms simulations to explore the short term dynamics of the uwh the successive modis sst observations acquired by the terra and aqua satellites captured fast cooling and fast warming uwh events during the local daytime and nighttime respectively the sst varied by more than 1 c within 3 h for both events thereby suggesting that the uwh can change rapidly investigations based on roms simulations demonstrated that the vigorous tidal currents in the uwh domain can lead to fast and periodic adjustments in the uwh in general flood tides intensify the uwh whereas ebb tides inhibit it furthermore model data fusion analysis suggested that strong horizontal advection due to intense tidal currents and high vertical velocity caused by divergence convergence induced by progressive tidal waves may comprise the intrinsic physical mechanism responsible for the fast changing uwh we validated this hypothesis by investigating the time of occurrence and the spatial distribution of the variations in the sst for the fast cooling and fast warming uwh events the results showed that the observations agreed with the hypothesis finally analyses based on modis sst images in situ sst time series and model diagnostic results indicated that the influence of tidal flow on the uwh is weak during the neap tides or transition periods for tidal currents probably due to the weak horizontal advection and divergence convergence the model used in this study was forced by constant winds and this configuration was based on the assumption that short term changes in winds are insignificant this assumption was reasonable and helpful for simplifying the analysis of the fast changing uwh however winds can sometimes change significantly within a short time but their effects have not been determined this study demonstrated that the uwh can be fast changing and we provided reasonable explanations in order to obtain a better understanding of the uwh in future research it would be interesting to identify the different roles as well as the joint effects of variable winds and tides on the uwh dynamics credit authorship

23977,in this study we investigated the short term dynamics of upwelling off the west coast of hainan island uwh by combining moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis infrared sea surface temperature sst images and regional ocean modeling system roms simulations modis observations showed that the uwh could exhibit rapid temporal variations where the sst could increase or decrease by more than 1 c within 3 h further investigations based on roms simulations suggested that flood tides could rapidly intensify the uwh whereas ebb tides could rapidly weaken the uwh strong horizontal advection by intense tidal currents and high vertical velocity due to divergence convergence triggered by progressive tidal waves were identified as the intrinsic physical mechanisms responsible for the rapid sst variations in the uwh these findings were verified based on a modis observed fast cooling uwh event and a modis observed fast warming uwh event analyses of the timing of occurrence tidal phase and spatial patterns of the significant variations in the sst for these events all agreed with the hypothesis stated above model data fusion analysis indicated that when a neap tide or transition period for tidal currents occurs the influence of the tidal flow on the uwh is weak because of the associated weak horizontal advection and divergence convergence keywords hainan island

attracted extensive attention in general ekman transport forced by wind stress and ekman pumping due to wind stress curl are recognized as the dominant drivers of most coastal upwelling systems e g castelao and barth 2006 jing et al 2009 albert et al 2010 however topography can significantly modify the coastal upwelling dynamics song et al 2001 demonstrated that variable alongshore bathymetry facilitates the development of upwelling centers along the coast by enhancing attenuating upwelling on the downslope upslope sides of topographic highs the uneven upwelling distribution induced by the topography then leads to a horizontal pressure gradient which drives the meandering currents to modulate the upwelling structure song and chao 2004 numerical investigations by chen et al 2013 suggested that a steeper shelf slope corresponds to a narrower cross shore width for the surface ekman divergence as well as greater vertical velocity in addition changes in the relative vorticity due to the existence of a headland or a canyon dominate the vertical motion nearby to modulate the local upwelling intensity chen et al 2014 in addition to the wind driven mechanism the combined effect of topography and currents can also trigger coastal upwelling under certain conditions e g lee et al 1999 allen and hickey 2010 in coastal zones wave mixing or tide mixing can promote the uplift of lower layer cold waters to enhance the upwelling intensity wang et al 2015 when a river discharges into an upwelling zone the water column will be stabilized by the freshwater which then suppresses the growth of upwelling hickey et al 2005 wang et al 2015 moreover coastal upwelling supplies a cold bottom boundary layer to the local atmosphere which enhances the land sea temperature gradient and adjusts the sea breeze circulation and thus the upwelling varies with the changing winds thereby resulting in feedback franchito et al 2008 alves et al 2018 in the boreal summer coastal upwellings that develop off the east and west coasts of hainan island are among the most distinctive hydrodynamic phenomena found in the northwestern south china sea scs fig 1a to the north of hainan island a deep narrow channel with an intense tidal flow shi et al 2002 called the qiongzhou strait separates the island from the chinese mainland to the west the beibu gulf is a semi enclosed bay adjacent to the central basin of the scs a broad continental shelf of the scs is present off the east coast of hainan island with a depth less than 200 m and isobaths approximately parallel to the coastline fig 1a as shown in fig 1a two upwelling zones are found around the coasts of hainan island the upwelling off the east coast of hainan island ueh and the upwelling off the west coast of hainan island uwh the ueh has received extensive attention in previous investigations which demonstrated that the ueh is primarily a wind driven phenomenon and it is also modulated by topography river runoff tides wave

2016a b the prevailing southerly winds lead to shoreward ekman transport off the west coast of hainan island thereby resulting in downwelling however remarkable upwelling also occurs according to both the sea surface temperature sst fig 1a and the observed vertical temperature structure fig 1b i e the uwh lü et al 2008 proposed that the uwh is tidally driven and fig 1c shows a schematic illustration of this upwelling during the summer a strong tidal mixing front is established because of the intense tidal currents off the west coast of hainan island hu et al 2003 the entire water column to the right of the front is filled with well mixed warm water whereas stratification still exists on the left side therefore a density difference exists across the tidal mixing front which then generates a pressure gradient force due to the topography slope the pressure gradient force drives an upward motion and the uwh finally develops the southerly winds have an inhibitory effect on the development of the uwh but they are not sufficiently strong to suppress the uwh completely wang et al 2015 and bai et al 2019 also provided support for this theory regarding the development of the uwh and suggested that wave mixing might play a sensitive role in this upwelling system despite these studies the short term dynamics of the uwh remain unknown because previous investigations focused mainly on its mean state characteristics thus in order to explore the short term dynamics of the uwh we conducted a data model fusion investigation based mainly on satellite remote sensing data and simulations of the regional ocean modeling system roms the fast changing feature of the uwh and the associated physical mechanisms were clarified in detail in this study the remainder of this article is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the data and tools employed in sections 3 4 5 and 6 we present the evidence simulations mechanisms and a discussion of the fast changing feature respectively finally we give our conclusions in section 7 2 data and tools 2 1 satellite observed sst moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sst data http oceancolor gsfc nasa gov were used to capture and analyze uwh events the terra and aqua satellites are both equipped with modis and the minimum interval between their transit times over uwh events is approximately 3 h which was suitable for determining the short term dynamics of the uwh to better capture the detailed structure of the uwh we used modis level 2 sst data with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km modis cannot operate in the presence of heavy clouds so we examined modis infrared sst images taken over the northwestern scs during june to august 2001 2017 and selected the images with high quality observations furthermore we excluded sst data with low retrieval quality flags data with qual sst 1 were removed to ensure the reliability of the analysis in addition we also used modis level 3 monthly averaged sst data to determine the climatological pattern for the uwh as presented in fig 1a 2 2 era interim winds we used the 3 h era interim winds data set http apps ecmwf int datasets to capture the wind pattern that accompanied the sst results sensed by aqua or terra the era interim data set is a global atmospheric reanalysis data set produced by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf dee et al 2011 and this product has been used extensively because of its good quality this product was also used to analyze the climatological summer monsoon over the northwestern scs fig 1a 2 3 tide model driver to efficiently hindcast the sea surface elevation and tidal currents we used the tide model driver tmd package supplied by oregon state university egbert and erofeeva 2002 the regional tidal solutions for the china seas model ind 2016 with a spatial resolution of 1 30 were utilized with the tmd toolbox both the tmd toolbox and tidal solutions used in this study are available from http volkov oce orst edu tides 3 evidence of fast changing uwh based on modis infrared sst images 3 1 normal diurnal variations in sst in the beibu gulf due to the significant variations in daytime nighttime surface solar radiation the diurnal cycle is one of the most important components of the variability of the sst gentemann et al 2003 kennedy et al 2007 figs 2a 2c present the 25 h sst variations at stations 6215 6238 and 6252 locations in fig 1a based on observations acquired by the general oceanographic survey of china during the summer of 1960 figs 2a 2c illustrate the typical diurnal cycle of the sst in the central beibu gulf during the summer in particular the sst started to increase at 6 00 9 00 when the ocean began to receive sunlight and as more solar radiation was absorbed the sst reached a peak at 16 00 17 00 before then decreasing into the evening and the night until a new cycle started figs 2d 2e show successive sst images acquired by modis on terra at 3 35 utc and aqua at 6 40 utc on june 2 2016 respectively the differences in the sst sst a q u a sst t e r r a between these two observations are presented in fig 2f as shown in fig 2f the seas off the west coast of hainan island warmed up during the local daytime which was consistent with the diurnal variation in the sst furthermore figs 2g and 2h show successive sst images captured by modis on terra at 15 35 utc and aqua at 18 20 utc on june 29 2015 during local nighttime respectively and their differences are shown in fig 2i the seas had just cooled down fig 2i which also agreed well with the diurnal variations in the sst however the modis infrared sst images suggested that the variations in the sst in the uwh disrupted the normal diurnal variations in some situations as described in the following 3 2 fast changing uwh observed by modis sst figs 3a 3b and 3c show successive infrared sst images captured by modis on terra at 3 00 utc and aqua at 6 10 utc on july 4 2011 and their differences respectively figs 3a 3c clearly indicate that the uwh intensified significantly within 3 h and that the sst decreased by more than 1 c these results contrast with the diurnal sst variations in the beibu gulf as discussed in section 3 1 the corresponding local times utc 8 for these two sst observations were 11 00 and 14 10 when the solar radiation should have increased the sst during this period another example is illustrated in figs 3d 3e and 3f which show successive sst images captured by modis on terra at 15 20 and on aqua at 18 05 utc on july 16 2003 and their differences respectively remarkably figs 3d 3f indicate that a fast warming uwh event increased by more than 1 c within 3 h occurred during the local nighttime when the ocean lost heat to the atmosphere and the sst should have decreased hence fig 3 demonstrates that the uwh could exhibit fast cooling as well as fast warming i e the uwh could change rapidly figs 3a and 3b also show the era interim winds at the nearest moments associated with the sst images where they suggest that minor changes occurred in the winds during the fast cooling uwh event similarly the era interim wind vectors shown in figs 3d and 3e indicate that a quasi constant wind field accompanied the fast warming uwh event previous investigations proposed that the response time for upwelling to changing winds occurs on a scale of several days gu et al 2012 chen et al 2013 moreover the fast cooling and fast warming uwh events both contradicted the normal diurnal variations in the sst therefore air sea heat exchange or winds did not trigger these fast changing uwh events 4 modeling the fast changing uwh 4 1 model configuration the modis sst images were not sufficient to determine the three dimensional 3 d structure of the fast changing uwh thus in order to better determine the intrinsic physics of this phenomenon we used the roms model shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 to simulate the 3 d dynamics of the uwh the rectangular model grid extended from 105 5 e to 113 5 e in the zonal direction and from 15 n to 23 n in the meridional direction horizontally the model had a resolution of 4 km in the vertical direction we applied a 20 level stretched terrain following coordinate moreover theta s and theta b were set to 5 0 and 0 4 respectively to enhance the resolution near the surface and the bed the topography originated from hybrid data based on the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco provided by the british oceanographic data centre bodc https www bodc ac uk and a local electronic navigation chart two model runs were executed to explore the short term dynamics of the uwh baroclinic and barotropic cases for the baroclinic model the boundary and initial conditions were both interpolated from the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom database https www hycom org dataserver tidal harmonic constants of 10 tidal constituents m 2 s 2 n 2 k 2 k 1 o 1 p 1 q 1 m f and m m derived from the tpxo7 product egbert and erofeeva 2002 were also added to the open boundaries as tidal forcing the comprehensive ocean atmosphere data set coads05 da silva et al 1994 was used to generate the monthly mean surface heat and freshwater fluxes for the baroclinic model most importantly we imposed a constant northward wind force of 0 035 n m2 over the sea surface this design was mainly based on the climatological wind pattern shown in fig 1a and the fact that winds should play a weak role in the fast changing uwh as explained in section 3 2 which also simplified the discussion the baroclinic time step was set to 120 s with a model splitting ratio of 30 and the data output frequency was every 3 h we examined the performance of the baroclinic model at modeling the uwh not shown after comparing the results produced by the baroclinic model with those reported by lü et al 2008 and wang et al 2015 we confirmed that the baroclinic model reliably simulated the 3 d dynamic structure of the uwh the barotropic model shared the same tidal forcing and integration setups as the baroclinic model but the salinity and temperature were kept constant throughout the integration the baroclinic run and barotropic run both lasted for 120 days from their initialization and we only used the outputs for the last 30 days when the model was stable 4 2 tidally induced fast changing uwh diurnal tidal signals are dominant in the beibu gulf minh et al 2014 figs 4a 4i show the evolution of the sst and sea surface currents during an entire tidal period based on the baroclinic model according to the simulation the intensity of the uwh changed remarkably and rapidly where it intensified during flood tides and weakened under ebb tidal flows fig 4j shows a time series of the sst along section ab marked in fig 4a which clearly indicates the presence of a fast changing uwh as well as suggesting that the fast changing feature occurred during the representative tidal period as shown in figs 4a 4i and that it was also a recurrent phenomenon fig 4 suggests that the fast changing uwh is closely associated with the local tidal phase moreover the baroclinic model was run under the force of constant winds and monthly averaged heat fluxes and thus fig 4 strongly suggests that the fast changing feature of the uwh is tidally induced 5 mechanism responsible for the fast changing uwh 5 1 vertical structure of uwh the fast changing surface structure of the uwh suggests that a corresponding 3 d dynamic adjustment occurs in the entire water column we defined period t9 6 h t9 12 h shown in fig 4 as the flood tides and t9 18 h t9 24 h as the ebb tides based on the baroclinic model we examined the vertical distribution of the temperature and u w vectors along section ab fig 4a during flood tides fig 5a and ebb tides fig 5b the differences in w and temperature between the flood tides and the entire tidal period t9 t9 24 h are shown in fig 5c and the ebb tides and the entire tidal period are compared in fig 5d during the flood tides the vertical velocity in the uwh was remarkably intensified with an enhancement of approximately 1 1 0 4 m s and thus the sst in the uwh zone decreased by approximately 1 c fig 5c during the ebb tides the vertical velocity exhibited an abnormal downward pattern fig 5b which constrained the intensity of the uwh compared with the average vertical velocity during the entire tidal period the vertical velocity decreased by approximately 1 1 0 4 m s in the uwh under the ebb tidal flow thereby leading to an increase of 1 c in the sst fig 5d as noted in section 1 the tidal mixing front is established by intense tidal currents over the western coastal seas of hainan island and the density difference across the tidal mixing front then drives the upward motion with the help of the topographic slope lü et al 2008 however fig 5b suggests that some mechanism must have competed with the pressure gradient force originating from the density difference and triggered a downward motion in uwh the u w vectors along section ab produced by the barotropic model are shown in figs 5e and 5f for the same periods as those shown in figs 5a and 5b respectively figs 5e and 5f indicate that tides led to an upward motion in the entire water column during the flood tides and a downward motion during the ebb tides therefore this effect should account for or partly explain the intensified and suppressed upwellings shown in figs 5a and 5b respectively however how can tides significantly affect the vertical motion throughout the entire water column 5 2 progressive tidal wave induced convergence and divergence based on the barotropic experiment fig 6a shows the depth averaged horizontal flood tidal flow and its divergence field which is defined as div v h v h x y u v u x v y where v h u v is the horizontal velocity vector and x y is the two dimensional differential operator fig 6a suggests that the progressive tidal wave could trigger a divergence convergence train off the west coast of hainan island and the location nearly overlapped with the uwh strong divergence convergence of the horizontal currents led to a high upward downward vertical velocity in the entire water column as shown in fig 6c which is also illustrated in figs 5e and 5f the conditions were similar during the ebb tides but the opposite of those during the flood tides as suggested in figs 6a 6d furthermore we examined the depth averaged horizontal currents the divergence field and the depth mean vertical velocity for the baroclinic case during flood and ebb tides where the results are shown in figs 6e 6h respectively the results differed for the baroclinic case and the barotropic case because of the introduction of baroclinic effects but the divergence convergence train induced by tidal waves still existed and it induced strong upward downward motion as shown in figs 6c 6d 6g and 6h the flood tides had a positive effect on upward motion rather than downward motion because the former had a stronger intensity and covered a broader area i e the flood tides promoted the uwh by contrast the ebb tides had an inhibitory effect 5 3 horizontal advection by tidal currents the long band shaped uwh stretches from the southwest coast to the northwest coast of hainan island figs 1 3 and 4 this band connects with cold waters toward the southern end of the uwh region because of upwelling off the southwest coast of hainan island li et al 2018 whereas warm gulf waters exist toward the northern end of the uwh figs 1a and 4a 4i this difference is also illustrated in figs 6i and 6j which show the temperatures along section cd fig 6c during the flood and ebb tides section cd was specified to cross the central axis of the divergence convergence train also the uwh region given the intense tidal currents during both the flood tides and the ebb tides the flood tidal currents northward could transport the southern cold waters toward the uwh region thereby helping to enhance the uwh it should be noted that a topographic slope is present at the 18 4 18 6 n segment of section cd and this slope helps to elevate the cold water carried by the flow when the flood tidal currents pass thereby enhancing the uwh under ebb tidal currents this process transports the northern warm waters southwardly to the uwh area thereby suppressing the uwh 5 4 temperature diagnosis to further understand this fast changing uwh we diagnosed the temperature dynamics of the uwh based on the heat budget equation 1 t t rate u t x v t y hadv w t z vadv z k t t z vdif d h hdif with the following surface and bottom boundary conditions 2 z k t t z z 0 q net ρ c p 3 z k t t z z h 0 where t is temperature t is time u v and w are the east west south north and vertical components of the velocity respectively k t is the vertical diffusivity coefficient q net is the surface net heat flux ρ is the density of seawater c p is the specific heat capacity of seawater and h is the water depth the time rate of change in the temperature rate is on the left hand side of eq 1 whereas the horizontal advection term hadv vertical advection term vadv vertical diffusivity term vdif and horizontal diffusivity term hdif are on the right hand side according to the model diagnostics the magnitudes of the vertical and horizontal diffusivity terms are at least one order smaller than those of the other terms and thus they were not considered in this study we selected two representative stations e and f fig 7a which were located adjacent to each other within the region of the divergence convergence train the sst diagnostic terms at stations e and f are shown in figs 7d and 7e respectively the time series of the horizontal velocity vectors at station e during the same period is presented in fig 7c the complete tidal period t9 t9 24 h is denoted by red shading and green shading for the flood and ebb tidal phases respectively in figs 7c 7f at station e the vadv mainly helped to reduce the sst during the flood tides and to warm the sea surface during the ebb tides figs 7c and 7d which agreed well with the vertical velocity patterns shown in figs 6c and 6g and figs 6d and 6h respectively the variations in the sst were basically determined by the balance between the vadv and hadv and these two terms generally had contrasting effects on the uwh figs 7d and 7e the magnitude of rate at point e alternated between positive and negative values regardless of the presence of flood or ebb tides thereby indicating that the relative contributions of the hadv and vadv were unclear the temperature diagnostic results at station f were similar to those at station e but the hadv and vadv had opposite signs compared with those at station e because these two stations had opposite convergent signals figs 7a and 7b the temperature diagnostic results were relatively chaotic at a single station so we also examined the results for the entire uwh region dashed lined box in fig 7a as shown in fig 7f fig 7f demonstrates that flood tides intensified the uwh whereas ebb tides suppressed the uwh thereby agreeing with figs 4a 4i moreover as shown in figs 10a 10c the areal mean sst in the uwh domain decreased during the flood tidal period marked in red and then gradually increased during the following ebb tidal period marked in green which are also consistent with fig 7f the hadv continued to decrease during the flood tides which facilitated the development of the uwh and this supported the proposal in section 5 3 as shown in fig 7f the vadv decreased from the maximum ebb flow to the maximum flood flow and then increased until a new cycle began the phase difference between the vadv and hadv was approximately one quarter that of the entire tidal period therefore the vadv had both facilitatory and inhibitory effects on the uwh during flood tides and ebb tides which were related to the dynamic adjustment of the intensity of the divergence convergence train near the maximum flood flow the hadv and vadv both contributed to cooling down the uwh and the sst decreased at the fastest rate whereas the sst increased more rapidly during the maximum ebb flow fig 7f in addition the changes in the rate hadv and vadv were not strictly synchronous with the variations in the tidal currents probably due to the remaining influence of the last flood tides or ebb tides 6 discussion 6 1 times when fast cooling and fast warming uwh events occurred as described in section 3 we identified fast cooling and fast warming uwh events based on modis sst observations fig 3 for simplicity we defined the start and end times of the observed fast cooling event as t5 and t6 respectively and those of the fast warming event as t7 and t8 for the period from t5 to t6 the tidal elevations and tidal currents hindcasted by the tmd at station e fig 7a are shown in figs 8e and 8f where the locations of t5 and t6 are also marked figs 8e and 8f indicate that the fast cooling uwh event occurred near the maximum flood flow which is consistent with our hypothesis and in agreement with the results shown in figs 6i and 7f near the maximum flood northward tidal currents transported the southern cold waters to the uwh region and helped to increase its intensity negative hadv by contrast the vigorous upward velocity due to strong divergence caused more cold water to upwell from the lower layer which also enhanced the uwh negative vadv finally the uwh cooled down rapidly under the joint effect of these two factors furthermore figs 8g and 8h show that the fast warming event occurred near the maximum ebb flow which is consistent with the discussions in sections 5 2 5 4 the ebb tidal flow carried the warm waters southward to the uwh region and suppressed the upwelling intensity positive hadv and the downward velocity due to the convergence of the ebb tidal flow inhibited the upwelling positive vadv and thus the uwh warmed up significantly in the related regions 6 2 spatial distribution of the variations in sst fig 3c shows that the negative differences in the sst δ sst during the fast cooling uwh event were located in isolated patches rather than distributed continuously to understand this distribution fig 9a shows the locations of the uwh at t5 and t6 by plotting the sst below 28 0 c according to fig 9a the flood tidal currents moved the location of the uwh toward the northeast which was consistent with the flow pattern as a consequence the hot water in area a1 blue ellipse in figs 3c and 9a at t5 was replaced by the cold upwelling water at t6 which partly explains the significantly negative δ sst within area a1 as shown in fig 3c in addition area a1 matched well with the convergent divergent area ca black rectangle in figs 7a 7b and 9a 9d and fig 7d indicates that the vadv was negative and this helped to intensify the uwh near the maximum flood therefore the upward motion in area ca due to the locally divergent flow also contributed to the cold patch in area a1 moreover the flow divergence exhibited an alternating train like pattern figs 6a and 6b and in the areas adjacent to the north and south of area ca the downward motion caused by the locally convergent flow suppressed the upwelling which might explain the isolated patchy pattern for the negative δ sst in area a2 red ellipse in figs 3c and 9a the cold upwelling waters at t5 were replaced by the adjacent hot water at t6 under the influence of flood tidal currents thereby resulting in the significantly positive δ sst in area a2 fig 3c similarly δ sst was significantly positive in area a3 red ellipse in figs 3f and 9b which was due to the joint influence of the horizontal advection of the strong ebb flow and the downward motion associated with local convergence the significantly negative δ sst in area a4 blue ellipse in figs 3f and 9b was mainly due to the change in the location of the uwh caused by the ebb tidal flow fig 9b in addition the fast cooling uwh event was observed during the local daytime when the ocean warmed up and thus solar radiation may have also contributed to the significantly positive δ sst in area a2 fig 3c similarly the heat exchange between the ocean and atmosphere loss of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere may have contributed to the negative δ sst within area a4 fig 3f during the local nighttime we examined the variations in the sst during the flood and ebb tides for the selected tidal period presented in fig 4 fig 9c shows the modeled 29 0 c isotherm at t9 6 h red contour and t9 9 h green contour and it demonstrates that the location of the uwh moved northeastwardly under the flood tidal currents which is in good agreement with the satellite observations presented in fig 9a moreover fig 9d shows that the ebb tidal flow moved the uwh southwestward which is also consistent with the modis observations presented in fig 9b in general the modeled uwh intensified under northward tidal currents whereas it attenuated under a southward tidal flow figs 9c and 9d however significantly positive δ sst and negative δ sst values occurred near the southwest edge of the uwh as shown in figs 9c and 9d which approximately agreed with the variations in the sst in area a2 fig 3c and area a4 fig 3f respectively and they were mainly due to the change in the location of the uwh caused by tidal currents figs 9c and 9d also show that the most significant δ sst was found in area ca which contrasted with the normal diurnal variation in the sst this result is consistent with figs 3c and 3f and it indicates that the strong vertical velocity due to the convergence divergence of the tidal flow contributed to the variations in the sst in addition the modeling results showed that the δ sst values north and south of area ca had an opposite sign compared with that in area ca figs 9c and 9d possibly due to the opposite divergence in the different areas thereby facilitating the formation of the isolated δ sst patches shown in figs 3c and 3f 6 3 limitations of the tidal influence on uwh the results presented above demonstrate the fast changing feature of uwh and they suggest that the strong vertical velocity and horizontal advection triggered by progressive tidal waves might explain this fast changing upwelling however these suggestions are based mainly on the premise that strong tidal currents act off the west coast of hainan island the intensity of the tides varies with time so we examined the influence of weak tidal flow on the uwh figs 10a and 10b present time series of the sea level height and surface velocity at station e fig 7a over approximately 30 days where the neap tide and spring tide are highlighted by cyan shading and yellow shading respectively the area averaged sst in the uwh domain dashed line box in fig 7a was used as an intensity index for the uwh and the time series is presented in fig 10c according to figs 10a 10c the neap tide could not trigger remarkable adjustments of the uwh in the short term this is easy to understand because during a neap tide the tidal currents and divergence convergence of the flow are both weak and thus the neap tide cannot contribute significantly to changes in the short term dynamics of the uwh figs 2d and 2e show a normal warming event in the seas off the west coast of hainan island during the local daytime whereas figs 2g and 2h present a normal cooling event during the local nighttime both events followed a diurnal sst variation pattern for simplicity we defined the start and end times of the observed normal warming event as t1 and t2 respectively and those for the normal cooling event as t3 and t4 respectively for the period from t1 to t2 the tidal elevations and tidal currents hindcasted by the tmd at station e fig 7a are shown in figs 8a and 8b respectively similarly time series for the tidal elevations and tidal velocity vectors during the period from t3 to t4 are presented in figs 8c and 8d respectively according to figs 8a 8d modis observed a normal warming event and a normal cooling event that occurred during neap tides when the tidal currents were very weak as also indicated by the modeling results fig 10 as shown in fig 11a the sst time series observed at station 6223 during the general oceanographic survey of china on may 30 1959 also demonstrated that neap tides could not significantly alter the short term dynamics of the uwh fig 11a also shows time series for the tidal velocity and sea level height hindcasted by the tmd during the observation period according to fig 11a the weak flood ebb tidal currents 0 4 m s during neap tides fig 11b could not break the normal diurnal sst variation pattern and lead to abnormal cooling warming of the sea surface during the local day night thereby demonstrating the weak role of neap tides in the uwh as also shown by the modeling results fig 10 furthermore based on these findings we suggest that the influence of the tides on the uwh will also be weak during or near the transition period of the tidal flow when the tidal currents are weak and the flow direction could even experience a reversal figs 12a 12b and 12c show the successive sst observations acquired by modis on terra at 3 15 utc and aqua at 6 15 utc on august 2 2005 and their differences sst a q u a sst t e r r a respectively for simplicity we defined the start and end times of this event as t10 and t11 respectively the time series produced by tmd for the tidal elevations and tidal velocity vectors are presented in figs 12d and 12e respectively which show that t10 to t11 was in the transition period for the tidal currents during the spring tide figs 12f and 12g therefore figs 12a 12g suggest that even during the spring tide the tidal currents in the transition period could not alter the normal warming of the sea surface in the uwh possibly due to the weak intensity of the tidal currents and the opposite effects of flood and ebb tidal flows in addition for the entire uwh domain the numerical results shown in fig 7f indicate that the rate already changed sign from negative to positive before the minimum flood which also indicates the weak role of weak tidal currents during the transition period 7 summary and conclusion the uwh is a special upwelling system given its tidally driven mechanism lü et al 2008 wang et al 2015 bai et al 2019 however previous studies of the uwh focused mainly on its mean state characteristics and its short term dynamics were not investigated in this study we conducted a model data fusion study using modis infrared sst images and roms simulations to explore the short term dynamics of the uwh the successive modis sst observations acquired by the terra and aqua satellites captured fast cooling and fast warming uwh events during the local daytime and nighttime respectively the sst varied by more than 1 c within 3 h for both events thereby suggesting that the uwh can change rapidly investigations based on roms simulations demonstrated that the vigorous tidal currents in the uwh domain can lead to fast and periodic adjustments in the uwh in general flood tides intensify the uwh whereas ebb tides inhibit it furthermore model data fusion analysis suggested that strong horizontal advection due to intense tidal currents and high vertical velocity caused by divergence convergence induced by progressive tidal waves may comprise the intrinsic physical mechanism responsible for the fast changing uwh we validated this hypothesis by investigating the time of occurrence and the spatial distribution of the variations in the sst for the fast cooling and fast warming uwh events the results showed that the observations agreed with the hypothesis finally analyses based on modis sst images in situ sst time series and model diagnostic results indicated that the influence of tidal flow on the uwh is weak during the neap tides or transition periods for tidal currents probably due to the weak horizontal advection and divergence convergence the model used in this study was forced by constant winds and this configuration was based on the assumption that short term changes in winds are insignificant this assumption was reasonable and helpful for simplifying the analysis of the fast changing uwh however winds can sometimes change significantly within a short time but their effects have not been determined this study demonstrated that the uwh can be fast changing and we provided reasonable explanations in order to obtain a better understanding of the uwh in future research it would be interesting to identify the different roles as well as the joint effects of variable winds and tides on the uwh dynamics credit authorship

23978,dynamical climate models have been extensively used over the last decade to perform seasonal sea ice predictions in the context of ensemble forecasting to date the sensitivity to the initial conditions has received the most attention through the evaluation of the theoretical limit of antarctic sea ice predictability imposed by the chaotic evolution of the climate system the respective contributions of perturbed ocean sea ice initial conditions and perturbed atmospheric boundary conditions to this predictability remains unevaluated though using the coupled ocean sea ice model nemo3 6 lim3 we developed a suitable framework for evaluating both influences on seasonal antarctic sea ice predictions this study reveals that the uncertainty associated with the evolution of the atmospheric conditions is a major limitation to the realization of skilful sea ice extent sie predictions however it has a limited impact on sea ice volume siv predictions the discrepancies between the sie and siv predictabilities have been attributed to the presence of very thin ice which accounts for much of the sie variability in winter we also demonstrated that an incorrect estimate of the ocean sea ice initial conditions has a weaker but not negligible influence the time evolution of different plausible ocean sea ice initial conditions under perfect knowledge of the atmospheric conditions suggest that the initial sie errors cannot be totally reduced by the atmospheric forcing they even increase during the melt season the high persistence of the siv anomalies is found to be responsible for this behaviour these findings imply that a correct initialization of the sea ice thickness sit might be more important than previously thought for seasonal antarctic sea ice predictions especially if one wants to predict the sie during the melt season keywords earth science cryosphere sea ice antarctic predictions initial conditions 1 introduction several initiatives have flourished over the last decades in the earth s science community to understand diagnose track and predict climate changes to come the sea ice community is no exception to the rule the 2007 year with an unforeseen summer arctic sea ice cover loss sounds like an emergency signal and exemplifies the need for developing efficient prediction systems the sea ice prediction network sipn was initiated and provides a solid framework for advancing predictability of sea ice notably by supporting the sea ice outlook contributions see the sipn website at https www arcus org sipn presentations and publications the arctic seasonal sea ice predictions received much attention yet see for instance guemas et al 2014 tietsche et al 2014 day et al 2016 hawkins et al 2016 bushuk et al 2017 and blockley and peterson 2018 the antarctic counterpart is still in its infancy the disproportion between the two hemispheres probably arises from historical reasons with much of the continents being situated in the northern hemisphere but might now be motivated by the opportunity that represents an open summer arctic basin for transit shipping through the arctic ocean melia et al 2017 sea ice is linked to the evolution of the atmosphere and ocean we can thus expect the timescale on which sea ice can be predicted to be bounded by the inherent memory associated with those two media that is from a coupled of weeks for the atmosphere to a few seasons for the ocean frankignoul and hasselmann 1977 deser et al 2003 chevallier et al 2019 due to its ocean origin sea ice might be expected to have a persistence comparable to the one of the ocean however the geometrical configuration of the southern ocean makes the antarctic sea ice more mobile than the arctic one offshore it is characterized by a close to free drift state holland and kwok 2012 winds cause sea ice to move northwards into warmer waters where it eventually melts moreover antarctic sea ice is primarily seasonal it is therefore thinner than its arctic counterpart for those reasons sea ice motion is expected to be strongly affected by winds which have therefore the potential to limit the sea ice predictability beyond months chevallier et al 2019 see their fig 2 due to the timescale on which seasonal predictions operate any prediction performed with a climate model will suffer from poorly known initial conditions and model biases even in the case of a fully observed climate state in terms of spatial coverage and a full understanding and accurate representation of all the biological chemical and physical processes in climate models an infinitely accurate forecast would be out of reach because of the limited accuracy of measurements see bunzel et al 2016 for instance due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions any small departures from the real climate state will inevitably grow and render the forecast useless after some lead time firstly introduced by lorenz 1963 one often refers to this problem as the chaotic nature of the climate system the sensitivity of dynamical models to the unavoidable small errors in their initial conditions can be typically isolated from model biases using a perfect model approach this method gives some insight about the inherent ability of a climate model to predict itself that is the ability of the model to predict the actual climate if it would faithfully represent all the processes governing the climate system previous studies dedicated to this problem showed skilful predictions of the antarctic sie and sea ice edge up to a few months in advance holland et al 2013 zunz et al 2014 marchi et al 2018 however the predictability is limited to the sea ice growing season and the whole winter the origin of this predictability has been attributed to the memory associated with the ocean heat content ohc holland et al 2013 showed that the sea surface temperatures ssts near the sea ice edge during the sea ice growing season are correlated with the ssts of the previous winter at the same location although the sst anomalies are directly relevant to prescribe the sea ice edge location they are not predictable at most places in summer in some regions however the winter sst anomalies extend through the ocean mixed layer and are efficiently isolated from the surface once the mixed layer shoals in summer those heat anomalies resurface when brine rejection causes the subsurface waters to be re entrained into the deepening mixed layer by this mechanism the sea ice edge and sie predictability can reemerge between two sea ice growing seasons marchi et al 2018 suggested that the ocean convection activity modulates the efficiency of this reemergence mechanism in climate models it is interesting to note that this mechanism was also found in the arctic bushuk et al 2017 suggesting that arctic and antarctic sea ice could share common predictability properties despite the apparent differences in the processes governing their evolution a first attempt to evaluate the impact of the knowledge of the initial conditions on real sea ice predictions on seasonal timescales was provided in guemas et al 2016 through the initialization of the ocean and atmosphere the sea ice component was not initialized directly from observations but from a sea ice reconstruction which provides a complete description of the sea ice initial state but also consistency with the atmospheric and oceanic reanalyses used it turns out that initializing the winter sea ice state from its best possible observational estimate does not improve the skill of sea ice predictions this study rather pointed out the role of the ocean heat content again which acts as a source of memory for sea ice and provides skilful sea ice forecasts for two months during the freezing season drivers of the recent changes in the southern ocean sea ice remain an open question the modest overall increase in antarctic sea ice cover 1 5 per decade 1981 2010 masks substantial regional disparities and significant interannual variability over the recent years with multiple record high 2012 14 and record low 2016 18 sie parkinson 2019 recent studies acknowledged the prime role of the atmosphere notably through the setting up of anomalous circulation patterns stuecker et al 2017 reid et al 2017 turner et al 2017 however there is also evidence that those unusual atmospheric conditions have triggered the release of heat stored in the subsurface ocean lecomte et al 2017 meehl et al 2019 wang et al 2019 kusahara et al 2018 addressed the record low antarctic sie in 2017 by performing retrospective sea ice predictions and confirmed that the ocean thermal conditions have played a role however the relative roles of atmosphere and ocean as drivers of the recent changes in antarctic sea ice are still not well known hobbs et al 2016 based on those findings the present study aims at giving new insights about the relative contributions of the atmosphere and ocean including sea ice to the realization of skilful antarctic sea ice predictions on the seasonal timescale to address this question we decided to work in a perfect model framework to avoid errors arising from model imperfections a description of the experiments that we carried out to isolate and evaluate the forecast uncertainties attributable to 1 the atmospheric variability and 2 an inaccurate incomplete estimate of the ocean sea ice initial conditions is provided in section 2 model estimates of these two sources of uncertainties are presented in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 as we will see those sections give complementary views on the forecast uncertainty associated with an sie and siv prediction for this reason we decided to discuss the implications of the two sources of uncertainties for the sie and siv in sections 3 3 and 3 4 respectively section 3 5 finally deals with the possible implications of the siv predictive skills on the sie one a discussion of our results is then provided in section 4 conclusions and perspectives about this work can be found in section 5 2 model and methods 2 1 model setup our hindcasts were performed using version 3 6 of the nucleus for european modelling of the ocean nemo model madec and the nemo team 2008 a global ocean configuration with a 1 resolution is used to resolve the primitive equations that describe the ocean flow prognostic variables are the three dimensional velocity field the sea surface height the conservative temperature and the absolute salinity this model offers multiple ways to deal with vertical mixing in the ocean a turbulent closure scheme combining the turbulent kinetic energy tke with a turbulent length scale is employed here to compute the vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivities madec et al 1998 within nemo the ocean is interfaced with the louvain la neuve sea ice model lim3 6 which is a dynamic thermodynamic sea ice model a description of this model as it is incorporated into the stable release of nemo3 6 is given in rousset et al 2015 here is a non exhaustive list of the lim3 6 features to account for the ice thickness distribution itd at the sub grid scale a description of the ice thickness into multiple categories 5 by default has been implemented this discretization involves the computation of the ice concentration ice volume per unit area ice internal energy ice salt content snow volume per unit area and snow internal energy for each category separately the ice dynamics is formulated on a c grid the momentum equation being resolved using the elastic viscous plastic rheology formulation of bouillon et al 2013 runoff data consist of a monthly climatology the river runoffs can be distributed over different ocean levels south of 60 s estimates of the coastal freshwater discharge from the ice shelf melt are used depoorter et al 2013 the contribution to the freshwater flux of the iceberg melt in the southern ocean is also taken into account merino et al 2016 in addition to the prescribed freshwater fluxes the sea surface salinity sss is restored towards the world ocean atlas 2013 monthly climatology woa13 zweng et al 2013 to prevent spurious model drift the negative feedback coefficient associated with this sss restoring is 167mm day it corresponds to a relaxation timescale of 300 days for a 50m mixed layer depth to avoid a misrepresentation of the interactions between the ocean and sea ice the sss restoring term is modulated by the presence of sea ice multiplied by one minus the sea ice concentration sic the sss restoring has been equally activated for the reference simulation and the hindcasts this restoring does not provide any additional constraint on the evolution of our predictions it has nearly no impact on the ensemble characteristics that we have analysed not shown a complete description of the model configuration used is reported in barthélemy et al 2017 2 2 atmospheric forcing used the nemo engine provides a wide variety of model configurations and setup in this study we used a global configuration with the ocean and sea ice forced by the atmosphere making no use of data assimilation the chosen atmospheric reanalysis to force the model is jra 55 the japanese 55 year reanalysis kobayashi et al 2015 harada et al 2016 it covers the period from 1958 coinciding with the establishment of the global radiosonde observing system to the present day the entire jra 55 production was completed in 2013 and it is now upgraded on a monthly time basis compared to its predecessor this reanalysis comes with a higher spatial resolution namely tl319l60 it consists of 60 vertical levels and a horizontal resolution of approximately 55km a new radiation scheme four dimensional variational data assimilation 4d var with a bias correction for satellite radiances varbc and an introduction of greenhouse gases with time varying concentrations a detailed analysis of the nemo3 6 lim3 performance under this reanalysis in the southern ocean area can be found in barthélemy et al 2017 the nemo surface module includes an on the fly interpolation of input forcing fields the core bulk formulae are here employed to compute the surface boundary condition fields and associated fluxes over both the ocean and sea ice surfaces large and yeager 2004 those formulae were initially developed to deal with the core forcing a mixture of ncep reanalysis and satellite data this bulk formulation requires eight input fields which are the zonal and meridional components of the 10m air velocity the 10m air temperature the specific humidity the incoming longwave radiation the incoming shortwave radiation as well as the liquid and solid precipitation rates all the variables are available at the three hourly frequency 2 3 experimental design as a baseline to the evaluation of our idealized retrospective predictions we performed a reference simulation covering the period 1958 2016 inclusive this simulation was initialized from rest with the temperature locarnini et al 2013 and salinity zweng et al 2013 fields from the woa13 the sea ice initialization was conducted as follows the ocean was assumed to be covered with sea ice everywhere the sst does not exceed the freezing temperature by more than 2 c the prescribed initial values for the snow depth and sit were 0 3m and 1m respectively regarding the sic it was fixed at 0 9 the initial ice salinity was 6 3g kg while the initial sea ice temperature was set equal to 270k the same temperature was initially applied to the snow we advocate use of the limited 1980 2016 period of our reference simulation to minimize the influence of the initialization procedure on the computed surface quantities however the small spinup phase between 1958 and 1980 cannot ensure the bottom ocean to be at equilibrium at the beginning of 1980 as sea ice is primarily driven by the atmospheric conditions and the state of the upper ocean we do not expect this non equilibrium regime to affect much our results it is worth saying that we do not expect the ocean surface to be at equilibrium anyway since the jra 55 reanalysis accounts for time varying concentrations of greenhouse gases a set of 37 ocean sea ice initial conditions 37 atmospheric forcing years 2 start dates hindcasts was generated to examine both influences of the perturbed boundary and initial conditions on seasonal antarctic sea ice predictions each hindcast was initialized from the ocean sea ice conditions prescribed by the reference simulation predictions were started in march 1st and september 1st for each of the 37 years included in the period 1980 2016 those two start dates approximately stand for the beginning of the sea ice growth and melt seasons the model was then integrated forward in time for one year forcing it with the 37 different atmospheric years available between 1980 and 2016 depending on the targeted objective these hindcasts are grouped differently as sketched in fig 1 we first evaluated the effect of different atmospheric forcing years on the dispersion of hindcasts initialized from the same ocean sea ice state this provided an estimation of the forecast uncertainty associated with the uncertainty of the evolution of the atmosphere based on past atmospheric conditions this kind of experiment also gave information about the timescales on which a seasonal sea ice prediction benefits from the knowledge of the ocean sea ice initial conditions to study this influence of the atmosphere we grouped the hindcasts by ocean sea ice initial conditions we created 37 ensembles each of them including 37 ensemble members all the ensemble members share the same ocean sea ice initial conditions but they are forced by 37 different atmospheric forcing years this method is also employed at uclouvain for the sea ice outlook exercises which are part of the sipn and sipn south projects visit https www arcus org sipn sea ice outlook and http acecrc org au sipn south for more information in parallel to the evaluation of the influence of the atmospheric conditions on an antarctic sea ice prediction we explored the isolated influence of a biased ocean sea ice initial state on a sea ice prediction by applying the same atmospheric forcing to multiple ocean sea ice initial states by grouping the hindcasts by atmospheric forcing years we were able to quantify the consequences of incorrectly initializing the ocean sea ice state in particular we identified the timescale on which inaccurate ocean sea ice initial conditions may spoil a sea ice prediction assuming perfect knowledge of the atmospheric conditions one year in advance the set of 37 ocean sea ice initial conditions samples all the possible ocean and sea ice climatological states between 1980 and 2016 2 4 a forced ocean sea ice model the use of a forced ocean sea ice model to evaluate the sensitivity of a given ocean sea ice initial state to multiple atmospheric conditions or the time of residence of introduced ocean sea ice anomalies under prescribed atmosphere inevitably hides some aspect about the importance of the coupled processes between the ocean and sea ice components and the overlying atmosphere especially feedbacks between the ocean sea ice and the atmosphere are not represented it is consequently impossible to test the positive impact of the initialization of the ocean and sea ice on the atmosphere or conversely to test how a badly initialized ocean sea ice state adversely affects the state of the atmosphere nonetheless the persistence of sea ice at the sub seasonal to seasonal timescales has been identified as the primary source of predictability for sea ice area properties chevallier et al 2019 persistence can even extend to several months for the total siv the interactions with the ocean are also found to sustain the sea ice predictability beyond persistence which exemplifies the need to work with a coupled ocean sea ice system on the contrary the added value of the initialization of the sea ice on the predictions of atmospheric quantities is more ambiguous while morioka et al 2019 identified a potential influence of the antarctic sic initialization on seasonal predictions of the regional atmospheric variability in the weddell sea and the atlantic sector of the southern ocean guemas et al 2016 reported no positive impact of the initialization of the ocean direct and sea ice indirect on the atmosphere prediction skill we therefore expect our forced ocean sea ice model to provide relevant information about the influence of the atmosphere and ocean sea ice initial conditions on seasonal sea ice predictions 3 results 3 1 sie and siv mean states we present in this section some aspects about the sie and siv mean state simulated by the nemo3 6 lim3 model when it is forced with the jra 55 reanalysis an exhaustive discussion of the quality of the antarctic sea ice representation over the period 1985 2014 simulated with the same model version and reanalysis is included in barthélemy et al 2017 as compared with observations the simulated sie mean state over the period 1980 2016 is characterized by a too low summer state and too high winter state fig 2 the minimum summer sie is underestimated by approximately 2 106 km2 while the maximum winter sie exceeds the observations by about the same value those biases lead to an overestimation of the amplitude of the seasonal antarctic sie variations and are associated with excessive sie melting and freezing rates most of the remnant summer sea ice is located in the weddell sea and the opening of the ross sea polynya is fairly well represented barthélemy et al 2017 showed with the same model that the atmospheric forcing has a strong influence on the minimum sie as well as the spatial distribution of sea ice at the minimum extent the excessive summer melt with jra 55 as compared to the other reanalyses is attributed to higher surface air temperatures in the weddell sea which suggests the importance of thermodynamic processes during the sea ice retreat in contrast to the summer limited differences are found between the winter sie states simulated with the three reanalyses the overestimation of the sie is observed for all the longitudes it can also be observed from fig 2 that the simulated sie seasonal cycle is shifted by about two weeks in comparison with observations except during the beginning of the melt season october and november for this specific period a slower than observed sie decline rate avoids the simulated sie to drop below the observed state the sie melting rate suddenly changes at the end of november when the sie undergoes an abrupt reduction the simulated sie decline is thus made of two different sloping portions characterizing two distinct melting regimes the observations feature a more gradual sie decline we will see in section 3 5 that the limited sie loss at the beginning of the melt season is expected to induce some sie predictability during this period due to the lack of a reliable climatology for the sit in the antarctic a rigorous assessment of the quality of the siv simulated by our model was not possible to achieve there is a critical need for in situ sit measurements their spatiotemporal coverage is rather limited and leaves most of the southern ocean unsampled in this context the retrieval of sit from remote sensors including satellite observations is an option but their validation remains an issue a review of the limitations associated with their use can be found in kern et al 2016 accordingly caution is warranted in quantitatively interpreting any estimate of the antarctic siv the total antarctic siv estimate of kurtz and markus 2012 is provided for information rather than for direct comparison with our reference simulation according to this dataset our model gives a reasonable estimate of the total siv in summer march and fall june the low sie simulated in summer could be responsible for the underestimation of the siv for this season the simulated and observed siv values mostly differ in late winter early spring november the simulated volume in winter is too high by almost a factor two with respect to satellite estimates multiple hypotheses can be formulated to explain this disagreement 1 the siv estimate in early spring is highly sensitive to the timing of the retreat season a slight shift as it is observed for the sie can induce large differences in siv estimates 2 barthélemy et al 2017 noted that the winter simulated siv is sensitive to the atmospheric reanalysis applied while the winter sie does not differ much between the simulations driven by three different atmospheric reanalyses the winter siv ranges from 16 103 km3 dfs to 20 103 km3 jra the difference is likely to originate from the differences in air temperatures 3 according to kern et al 2016 there is evidence that the estimate of kurtz and markus 2012 significantly underestimates the sea ice thickness because of the zero sea ice freeboard assumption used kwok and maksym 2014 kern and spreen 2015 to conclude we mention that the largest simulated winter sit are found in the weddell sea the western part of the ross sea and the bellingshausen and amundsen seas irrespective of the reanalysis used the averaged sit over a grid cell along the coastline can amount to 2m in those regions 3 2 presentation of the retrospective seasonal sea ice predictions 3 2 1 sea ice forecast uncertainty associated with an uncertain atmosphere we present in this section the implications of uncertain atmospheric conditions on a seasonal antarctic sea ice prediction starting a prediction from a given ocean sea ice state we judged the deterioration of the forecast accuracy by comparing the ensemble spread of each of the 37 ensembles to the variability of a reference simulation chosen here as the 1980 2016 control simulation we characterized the ensemble spread by the standard deviation of the ensemble members around their ensemble mean assuming that the predictions are initialized from an ocean sea ice state infinitesimally close to reality and that our sea ice forecast system is a faithful transposition of the climate system we explore the timescale on which skilful sie and siv predictions can be achieved potential predictability fig 3 red curves shows the potential predictability of the antarctic sie and siv red curves give the daily evolution of the ensemble standard deviation when hindcasts are started from the same ocean sea ice initial conditions and driven by multiple atmospheric forcing years as the ocean sea ice initial conditions are perfectly known there is no uncertainty in the initial conditions and the ensemble spread must be zero at the initial prediction lead time irrespective of the start date and the ocean sea ice initial state used to start the prediction the sie ensemble spread quickly grows with lead time the ensemble standard deviation reaches the climatological one after one month when initializing the ocean sea ice in march while a few days are enough when initializing it in september the predictability of the sie is thus said to be limited to one month a few days for the predictions started in march september for the rest of the predictions the ensemble and climatological standard deviation curves are indistinguishable from each other the sie variability peaks in january we noticed that the amplitude of the peak is sensitive to the metric used to diagnose the sea ice cover a lower peak being found for the sea ice area not shown compared to fig 3 a red curves fig 3 c red curves reveals for the siv that there is some predictive skill to be gained from the knowledge of the ocean sea ice initial conditions up to 10 months in advance the ensemble spread and the climatological standard deviation become of comparable magnitude in summer from january the ensemble spread steadily increases throughout the sea ice growing season i e from march to september it then remains approximately constant from september to november the siv ensemble spread jumps markedly at the beginning of the sea ice retreat season suggesting a summer melting barrier to siv predictions those observations about the siv ensemble spread apply regardless of the start date however the summer variability peak does no longer prevent the siv from being predicted from march when the predictions start in september for some ensembles the siv ensemble spread is well below the climatological reference and so for the whole period of prediction while the siv ensemble spread does not differ much between the ensembles throughout the siv growing season until november see fig 3 d red curves differences in the ensemble spread become noticeably larger after the summer variability peak the ensemble siv standard deviation in march ranges from 0 4 to 0 7 103 km3 depending on the ocean sea ice initial state this indicates that different ocean sea ice initial states can lead to distinct siv predictability horizons general considerations about the evolution of the sie and siv for the different hindcasts can be directly inferred from figures s1 and s2 of the supporting information they show the annual evolution of the differences between the forecasted sie siv and the control simulation they are complementary views of the analysis of the sie and siv predictability presented in this section 3 2 2 sea ice forecast uncertainty associated with an uncertain ocean sea ice initial state in this section we show how unsatisfactory it can be to attempt to produce the best possible sea ice forecasts from a biased ocean sea ice initial state even if the atmospheric conditions are perfectly known as in the previous section a measure of the ensemble spread for each ensemble is provided by the standard deviation of the ensemble members around their ensemble mean supplementary materials are also provided figures s3 and s4 to examine the individual evolution of each simulation as compared with the control simulation blue curves in fig 3 panels a and b illustrate the impact of an uncertain ocean sea ice initial state on antarctic sie predictions over one year by construction the ensemble standard deviation is equal to the climatological standard deviation at the initial time while this equality is verified for the ensembles started on march 1st the sie for the ensembles starting on september 1st almost immediately responds to the atmospheric forcing this causes the sie ensemble spread to drop during the first days of the simulation this means that any difference between the true hindcast i e the hindcast started from an ocean sea ice state coherent with the atmospheric forcing applied and the hindcasts initialized from a biased ocean sea ice state quickly dampens whatever the selected forcing year to drive the simulations started in september the ensemble spread is efficiently reduced after three days for the two start dates the sie standard deviation levels off around 0 2 106 km2 in september this important result suggests that any initial ocean sea ice error cannot be reduced to zero even if the atmospheric forcing is perfectly known one year in advance intrinsic fluctuations associated with the uncertainty in the ocean sea ice initial conditions remain we noticed that the magnitude of those fluctuations is independent of the metric used to assess the sea ice cover in particular the remaining ensemble spread is not attributable to the 15 threshold used in the definition of the sie for which small fluctuations around this value of the sic could induce an excessive sie disagreement it is also interesting to note that the limit of 0 2 106 km2 is reached independently of the start date and the atmospheric year chosen to force the simulations besides any further reduction of the ensemble spread is only achievable when going from one growing season to the next this last point can only be appreciated for the september start date as previously noticed for the ensemble initialized from the same ocean sea ice initial conditions we do observe for both start dates a peak in january in the sie ensemble standard deviation the position of this peak is controlled by the sea ice retreat rate which is maximum in absolute value during the first days of january not shown it can also be seen that the magnitude of the peak depends on the start date the predictions initialized in march that is far from the melt season display a weaker peak than the predictions initialized in september the annual evolution of an initial siv error is illustrated for the two start dates in fig 3 panels c and d blue curves as for the sie the initial siv ensemble standard deviation should be equal to the climatological variability the climatological standard deviation was estimated after detrending the data series of the control simulation to isolate the variability associated with the year to year siv fluctuations this accounts for the initial disagreement between both standard deviations especially visible for the september start date irrespective of the start date those plots show that the siv ensemble standard deviation is nearly constant through the period of the prediction until the melt season no matter the selected atmospheric forcing year the siv ensemble spread only starts to be reduced from november to february as a consequence an accurate siv forecast requires accurate ocean sea ice initial conditions this is especially true if an siv prediction is started between march and november as an initial siv error will not be reduced until the beginning of the melt season november even if the atmospheric forcing is perfectly known as for the evaluation of the predictability of the siv coming from the knowledge of the initial conditions in september fig 3 d red curves most of the differences between the ensembles arise in january 3 3 the uncertainty associated with an sie prediction we have seen in section 3 2 1 that the evolution of the antarctic sie is highly sensitive to the atmospheric forcing applied information about the sie initial state is lost after one month for the predictions starting in march while the loss is almost instantaneous for the predictions starting in september fig 3 panels a and b red curves the sensitivity of the sie initial conditions to the atmospheric forcing can also be recovered from the ensembles that are started from multiple ocean sea ice initial conditions and forced by a given atmosphere as stated in section 3 2 2 we noted that any member to member initial sie discrepancy on march 1st september 1st is efficiently reduced after one month a few days when those initial states are forced with the same atmosphere fig 3 panels a and b blue curves the different sie sensitivities to the atmospheric conditions observed for the two start dates can be inferred from fig 4 this figure illustrates the annual evolution of the coefficient of determination r 2 characterizing the regression relationship between the total sie and the extent of sea ice thicker than 0 2m 0 4m 0 6m and 0 8m respectively r 2 coefficients have been computed using a linear regression analysis computationally a grid cell is said to be thicker than x m if the averaged sit over the grid cell area actually covered by sea ice is at least x m fig 4 shows that the contribution to the sie variability explained by the different ice thickness categories that we defined is highly seasonal in early march relatively thick ice that is sea ice thicker than 0 4m contributes for 40 to the sie variability while this number drops to nearly zero in september the contribution of very thin ice to the total sie variability can be appreciated by looking at the jump in the r 2 coefficients when sea ice thicker than 0 4m or sea ice thicker than 0 2m is considered we see that the total sie variability in winter can only be explained by considering the very thin ice consequently the sie initial state in september is more likely to be rapidly modified by the atmospheric forcing than the sie initial state in march as thin ice accounts for much of the total sie variability in september previous studies but carried out with fully coupled atmosphere ocean sea ice models holland et al 2013 zunz et al 2014 marchi et al 2018 have shown skilful sie ice edge predictions over longer timescales they notably highlighted the role of the ocean as a source of memory for the sie ice edge location in those studies the sie is found to be predictable when the interactions between the ocean surface and its interior are effective the dominating influence of the atmosphere on the evolution of the sie hindcasts suggests that the ocean does not play such a central role in our simulations to verify this we computed the prognostic potential predictability ppp see pohlmann et al 2004 of the ohc this measure of potential predictability compares the ensemble spread to the model internal variability derived from the control simulation if the ppp is close to 1 the ensemble spread is much smaller than the model internal variability and the ohc is said to be predictable if the ppp is equal to or lower than 0 the predictability resulting from the knowledge of the initial conditions is said to be lost the ohc is computed over the first 50m to capture the predictability of the ocean that is relevant for the interactions with the surface it can be seen from fig 5 that the ocean rapidly loses its predictability as the sea ice grows that is as the mixed layer deepens and gets deeper than 50m and the interactions between the surface and the ocean interior become effective by contrast fig 6 indicates that the ohc computed between 100m and 200m remains predictable over one year this is because the ocean mixed layer rarely exceeds 100m which prevents this layer to interact with the surface 3 4 the uncertainty associated with an siv prediction in contrast to the sie the predictability of the siv coming from the knowledge of the ocean sea ice initial conditions extends to several months the atmospheric conditions imposed by the different forcing years induce less differentiation between the ensemble members fig 3 panels c and d red curves similarly for the hindcasts grouped by atmospheric forcing year we found that any error in the siv initial conditions can only be reduced during the melt season fig 3 panels c and d blue curves this is in stark contrast with the sie for which the reduction of an initial error is effective on the first lead day we identified the persistence of the siv initial conditions as the origin of the siv predictability or conversely of the non reduction of the member to member siv initial differences for the ensembles starting from multiple ocean sea ice conditions in march we computed the persistence of the initial siv ensemble anomalies figs 7 and 8 the persistence was characterized in terms of lagged correlations that is the correlations between the siv anomalies integrated over a given domain in march and the siv anomalies the following months one initial month with multiple target months similar conclusions hold for the september start date in particular when the persistence is evaluated after the melt season the term lagged correlation must be interpreted with caution here as we did not exactly correlate the two same variables we correlated the siv integrated over a given region in march with the local siv at different lag times the use of the total summer siv was motivated by the fact that the advection of the siv anomalies and the local divergence convergence of the sea ice might blur the correlations at the local scale consequently the persistence was difficult to trace furthermore the time lagged relationship between the siv and its future state was not evaluated from a single long simulation as commonly done in studies dealing with persistence see for instance ordoñez et al 2018 this approach supposes to compute for an initial time and a target time as many differences anomalies between the simulation and its climatological mean as there are years in the simulation we took advantage of the ensembles created to compute for each ensemble the anomalies between the ensemble members and the hindcast forced with the proper atmospheric year we thus performed the correlations over the ensemble dimension rather than over time those considerations about the lagged correlations yield the following formula 1 cor τ 1 n n 1 37 m 1 37 y n m t y n n t y n m t τ y n n t τ m 1 37 y n m t y n n t 2 m 1 37 y n m t τ y n n t τ 2 1 2 where the summation index m denotes a numbering of all possible ocean sea ice initial conditions m 1 1980 m 37 2016 while the n index samples the atmospheric forcing years which are used to drive the simulations n 1 1980 n 37 2016 y n m y n m corresponds to the prediction started from the ocean sea ice conditions prescribed by the m th year and driven by the atmospheric conditions of the n th year y n n therefore corresponds to the control simulation at the time of the n th forcing year this implies that the anomalies are computed relative to the control simulation which represents for each ensemble the simulation started from the best possible ocean sea ice initial state departures from the control simulation at the reference time t march are then tracked for nine months so that the lag time τ varies between 0 march and 8 november it was not possible to directly evaluate the persistence of the remaining siv in march at the hemispherical scale this is because the sea ice variability in the southern ocean has a complex spatial structure a positive negative siv anomaly at the hemispherical scale does not necessarily translate into a positive negative siv anomaly at the regional scale we thus decided to track the evolution of the summer siv for each basin individually in the following we focus on the weddell and ross seas similar results are found for the indian ocean the western pacific ocean and the bellingshausen amundsen seas not shown consequently y t will refer to the total remaining siv in march in the weddell ross sea while y t τ will be the monthly mean siv simulated at all gridpoints at lag time τ maps of the correlations c o r are presented in figs 7 and 8 for the weddell and ross seas respectively unsurprisingly figs 7 and 8 show high correlations for the lag 0 month departures from one are due to the use of the aggregate siv lagged correlations at subsequent lags are characterized by a shift towards lower latitudes of the highest correlations based on the age of the sea ice not shown the advection of the siv anomalies is regarded as a plausible candidate to explain the shift the role of the advection is reinforced by the pathway followed by the high correlations notably in the weddell sea where the correlations are transported along the weddell gyre the persistence of the siv initial conditions figs 7 and 8 suggests that a perfectly forecasted atmosphere does not prevent initial member to member siv discrepancies to hold this is consistent with fig 3 c blue curves which indicates that the siv ensemble spread remains constant from march to november the siv ensemble spread then sharply decreases a direct comparison with fig 2 suggests that the reduction of the siv ensemble spread coincides with the reduction of the siv in the mean state we do not expect the diminution of the siv mean state to be directly responsible for the reduction of the siv ensemble spread though this statement is motivated by the evolution of the siv standard deviation derived from the reference simulation black line in fig 3 c the siv standard deviation in the reference simulation does not decrease with the melt of sea ice it even increases keeping in mind that in forced mode the atmospheric forcing fully specifies where the sea ice must melt and where it can survive regardless of its thickness we present a geometrical spatial argument to explain the reduction of the siv ensemble spread from november to february the atmospheric forcing is inefficient to reduce any initial siv difference from march to november because the air temperature does not allow the sea ice to melt in regions where its thickness is different between the ensemble members furthermore the summer sea ice that remains in march is thick and isolated on top by the snow as a result it cannot be easily modified by the atmospheric forcing and the introduced siv anomalies hold until november figs 7 and 8 the siv ensemble spread also remains at about the same value in september when the maximum of the sie is observed this shows that the sea ice melt does not initiate the reduction of the siv ensemble spread the beginning of the melt season is mainly characterized by the melt of thin ice that has been formed in late winter and has a weak impact on the siv ensemble spread from november however part of the existing sea ice in march has been advected northwards and is now available for melting as sea ice melts the regions where the simulated siv is different between the ensemble members become less extended as the siv is an integrated quantity the siv ensemble spread must consequently reduce fig 3 panels c and d blue curves also indicates that most of the differences between the ensembles have their origin in february that is at the end of the melt season we noticed that the siv ensemble spread and the siv ensemble mean are positively correlated for that month not shown that is a high siv mean state in february is associated with a large siv ensemble spread this is because a high siv mean state is the result of atmospheric conditions that induce a moderate sea ice melt if the atmospheric forcing melts less sea ice then a significant part of the initial member to member siv differences will remain 3 5 a link between sie and siv uncertainties a direct comparison between panels a and c and panels b and d of fig 3 red curves reveals that siv predictability does not necessarily imply sie predictability while knowing exactly the siv state in march adequately constrains the evolution of the sie during the first month of prediction the sie and siv are completely disconnected from each other from the first lead days for the predictions initialized in september whereas an analysis at the hemispheric scale of the sie and siv does not demonstrate any positive impact of the siv predictability on the sie predictability after the first lead month we noticed at the regional scale that the siv predictability may turn into sie predictability from october to december for the predictions started in september fig 9 red curves shows a net reduction of the sie ensemble spread for all the ensembles grouped by initial condition from mid october this reduction holds until december when the ensemble spread goes back to the climatological variability the regional sie predictions starting on march 1st as well as the regional siv predictions for the two start dates are presented in figures s5 and s6 of the supporting information respectively the reduction of the sie ensemble spread has been identified in four of the five sectors that we defined those sectors are the indian ocean the western pacific ocean the ross sea and the bellingshausen amundsen seas refer to the caption of fig 9 for the definition of the regional divisions the weddell sea is the only sector for which a net reduction of the ensemble spread is not observed as the weddell sea sector contributes for one third of the total sie it presumably explains why this reduction is not observed in the total sie ensemble spread either besides this drop in sie ensemble spread is shared by all the ensembles and takes place simultaneously for all the ensemble members in mid october this means that the reduction is not preconditioned by any of the ocean sea ice initial states used to understand the reemergence of the sie predictability we looked at the joint evolution of the sie and siv in the reference simulation over the period 1980 2016 a scatter plot of the yearly cycle of the total sie versus total siv averaged over this period is provided in fig 10 note that similar conclusions can be drawn from the evolutions of the sie and siv for each sector individually figure s7 of the supporting information three distinct phases can be distinguished from fig 10 during the melt season the first phase extending from september to october corresponds to a period when the evolutions of the sie and siv are out of phase while the sie is already diminishing from september the siv still increases and only reaches its maximum value at the end of october due to the strong melt occurring at the end of this phase the very thin ice up to 0 2m which explains as much as 50 of the sie variability in early october fig 4 disappears this leaves the ocean with thicker sea ice second phase for which the siv was found to be highly persistent figs 7 and 8 the sie is consequently better constrained by the siv which leads to some sie predictability from the end of october to december the siv predictability coming from the knowledge of the initial conditions can now effectively transfer to the sie the sie ensemble spread finally goes back to the climatology in mid december third phase when the sea ice undergoes a melting regime change while a siv loss of about 5 103 km3 is associated with a sie loss of about 2 5 106 km2 in phase 2 see fig 10 the sie loss doubles for a same siv loss in phase 3 the siv in phase 3 regulates much less effectively the sie losses the atmospheric variability dominates the evolution of the siv and consequently of the sie accordingly it gives a reasonable explanation of the limitation of the reemergence of the sie predictability to december the change in sie siv melting regime between phase 2 and phase 3 is a robust feature of the version of nemo3 6 lim3 that we used we observed a similar transition in spring when the model is forced with the two other reanalyses used in barthélemy et al 2017 due to the lack of a reliable antarctic sit climatology we were however unable to validate the strength of this transition in observations we also noticed that the start date does matter for the experiments starting on march 1st the sie ensemble spread no longer drops below the climatological spread figure s5 of the supporting information this is coherent with an increased siv ensemble spread simulated for the same period see fig 3 c and d red curves and figure s6 of the supporting information 4 discussion the uncertainty about the future state of the atmosphere is a serious limitation to the realization of skilful seasonal antarctic sie predictions furthermore the skill of seasonal antarctic sie predictions driven by multiple atmospheric forcing years relies heavily on the prediction start date while skilful sie predictions can be achieved one month in advance if the ocean sea ice state is perfectly initialized on march 1st fig 3 a red curves skilful sie predictions are limited to a few days for the predictions starting on september 1st fig 3 b red curves to understand the relative performance of the ensemble predictions relating to the two start dates we invoked the contribution of different sea ice thickness categories to the total sie variability fig 4 this analysis revealed that very thin ice 0 2 m dictates the variability of the total sie in september while relatively thick ice 0 4 m explains a significant part of the total sie variability in early march the initialization of the ocean sea ice conditions the siv in particular does not improve the sie predictions in september because the sea ice near the sea ice edge is thin while the initial siv conditions adequately constrain the evolution of the sie in march for the first lead month the evolution of the sie in september is primarily controlled by the applied atmospheric conditions the dominating influence of the atmosphere on the evolution of the forecasted sie can also be deduced from the predictions started from multiple initial conditions and forced by the same atmospheric forcing year fig 3 panels a and b blue curves an important underlying feature of those experiments concerns the introduced sie anomaly in the initial conditions it turns out that they cannot be totally reduced even if the atmosphere was perfectly predictable for one year a residual sie ensemble spread of 0 2 106 km2 is found independently of the start date march 1st or september 1st the origin of those fluctuations remains unclear they might be caused by the initial member to member ocean differences which are rapidly reduced by the atmospheric forcing the limited influence of the ocean on our sie predictions suggests that part of the prediction skill should be attributed to the coupling between the ocean sea ice and the atmosphere sea ice predictions in forced mode prevent the exchange of information from the ocean and sea ice to the atmosphere the slow varying components that represent sea ice and the ocean cannot mitigate the growth of an initial atmospheric anomaly which makes initially close ocean sea ice states to quickly diverge it appears that the atmospheric forcing not only governs the evolution of the surface but also the state of the ocean mixed layer see fig 5 as a result the oceanic upper layer rapidly forgets its past surface conditions leading to a marked decrease in sie predictability in particular the ocean is expected to influence the sea ice advance from one season to the next through an sst linked reemergence mechanism that involves the mixed layer seasonal cycle holland et al 2013 zunz et al 2014 marchi et al 2018 while this mechanism was previously identified in fully coupled climate models its absence in our model might again reflect the leading influence of the coupling with the atmosphere on the computed surface quantities nonetheless marchi et al 2018 notified that the ec earth2 2 model was the only model out of the six assessed not to include the reemergence mechanism for this model the sst anomalies are not efficiently stored in the ocean subsurface during summer months interestingly ec earth2 2 embedded nemo and lim not the same versions as ocean and sea ice components our model might impose the same limitation on the reemergence of the sst anomalies in comparison with the sie skilful siv predictions for the predictions driven by multiple atmospheric forcing years might be achieved for the whole period of prediction that is for one year fig 3 panels c and d red curves nonetheless the melt season was found to significantly degrade the quality of the siv predictions the siv ensemble spread remarkably peaks in austral spring from november to february for all the tested ocean sea ice initial conditions which suggests that the evolution of the siv is primarily controlled by the atmospheric conditions at this time of the year this result agrees with the study of ordoñez et al 2018 while the total siv anomalies are highly persistent in both hemispheres they noticed that antarctic siv anomalies rapidly lose memory during the melt season nonetheless the persistence of the siv initial conditions figs 7 and 8 which is mostly confined to the inner ice pack is expected to advance or delay by a few days the effect of melt on the ice edge retreat as soon as the thin ice disappears this assertion is supported by the increase of the sie ensemble spread from november in fig 3 panels a and b blue curves and by fig 4 which shows the role of thick ice in explaining the sie variability the influence of the ocean can be ruled out as fig 5 demonstrated that its upper state is mainly driven by the atmospheric forcing applied during the sea ice retreat no ohc predictability the influence of persistent siv initial conditions on the sie conditions is consistent with fig 9 red curves this figure shows at the regional scale that the initialization of the siv can induce some sie predictability at the beginning of the sea ice melt season as soon as the thin ice disappears mid october in four of the five sectors that we defined a net reduction of the sie ensemble spread compared to the climatological spread is observed from mid october to december there is evidence that the reemergence of the sie predictability in early spring is related to the way the sea ice retreat is simulated by the model we distinguished three phases during the melt season which are consistent with the timing of the improvement of the sie predictability fig 10 the weddell sea is the only region where the sie predictability does not improve in the austral spring although the three phases mentioned above are also simulated for this region this suggests that the described relationship between the sie and the siv is not a sufficient condition for the sie predictability to reemerge aspects of the local sit goosse et al 2009 and the winds may also be important a recent study by morioka et al 2019 also showed the leading role of the atmosphere in performing skilful antarctic sie predictions they demonstrated the positive influence of the sic initialization on the regional atmospheric variability in the weddell sea those improvements might in turn positively contribute to the quality of sic predictions over the weddell sea during the austral spring 5 conclusions we view the present study as a first attempt to address the respective contributions of the perturbed atmosphere and ocean sea ice initial conditions to the limitation of accurate seasonal antarctic sea ice predictions we used the ocean sea ice model nemo3 6 lim3 driven by the atmospheric reanalysis jra 55 to appreciate the relative importance of these two sources of uncertainties in a perfect model framework we have shown that the seasonal evolution of the antarctic sie primarily responds to the atmospheric conditions for the predictions forced by multiple atmospheric conditions the potential predictability of the sie rapidly decreases with lead time whatever the start date used march 1st or september 1st unlike the sie the siv can be potentially predicted until the melt season at least siv predictions are less sensitive to the atmospheric forcing years applied this predictability arises from the high persistence of the siv initial conditions contrary to the predictions performed with fully coupled climate models the upper ocean has not been identified as a source of memory for the antarctic sie we found that the predictability of the ohc over the first 50m rapidly decreases as soon as the interactions between the surface and the ocean interior become effective deepening of the mixed layer the limited influence of the ocean on the sea ice is hypothesized to result from the absence of feedbacks between the ocean and the atmosphere previous studies on the predictability of the antarctic sea ice might have underestimated the importance of the interactions between the ocean surface and the atmosphere for the realization of skilful sie predictions this study has also demonstrated the importance of the ocean sea ice initial conditions to perform skilful seasonal antarctic sea ice predictions under a presumed perfect knowledge of the atmospheric conditions one year in advance having a proper estimate of the siv during the growing season is essential as an error in the siv initial state will not be reduced until the melt season if adequately initialized the summer siv can further be used to constrain the evolution of the sie at the beginning of the sea ice growing season march and at the onset of the sea ice retreat as soon as the thin ice has disappeared the initialization of the sea ice thickness would therefore be desirable for real forecasts credit authorship contribution statement sylvain marchi conceptualization methodology software

23978,dynamical climate models have been extensively used over the last decade to perform seasonal sea ice predictions in the context of ensemble forecasting to date the sensitivity to the initial conditions has received the most attention through the evaluation of the theoretical limit of antarctic sea ice predictability imposed by the chaotic evolution of the climate system the respective contributions of perturbed ocean sea ice initial conditions and perturbed atmospheric boundary conditions to this predictability remains unevaluated though using the coupled ocean sea ice model nemo3 6 lim3 we developed a suitable framework for evaluating both influences on seasonal antarctic sea ice predictions this study reveals that the uncertainty associated with the evolution of the atmospheric conditions is a major limitation to the realization of skilful sea ice extent sie predictions however it has a limited impact on sea ice volume siv predictions the discrepancies between the sie and siv predictabilities have been attributed to the presence of very thin ice which accounts for much of the sie variability in winter we also demonstrated that an incorrect estimate of the ocean sea ice initial conditions has a weaker but not negligible influence the time evolution of different plausible ocean sea ice initial conditions under perfect knowledge of the atmospheric conditions suggest that the initial sie errors cannot be totally reduced by the atmospheric forcing they even increase during the melt season the high persistence of the siv anomalies is found to be responsible for this behaviour these findings imply that a correct initialization of the sea ice thickness sit might be more important than previously thought for seasonal antarctic sea ice predictions especially if one wants to predict the sie during the melt season keywords earth science cryosphere sea ice antarctic predictions initial conditions 1 introduction several initiatives have flourished over the last decades in the earth s science community to understand diagnose track and predict climate changes to come the sea ice community is no exception to the rule the 2007 year with an unforeseen summer arctic sea ice cover loss sounds like an emergency signal and exemplifies the need for developing efficient prediction systems the sea ice prediction network sipn was initiated and provides a solid framework for advancing predictability of sea ice notably by supporting the sea ice outlook contributions see the sipn website at https www arcus org sipn presentations and publications the arctic seasonal sea ice predictions received much attention yet see for instance guemas et al 2014 tietsche et al 2014 day et al 2016 hawkins et al 2016 bushuk et al 2017 and blockley and peterson 2018 the antarctic counterpart is still in its infancy the disproportion between the two hemispheres probably arises from historical reasons with much of the continents being situated in the northern hemisphere but might now be motivated by the opportunity that represents an open summer arctic basin for transit shipping through the arctic ocean melia et al 2017 sea ice is linked to the evolution of the atmosphere and ocean we can thus expect the timescale on which sea ice can be predicted to be bounded by the inherent memory associated with those two media that is from a coupled of weeks for the atmosphere to a few seasons for the ocean frankignoul and hasselmann 1977 deser et al 2003 chevallier et al 2019 due to its ocean origin sea ice might be expected to have a persistence comparable to the one of the ocean however the geometrical configuration of the southern ocean makes the antarctic sea ice more mobile than the arctic one offshore it is characterized by a close to free drift state holland and kwok 2012 winds cause sea ice to move northwards into warmer waters where it eventually melts moreover antarctic sea ice is primarily seasonal it is therefore thinner than its arctic counterpart for those reasons sea ice motion is expected to be strongly affected by winds which have therefore the potential to limit the sea ice predictability beyond months chevallier et al 2019 see their fig 2 due to the timescale on which seasonal predictions operate any prediction performed with a climate model will suffer from poorly known initial conditions and model biases even in the case of a fully observed climate state in terms of spatial coverage and a full understanding and accurate representation of all the biological chemical and physical processes in climate models an infinitely accurate forecast would be out of reach because of the limited accuracy of measurements see bunzel et al 2016 for instance due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions any small departures from the real climate state will inevitably grow and render the forecast useless after some lead time firstly introduced by lorenz 1963 one often refers to this problem as the chaotic nature of the climate system the sensitivity of dynamical models to the unavoidable small errors in their initial conditions can be typically isolated from model biases using a perfect model approach this method gives some insight about the inherent ability of a climate model to predict itself that is the ability of the model to predict the actual climate if it would faithfully represent all the processes governing the climate system previous studies dedicated to this problem showed skilful predictions of the antarctic sie and sea ice edge up to a few months in advance holland et al 2013 zunz et al 2014 marchi et al 2018 however the predictability is limited to the sea ice growing season and the whole winter the origin of this predictability has been attributed to the memory associated with the ocean heat content ohc holland et al 2013 showed that the sea surface temperatures ssts near the sea ice edge during the sea ice growing season are correlated with the ssts of the previous winter at the same location although the sst anomalies are directly relevant to prescribe the sea ice edge location they are not predictable at most places in summer in some regions however the winter sst anomalies extend through the ocean mixed layer and are efficiently isolated from the surface once the mixed layer shoals in summer those heat anomalies resurface when brine rejection causes the subsurface waters to be re entrained into the deepening mixed layer by this mechanism the sea ice edge and sie predictability can reemerge between two sea ice growing seasons marchi et al 2018 suggested that the ocean convection activity modulates the efficiency of this reemergence mechanism in climate models it is interesting to note that this mechanism was also found in the arctic bushuk et al 2017 suggesting that arctic and antarctic sea ice could share common predictability properties despite the apparent differences in the processes governing their evolution a first attempt to evaluate the impact of the knowledge of the initial conditions on real sea ice predictions on seasonal timescales was provided in guemas et al 2016 through the initialization of the ocean and atmosphere the sea ice component was not initialized directly from observations but from a sea ice reconstruction which provides a complete description of the sea ice initial state but also consistency with the atmospheric and oceanic reanalyses used it turns out that initializing the winter sea ice state from its best possible observational estimate does not improve the skill of sea ice predictions this study rather pointed out the role of the ocean heat content again which acts as a source of memory for sea ice and provides skilful sea ice forecasts for two months during the freezing season drivers of the recent changes in the southern ocean sea ice remain an open question the modest overall increase in antarctic sea ice cover 1 5 per decade 1981 2010 masks substantial regional disparities and significant interannual variability over the recent years with multiple record high 2012 14 and record low 2016 18 sie parkinson 2019 recent studies acknowledged the prime role of the atmosphere notably through the setting up of anomalous circulation patterns stuecker et al 2017 reid et al 2017 turner et al 2017 however there is also evidence that those unusual atmospheric conditions have triggered the release of heat stored in the subsurface ocean lecomte et al 2017 meehl et al 2019 wang et al 2019 kusahara et al 2018 addressed the record low antarctic sie in 2017 by performing retrospective sea ice predictions and confirmed that the ocean thermal conditions have played a role however the relative roles of atmosphere and ocean as drivers of the recent changes in antarctic sea ice are still not well known hobbs et al 2016 based on those findings the present study aims at giving new insights about the relative contributions of the atmosphere and ocean including sea ice to the realization of skilful antarctic sea ice predictions on the seasonal timescale to address this question we decided to work in a perfect model framework to avoid errors arising from model imperfections a description of the experiments that we carried out to isolate and evaluate the forecast uncertainties attributable to 1 the atmospheric variability and 2 an inaccurate incomplete estimate of the ocean sea ice initial conditions is provided in section 2 model estimates of these two sources of uncertainties are presented in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 as we will see those sections give complementary views on the forecast uncertainty associated with an sie and siv prediction for this reason we decided to discuss the implications of the two sources of uncertainties for the sie and siv in sections 3 3 and 3 4 respectively section 3 5 finally deals with the possible implications of the siv predictive skills on the sie one a discussion of our results is then provided in section 4 conclusions and perspectives about this work can be found in section 5 2 model and methods 2 1 model setup our hindcasts were performed using version 3 6 of the nucleus for european modelling of the ocean nemo model madec and the nemo team 2008 a global ocean configuration with a 1 resolution is used to resolve the primitive equations that describe the ocean flow prognostic variables are the three dimensional velocity field the sea surface height the conservative temperature and the absolute salinity this model offers multiple ways to deal with vertical mixing in the ocean a turbulent closure scheme combining the turbulent kinetic energy tke with a turbulent length scale is employed here to compute the vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivities madec et al 1998 within nemo the ocean is interfaced with the louvain la neuve sea ice model lim3 6 which is a dynamic thermodynamic sea ice model a description of this model as it is incorporated into the stable release of nemo3 6 is given in rousset et al 2015 here is a non exhaustive list of the lim3 6 features to account for the ice thickness distribution itd at the sub grid scale a description of the ice thickness into multiple categories 5 by default has been implemented this discretization involves the computation of the ice concentration ice volume per unit area ice internal energy ice salt content snow volume per unit area and snow internal energy for each category separately the ice dynamics is formulated on a c grid the momentum equation being resolved using the elastic viscous plastic rheology formulation of bouillon et al 2013 runoff data consist of a monthly climatology the river runoffs can be distributed over different ocean levels south of 60 s estimates of the coastal freshwater discharge from the ice shelf melt are used depoorter et al 2013 the contribution to the freshwater flux of the iceberg melt in the southern ocean is also taken into account merino et al 2016 in addition to the prescribed freshwater fluxes the sea surface salinity sss is restored towards the world ocean atlas 2013 monthly climatology woa13 zweng et al 2013 to prevent spurious model drift the negative feedback coefficient associated with this sss restoring is 167mm day it corresponds to a relaxation timescale of 300 days for a 50m mixed layer depth to avoid a misrepresentation of the interactions between the ocean and sea ice the sss restoring term is modulated by the presence of sea ice multiplied by one minus the sea ice concentration sic the sss restoring has been equally activated for the reference simulation and the hindcasts this restoring does not provide any additional constraint on the evolution of our predictions it has nearly no impact on the ensemble characteristics that we have analysed not shown a complete description of the model configuration used is reported in barthélemy et al 2017 2 2 atmospheric forcing used the nemo engine provides a wide variety of model configurations and setup in this study we used a global configuration with the ocean and sea ice forced by the atmosphere making no use of data assimilation the chosen atmospheric reanalysis to force the model is jra 55 the japanese 55 year reanalysis kobayashi et al 2015 harada et al 2016 it covers the period from 1958 coinciding with the establishment of the global radiosonde observing system to the present day the entire jra 55 production was completed in 2013 and it is now upgraded on a monthly time basis compared to its predecessor this reanalysis comes with a higher spatial resolution namely tl319l60 it consists of 60 vertical levels and a horizontal resolution of approximately 55km a new radiation scheme four dimensional variational data assimilation 4d var with a bias correction for satellite radiances varbc and an introduction of greenhouse gases with time varying concentrations a detailed analysis of the nemo3 6 lim3 performance under this reanalysis in the southern ocean area can be found in barthélemy et al 2017 the nemo surface module includes an on the fly interpolation of input forcing fields the core bulk formulae are here employed to compute the surface boundary condition fields and associated fluxes over both the ocean and sea ice surfaces large and yeager 2004 those formulae were initially developed to deal with the core forcing a mixture of ncep reanalysis and satellite data this bulk formulation requires eight input fields which are the zonal and meridional components of the 10m air velocity the 10m air temperature the specific humidity the incoming longwave radiation the incoming shortwave radiation as well as the liquid and solid precipitation rates all the variables are available at the three hourly frequency 2 3 experimental design as a baseline to the evaluation of our idealized retrospective predictions we performed a reference simulation covering the period 1958 2016 inclusive this simulation was initialized from rest with the temperature locarnini et al 2013 and salinity zweng et al 2013 fields from the woa13 the sea ice initialization was conducted as follows the ocean was assumed to be covered with sea ice everywhere the sst does not exceed the freezing temperature by more than 2 c the prescribed initial values for the snow depth and sit were 0 3m and 1m respectively regarding the sic it was fixed at 0 9 the initial ice salinity was 6 3g kg while the initial sea ice temperature was set equal to 270k the same temperature was initially applied to the snow we advocate use of the limited 1980 2016 period of our reference simulation to minimize the influence of the initialization procedure on the computed surface quantities however the small spinup phase between 1958 and 1980 cannot ensure the bottom ocean to be at equilibrium at the beginning of 1980 as sea ice is primarily driven by the atmospheric conditions and the state of the upper ocean we do not expect this non equilibrium regime to affect much our results it is worth saying that we do not expect the ocean surface to be at equilibrium anyway since the jra 55 reanalysis accounts for time varying concentrations of greenhouse gases a set of 37 ocean sea ice initial conditions 37 atmospheric forcing years 2 start dates hindcasts was generated to examine both influences of the perturbed boundary and initial conditions on seasonal antarctic sea ice predictions each hindcast was initialized from the ocean sea ice conditions prescribed by the reference simulation predictions were started in march 1st and september 1st for each of the 37 years included in the period 1980 2016 those two start dates approximately stand for the beginning of the sea ice growth and melt seasons the model was then integrated forward in time for one year forcing it with the 37 different atmospheric years available between 1980 and 2016 depending on the targeted objective these hindcasts are grouped differently as sketched in fig 1 we first evaluated the effect of different atmospheric forcing years on the dispersion of hindcasts initialized from the same ocean sea ice state this provided an estimation of the forecast uncertainty associated with the uncertainty of the evolution of the atmosphere based on past atmospheric conditions this kind of experiment also gave information about the timescales on which a seasonal sea ice prediction benefits from the knowledge of the ocean sea ice initial conditions to study this influence of the atmosphere we grouped the hindcasts by ocean sea ice initial conditions we created 37 ensembles each of them including 37 ensemble members all the ensemble members share the same ocean sea ice initial conditions but they are forced by 37 different atmospheric forcing years this method is also employed at uclouvain for the sea ice outlook exercises which are part of the sipn and sipn south projects visit https www arcus org sipn sea ice outlook and http acecrc org au sipn south for more information in parallel to the evaluation of the influence of the atmospheric conditions on an antarctic sea ice prediction we explored the isolated influence of a biased ocean sea ice initial state on a sea ice prediction by applying the same atmospheric forcing to multiple ocean sea ice initial states by grouping the hindcasts by atmospheric forcing years we were able to quantify the consequences of incorrectly initializing the ocean sea ice state in particular we identified the timescale on which inaccurate ocean sea ice initial conditions may spoil a sea ice prediction assuming perfect knowledge of the atmospheric conditions one year in advance the set of 37 ocean sea ice initial conditions samples all the possible ocean and sea ice climatological states between 1980 and 2016 2 4 a forced ocean sea ice model the use of a forced ocean sea ice model to evaluate the sensitivity of a given ocean sea ice initial state to multiple atmospheric conditions or the time of residence of introduced ocean sea ice anomalies under prescribed atmosphere inevitably hides some aspect about the importance of the coupled processes between the ocean and sea ice components and the overlying atmosphere especially feedbacks between the ocean sea ice and the atmosphere are not represented it is consequently impossible to test the positive impact of the initialization of the ocean and sea ice on the atmosphere or conversely to test how a badly initialized ocean sea ice state adversely affects the state of the atmosphere nonetheless the persistence of sea ice at the sub seasonal to seasonal timescales has been identified as the primary source of predictability for sea ice area properties chevallier et al 2019 persistence can even extend to several months for the total siv the interactions with the ocean are also found to sustain the sea ice predictability beyond persistence which exemplifies the need to work with a coupled ocean sea ice system on the contrary the added value of the initialization of the sea ice on the predictions of atmospheric quantities is more ambiguous while morioka et al 2019 identified a potential influence of the antarctic sic initialization on seasonal predictions of the regional atmospheric variability in the weddell sea and the atlantic sector of the southern ocean guemas et al 2016 reported no positive impact of the initialization of the ocean direct and sea ice indirect on the atmosphere prediction skill we therefore expect our forced ocean sea ice model to provide relevant information about the influence of the atmosphere and ocean sea ice initial conditions on seasonal sea ice predictions 3 results 3 1 sie and siv mean states we present in this section some aspects about the sie and siv mean state simulated by the nemo3 6 lim3 model when it is forced with the jra 55 reanalysis an exhaustive discussion of the quality of the antarctic sea ice representation over the period 1985 2014 simulated with the same model version and reanalysis is included in barthélemy et al 2017 as compared with observations the simulated sie mean state over the period 1980 2016 is characterized by a too low summer state and too high winter state fig 2 the minimum summer sie is underestimated by approximately 2 106 km2 while the maximum winter sie exceeds the observations by about the same value those biases lead to an overestimation of the amplitude of the seasonal antarctic sie variations and are associated with excessive sie melting and freezing rates most of the remnant summer sea ice is located in the weddell sea and the opening of the ross sea polynya is fairly well represented barthélemy et al 2017 showed with the same model that the atmospheric forcing has a strong influence on the minimum sie as well as the spatial distribution of sea ice at the minimum extent the excessive summer melt with jra 55 as compared to the other reanalyses is attributed to higher surface air temperatures in the weddell sea which suggests the importance of thermodynamic processes during the sea ice retreat in contrast to the summer limited differences are found between the winter sie states simulated with the three reanalyses the overestimation of the sie is observed for all the longitudes it can also be observed from fig 2 that the simulated sie seasonal cycle is shifted by about two weeks in comparison with observations except during the beginning of the melt season october and november for this specific period a slower than observed sie decline rate avoids the simulated sie to drop below the observed state the sie melting rate suddenly changes at the end of november when the sie undergoes an abrupt reduction the simulated sie decline is thus made of two different sloping portions characterizing two distinct melting regimes the observations feature a more gradual sie decline we will see in section 3 5 that the limited sie loss at the beginning of the melt season is expected to induce some sie predictability during this period due to the lack of a reliable climatology for the sit in the antarctic a rigorous assessment of the quality of the siv simulated by our model was not possible to achieve there is a critical need for in situ sit measurements their spatiotemporal coverage is rather limited and leaves most of the southern ocean unsampled in this context the retrieval of sit from remote sensors including satellite observations is an option but their validation remains an issue a review of the limitations associated with their use can be found in kern et al 2016 accordingly caution is warranted in quantitatively interpreting any estimate of the antarctic siv the total antarctic siv estimate of kurtz and markus 2012 is provided for information rather than for direct comparison with our reference simulation according to this dataset our model gives a reasonable estimate of the total siv in summer march and fall june the low sie simulated in summer could be responsible for the underestimation of the siv for this season the simulated and observed siv values mostly differ in late winter early spring november the simulated volume in winter is too high by almost a factor two with respect to satellite estimates multiple hypotheses can be formulated to explain this disagreement 1 the siv estimate in early spring is highly sensitive to the timing of the retreat season a slight shift as it is observed for the sie can induce large differences in siv estimates 2 barthélemy et al 2017 noted that the winter simulated siv is sensitive to the atmospheric reanalysis applied while the winter sie does not differ much between the simulations driven by three different atmospheric reanalyses the winter siv ranges from 16 103 km3 dfs to 20 103 km3 jra the difference is likely to originate from the differences in air temperatures 3 according to kern et al 2016 there is evidence that the estimate of kurtz and markus 2012 significantly underestimates the sea ice thickness because of the zero sea ice freeboard assumption used kwok and maksym 2014 kern and spreen 2015 to conclude we mention that the largest simulated winter sit are found in the weddell sea the western part of the ross sea and the bellingshausen and amundsen seas irrespective of the reanalysis used the averaged sit over a grid cell along the coastline can amount to 2m in those regions 3 2 presentation of the retrospective seasonal sea ice predictions 3 2 1 sea ice forecast uncertainty associated with an uncertain atmosphere we present in this section the implications of uncertain atmospheric conditions on a seasonal antarctic sea ice prediction starting a prediction from a given ocean sea ice state we judged the deterioration of the forecast accuracy by comparing the ensemble spread of each of the 37 ensembles to the variability of a reference simulation chosen here as the 1980 2016 control simulation we characterized the ensemble spread by the standard deviation of the ensemble members around their ensemble mean assuming that the predictions are initialized from an ocean sea ice state infinitesimally close to reality and that our sea ice forecast system is a faithful transposition of the climate system we explore the timescale on which skilful sie and siv predictions can be achieved potential predictability fig 3 red curves shows the potential predictability of the antarctic sie and siv red curves give the daily evolution of the ensemble standard deviation when hindcasts are started from the same ocean sea ice initial conditions and driven by multiple atmospheric forcing years as the ocean sea ice initial conditions are perfectly known there is no uncertainty in the initial conditions and the ensemble spread must be zero at the initial prediction lead time irrespective of the start date and the ocean sea ice initial state used to start the prediction the sie ensemble spread quickly grows with lead time the ensemble standard deviation reaches the climatological one after one month when initializing the ocean sea ice in march while a few days are enough when initializing it in september the predictability of the sie is thus said to be limited to one month a few days for the predictions started in march september for the rest of the predictions the ensemble and climatological standard deviation curves are indistinguishable from each other the sie variability peaks in january we noticed that the amplitude of the peak is sensitive to the metric used to diagnose the sea ice cover a lower peak being found for the sea ice area not shown compared to fig 3 a red curves fig 3 c red curves reveals for the siv that there is some predictive skill to be gained from the knowledge of the ocean sea ice initial conditions up to 10 months in advance the ensemble spread and the climatological standard deviation become of comparable magnitude in summer from january the ensemble spread steadily increases throughout the sea ice growing season i e from march to september it then remains approximately constant from september to november the siv ensemble spread jumps markedly at the beginning of the sea ice retreat season suggesting a summer melting barrier to siv predictions those observations about the siv ensemble spread apply regardless of the start date however the summer variability peak does no longer prevent the siv from being predicted from march when the predictions start in september for some ensembles the siv ensemble spread is well below the climatological reference and so for the whole period of prediction while the siv ensemble spread does not differ much between the ensembles throughout the siv growing season until november see fig 3 d red curves differences in the ensemble spread become noticeably larger after the summer variability peak the ensemble siv standard deviation in march ranges from 0 4 to 0 7 103 km3 depending on the ocean sea ice initial state this indicates that different ocean sea ice initial states can lead to distinct siv predictability horizons general considerations about the evolution of the sie and siv for the different hindcasts can be directly inferred from figures s1 and s2 of the supporting information they show the annual evolution of the differences between the forecasted sie siv and the control simulation they are complementary views of the analysis of the sie and siv predictability presented in this section 3 2 2 sea ice forecast uncertainty associated with an uncertain ocean sea ice initial state in this section we show how unsatisfactory it can be to attempt to produce the best possible sea ice forecasts from a biased ocean sea ice initial state even if the atmospheric conditions are perfectly known as in the previous section a measure of the ensemble spread for each ensemble is provided by the standard deviation of the ensemble members around their ensemble mean supplementary materials are also provided figures s3 and s4 to examine the individual evolution of each simulation as compared with the control simulation blue curves in fig 3 panels a and b illustrate the impact of an uncertain ocean sea ice initial state on antarctic sie predictions over one year by construction the ensemble standard deviation is equal to the climatological standard deviation at the initial time while this equality is verified for the ensembles started on march 1st the sie for the ensembles starting on september 1st almost immediately responds to the atmospheric forcing this causes the sie ensemble spread to drop during the first days of the simulation this means that any difference between the true hindcast i e the hindcast started from an ocean sea ice state coherent with the atmospheric forcing applied and the hindcasts initialized from a biased ocean sea ice state quickly dampens whatever the selected forcing year to drive the simulations started in september the ensemble spread is efficiently reduced after three days for the two start dates the sie standard deviation levels off around 0 2 106 km2 in september this important result suggests that any initial ocean sea ice error cannot be reduced to zero even if the atmospheric forcing is perfectly known one year in advance intrinsic fluctuations associated with the uncertainty in the ocean sea ice initial conditions remain we noticed that the magnitude of those fluctuations is independent of the metric used to assess the sea ice cover in particular the remaining ensemble spread is not attributable to the 15 threshold used in the definition of the sie for which small fluctuations around this value of the sic could induce an excessive sie disagreement it is also interesting to note that the limit of 0 2 106 km2 is reached independently of the start date and the atmospheric year chosen to force the simulations besides any further reduction of the ensemble spread is only achievable when going from one growing season to the next this last point can only be appreciated for the september start date as previously noticed for the ensemble initialized from the same ocean sea ice initial conditions we do observe for both start dates a peak in january in the sie ensemble standard deviation the position of this peak is controlled by the sea ice retreat rate which is maximum in absolute value during the first days of january not shown it can also be seen that the magnitude of the peak depends on the start date the predictions initialized in march that is far from the melt season display a weaker peak than the predictions initialized in september the annual evolution of an initial siv error is illustrated for the two start dates in fig 3 panels c and d blue curves as for the sie the initial siv ensemble standard deviation should be equal to the climatological variability the climatological standard deviation was estimated after detrending the data series of the control simulation to isolate the variability associated with the year to year siv fluctuations this accounts for the initial disagreement between both standard deviations especially visible for the september start date irrespective of the start date those plots show that the siv ensemble standard deviation is nearly constant through the period of the prediction until the melt season no matter the selected atmospheric forcing year the siv ensemble spread only starts to be reduced from november to february as a consequence an accurate siv forecast requires accurate ocean sea ice initial conditions this is especially true if an siv prediction is started between march and november as an initial siv error will not be reduced until the beginning of the melt season november even if the atmospheric forcing is perfectly known as for the evaluation of the predictability of the siv coming from the knowledge of the initial conditions in september fig 3 d red curves most of the differences between the ensembles arise in january 3 3 the uncertainty associated with an sie prediction we have seen in section 3 2 1 that the evolution of the antarctic sie is highly sensitive to the atmospheric forcing applied information about the sie initial state is lost after one month for the predictions starting in march while the loss is almost instantaneous for the predictions starting in september fig 3 panels a and b red curves the sensitivity of the sie initial conditions to the atmospheric forcing can also be recovered from the ensembles that are started from multiple ocean sea ice initial conditions and forced by a given atmosphere as stated in section 3 2 2 we noted that any member to member initial sie discrepancy on march 1st september 1st is efficiently reduced after one month a few days when those initial states are forced with the same atmosphere fig 3 panels a and b blue curves the different sie sensitivities to the atmospheric conditions observed for the two start dates can be inferred from fig 4 this figure illustrates the annual evolution of the coefficient of determination r 2 characterizing the regression relationship between the total sie and the extent of sea ice thicker than 0 2m 0 4m 0 6m and 0 8m respectively r 2 coefficients have been computed using a linear regression analysis computationally a grid cell is said to be thicker than x m if the averaged sit over the grid cell area actually covered by sea ice is at least x m fig 4 shows that the contribution to the sie variability explained by the different ice thickness categories that we defined is highly seasonal in early march relatively thick ice that is sea ice thicker than 0 4m contributes for 40 to the sie variability while this number drops to nearly zero in september the contribution of very thin ice to the total sie variability can be appreciated by looking at the jump in the r 2 coefficients when sea ice thicker than 0 4m or sea ice thicker than 0 2m is considered we see that the total sie variability in winter can only be explained by considering the very thin ice consequently the sie initial state in september is more likely to be rapidly modified by the atmospheric forcing than the sie initial state in march as thin ice accounts for much of the total sie variability in september previous studies but carried out with fully coupled atmosphere ocean sea ice models holland et al 2013 zunz et al 2014 marchi et al 2018 have shown skilful sie ice edge predictions over longer timescales they notably highlighted the role of the ocean as a source of memory for the sie ice edge location in those studies the sie is found to be predictable when the interactions between the ocean surface and its interior are effective the dominating influence of the atmosphere on the evolution of the sie hindcasts suggests that the ocean does not play such a central role in our simulations to verify this we computed the prognostic potential predictability ppp see pohlmann et al 2004 of the ohc this measure of potential predictability compares the ensemble spread to the model internal variability derived from the control simulation if the ppp is close to 1 the ensemble spread is much smaller than the model internal variability and the ohc is said to be predictable if the ppp is equal to or lower than 0 the predictability resulting from the knowledge of the initial conditions is said to be lost the ohc is computed over the first 50m to capture the predictability of the ocean that is relevant for the interactions with the surface it can be seen from fig 5 that the ocean rapidly loses its predictability as the sea ice grows that is as the mixed layer deepens and gets deeper than 50m and the interactions between the surface and the ocean interior become effective by contrast fig 6 indicates that the ohc computed between 100m and 200m remains predictable over one year this is because the ocean mixed layer rarely exceeds 100m which prevents this layer to interact with the surface 3 4 the uncertainty associated with an siv prediction in contrast to the sie the predictability of the siv coming from the knowledge of the ocean sea ice initial conditions extends to several months the atmospheric conditions imposed by the different forcing years induce less differentiation between the ensemble members fig 3 panels c and d red curves similarly for the hindcasts grouped by atmospheric forcing year we found that any error in the siv initial conditions can only be reduced during the melt season fig 3 panels c and d blue curves this is in stark contrast with the sie for which the reduction of an initial error is effective on the first lead day we identified the persistence of the siv initial conditions as the origin of the siv predictability or conversely of the non reduction of the member to member siv initial differences for the ensembles starting from multiple ocean sea ice conditions in march we computed the persistence of the initial siv ensemble anomalies figs 7 and 8 the persistence was characterized in terms of lagged correlations that is the correlations between the siv anomalies integrated over a given domain in march and the siv anomalies the following months one initial month with multiple target months similar conclusions hold for the september start date in particular when the persistence is evaluated after the melt season the term lagged correlation must be interpreted with caution here as we did not exactly correlate the two same variables we correlated the siv integrated over a given region in march with the local siv at different lag times the use of the total summer siv was motivated by the fact that the advection of the siv anomalies and the local divergence convergence of the sea ice might blur the correlations at the local scale consequently the persistence was difficult to trace furthermore the time lagged relationship between the siv and its future state was not evaluated from a single long simulation as commonly done in studies dealing with persistence see for instance ordoñez et al 2018 this approach supposes to compute for an initial time and a target time as many differences anomalies between the simulation and its climatological mean as there are years in the simulation we took advantage of the ensembles created to compute for each ensemble the anomalies between the ensemble members and the hindcast forced with the proper atmospheric year we thus performed the correlations over the ensemble dimension rather than over time those considerations about the lagged correlations yield the following formula 1 cor τ 1 n n 1 37 m 1 37 y n m t y n n t y n m t τ y n n t τ m 1 37 y n m t y n n t 2 m 1 37 y n m t τ y n n t τ 2 1 2 where the summation index m denotes a numbering of all possible ocean sea ice initial conditions m 1 1980 m 37 2016 while the n index samples the atmospheric forcing years which are used to drive the simulations n 1 1980 n 37 2016 y n m y n m corresponds to the prediction started from the ocean sea ice conditions prescribed by the m th year and driven by the atmospheric conditions of the n th year y n n therefore corresponds to the control simulation at the time of the n th forcing year this implies that the anomalies are computed relative to the control simulation which represents for each ensemble the simulation started from the best possible ocean sea ice initial state departures from the control simulation at the reference time t march are then tracked for nine months so that the lag time τ varies between 0 march and 8 november it was not possible to directly evaluate the persistence of the remaining siv in march at the hemispherical scale this is because the sea ice variability in the southern ocean has a complex spatial structure a positive negative siv anomaly at the hemispherical scale does not necessarily translate into a positive negative siv anomaly at the regional scale we thus decided to track the evolution of the summer siv for each basin individually in the following we focus on the weddell and ross seas similar results are found for the indian ocean the western pacific ocean and the bellingshausen amundsen seas not shown consequently y t will refer to the total remaining siv in march in the weddell ross sea while y t τ will be the monthly mean siv simulated at all gridpoints at lag time τ maps of the correlations c o r are presented in figs 7 and 8 for the weddell and ross seas respectively unsurprisingly figs 7 and 8 show high correlations for the lag 0 month departures from one are due to the use of the aggregate siv lagged correlations at subsequent lags are characterized by a shift towards lower latitudes of the highest correlations based on the age of the sea ice not shown the advection of the siv anomalies is regarded as a plausible candidate to explain the shift the role of the advection is reinforced by the pathway followed by the high correlations notably in the weddell sea where the correlations are transported along the weddell gyre the persistence of the siv initial conditions figs 7 and 8 suggests that a perfectly forecasted atmosphere does not prevent initial member to member siv discrepancies to hold this is consistent with fig 3 c blue curves which indicates that the siv ensemble spread remains constant from march to november the siv ensemble spread then sharply decreases a direct comparison with fig 2 suggests that the reduction of the siv ensemble spread coincides with the reduction of the siv in the mean state we do not expect the diminution of the siv mean state to be directly responsible for the reduction of the siv ensemble spread though this statement is motivated by the evolution of the siv standard deviation derived from the reference simulation black line in fig 3 c the siv standard deviation in the reference simulation does not decrease with the melt of sea ice it even increases keeping in mind that in forced mode the atmospheric forcing fully specifies where the sea ice must melt and where it can survive regardless of its thickness we present a geometrical spatial argument to explain the reduction of the siv ensemble spread from november to february the atmospheric forcing is inefficient to reduce any initial siv difference from march to november because the air temperature does not allow the sea ice to melt in regions where its thickness is different between the ensemble members furthermore the summer sea ice that remains in march is thick and isolated on top by the snow as a result it cannot be easily modified by the atmospheric forcing and the introduced siv anomalies hold until november figs 7 and 8 the siv ensemble spread also remains at about the same value in september when the maximum of the sie is observed this shows that the sea ice melt does not initiate the reduction of the siv ensemble spread the beginning of the melt season is mainly characterized by the melt of thin ice that has been formed in late winter and has a weak impact on the siv ensemble spread from november however part of the existing sea ice in march has been advected northwards and is now available for melting as sea ice melts the regions where the simulated siv is different between the ensemble members become less extended as the siv is an integrated quantity the siv ensemble spread must consequently reduce fig 3 panels c and d blue curves also indicates that most of the differences between the ensembles have their origin in february that is at the end of the melt season we noticed that the siv ensemble spread and the siv ensemble mean are positively correlated for that month not shown that is a high siv mean state in february is associated with a large siv ensemble spread this is because a high siv mean state is the result of atmospheric conditions that induce a moderate sea ice melt if the atmospheric forcing melts less sea ice then a significant part of the initial member to member siv differences will remain 3 5 a link between sie and siv uncertainties a direct comparison between panels a and c and panels b and d of fig 3 red curves reveals that siv predictability does not necessarily imply sie predictability while knowing exactly the siv state in march adequately constrains the evolution of the sie during the first month of prediction the sie and siv are completely disconnected from each other from the first lead days for the predictions initialized in september whereas an analysis at the hemispheric scale of the sie and siv does not demonstrate any positive impact of the siv predictability on the sie predictability after the first lead month we noticed at the regional scale that the siv predictability may turn into sie predictability from october to december for the predictions started in september fig 9 red curves shows a net reduction of the sie ensemble spread for all the ensembles grouped by initial condition from mid october this reduction holds until december when the ensemble spread goes back to the climatological variability the regional sie predictions starting on march 1st as well as the regional siv predictions for the two start dates are presented in figures s5 and s6 of the supporting information respectively the reduction of the sie ensemble spread has been identified in four of the five sectors that we defined those sectors are the indian ocean the western pacific ocean the ross sea and the bellingshausen amundsen seas refer to the caption of fig 9 for the definition of the regional divisions the weddell sea is the only sector for which a net reduction of the ensemble spread is not observed as the weddell sea sector contributes for one third of the total sie it presumably explains why this reduction is not observed in the total sie ensemble spread either besides this drop in sie ensemble spread is shared by all the ensembles and takes place simultaneously for all the ensemble members in mid october this means that the reduction is not preconditioned by any of the ocean sea ice initial states used to understand the reemergence of the sie predictability we looked at the joint evolution of the sie and siv in the reference simulation over the period 1980 2016 a scatter plot of the yearly cycle of the total sie versus total siv averaged over this period is provided in fig 10 note that similar conclusions can be drawn from the evolutions of the sie and siv for each sector individually figure s7 of the supporting information three distinct phases can be distinguished from fig 10 during the melt season the first phase extending from september to october corresponds to a period when the evolutions of the sie and siv are out of phase while the sie is already diminishing from september the siv still increases and only reaches its maximum value at the end of october due to the strong melt occurring at the end of this phase the very thin ice up to 0 2m which explains as much as 50 of the sie variability in early october fig 4 disappears this leaves the ocean with thicker sea ice second phase for which the siv was found to be highly persistent figs 7 and 8 the sie is consequently better constrained by the siv which leads to some sie predictability from the end of october to december the siv predictability coming from the knowledge of the initial conditions can now effectively transfer to the sie the sie ensemble spread finally goes back to the climatology in mid december third phase when the sea ice undergoes a melting regime change while a siv loss of about 5 103 km3 is associated with a sie loss of about 2 5 106 km2 in phase 2 see fig 10 the sie loss doubles for a same siv loss in phase 3 the siv in phase 3 regulates much less effectively the sie losses the atmospheric variability dominates the evolution of the siv and consequently of the sie accordingly it gives a reasonable explanation of the limitation of the reemergence of the sie predictability to december the change in sie siv melting regime between phase 2 and phase 3 is a robust feature of the version of nemo3 6 lim3 that we used we observed a similar transition in spring when the model is forced with the two other reanalyses used in barthélemy et al 2017 due to the lack of a reliable antarctic sit climatology we were however unable to validate the strength of this transition in observations we also noticed that the start date does matter for the experiments starting on march 1st the sie ensemble spread no longer drops below the climatological spread figure s5 of the supporting information this is coherent with an increased siv ensemble spread simulated for the same period see fig 3 c and d red curves and figure s6 of the supporting information 4 discussion the uncertainty about the future state of the atmosphere is a serious limitation to the realization of skilful seasonal antarctic sie predictions furthermore the skill of seasonal antarctic sie predictions driven by multiple atmospheric forcing years relies heavily on the prediction start date while skilful sie predictions can be achieved one month in advance if the ocean sea ice state is perfectly initialized on march 1st fig 3 a red curves skilful sie predictions are limited to a few days for the predictions starting on september 1st fig 3 b red curves to understand the relative performance of the ensemble predictions relating to the two start dates we invoked the contribution of different sea ice thickness categories to the total sie variability fig 4 this analysis revealed that very thin ice 0 2 m dictates the variability of the total sie in september while relatively thick ice 0 4 m explains a significant part of the total sie variability in early march the initialization of the ocean sea ice conditions the siv in particular does not improve the sie predictions in september because the sea ice near the sea ice edge is thin while the initial siv conditions adequately constrain the evolution of the sie in march for the first lead month the evolution of the sie in september is primarily controlled by the applied atmospheric conditions the dominating influence of the atmosphere on the evolution of the forecasted sie can also be deduced from the predictions started from multiple initial conditions and forced by the same atmospheric forcing year fig 3 panels a and b blue curves an important underlying feature of those experiments concerns the introduced sie anomaly in the initial conditions it turns out that they cannot be totally reduced even if the atmosphere was perfectly predictable for one year a residual sie ensemble spread of 0 2 106 km2 is found independently of the start date march 1st or september 1st the origin of those fluctuations remains unclear they might be caused by the initial member to member ocean differences which are rapidly reduced by the atmospheric forcing the limited influence of the ocean on our sie predictions suggests that part of the prediction skill should be attributed to the coupling between the ocean sea ice and the atmosphere sea ice predictions in forced mode prevent the exchange of information from the ocean and sea ice to the atmosphere the slow varying components that represent sea ice and the ocean cannot mitigate the growth of an initial atmospheric anomaly which makes initially close ocean sea ice states to quickly diverge it appears that the atmospheric forcing not only governs the evolution of the surface but also the state of the ocean mixed layer see fig 5 as a result the oceanic upper layer rapidly forgets its past surface conditions leading to a marked decrease in sie predictability in particular the ocean is expected to influence the sea ice advance from one season to the next through an sst linked reemergence mechanism that involves the mixed layer seasonal cycle holland et al 2013 zunz et al 2014 marchi et al 2018 while this mechanism was previously identified in fully coupled climate models its absence in our model might again reflect the leading influence of the coupling with the atmosphere on the computed surface quantities nonetheless marchi et al 2018 notified that the ec earth2 2 model was the only model out of the six assessed not to include the reemergence mechanism for this model the sst anomalies are not efficiently stored in the ocean subsurface during summer months interestingly ec earth2 2 embedded nemo and lim not the same versions as ocean and sea ice components our model might impose the same limitation on the reemergence of the sst anomalies in comparison with the sie skilful siv predictions for the predictions driven by multiple atmospheric forcing years might be achieved for the whole period of prediction that is for one year fig 3 panels c and d red curves nonetheless the melt season was found to significantly degrade the quality of the siv predictions the siv ensemble spread remarkably peaks in austral spring from november to february for all the tested ocean sea ice initial conditions which suggests that the evolution of the siv is primarily controlled by the atmospheric conditions at this time of the year this result agrees with the study of ordoñez et al 2018 while the total siv anomalies are highly persistent in both hemispheres they noticed that antarctic siv anomalies rapidly lose memory during the melt season nonetheless the persistence of the siv initial conditions figs 7 and 8 which is mostly confined to the inner ice pack is expected to advance or delay by a few days the effect of melt on the ice edge retreat as soon as the thin ice disappears this assertion is supported by the increase of the sie ensemble spread from november in fig 3 panels a and b blue curves and by fig 4 which shows the role of thick ice in explaining the sie variability the influence of the ocean can be ruled out as fig 5 demonstrated that its upper state is mainly driven by the atmospheric forcing applied during the sea ice retreat no ohc predictability the influence of persistent siv initial conditions on the sie conditions is consistent with fig 9 red curves this figure shows at the regional scale that the initialization of the siv can induce some sie predictability at the beginning of the sea ice melt season as soon as the thin ice disappears mid october in four of the five sectors that we defined a net reduction of the sie ensemble spread compared to the climatological spread is observed from mid october to december there is evidence that the reemergence of the sie predictability in early spring is related to the way the sea ice retreat is simulated by the model we distinguished three phases during the melt season which are consistent with the timing of the improvement of the sie predictability fig 10 the weddell sea is the only region where the sie predictability does not improve in the austral spring although the three phases mentioned above are also simulated for this region this suggests that the described relationship between the sie and the siv is not a sufficient condition for the sie predictability to reemerge aspects of the local sit goosse et al 2009 and the winds may also be important a recent study by morioka et al 2019 also showed the leading role of the atmosphere in performing skilful antarctic sie predictions they demonstrated the positive influence of the sic initialization on the regional atmospheric variability in the weddell sea those improvements might in turn positively contribute to the quality of sic predictions over the weddell sea during the austral spring 5 conclusions we view the present study as a first attempt to address the respective contributions of the perturbed atmosphere and ocean sea ice initial conditions to the limitation of accurate seasonal antarctic sea ice predictions we used the ocean sea ice model nemo3 6 lim3 driven by the atmospheric reanalysis jra 55 to appreciate the relative importance of these two sources of uncertainties in a perfect model framework we have shown that the seasonal evolution of the antarctic sie primarily responds to the atmospheric conditions for the predictions forced by multiple atmospheric conditions the potential predictability of the sie rapidly decreases with lead time whatever the start date used march 1st or september 1st unlike the sie the siv can be potentially predicted until the melt season at least siv predictions are less sensitive to the atmospheric forcing years applied this predictability arises from the high persistence of the siv initial conditions contrary to the predictions performed with fully coupled climate models the upper ocean has not been identified as a source of memory for the antarctic sie we found that the predictability of the ohc over the first 50m rapidly decreases as soon as the interactions between the surface and the ocean interior become effective deepening of the mixed layer the limited influence of the ocean on the sea ice is hypothesized to result from the absence of feedbacks between the ocean and the atmosphere previous studies on the predictability of the antarctic sea ice might have underestimated the importance of the interactions between the ocean surface and the atmosphere for the realization of skilful sie predictions this study has also demonstrated the importance of the ocean sea ice initial conditions to perform skilful seasonal antarctic sea ice predictions under a presumed perfect knowledge of the atmospheric conditions one year in advance having a proper estimate of the siv during the growing season is essential as an error in the siv initial state will not be reduced until the melt season if adequately initialized the summer siv can further be used to constrain the evolution of the sie at the beginning of the sea ice growing season march and at the onset of the sea ice retreat as soon as the thin ice has disappeared the initialization of the sea ice thickness would therefore be desirable for real forecasts credit authorship contribution statement sylvain marchi conceptualization methodology software

23979,a coastal ocean model is presented adapting the unstructured c grid discretisation ringler et al 2010 employed in the mpas model for prediction across scales global ocean model for use in an existing structured coastal modelling framework specifically the discretisation of momentum advection horizontal viscosity coriolis and continuity due to ringler et al are used remaining terms are adapted from their equivalent formulations on structured meshes the new model operates on an unstructured variant of the arakawa c grid whereby normal velocity components are staggered at the edges of voronoi cells with fluid height and tracer variables located at cell centres in contrast to equivalent c grid formulations on triangular meshes there is no requirement to suppress spurious numerical modes associated with the horizontal divergence operator alleviating a significant difficulty often associated with unstructured c grid models additional attention was required to make the new model applicable to coastal configurations vis open boundaries wetting and drying and inline meshing capabilities extensions of existing high order tracer advection schemes were also implemented to operate on voronoi type meshes the model was tested in a realistic application a flood event in a complex coastal embayment subject to full forcing which exercised these unstructured numerics model solutions compared favourably to observations collected from a slocum glider tide gauge and sub surface mooring keywords unstructured modelling numerical modelling coastal processes 1 introduction unstructured methods have proven to be popular when modelling coastal environments due to their ability to tailor resolution such that complex geography can be suitably discretised pain et al 2005 while most of their structured model counterparts operate on an arakawa c grid there are myriad options available concerning the placement of variables on unstructured meshes danilov 2013 the arakawa c grid is a popular choice in the structured modelling community due to its good representation of propagating gravity waves on rectangular grids compared to other grid staggers attempts to construct c grid formulations on unstructured triangulations have typically led to significant numerical difficulties with solutions commonly contaminated by chequerboard noise in the horizontal divergence and vertical velocity danilov 2010 while this numerical instability is most prominent in three dimensional baroclinic situations small effective rossby radii of deformation such effects can also manifest in the coastal regime and alternative c grid formulations for unstructured coastal models are sought this study pursues such ambitions adapting the unstructured c grid discretisation used in the global model for prediction across scales mpas ringler et al 2013 for use in a coastal modelling environment this numerical framework described in ringler et al 2013 thuburn et al 2009 and ringler et al 2010 and hereafter referred to as trisk thuburn ringler skamarock klemp is based on a voronoi type interpretation of the arakawa c grid staggering whereby normal velocity components are positioned at the edges of polygonal voronoi cells fluid height and tracer variables are located at cell centres and vorticity values are computed at cell vertices the trisk formulation is known to be absent of the spurious divergence modes that plague equivalent triangle based formulations trisk is also a mimetic scheme conserving mass volume potential vorticity energy for the coriolis term and supporting stationary geostrophic modes these latter issues concerning the discretisation of the coriolis term were previously problematic on voronoi type meshes these features make trisk an attractive choice when building an unstructured model designed to span multiple spatial scales in our new coastal modelling framework we combine a trisk like discretisation with various additional functionality needed for coastal applications notably the treatment of open boundaries support for wetting and drying the implementation of turbulence closures and an inline unstructured meshing capability in recognition of its roots in the mpas framework we refer to this new model as compas coastal ocean marine prediction across scales after briefly reviewing several related unstructured modelling efforts we devote the remainder of this paper to a description of the compas environment its verification and an assessment of its performance in section 2 we review the trisk formulation as well as the associated traditional finite difference approaches that constitute the compas dynamical core in section 3 we detail additional functionality around open boundaries wetting and drying tracer advection and mesh generation required in our coastal modelling framework the focus here is on functionality that required additional effort to transition from conventional structured finite difference schemes to methods supporting general unstructured meshes section 4 presents an idealised test case with section 5 extending analysis to a real world example demonstrating the utility of the new model in practice concluding remarks are included in section 6 1 1 unstructured coastal models a range of different unstructured models and approaches targeted toward coastal ocean modelling have been developed previously including methods based on finite volume formulations e g fvcom suntans fesom c see danilov 2013 as well as various continuous and discontinuous finite element type discretisations e g slim fluidity thetis schism such methods differ in their placement of variables on the computational grid the polynomial spaces chosen to discretise numerical operators and the layout and configuration of the underlying unstructured meshes employed in each case considering first the finite volume formulations a key difficulty has been construction of a stable unstructured c grid scheme that does not possess destructive computational modes many existing triangle based formulations are known to exhibit a grid scale instability coupling horizontal divergence and vertical velocity danilov 2010 such schemes typically require the application of filtering suppression techniques wolfram and fringer 2013 which contributes to undesirable numerical dissipation while recent advances based on mimetic discretisations korn 2017 korn and linardakis 2018 reduce the severity of such instabilities it is not clear that such effects can be eliminated entirely and abandonment of either the triangular mesh framework or the c grid staggering often results the approach of ringler et al 2013 follows the former route where the equations are discretised on the dual of a delaunay triangulation i e a voronoi diagram a hexagonal mesh in the case of a perfectly regular delaunay triangulation gassmann 2011 shows that the spurious modes associated with triangular c grid meshes are absent in these hexagonal cases alternatively several finite volume models have also successfully been developed based on unstructured b grid like formulations e g fvcom fesom c finite element strategies especially discontinuous galerkin techniques a k a dg methods offer a range of interesting possibilities including the potential to achieve higher order accuracy through the use of sub grid polynomial representations such approaches however present their own issues notably computational efficiency with more fundamental research concerning their numerical formulation and performance thought to be required before such schemes can be considered obvious alternatives to conventional finite difference volume approaches presently it is thought that the trisk type c grid scheme represents an effective and flexible choice for multiscale modelling combining good representations of barotropic and baroclinic processes the flexibility of general voronoi type unstructured meshes and competitive computational performance in this study we focus on implementing a trisk like discretisation within a coastal modelling framework and to assessing its viability and performance 2 model equations compas is a coastal ocean model designed to be used at scales ranging from estuaries to regional ocean domains it is a three dimensional finite volume hydrodynamic model based on the three dimensional equations of momentum continuity and conservation of heat and salt employing the hydrostatic and boussinesq assumptions the equations of motion are discretised on arbitrary polygonal meshes according to the trisk formulation a generalisation of the standard arakawa c grid scheme to unstructured grids the horizontal mesh must be an orthogonal centroidal and well centred primal dual tessellation typically consisting of collections of voronoi cells and their dual delaunay triangles see section 3 a choice of fixed z coordinates or terrain following σ coordinates is available in the vertical the z vertical system allows for wetting and drying of surface cells useful for modelling regions such as tidal flats where large areas are periodically dry it also allows the free surface to move through multiple layers in areas of large tidal range with fine vertical discretisation the bottom topography is represented using partial cells compas has a nonlinear free surface and uses mode splitting to separate the two dimensional 2d mode from the three dimensional 3d mode the model uses explicit time stepping throughout except for the vertical diffusion scheme which is implicit compas is based on the framework outlined in herzfeld 2006 this model is a finite difference model that uses an underlying unstructured coordinate system the generalisation of this unstructured system greatly simplifies the transition from finite differences to trisk numerics as such the horizontal terms in the governing equations momentum advection horizontal mixing and coriolis are discretised using the trisk numerics whereas the pressure gradient and vertical mixing are discretised using the finite difference approach outlined in herzfeld 2006 compas therefore inherits much of the functionality of the host model of herzfeld 2006 including numerous turbulence closure schemes k ε k ω mellor yamada 2 0 and 2 5 and open boundary infrastructure the equations of motion in compas are based upon and are similar to those described in blumberg and herring 1987 the equations used in the z model are presented here the σ model follows the formulation of blumberg and herring 1987 and is not repeated here the placement of variables on the horizontal mesh is illustrated in fig 2 1 where u 1 is the velocity in the normal direction with unit vector n ˆ to an edge u 2 is the velocity in the tangential direction with unit vector t ˆ to an edge and c are scalar values at the cell centre every centre is surrounded by n p e edges and vertices each assigned a unique number 1 n p e distances between centres are a function of edge indices and are denoted h2 distance between vertices are also a function of edge indices and are denoted h1 coordinates for centres edges and vertices are denoted cellx celly u1x u1y and gridx gridy respectively the triangle created from joining cell centres surrounding a given vertex is the delaunay dual the continuity equation is 2 1 u w z 0 where u is the horizontal velocity u n ˆ u 1 t ˆ u 2 w is the vertical velocity and z is the vertical coordinate positive upwards following ringler et al 2013 appendix a the momentum in the horizontal direction is given by 2 2 u t η k u w u z 1 ρ 0 p k d h u z v z u z where t is the time p is pressure ρ 0 is a reference density k is the kinetic energy k u 2 2 v z is the vertical viscosity coefficient and d h u is the horizontal momentum diffusion using the trisk numerics the nonlinear advection term combines the momentum advection and coriolis term where the advective term is cast in the vector invariant form here η k u f is the absolute vorticity where f is the coriolis parameter and k is the unit vector in the vertical direction the hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations are invoked in the formulation of eq 2 2 both compas and mpas operate on a mesh defined by the delaunay dual in the coastal zone with complex geography the transition of resolution often results in polygons with the minimum of 4 edges or often up to 9 edges in the mesh an implementation of momentum advection is required that can discretise the momentum advection term on these variable polygons and the vector invariant approach is an efficient and relatively simple method to accommodate this the horizontal momentum diffusion is given by the laplacian operator ringler et al 2013 eq a 8 2 3 d h u v h δ k η where δ u and v h is the horizontal viscosity coefficient as noted by ringler et al 2013 this formulation is not invariant under solid body rotation and cannot lead to a viscous force if v h is variable which is a limitation of the implementation in practice although formally incorrect we observe no degradation of the solution with variable horizontal viscosity a bi harmonic formulation is also available the pressure p is given by 2 4 p x y z p a x y z ζ ρ g d z here p a is the atmospheric pressure ζ is the surface elevation g is the acceleration due to gravity and ρ is the density the treatment of this term in the wetting and drying framework is described in appendix b the conservation equation for any tracer c is given by 2 5 c t c u z c w k h c z k z c z where k h is the horizontal diffusion coefficient and k z is the vertical diffusion coefficient the latter may be computed using a variety of two equation turbulence closure schemes e g k ε k ω mellor yamada 2 0 2 5 warner et al 2005 eq 2 5 is valid for temperature salinity and any contaminants included the vertical velocity is obtained from eq 2 1 the boundary conditions at the surface are 2 6 ρ v z z u τ s 2 7 ρ k z z t s h t h s where t is the temperature s is the salinity and τ s is the surface wind stress h t is the surface heat flux and h s is the surface salt flux the surface boundary condition for vertical velocity is 2 8 w t o p ζ t u s ζ where ζ and u s are the surface elevation and velocity respectively the velocity through the bottom w b o t is zero the boundary conditions at the bottom are 2 9 ρ v z z u τ b 2 10 ρ k z z t s 0 where τ b is the bottom stress given by the quadratic friction law 2 11 τ b ρ c d u u where the drag coefficient is given by 2 12 c d max 1 κ ln z z 0 z 0 2 c d m i n here z denotes the distance above the sea floor numerically this is implemented as the first grid point above the bottom c d m i n is a minimum drag coefficient typically between 0 002 and 0 003 used when the first grid point is a long way from the bottom i e for large z z o is the bottom roughness and κ 0 4 is von karman s constant the model uses mode splitting where the 2d mode is the solution to the vertical integral of eq 2 2 with the surface elevation given by 2 13 ζ t d u 0 where d ζ h is the total water depth and h is the bottom depth and u 1 d h ζ u d z is the vertically integrated horizontal velocity both the barotropic and baroclinic mode use 2nd order leapfrog time stepping further details of the split explicit mode splitting and time stepping is described in appendix a the nonlinear advection term is solved by computing integrals of velocity around edges to obtain cell centred kinetic energy and vertex centred relative vorticity see fig 2 1 for relative locations of edges centres and vertices the gradient of kinetic energy across centres is edge centred and may be used in eq 2 2 relative vorticity is added to planetary vorticity at vertices to obtain absolute vorticity this is averaged onto the edge centre via several methods energy neutral potential enstrophy conserving or potential enstrophy dissipating formulations ringler et al 2010 eqs 49 71 and 73 respectively the energetically neutral formulation is used by default further details of the horizontal discretisation can be found in ringler et al 2013 the tangential velocity is computed according to thuburn et al 2009 eq 33 this formulation ensures coriolis terms are energy conserving and geostrophic modes are stationary although the trisk method is designed to operate on an arbitrary voronoi mesh it will also function on other orthogonal tessellations this includes the orthogonal curvilinear grids that structured models operate on the ability to run on both structured grids and unstructured meshes is an advantage which we exploit when testing against established benchmarks following the approach of herzfeld 2006 at solid boundaries every cell centre is associated with a unique ghost cell which is used to define the lateral boundary conditions this is typically a no gradient condition lateral boundary conditions for velocity use a free slip condition by setting relative vorticity to zero at solid boundary vertices see section a 4 ringler et al 2013 3 coastal enhancements compas is a hybrid of the model described by herzfeld 2006 and mpas o ringler et al 2013 as mpas o is designed to operate at global scales it is not optimally suited to downscaled coastal environments where additional physical processes constraints and model features become important specifically robust open boundary methods are required to be applied to maintain stability achieve accurate solutions and facilitate model coupling bathymetry plays a greater role in steering circulation and a representation of nonlinear wetting and drying processes becomes critical wetting and drying may also be required for z vertical coordinates so that vanishing layers can be used with high vertical resolution in the presence of large changes in elevation e g tidal ranges dynamics associated with freshwater inputs from rivers are required to be resolved e g estuarine processes flood plumes and rofis sub grid scale parameterisation in the vertical is typically more important than in the horizontal direction robust inline unstructured meshing tools are required to build complex multi scale model configurations and achieve rapid operational turnover the evolution of generic 2d tracers and tracers in a layered sediment for coupling to biogeochemical bgc and sediment transport modules is also a requirement of compas as is a conservative offline semi lagrangian transport model that can operate on long time steps for bgc transport given these different requirements of coastal modelling it was considered more efficient to import the trisk numerics into the existing framework of herzfeld 2006 which already supported this coastal functionality in this section we consider some key areas which required additional attention on an unstructured mesh 3 1 open boundaries implementation of open boundary equations on an unstructured mesh presents several challenges firstly unlike structured grids where every boundary cell centre is associated with a unique normal velocity edge unstructured meshes may host multiple normal velocity edges for each boundary cell centre fig 3 1a although this is usually not the case if meshes are boundary fitted i e triangulations generated within a convex hull the possibility must be accounted for this results in increased housekeeping to track centres associated with edges edges interior to the boundary edge and to allow for multiple ghost cells associated with boundary centres for hosting data beyond the boundary limits secondly most open boundary radiation conditions are formulated assuming a wave is approaching the boundary at right angles to the boundary edge certainly schemes such as orlanski 1976 miller and thorpe 1981 and camerlengo and o brien 1980 compute the phase speed using cell centres or edges perpendicular to boundary centres or edges the flather condition flather 1988 is formulated using a radiation condition and 1 dimensional continuity equation applicable to the normal boundary direction in unstructured meshes there is no guarantee that interior cell centres or edges will be located perpendicular to boundary centres or edges fig 3 1b this means that costly reconstructions should be performed in order to compute gradients normal to the boundary or since these boundary conditions are themselves approximations with inherent specification error use the nearest centre e g c i for centre c b in fig 3 1b or edge to the normal direction and accept this approximation as yet another source of error radiation conditions used in an active capacity with external data are not robust in the sense that optimised conditions transport poorly to other applications and can be quite susceptible to over specification error often this error must be controlled with sponge zones nudging zones or flow relaxation to maintain stability the active condition of herzfeld and andrewartha 2012 extended by herzfeld and gillibrand 2015 has proven robust and accurate across a wide range of applications this is essentially a dirichlet clamped condition applied to normal and tangential boundary velocities with a local flux adjustment to maintain volume conservation the arrangement of state variables on a hexagonal open boundary is illustrated in fig 3 2 the flux adjustment essentially solves an inverted continuity equation for a normal boundary velocity perturbation which when applied to the cell velocity divergence achieves a target elevation with reference to fig 3 2 the flux f b t required to be applied to normal boundary faces to achieve a target elevation of ζ t is 3 1 f b t a 2 δ t 2 d ζ t 1 ζ t e n o r n e c f e where a is the cell area and δ t 2 d is the 2d time step and n e c indicates the sign of the vector at edge e relative to cell c i e n e c 1 if the normal velocity vector points out of cell c and 1 if the vector points into cell c this flux is then equally distributed over α normal boundary faces e g α 3 in fig 3 2 and converted to a velocity which is subsequently relaxed toward with a time scale τ f for each normal depth averaged boundary velocity u e blue arrows in fig 3 2 3 2 u e t 1 u e t δ t 2 d τ f u e t f b t α l e d b where u e t 1 is the flux corrected velocity at edge e u e t is the normal velocity boundary condition at edge e l e is the edge length and d b are the depths at the boundary edges the time scale is relative to the 2d time step hence if τ f δ t 2 d then the target elevation is achieved every time step in practice τ f 1 2 δ t 2 d provides good results in downscaling applications the target elevation is provided from a parent model and may have a tidal signal or inverse barometer effect added the normal boundary condition u e t is typically either also prescribed from the parent model or is the vertical integral of 3d normal boundary velocities prescribed from the parent model the stagger in the boundary cell is organised so that boundary normal velocities lie outward of the cell centre c b along the green lines in fig 3 1a referred to as normal velocity outside elevation implementation nvoe by herzfeld 2009 using this implementation the elevation is fully constrained and does not require a boundary condition it may be solved via the continuity equation as for the domain interior this means boundary elevation is transmissive of interior signals approaching the boundary while responding to incoming forcing thus minimising specification error this arrangement is conservative in the boundary cell so the conservation equation may be also used in the boundary cell to solve for tracers using the same advection scheme as used in the interior this requires several ghost cells e g c g in fig 3 1a to exist beyond the boundary edge onto which external data e g from a parent model is interpolated this open boundary condition is very well suited to finite volume methods on unstructured meshes requiring no reconstructions of variables perpendicular to the boundary in the case of boundary fitted meshes the scheme operates identically as for structured grids for multiple edges associated with a cell centre the normal velocity perturbation from the flux adjustment is equally spread over all those edges although compas is equipped with a full suite of open boundary approaches where radiation conditions are subject to the perpendicular phase speed issue described above the flux adjusted dirichlet condition has proven to be very reliable in actively forced downscaling applications and other approaches are rarely used the utility of this scheme is demonstrated in sections 4 and 5 however a passively forced domain would require application of the alternative conditions the practical issue of designating cells in the mesh as open boundary cells is also more difficult in unstructured mesh models as the indexing is essentially random whereas in structured mesh models open boundaries can be set as a range of i j indices where either i or j is monotonically increasing to specify open boundaries in compas on the mesh perimeter we define a start end and mid geographic location latitude and longitude for the boundary where the mid location lies somewhere between the start and end to obtain the boundary cell indices a bounding perimeter of the mesh is first computed which comprises the cell centres which have a number of valid maps to other cell centres that is less than their number of edges we define the open boundary as the cells on that perimeter from the start location passing through the mid location and terminating at the end location 3 2 mesh generation use of a trisk based formulation in compas imposes strict constraints on the quality of the underlying unstructured grids utilised meshes are required to be orthogonal centroidal and well centred collections of polygonal cells and dual triangles typically defined in terms of voronoi diagrams and their dual delaunay triangulations these requirements constrain the geometry of the mesh cell edges must be perpendicular to the line joining adjacent cell centres triangle vertices must be positioned at the centre of mass of each polygonal cell and cell vertices must lie in the interior of their associated dual triangles in addition to these discretisation based constraints meshes are typically required to conform to the geometry of coastal boundaries and to follow complex user defined mesh spacing distributions generating such grids is non trivial requiring the construction of highly optimised centroidal voronoi tessellations cvts see du et al 1999 and non obtuse delaunay triangulations see vanderzee et al 2010 compas uses the unstructured meshing library jigsaw engwirda 2017 to accomplish these tasks jigsaw incorporates a range of delaunay based mesh generation and optimisation algorithms including off centre type delaunay refinement techniques erten and üngör 2010 engwirda and ivers 2016 and hybrid mesh optimisation strategies engwirda 2018 these methods are designed to build very high quality delaunay voronoi type meshes in complex domains and have proven successful in generating the optimised orthogonal centroidal and well centred grids required by compas the overall meshing workflow consists of a series of user guided and automated steps 1 a domain boundary and mesh spacing distribution weighting function is defined by the model user the boundary is represented as a collection of polygons polylines and fixed vertices the mesh spacing distribution is a scalar function h x specifying the variation of target cell edge length throughout the domain 2 an off centre delaunay refinement algorithm engwirda and ivers 2016 is used to generate a triangulation of the domain conforming to the boundary definition and following imposed mesh spacing constraints the refinement process continues until a sufficiently high quality restricted delaunay triangulation is generated satisfying various bounds on cell quality size and boundary approximation fidelity see section 3 2 1 for additional details 3 a voronoi grid is assembled from the triangulation with each polygonal cell formed by joining the orthogonal centres of the dual triangles adjacent to each vertex in the triangulation the orthogonal centre of a given triangle is the centre of its circumball the circle passing through its vertices 4 mesh optimisation techniques are used to improve the quality of the final mesh through a combination of cvt like vertex movement transformations of cell topology and vertex insertion removal engwirda 2017 2018 the shape and size of the polygonal cells and dual triangles are iteratively improved optimisation is designed to enhance both the centroidal and well centred characteristics of the mesh leading to tessellations optimised for the trisk based c grid discretisation described in section 2 a number of novel features designed to support high quality grid generation for coastal domains are incorporated including flexible representations for coastal boundary definitions and techniques to support the construction of high quality mesh spacing distributions jigsaw is incorporated as an inline component in the compas framework facilitating automated domain generation and model configuration options applicable to the domain boundary include sub sampling smoothing and linking and options for the mesh spacing distribution include mapping distance from the coast bathymetry or any other variable read from file to mesh resolution via a series of piecewise linear exponential or cosine functions 3 2 1 flexible domain representation geoscientific datasets often define coastlines and domain polygons containing a multitude of features undesirable for mesh generation being sampled at inappropriate resolution containing sharp corners and or narrow passages the application of conventional meshing tools e g triangle shewchuk 2002 typically results in low quality grids containing small cells and undesirable geometrical features the presence of these artefacts can impose severe restrictions on model time step and must be eliminated in practical model configurations while pre processing techniques ramer 1972 douglas and peucker 1973 can be applied to smooth and simplify piecewise linear geometry definitions it is often difficult to obtain results that lead to optimal meshes especially when complex non uniform mesh spacing constraints are imposed as is typical in coastal model configurations the use of restricted delaunay triangulation r d t techniques edelsbrunner and shah 1997 offers an alternative strategy supporting the generation of meshes that conform approximately to a given boundary definition in contrast to conventional delaunay type meshing kernels r d t based approaches do not seek to triangulate the full input geometry exactly but instead progressively refine an initially coarse tessellation until a satisfactory approximation is obtained this triangulation is then further subdivided to ensure mesh spacing and cell quality constraints are satisfied leading to high quality tessellations that effectively filter out small undesirable features in the geometry definition our r d t type meshing kernel is based on the following procedure 1 a coarse delaunay triangulation d t of the domain is constructed based on a small subset of n vertices drawn from the input geometry typically n 16 with vertices selected to give quasi uniform coverage of the full domain 2 the initial set of edges that approximate the domain boundary is identified by constructing the r d t from the initial d t formed in step 1 by definition edelsbrunner and shah 1997 these restricted delaunay edges are those associated with segments in the dual voronoi diagram that intersect the true boundary see fig 3 3 for details 3 the r d t is progressively refined introducing new vertices to eliminate poor quality edges and or triangles in the mesh an edge e is considered poor if a it is too long such that l α h x where l is the length of the edge h x is sampled at the edge midpoint and α 4 3 by default b it does not approximate the domain geometry with sufficient accuracy such that ϵ β h x where ϵ is the length of the perpendicular projection from the edge midpoint to the true boundary the one sided hausdorff distance h x is sampled at the edge midpoint and β 1 5 by default c optional it does not recover the topology of the true domain geometry a triangle t is considered poor if a it is too large such that 3 r α h x where r is the radius of the circumscribing ball associated with t h x is sampled at the centre of the ball and α 4 3 by default b it is of poor shape such that r l ρ where r is the radius of the circumscribing ball associated with t l is the length of the shortest edge in t and the radius edge threshold ρ 1 05 by default this places an implicit bound on the angles in the mesh with θ a r c s i n 1 2 ρ and θ π 2 a r c s i n 1 2 ρ 4 new vertices are added to the r d t using the off centre refinement rules described in engwirda and ivers 2016 and engwirda 2016 these point placement strategies solve a local optimisation problem for the position of new vertices attempting to place new points such that local mesh spacing and quality constraints are satisfied in an optimal manner the r d t is updated following the insertion of each new vertex allowing the approximation of the geometry to be progressively improved see fig 3 3 for several snapshots of the point insertion process 5 refinement continues until all edge and triangle based constraints are satisfied ensuring that cells in the final mesh satisfy the various imposed mesh spacing quality and approximation accuracy thresholds globally the refinement procedure is priority ordered processing the edge or triangle of worst quality at each iteration the performance of r d t based meshing techniques has been studied previously boissonnat and oudot 2005 cheng et al 2013 confirming that such methods offer robust convergence guaranteed to accurately recover both the geometry and topology of an arbitrary boundary definition as h x 0 following the generation of the initial r d t mesh a sequence of mesh optimisation steps are undertaken to further improve its quality 1 the position of vertices are updated according to an optimal delaunay tessellation odt heuristic each vertex is moved toward the weighted mean of its neighbouring voronoi vertices as per chen and xu 2004 in the present implementation vertices lying on the boundary of the domain remain fixed throughout the iteration 2 the topology of the mesh is updated to ensure the tessellation satisfies the delaunay criterion after adjustment of vertex positions updates are computed incrementally flipping the connectivity of edges sandwiched between neighbouring triangles until all cells are delaunay triangles 3 vertex insertion removal operations are attempted new vertices are inserted and existing vertices removed if such operations improve the local quality of the mesh the optimisation steps described above are applied iteratively with 16 full sweeps of the process conducted by default overall mesh optimisation typically improves the shape and spacing of both the delaunay triangles and voronoi polygons leading to tessellations that are better conditioned for the trisk type numerical formulation described in section 2 additional detail concerning the mesh optimisation procedure is contained in engwirda 2017 2018 in our coastal modelling framework use of this restricted delaunay meshing kernel enables the generation of high quality computational grids given potentially low quality geometry inputs smoothing and re sampling the domain boundary at the desired scales of interest without introducing overly small cells and or geometric artefacts an example domain and mesh for the great barrier reef region of the australian coast is included in fig 3 4 showing how a high resolution gshhg based coastline definition can be approximated using a comparatively low resolution restricted delaunay mesh note that various channels and inlets narrower than the local mesh spacing constraints are excluded from the mesh this behaviour allows a relatively large minimum cell size to be preserved leading to a model configuration with acceptable limits on time step size 3 2 2 mesh resolution design the resolution of the unstructured grid can be tailored to the characteristics of the circulation bathymetry and coastline of the domain and areas of interest of the simulation enabling the exploration of multi scale representations of coastal flows the design of optimal mesh resolution distributions for coastal modelling is an ongoing area of research though a number of heuristics are currently in use throughout the community one popular approach e g lambrechts et al 2008 is to adapt mesh spacing to the geometry and bathymetry of the domain considering a combination of distance to coast barotropic wave speed and user defined constraints 3 3 h x min β d d x β w w x h u x where d x x g x is the minimum distance from a point in the domain to its projection on the geometry g x w x g h x is an estimate of the barotropic wave speed given a resting height h x and gravitational acceleration g and h u x represents additional user defined constraints β d β w are relative scaling parameters employing the distance to coast heuristic can be used to enhance resolution along the coastal boundary while matching grid spacing to estimates of free surface wave speed serves to introduce additional mesh resolution in the shelf region and to equilibrate cfl based restrictions on model time step across the domain irrespective of the heuristics employed the generation of high quality meshes requires the construction of mesh spacing distributions that are sufficiently smooth transitioning between regions of large and small grid spacing at rates that enable the formation of relatively undistorted polygonal cells and dual triangles noting that the heuristics in eq 3 3 are typically non smooth defined in terms of discrete coastal geometry and bathymetric data an additional smoothing procedure is employed following persson 2006 a gradient limiting approach is used to construct lipshitz smooth mesh spacing functions given a maximum allowable gradient γ h a fast marching method sethian 1999 sethian and vladimirsky 2000 is employed to solve a variant of the eikonal equation 3 4 max h x γ h γ h given an initial possibly non smooth estimate h 0 x for the mesh spacing distribution the solution of eq 3 4 returns a modified function h x with bounded variation values in h x are limited to ensure the maximum magnitude of spatial gradients does not exceed the threshold γ h at any point in the domain following a fast marching approach values are modified by incrementally working away from local minima if the gradient limits at a given point are violated values are updated in its local neighbourhood until the distribution is sufficiently smooth parts of h x for which the initial gradients already satisfy the threshold γ h remain unperturbed setting smaller values of γ h leads to smoother functions a detailed example is presented in fig 3 4 showing a bathymetrically adapted mesh spacing function and multi scale mesh for the great barrier reef region contours of the gradient limited mesh spacing distribution are drawn h x can be seen to remain smooth and well behaved even in regions of narrow detail adjacent to the archipelago and coastline this in turn leads to a high quality mesh incorporating smooth transitions in cell size 3 3 wetting and drying a cell designated as dry in a model should be reasonably expected to have zero depth and zero velocity through at least one edge bordering that cell these edges and the cell centre should also be omitted from momentum and tracer computation respectively either explicitly or via masking wetting and drying has been practically accomplished in sigma models oey 2005 warner et al 2013 however the sigma vertical coordinate is not the most appropriate for wetting and drying since layers cannot vanish and all cells must always have a non zero water depth oey 2005 on the other hand in z systems the water column need not be represented by all the prescribed layers and sea level may pass through layers to effectively remove a layer from the wet domain all the layers in a column may vanish to create a completely dry column on a c grid the approach of warner et al 2013 places a threshold on water depth at the cell centre usually several cm to tens of cm below which a water column is presumed dry when this occurs flow is restricted to inflow only with no flow allowed out of the cell through the edges while relatively simple to implement this situation does not represent true drying as a the cell still contains water b velocities are still non zero on the edges and c the cell is still included in the wet domain a more rigorous method of drying is the approach of oey 2005 where a depth threshold of the order of mm is placed on the edge depth i e edge thickness where this depth is the maximum depth at centres either side of the edge in the z system if this edge depth falls below the threshold then the velocity at that edge is set to zero cell centre depth is computed via the continuity equation as usual and if this depth falls below the sea floor then sea level is set to the bottom such that the cell contains no water and cell depth is identically zero this cell is then removed from the wet domain for subsequent computation of tracers which retain their last value in that cell the dry edge is also removed from the wet domain until such a time as the edge depth exceeds the threshold i e the maximum depth at centres either side of the edge becomes greater than the threshold the dry cell centre will become wet again when the divergence from all edges surrounding the centre is positive i e more flow is going into the cell through wet edges than flowing out this approach fulfils the three criteria for true drying described above this workflow is housekeeping so far the computation of the pressure gradient becomes more complex in the z system as an edge may be partially wet on one side therefore the edge thicknesses in a column must be decomposed into edges which have centres either side that are a fully wet on either side b partially wet on one side and c completely dry on one side see fig b 1 the pressure gradient formulation is then implemented using the methodology described in appendix b the wetting and drying algorithm is tested by simulating a wetting bore propagating along an initially dry channel the model domain represents a channel 2 km wide and 100 km long with uniform flat bathymetry this is discretised with a quadrilateral grid having spacing of 1000 m in the cross channel direction and 200 m along channel a constant velocity of 1 ms 1 is applied at one end of the initially dry depth 0 channel at the inflow boundary face the elevation is initially set to 0 1 m the quadratic bottom friction coefficient is 0 002 and vertical layer spacing is 0 5 m from 0 to 4 m temperature and salinity are set to 20 c and 35 respectively horizontal viscosity and diffusivity are set to 40 and 0 ms2s 1 respectively and vertical viscosity and diffusivity are constant at 0 05 and 0 01 ms2s 1 respectively the model is allowed to run for 3 h and the solution represents a propagating bore along the channel with a parabolic shape surface elevation profile determined by a balance between the quadratic bottom friction and surface slope the length of the bore is related to the depth at the inflow by l g d 2 2 c d u 2 where d is the depth at the inflow and u is the velocity at the inflow 1 ms 1 this relation is compared to the model solution in fig 3 5a showing good agreement with model and theory the bore profile at 1 h intervals is shown in fig 3 5b illustrating the parabolic shape note also that the depth in front of the bore is zero this simple test demonstrates the functionality of the wetting and drying algorithm used in compas 3 4 high order tracer advection often unstructured models apply low order approximations for tracer advection mpas uses 3rd and 4th order flux corrected transport fct schemes using the approach of skamarock and gassmann 2011 the flux correction zalesak 1979 is applied to maintain monotonicity which can be expensive numerically due to the limiting procedure and to a much lesser extent the solution of a first order scheme to obtain the flux limiter the approach of skamarock and gassmann 2011 relies on using a quadratic polynomial with coefficients obtained using a least squares fit to obtain the second derivative of tracers at edges via formal differentiation of that polynomial this method is also applied in compas but is taken a step further to use a least squares fit to reconstruct tracer values perpendicular to edges that are not accessible by direct mappings to cell centres from that edge if this is performed then monotonic advection schemes may be used and avoid the requirement of the fct scheme while computational saving is achieved in doing this more computation is required to obtain a larger number of coefficients in the least squares fit note that the ultimate limiter achieves monotonicity for 1 dimensional schemes and on 2 dimensional structured grids operator splitting is used to achieve monotonicity a 2 dimensional limiter is strictly required for the arbitrary meshes used here however the approach outlined here can be applied to any scheme and we do not observe monotonicity violations in test cases performed so far fig 3 6 illustrates the problem encountered when using higher order advection schemes on unstructured meshes with reference to fig 3 6 the quickest leonard 1991 scheme for example computes fluxes at the edge f i 1 2 as 3 5 f i 1 2 1 2 t i 1 t i 1 1 2 q i 1 2 t i t i 1 1 6 1 6 q i 1 2 2 c u r v c u r v t i 2 t i 1 t i 2 q i 1 2 0 c u r v t i 1 2 t i t i 1 q i 1 2 0 where q u 1 δ t h 2 is the courant number at cell edges h 2 is the distance between cell centres note that this scheme is not monotonic unless a limiter is applied here we use the ultimate limiter of leonard 1991 this limiter introduces normalised tracer variables at the cell faces 3 6 t i t i t u t d t u t i 1 2 t i 1 2 t u t d t u where t u is the tracer concentration at the upstream cell centre and t d is the tracer concentration at the downstream cell centre the monotonic solution is obtained if e g section 3 2 leonard 1991 3 7 t i 1 2 t i q i 1 2 for 0 t i 1 t i t i 1 2 1 for 0 t i 1 t i 1 2 t i for t i 0 o r t i 1 to implement the quickest scheme we require a set of 4 uniformly spaced values oriented along a line perpendicular to the edge f i 1 2 due to the layout of the unstructured grid the values at t i 1 and t i 2 may not be accessible by direct mappings to cell centres from the edge at f i 1 2 in this case a pentagon adjoins a hexagon in the i 1 direction so that the value at i 2 maps around the corner to cell t i 2 in fig 3 6 the correct value to use in the quickest computation should lie at the location of the green dot we use the quadratic least squares interpolation to reconstruct this value using values 1 to n p e at locations of the red dots in the least squares estimation if a local coordinate system x y is set up with local axis normal and tangential to the edge then the quadratic polynomial used is 3 8 t x y c 0 c 1 x c 2 y c 3 x 2 c 4 x y c 5 y 2 weights to calculate the quadratic polynomial coefficients c 0 t o c 5 are computed at model start up using singular value decomposition svd using a unit scalar field and cached for use throughout the run for every edge e and n th coefficient c n the svd procedure will generate weights b e n i where i 1 n p e corresponds to each tracer cell centre red dots in fig 3 6 in this case n p e 9 used in the least squares fit the n th coefficient for edge e c e n is recovered by the sum of these weights multiplied by the tracer value at that cell centre e g 3 9 c e n i 1 n p e b e n i t i given an x y relative to the centre of edge e then the tracer value at that location is approximated using eq 3 8 where the coefficients are obtained using eq 3 9 for that edge in the local coordinate system a value at 3 δ n is required to be computed for use in the advection algorithm eq 3 5 where δ n is the distance from the edge to each adjacent cell centre i e x 3 δ n and y 0 in the polynomial so that only weights associated with coefficients that are a function of x need be saved in order to estimate values at t i 1 and t i 2 e g in the example above coefficients c o c 1 and c 3 the approach of using least squares reconstructions to interpolate locally one dimensional values outside of direct mappings can be extended to any advection scheme that requires these values for higher order terms we have also implemented an unstructured variant of van leer s 1979 scheme using this approach see below these tracer advection schemes have been tested in an idealised domain an attractive feature of the trisk numerics is that it will operate on orthogonal curvilinear grids so tests can be performed using traditional advection schemes built for rectangular grids as a benchmark solution our test domain consists of a flat bottomed basin 20 m depth forced by a 1 m semi diurnal tide at the eastern boundary and connected to a 30 km long estuary of depth 5 m at the head and 10 m at the mouth delivering a flow of 100 m3s 1 a 0 1 nm 2 westerly wind blows over the domain the grid resolution is 200 m and the test runs for 30 days fig 3 7 shows solutions using various advection schemes parameterisations are identical in all simulations except for the advection scheme for the purpose of assessing the advection schemes the structured ultimate quickest solution is considered the benchmark solution with surface salinity shown in fig 3 7a because this scheme is monotone positive definite possesses low numerical diffusion and uses direct mappings which are possible on a quad grid to the tracer values e g t i 1 and t i 2 used for the 2nd derivative in the algorithm i e no approximations to these values are used the unstructured ultimate quickest uses the least squares interpolation to reconstruct these outmost tracer values hence any differences to the benchmark are due only to this approximation these are shown in fig 3 7b as the root mean squared salinity error rmse relative to the benchmark results using this scheme are very similar to the benchmark with largest error of 0 5 psu in the high salinity tongue intruding into lower salinity water in the north west of the basin the scheme of van leer 1979 has also been cast in unstructured form unstructured vanleer using the least squares reconstructions fig 3 7c and here differences to the benchmark are due to these reconstructions in addition to the inherent properties of the scheme the rmse again compares favourably to the benchmark albeit slightly more degraded compared to the unstructured ultimate quickest the unstructured 3rd order fct scheme fig 3 7d uses the least squares interpolation to approximate the second derivative directly and the larger rms errors indicate a more diffuse solution than the benchmark likely due to the use of the first order solution to construct the anti diffusive fluxes in the fct scheme all these unstructured schemes are viable candidates for generalised unstructured meshes they are however more numerically expensive speed comparisons are presented in table 3 1 note that several other schemes have also been included in this comparison structured van leers fct schemes and runtime ratios have been normalised to the fastest scheme structured vanleer the unstructured vanleer appears to be a good balance between computational efficiency and accuracy 3 5 other schemes smagorinsky horizontal closure smagorinsky 1963 is a popular method to prescribe horizontal diffusion and viscosity coefficients in coastal models as the magnitude of mixing scales with the amount of shear present in the flow mpas uses the analogous leith 1996 formulation in preference due to its performance in models with eddy permitting resolution in compas we include an option for smagorinsky mixing to be implemented where the tensors required to compute the smagorinsky mixing are computed from rotated reconstructions of cell centred east and north velocity vectors other functionality desired in the coastal domain is inherited from the framework of herzfeld 2006 with no requirement for modification to unstructured meshes this functionality mostly applies to schemes that operate in the vertical and includes 2 equation turbulence close and surface fluxes 4 idealised application to demonstrate the model is functional we first apply it to an idealised test that has an analytic solution the test we choose is that of an alongshore wind applied to an infinitely long channel with a sloping bottom this test case was considered by chapman 1985 and palma and matano 1998 2001 to assess various open boundary conditions and provides an opportunity in this study to exercise the open boundary infrastructure the use of cyclic open boundaries emulates an infinite coastline chapman 1985 hence when using this condition boundary error is minimised and we may compare the model directly to the analytic solution the analytic solution exists for a linear model where constant wind stress is applied in a longshore direction assuming cross shelf transport and alongshore sea level gradient are small then steady state t transport u is given by chapman 1985 eq 4 5 4 1 u d τ s ρ r where d is the water depth τ s is the wind stress ρ is the density and r is the linear friction coefficient note u is the transport hence velocity u u d the steady state sea surface slope is given by chapman 1985 eq 4 6 4 2 ζ y f τ s ρ g r l 2 y where l is the width of the channel and it is assumed ζ 0 at y l 2 mid channel the adjustment time for u to reach steady state is h r which at the deepest point is 2 5 days using a wind stress of 0 1 nm 2 in a zonal channel 500 km wide the dimensions of this domain are the same as the test domain used by palma and matano 1998 except the southern hemisphere is considered with depths at the southern and northern boundaries of 50 and 110 m respectively linear resistance coefficient r 0 0005 ms 1 coriolis 1 028 10 4 s 1 and ρ 1024 76 kgm 3 then eq 4 1 gives an along shore depth averaged velocity of 0 195 ms 1 the cross shore depth averaged velocity is zero and elevation at the coast from eq 4 2 is 0 49 m slope of 2 05 10 6 this result assumes a linear depth averaged model is used and a non linear 3 d model with quadratic bottom friction is expected to give different results two models were set up with a quadrilateral quad and regular hexagonal hex mesh so that both normal and tangential velocities could be implemented with cyclic boundary conditions resolution was 20 km for quad and distance between centres of 25 km for hex both models used 24 vertical layers the mellor yamada 2 0 turbulence closure scheme was used and horizontal viscosity and diffusivity were 2000 and 200 m2s 1 respectively sea level and currents at the coast when a steady state was achieved 12 days are shown in table 4 1 the results of which compare favourably with theory the evolution of sea level and velocity is shown in fig 4 1 note that the hex sea level initially overshoots the quad case and has a tendency to increase after the adjustment time this is a consequence of the cyclic normal boundary velocities unaligned with the flow for some boundary cell faces on a hexagonal cell making the cyclic boundary sensitive to small perturbations in the flow it is generally difficult to implement cyclic boundaries on hexagonal meshes unless the mesh is perfectly regular on a plane i e not on a spheroid however since this small deviation is related to the cyclic boundary implementation rather than the model dynamic core this test demonstrates that compas is capable of reproducing an accurate wind driven response especially for quad in an idealised domain and shows that both the open boundary infrastructure and basic dynamic core are behaving appropriately 5 realistic application to demonstrate the utility of compas we apply it to a realistic domain subjected to full forcing mechanisms and compare it to observations the domain chosen for the application is the storm bay d entrecasteaux channel and derwent estuary region in south east tasmania australia fig 4 1 we choose to simulate a flood event that will exercise the trisk coastal numerics specifically the open boundaries that introduce basin scale dynamics into the region through a seaward boundary and freshwater flow through two river boundaries momentum advection that represents the inertia of the freshwater flow sub gridscale parameterisation that stabilises the momentum advection while not adversely dissipating the flow high order tracer advection that preserves the frontal boundaries of the flow nonlinear coriolis that turns the flood plume to the left southern hemisphere and various meshing configurations using different weighting functions the storm bay area is dominated by local forcing notably freshwater inputs from the huon and derwent rivers in late summer storm bay may be impacted from offshore by the east australian current water flowing down the east coast of tasmania and in winter the region is influenced by the zeehan current flowing down the west coast these current systems are introduced into the model via the open boundaries the model is nested within a larger scale regional model covering the whole of tasmania and bass strait fig 5 1 which in turn is nested within the global ofam model oke et al 2008 low frequency sea level from the global model is superimposed with 8 tidal constituents m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 q1 from the tpxo global model egbert and erofeeva 2002 and applied at the boundary of the regional model the local model is subsequently nested within the regional model and therefore inherits both low frequency and tidal signals surface fluxes are derived from the australian bureau of meteorology s operational atmospheric models access a puri et al 2012 http www bom gov au nwp doc access nwpdata shtml at a resolution of 12 km heat fluxes applied at the surface boundary condition were computed from standard meteorological variables provided by access a wet and dry bulb temperature air pressure wind speed and cloud amount using short and longwave calculations outlined in zillman 1972 and the bulk method for sensible and latent heat using bulk coefficients of kondo 1975 for the surface freshwater fluxes precipitation was provided by access a and evaporation was computed from the latent heat flux wind speed was converted to stress using the bulk scheme of large and pond 1981 the model was run from 1 june 2015 to 20 june 2015 during which both huon and derwent rivers were in flood delivering fresh water into storm bay and fortunately coincided with the deployment of a slocum glider that was used for validation glider profiles are sampled at higher resolution than the model and therefore resolve finer scale dynamics which are absent in the model this makes quantitative comparison difficult and to overcome this we bring the glider toward the model by sub sampling the glider data onto the model grid as opposed to interpolating the model output onto the glider trajectory the glider observations are averaged into model volumetric cells at discrete time intervals and subsequently viewed as a time series allowing quantitative assessment of the model s performance using standard time series metrics root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae correlation coefficient cc bias willmott scores d in addition to coincident model and glider variables a horizontal neighbourhood can be defined around the glider location in the model and fuzzy verification techniques ebert 2008 may be used to assess the extent of any double penalty issues for this study a simple bound is placed around the glider variable representing minimum and maximum values of the variable in the model within the neighbourhood if the glider observation falls within these bounds we can assume the model is reproducing observed dynamics within a length scale representing a tolerable displacement of features in terms of ebert s decision model definition useful forecast predicts the observed variable within an area having a length scale that represents a tolerable displacement of a feature in the model additionally a mooring was deployed in storm bay at 43 315 s 147 623 e from which near surface 15 m temperature could be compared to the model and sea level at hobart 42 882 s 147 327 e was also available for comparison three unstructured grids were constructed and simulated using weighting functions representing bathymetry distance from the coast and salinity fig 5 2 denoted bathy coast and salt respectively this allows the role of discretisation and convergence of the solution to be assessed as well as demonstrating the meshing capability of compas the definition of each of these meshes is summarised in table 5 1 where a piecewise linear change in resolution was applied with the piecewise limits shown the salinity distribution used for the salt weighting was taken from an alternative structured model on 29 july 2018 additionally a structured orthogonal curvilinear quadrilateral grid quad was constructed based on a polar type cell distribution where minimum resolution is achieved at the grid edge along the offshore open boundary and resolution increases landward in a north westward direction resolution in this grid ranged from 66 to 956 m note that this grid contains up to double the number of surface wet cells as the unstructured meshes these models contain three open boundaries one offshore boundary skirting the shelf edge and two river boundaries supplying freshwater flows from the huon and derwent rivers the freshwater flows are input using the method described in herzfeld 2015 and the offshore boundary uses the condition described in herzfeld and andrewartha 2012 the rivers are represented to beyond the salt wedge propagation and tidal limit this is achieved by adding a 2 d laterally averaged orthogonal curvilinear grid with the mesh fig 5 3 since the mesh is defined as a series of independent cell specifications it is relatively simple to create a new set of cells representing the curvilinear river and patch these into the mesh by referencing one edge to a common set of coordinates this is something that is difficult to achieve in a structured grid or unstructured meshes that solely use triangles the advantage of using a quadrilateral curvilinear grid for this section is that there is no cross river resolution that would unduly compromise the required time step the models use the mellor yamada 2 0 turbulence closure model mellor and yamada 1982 the k ε model of burchard et al 1998 was also trialled but this seemed to overmix the freshwater plume in the estuary the unstructured ultimate quickest scheme was used for tracer advection and the smagorinsky horizontal mixing was implemented for bathy coast and salt with an empirical constant of 0 1 added to a defined base rate of 80 m2s 1 with areal scaling on the mesh the quad grid used biharmonic smagorinsky viscosity constant of 0 1 with a base rate of 14 7 105 m4s 1 also scaled by cell area all models used horizontal diffusivity of zero sea level at hobart and temperature at the storm bay mooring fig 5 1 metrics are reported in table 5 2 all models exhibit very good skill at predicting the tide willmott score of 0 96 for salt and also skilfully capture the low frequency variability the observed temperature exhibits some diurnal oscillations of up to 0 6 c that are not captured by the model hence while the rmse is low the correlation and willmott score show reduced skill both the temperature and low frequency records are too short to adequately assess model performance resulting from dynamics at longer timescales e g weather band or seasonal scales however results do indicate that the model is not performing erroneously the time period was chosen to assess the response to a flood plume event into storm bay so we now turn attention to the glider data freshwater flows down the huon and derwent rivers peak at 1290 and 235 m3s 1 respectively on 9 june 2015 the derwent river is regulated higher upstream in its catchment such that controlled volumes are released downstream consequently flow is usually less than the huon huon flow typically turns left into d entrecasteaux channel herzfeld and andrewartha 2010 eventually exiting the northern channel into storm bay this characteristic is also observed in all model meshes where a well defined plume is observed after the flood peak on 10 and 11 june fig 5 4a and salinity is persistently lower in the northern d entrecasteaux during this time enhanced shear and vorticity is observed in the velocity field which translates to elevated values for the smagorinsky mixing coefficient fig 5 4b derwent flow tends to head south eastward across storm bay this is also observed in the model although peak flows were on 9 june the maximum plume extent in storm bay due to the derwent flow occurred around 16 june this is a consequence of the lag in the plume transiting the estuary but also favourable wind and tide conditions combining to push the freshwater plume further into storm bay at this time the glider data fig 5 5 reflects this event with minimum surface salinity occurring on 16 june and thereafter increasing as the glider heads south eastward into more marine waters while in the fresh plume 16 june the glider time series shows numerous spikes of low salinity these correspond to the instances when the glider reaches the surface to record low salinity 32 then returns to depths of around 30 m with an associated increase in salinity to 35 as the glider heads further into storm bay and away from the flood plume the salinity becomes homogeneous to depths of 90 m with no evidence of a surface fresh layer the glider comparisons are shown in table 5 3 with a plot of the highest skill comparison for the coast model in fig 5 5 comparisons to observation in this figure also include the minimum and maximum temperature or salinity values found in the model in the neighbourhood of the glider location where the neighbourhood in this case is chosen as a 3 km diameter over the glider location a snapshot of the coast salinity distribution at 0000 16 june 2015 when freshwater intrusion into storm bay was maximum is provided in fig 5 6 for reference included in this figure is the glider trajectory and a distance scale finally a plot of coast salinity using time on the x axis and depth on the y axis is shown in fig 5 7 for qualitative comparison all models capture the intrusion of the freshwater plume into storm bay with the most accurate representation being the coast model which has a skill score of 0 91 for temperature and 0 96 for salinity these skill scores were computed at the model location coincident with that of the glider in some cases e g 1900 16 june the maximum salinity in the neighbourhood exhibits even better correlation to observation when the glider enters the plume at the surface fig 5 5 this indicates that while the freshwater plume is present its location is displaced in space slightly to result in some double penalty error confounding the quantitative skill metrics the neighbourhood diameter 3 km is somewhat subjective however when considered in the context of the spatial scale of the plume extent it seems a reasonable amount with which the exact plume position may be displaced as the glider enters marine waters further south the model shows a small bias of low temperature 0 1 c and high salinity 0 2 the temperature of the freshwater input is not measured and in this case we use the low pass filtered air temperature as the river temperature which appears to be introducing a low temperature bias this is observed in fig 5 5 as the spikes in the model time series when the glider is in the southern open water of storm bay after 17 june little variability in model skill is observed as a function of the model grid used the best response is provided by the coast model although all coast bathy and salt models provide accurate responses while the salt model has resolution specifically optimised along the freshwater plume trajectory the coast and bathy models also use weighting functions that deliver comparable resolution in these areas the quad model delivers the worst performance most likely due to high resolution not being allocated to the full path of the flood plume in particular the lack of high resolution in the more narrow reaches of the upper estuary it is encouraging to see a level of convergence of the solution across the different meshes since if this were not the case it would make the process of model calibration as a function of the mesh an exceedingly difficult one overall the response of the model when the trisk numerics are exercised is favourable in this case 6 conclusion an unstructured model is presented using the trisk numerics in the horizontal such that momentum advection is discretised using the vector invariant form coriolis uses the nonlinear advective approach where planetary vorticity is added to relative vorticity and tangential velocities are computed via the method of thuburn et al 2009 in the vertical a structured approach is adopted allowing access to z or σ vertical coordinates implementation of wetting and drying in z coordinates and access to a suite of 2 equation turbulence closure schemes this model adds to the pool of unstructured models that are capable of producing viable solutions in the coastal zone the point of difference is that our model operates on the dual of a c grid delaunay triangulation thus dispensing with the need to control spurious modes that are known to exist on c grid triangulations use of the c grid retains the good representation of propagating gravity waves on the mesh the trisk numerics support other attractive features vis conservation of potential vorticity a coriolis term that supports stationary modes and conserves energy and a computationally competitive implementation of momentum advection using the vector invariant approach coastal enhancements include the addition of a full open boundary suite where for active boundary forcing the scheme of herzfeld and andrewartha 2012 was found to be naturally well suited to unstructured approaches and delivered the high quality solutions seen in structured models a wetting and drying scheme was implemented where a depth threshold was applied to edges allowing cell centres to completely dry and new high order advection schemes were implemented by extending the approach of skamarock and gassmann 2011 a further attractive feature of compas is the inline generation of high quality meshes using the jigsaw mesh generation software this software is specifically designed to produce high quality meshes conforming to the requirements of trisk numerics vis orthogonal centroidal and well centred meshes additionally advanced techniques are used to produce power meshes and the mesh may be built on stereographic projections we have tested the model by assessing several idealised tests and an event based simulation in a realistic application south eastern tasmania against observations in the latter case the event was a freshwater flood discharge in an estuary emptying into a bay subject to full forcing this simulation exercised relevant aspects of the new coastal code vis momentum advection horizontal sub gridscale parameterisation high order tracer advection open boundary conditions and the jigsaw mesh generation with various weighting functions the results of the test indicated that these new discretisations in the coastal ocean code are performing favourably the model was also shown to produce viable solutions in idealised test cases whilst its performance to date is promising further applications and extended use is required to gauge its strengths and assess limitations it is hoped that this coastal implementation of the trisk numerics is a useful addition to the existing pool of

appreciate the encouragement of the mpas developers in pursuing this work appendix a 2d mode and time stepping the solutions to the equations of motion contain both fast moving surface gravity waves and slower moving internal waves it is advantageous from a computational efficiency perspective to separate these two types of motion allowing the fast moving waves to be solved on a smaller time step this is accomplished using mode splitting where eq 2 2 is vertically integrated to provide equations for the velocity transport i e 2d mode or barotropic mode which are then used via the vertical integral of eq 2 1 to provide the surface elevation the vertical integration of eq 2 2 removes all vertical structure for a variable x the vertical average is defined as a 1 x 1 h ζ h ζ x d z 1 d h ζ x d z eq 2 1 subject to vertical integration yields using 2 8 a 2 ζ t d u 0 where u is the vertically averaged type equation here velocity the vertical integral of eq 2 2 gives a 3 u t η k u 1 h 2 ρ 0 p a n g ρ t o p ζ n 1 d h k d r y g h 2 ρ z ζ ρ n d z d z k d h u τ s d ρ t o p τ b d ρ t o p ξ k u u 2 2 with ξ k u and where ringler et al 2013 section a 5 a 4 u u u the last two terms of eq a 3 represent the advection of this fluctuating velocity u and are called the dispersion terms mellor 2002 eq 22 rather than evaluate this explicitly eq a 4 is used and these terms are equal to the vertical average of the 3d velocity advection minus the 2d velocity advection e g a 5 ξ k u u 2 2 k u k u u 2 2 k u k u u 2 2 also d h u is computed using eq 2 3 with u substituted for u and ρ t o p and ρ b o t are surface and bottom density respectively the pressure gradient is computed using the method outlined in appendix b the bottom stress computed using bottom velocity vertical integral of momentum advection involving u in eq a 5 and the pressure gradient vertical integral are calculated prior to the 2d mode and held constant throughout the 2d time integrations the 2d mode in turn provides the surface elevation for use in the 3d mode the flow of control is illustrated in fig a 1 we choose not to use a time filter in this feedback so as to maintain consistency with the continuity and conservation equation with consistency defined by gross et al 2002 this is equivalent to the delta function filter discussed by shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 after the 2d mode is complete the 3d velocities are adjusted so that their vertical integral is equal to the 2d velocities it is possible to execute compas in 2d mode only this essentially only solves the vertically integrated equations to provide velocity transports and surface elevation leading to large savings in execution time compas uses leapfrog time stepping for momentum and euler forward time stepping for tracers the euler forward time stepping derivative in a simple one dimensional advection equation is approximated as a 6 c t 1 c t δ t u c t d x for some variable c this is a first order taylor approximation which is explicit in time since the function c d t is evaluated at the time level t as opposed to t 1 the euler scheme is unstable kowalik and murty 1993 p163 and requires the presence of some diffusion to stabilise it rood 1987 this scheme was chosen for tracers since an array containing tracer values at the backward time level is not required as this can become expensive in biogeochemical models using 60 state variables the leapfrog time derivative is second order accurate and in a simple one dimensional advection equation is approximated as a 7 f t 1 f t 1 2 u δ t f t d x for some momentum variable f solutions to the leapfrog scheme contain contributions representing physical related to the differential equation solved and computational related to the structure of the numerical equation modes the latter alternates on every timestep and is an undesirable artefact of the leapfrog scheme this computational mode can however be removed by the use of a filter such as that of asselin 1972 a 8 f t f t 0 5 υ f t 1 2 f t f t 1 where υ is a constant typically 0 1 compatibility between the 2d and 3d modes of the model and hence conservation is achieved by integrating the 2d fluxes over the 3d time steps and adjusting the 3d velocities once the 2d step is complete so that the vertical integral of the 3d fluxes is equal to the time integrated 2d fluxes this ensures that the change in sea level over the 3d time step as computed by the 2d equations is equal to the total divergence of 3d fluxes above any given layer see below the leapfrog method makes this summation over the 2d step difficult shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 consider fig a 2 where the 3d mode operates on a time step δ t 3 and the 2d mode has a time step δ t 2 with δ t 3 i r δ t 2 in this case i r 8 the leapfrog scheme advances any variable by 2 δ t 2 using the values of the variable at time t δ t 2 and t according to eq a 7 this time stepping is represented by the arrows in fig a 2 the 2d momentum fluxes must be integrated from time t to t δ t 3 according to a 9 u f l u x t t δ t 3 u t d h 1 δ t for some time increment δ t to be defined later if consistency and thus conservation is to be maintained between the 2d and 3d modes then a 10 u f l u x u f l u x h ζ u t δ t 3 h 1 δ t 3 d z integrating eq 2 1 from layer z to the surface using 2 8 with leibnitz s rule and noting z ζ 0 a 11 ζ t w z u z where w z is the vertical velocity through layer z and u z z ζ u d z is vertically integrated velocity at time t δ t 3 above layer z therefore the volume change in a water column over the time period δ t 3 is equal to the divergence of the vertical integral of the flux above that layer including the contribution of vertical fluxes the volume balance for the layer thickness this may be expressed as a 12 ζ t δ t 3 ζ t δ t 3 w z δ t 3 u z eq a 12 relates the vertical velocities to the change in sea level and if this is satisfied then conservation in the tracer equations is achieved if z h and w h 0 no flow through the bottom then eq a 12 becomes a 13 ζ t δ t 3 ζ t δ t 3 u z if eq a 10 holds then eq a 13 reverts to the continuity equation for the 2d mode eq 2 13 it is clear that for eq a 10 to hold the 2d fluxes must be integrated in time such that the time increment in eq a 9 δ t 2 δ t 2 i e on only every 2nd step of the leapfrog i e the summation of fluxes takes place on only those times depicted by the bottom sequence of arrows in fig a 2 this is only possible if i r is an even number hence the leapfrog scheme is limited by the condition that the ratio of δ t 3 δ t 2 must be even appendix b pressure term for wetting and drying the hydrostatic equation p ρ g d z can be integrated from any depth z to the surface ζ to give the pressure at the level z p b 1 p p a g z

through a summation of cell thickness above and including cell faces that are completely or partially dry this approach is adopted to cope with wetting and drying in which the surface elevation in

23979,a coastal ocean model is presented adapting the unstructured c grid discretisation ringler et al 2010 employed in the mpas model for prediction across scales global ocean model for use in an existing structured coastal modelling framework specifically the discretisation of momentum advection horizontal viscosity coriolis and continuity due to ringler et al are used remaining terms are adapted from their equivalent formulations on structured meshes the new model operates on an unstructured variant of the arakawa c grid whereby normal velocity components are staggered at the edges of voronoi cells with fluid height and tracer variables located at cell centres in contrast to equivalent c grid formulations on triangular meshes there is no requirement to suppress spurious numerical modes associated with the horizontal divergence operator alleviating a significant difficulty often associated with unstructured c grid models additional attention was required to make the new model applicable to coastal configurations vis open boundaries wetting and drying and inline meshing capabilities extensions of existing high order tracer advection schemes were also implemented to operate on voronoi type meshes the model was tested in a realistic application a flood event in a complex coastal embayment subject to full forcing which exercised these unstructured numerics model solutions compared favourably to observations collected from a slocum glider tide gauge and sub surface mooring keywords unstructured modelling numerical modelling coastal processes 1 introduction unstructured methods have proven to be popular when modelling coastal environments due to their ability to tailor resolution such that complex geography can be suitably discretised pain et al 2005 while most of their structured model counterparts operate on an arakawa c grid there are myriad options available concerning the placement of variables on unstructured meshes danilov 2013 the arakawa c grid is a popular choice in the structured modelling community due to its good representation of propagating gravity waves on rectangular grids compared to other grid staggers attempts to construct c grid formulations on unstructured triangulations have typically led to significant numerical difficulties with solutions commonly contaminated by chequerboard noise in the horizontal divergence and vertical velocity danilov 2010 while this numerical instability is most prominent in three dimensional baroclinic situations small effective rossby radii of deformation such effects can also manifest in the coastal regime and alternative c grid formulations for unstructured coastal models are sought this study pursues such ambitions adapting the unstructured c grid discretisation used in the global model for prediction across scales mpas ringler et al 2013 for use in a coastal modelling environment this numerical framework described in ringler et al 2013 thuburn et al 2009 and ringler et al 2010 and hereafter referred to as trisk thuburn ringler skamarock klemp is based on a voronoi type interpretation of the arakawa c grid staggering whereby normal velocity components are positioned at the edges of polygonal voronoi cells fluid height and tracer variables are located at cell centres and vorticity values are computed at cell vertices the trisk formulation is known to be absent of the spurious divergence modes that plague equivalent triangle based formulations trisk is also a mimetic scheme conserving mass volume potential vorticity energy for the coriolis term and supporting stationary geostrophic modes these latter issues concerning the discretisation of the coriolis term were previously problematic on voronoi type meshes these features make trisk an attractive choice when building an unstructured model designed to span multiple spatial scales in our new coastal modelling framework we combine a trisk like discretisation with various additional functionality needed for coastal applications notably the treatment of open boundaries support for wetting and drying the implementation of turbulence closures and an inline unstructured meshing capability in recognition of its roots in the mpas framework we refer to this new model as compas coastal ocean marine prediction across scales after briefly reviewing several related unstructured modelling efforts we devote the remainder of this paper to a description of the compas environment its verification and an assessment of its performance in section 2 we review the trisk formulation as well as the associated traditional finite difference approaches that constitute the compas dynamical core in section 3 we detail additional functionality around open boundaries wetting and drying tracer advection and mesh generation required in our coastal modelling framework the focus here is on functionality that required additional effort to transition from conventional structured finite difference schemes to methods supporting general unstructured meshes section 4 presents an idealised test case with section 5 extending analysis to a real world example demonstrating the utility of the new model in practice concluding remarks are included in section 6 1 1 unstructured coastal models a range of different unstructured models and approaches targeted toward coastal ocean modelling have been developed previously including methods based on finite volume formulations e g fvcom suntans fesom c see danilov 2013 as well as various continuous and discontinuous finite element type discretisations e g slim fluidity thetis schism such methods differ in their placement of variables on the computational grid the polynomial spaces chosen to discretise numerical operators and the layout and configuration of the underlying unstructured meshes employed in each case considering first the finite volume formulations a key difficulty has been construction of a stable unstructured c grid scheme that does not possess destructive computational modes many existing triangle based formulations are known to exhibit a grid scale instability coupling horizontal divergence and vertical velocity danilov 2010 such schemes typically require the application of filtering suppression techniques wolfram and fringer 2013 which contributes to undesirable numerical dissipation while recent advances based on mimetic discretisations korn 2017 korn and linardakis 2018 reduce the severity of such instabilities it is not clear that such effects can be eliminated entirely and abandonment of either the triangular mesh framework or the c grid staggering often results the approach of ringler et al 2013 follows the former route where the equations are discretised on the dual of a delaunay triangulation i e a voronoi diagram a hexagonal mesh in the case of a perfectly regular delaunay triangulation gassmann 2011 shows that the spurious modes associated with triangular c grid meshes are absent in these hexagonal cases alternatively several finite volume models have also successfully been developed based on unstructured b grid like formulations e g fvcom fesom c finite element strategies especially discontinuous galerkin techniques a k a dg methods offer a range of interesting possibilities including the potential to achieve higher order accuracy through the use of sub grid polynomial representations such approaches however present their own issues notably computational efficiency with more fundamental research concerning their numerical formulation and performance thought to be required before such schemes can be considered obvious alternatives to conventional finite difference volume approaches presently it is thought that the trisk type c grid scheme represents an effective and flexible choice for multiscale modelling combining good representations of barotropic and baroclinic processes the flexibility of general voronoi type unstructured meshes and competitive computational performance in this study we focus on implementing a trisk like discretisation within a coastal modelling framework and to assessing its viability and performance 2 model equations compas is a coastal ocean model designed to be used at scales ranging from estuaries to regional ocean domains it is a three dimensional finite volume hydrodynamic model based on the three dimensional equations of momentum continuity and conservation of heat and salt employing the hydrostatic and boussinesq assumptions the equations of motion are discretised on arbitrary polygonal meshes according to the trisk formulation a generalisation of the standard arakawa c grid scheme to unstructured grids the horizontal mesh must be an orthogonal centroidal and well centred primal dual tessellation typically consisting of collections of voronoi cells and their dual delaunay triangles see section 3 a choice of fixed z coordinates or terrain following σ coordinates is available in the vertical the z vertical system allows for wetting and drying of surface cells useful for modelling regions such as tidal flats where large areas are periodically dry it also allows the free surface to move through multiple layers in areas of large tidal range with fine vertical discretisation the bottom topography is represented using partial cells compas has a nonlinear free surface and uses mode splitting to separate the two dimensional 2d mode from the three dimensional 3d mode the model uses explicit time stepping throughout except for the vertical diffusion scheme which is implicit compas is based on the framework outlined in herzfeld 2006 this model is a finite difference model that uses an underlying unstructured coordinate system the generalisation of this unstructured system greatly simplifies the transition from finite differences to trisk numerics as such the horizontal terms in the governing equations momentum advection horizontal mixing and coriolis are discretised using the trisk numerics whereas the pressure gradient and vertical mixing are discretised using the finite difference approach outlined in herzfeld 2006 compas therefore inherits much of the functionality of the host model of herzfeld 2006 including numerous turbulence closure schemes k ε k ω mellor yamada 2 0 and 2 5 and open boundary infrastructure the equations of motion in compas are based upon and are similar to those described in blumberg and herring 1987 the equations used in the z model are presented here the σ model follows the formulation of blumberg and herring 1987 and is not repeated here the placement of variables on the horizontal mesh is illustrated in fig 2 1 where u 1 is the velocity in the normal direction with unit vector n ˆ to an edge u 2 is the velocity in the tangential direction with unit vector t ˆ to an edge and c are scalar values at the cell centre every centre is surrounded by n p e edges and vertices each assigned a unique number 1 n p e distances between centres are a function of edge indices and are denoted h2 distance between vertices are also a function of edge indices and are denoted h1 coordinates for centres edges and vertices are denoted cellx celly u1x u1y and gridx gridy respectively the triangle created from joining cell centres surrounding a given vertex is the delaunay dual the continuity equation is 2 1 u w z 0 where u is the horizontal velocity u n ˆ u 1 t ˆ u 2 w is the vertical velocity and z is the vertical coordinate positive upwards following ringler et al 2013 appendix a the momentum in the horizontal direction is given by 2 2 u t η k u w u z 1 ρ 0 p k d h u z v z u z where t is the time p is pressure ρ 0 is a reference density k is the kinetic energy k u 2 2 v z is the vertical viscosity coefficient and d h u is the horizontal momentum diffusion using the trisk numerics the nonlinear advection term combines the momentum advection and coriolis term where the advective term is cast in the vector invariant form here η k u f is the absolute vorticity where f is the coriolis parameter and k is the unit vector in the vertical direction the hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations are invoked in the formulation of eq 2 2 both compas and mpas operate on a mesh defined by the delaunay dual in the coastal zone with complex geography the transition of resolution often results in polygons with the minimum of 4 edges or often up to 9 edges in the mesh an implementation of momentum advection is required that can discretise the momentum advection term on these variable polygons and the vector invariant approach is an efficient and relatively simple method to accommodate this the horizontal momentum diffusion is given by the laplacian operator ringler et al 2013 eq a 8 2 3 d h u v h δ k η where δ u and v h is the horizontal viscosity coefficient as noted by ringler et al 2013 this formulation is not invariant under solid body rotation and cannot lead to a viscous force if v h is variable which is a limitation of the implementation in practice although formally incorrect we observe no degradation of the solution with variable horizontal viscosity a bi harmonic

integrated horizontal velocity both the barotropic and baroclinic mode use 2nd order leapfrog time stepping further details of the split explicit mode splitting and time stepping is described in appendix a the nonlinear advection term is solved by computing integrals of velocity around edges to obtain cell centred kinetic energy and vertex centred relative vorticity see fig 2 1 for relative locations of edges centres and vertices the gradient of kinetic energy across centres is edge centred and may be used in eq 2 2 relative vorticity is added to planetary vorticity at vertices to obtain absolute vorticity this is averaged onto the edge centre via several methods energy neutral potential enstrophy conserving or potential enstrophy dissipating formulations ringler et al 2010 eqs 49 71 and 73 respectively the energetically neutral formulation is used by default further details of the horizontal discretisation can be found in ringler et al 2013 the tangential velocity is computed according to thuburn et al 2009 eq 33 this formulation ensures coriolis terms are energy conserving and geostrophic modes are stationary although the trisk method is designed to operate on an arbitrary voronoi mesh it will also function on other orthogonal tessellations this includes the orthogonal curvilinear grids that structured models operate on the ability to run on both structured grids and unstructured meshes is an advantage which we exploit when testing against established benchmarks following the approach of herzfeld 2006 at solid boundaries every cell centre is associated with a unique ghost cell which is used to define the lateral boundary conditions this is typically a no gradient condition lateral boundary conditions for velocity use a free slip condition by setting relative vorticity to zero at solid boundary vertices see section a 4 ringler et al 2013 3 coastal enhancements compas is a hybrid of the model described by herzfeld 2006 and mpas o ringler et al 2013 as mpas o is designed to operate at global scales it is not optimally suited to downscaled coastal environments where additional physical processes constraints and model features become important specifically robust open boundary methods are required to be applied to maintain stability achieve accurate solutions and facilitate model coupling bathymetry plays a greater role in steering circulation and a representation of nonlinear wetting and drying processes becomes critical wetting and drying may also be required for z vertical coordinates so that vanishing layers can be used with high vertical resolution in the presence of large changes in elevation e g tidal ranges dynamics associated with freshwater inputs from rivers are required to be resolved e g estuarine processes flood plumes and rofis sub grid scale parameterisation in the vertical is typically more important than in the horizontal direction robust inline unstructured meshing tools are required to build complex multi scale model configurations and achieve rapid operational turnover the evolution of generic 2d tracers and tracers in a layered sediment for coupling to biogeochemical bgc and sediment transport modules is also a requirement of compas as is a conservative offline semi lagrangian transport model that can operate on long time steps for bgc transport given these different requirements of coastal modelling it was considered more efficient to import the trisk numerics into the existing framework of herzfeld 2006 which already supported this coastal functionality in this section we consider some key areas which required additional attention on an unstructured mesh 3 1 open boundaries implementation of open boundary equations on an unstructured mesh presents several challenges firstly unlike structured grids where every boundary cell centre is associated with a unique normal velocity edge unstructured meshes may host multiple normal velocity edges for each boundary cell centre fig 3 1a although this is usually not the case if meshes are boundary fitted i e triangulations generated within a convex hull the possibility must be accounted for this results in increased housekeeping to track centres associated with edges edges interior to the boundary edge and to allow for multiple ghost cells associated with boundary centres for hosting data beyond the boundary limits secondly most open boundary radiation conditions are formulated assuming a wave is approaching the boundary at right angles to the boundary edge certainly schemes such as orlanski 1976 miller and thorpe 1981 and camerlengo and o brien 1980 compute the phase speed using cell centres or edges perpendicular to boundary centres or edges the flather condition flather 1988 is formulated using a radiation condition and 1 dimensional continuity equation applicable to the normal boundary direction in unstructured meshes there is no guarantee that interior cell centres or edges will be located perpendicular to boundary centres or edges fig 3 1b this means that costly reconstructions should be performed in order to compute gradients normal to the boundary or since these boundary conditions are themselves approximations with inherent specification error use the nearest centre e g c i for centre c b in fig 3 1b or edge to the normal direction and accept this approximation as yet another source of error radiation conditions used in an active capacity with external data are not robust in the sense that optimised conditions transport poorly to other applications and can be quite susceptible to over specification error often this error must be controlled with sponge zones nudging zones or flow relaxation to maintain stability the active condition of herzfeld and andrewartha 2012 extended by herzfeld and gillibrand 2015 has proven robust and accurate across a wide range of applications this is essentially a dirichlet clamped condition applied to normal and tangential boundary velocities with a local flux adjustment to maintain volume conservation the arrangement of state variables on a hexagonal open boundary is illustrated in fig 3 2 the flux adjustment essentially solves an inverted continuity equation for a normal boundary velocity perturbation which when applied to the cell velocity divergence achieves a target elevation with reference to fig 3 2 the flux f b t required to be applied to normal boundary faces to achieve a target elevation of ζ t is 3 1 f b t a 2 δ t 2 d ζ t 1 ζ t e n o r n e c f e where a is the cell area and δ t 2 d is the 2d time step and n e c indicates the sign of the vector at edge e relative to cell c i e n e c 1 if the normal velocity vector points out of cell c and 1 if the vector points into cell c this flux is then equally distributed over α normal boundary faces e g α 3 in fig 3 2 and converted to a velocity which is subsequently relaxed toward with a time scale τ f for each normal depth averaged boundary velocity u e blue arrows in fig 3 2 3 2 u e t 1 u e t δ t 2 d τ f u e t f b t α l e d b where u e t 1 is the flux corrected velocity at edge e u e t is the normal velocity boundary condition at edge e l e is the edge length and d b are the depths at the boundary edges the time scale is relative to the 2d time step hence if τ f δ t 2 d then the target elevation is achieved every time step in practice τ f 1 2 δ t 2 d provides good results in downscaling applications the target elevation is provided from a parent model and may have a tidal signal or inverse barometer effect added the normal boundary condition u e t is typically either also prescribed from the parent model or is the vertical integral of 3d normal boundary velocities prescribed from the parent model the stagger in the boundary cell is organised so that boundary normal velocities lie outward of the cell centre c b along the green lines in fig 3 1a referred to as normal velocity outside elevation implementation nvoe by herzfeld 2009 using this implementation the elevation is fully constrained and does not require a boundary condition it may be solved via the continuity equation as for the domain interior this means boundary elevation is transmissive of interior signals approaching the boundary while responding to incoming forcing thus minimising specification error this arrangement is conservative in the boundary cell so the conservation equation may be also used in the boundary cell to solve for tracers using the same advection scheme as used in the interior this requires several ghost cells e g c g in fig 3 1a to exist beyond the boundary edge onto which external data e g from a parent model is interpolated this open boundary condition is very well suited to finite volume methods on unstructured meshes requiring no reconstructions of variables perpendicular to the boundary in the case of boundary fitted meshes the scheme operates identically as for structured grids for multiple edges associated with a cell centre the normal velocity perturbation from the flux adjustment is equally spread over all those edges although compas is equipped with a full suite of open boundary approaches where radiation conditions are subject to the perpendicular phase speed issue described above the flux adjusted dirichlet condition has proven to be very reliable in actively forced downscaling applications and other approaches are rarely used the utility of this scheme is demonstrated in sections 4 and 5 however a passively forced domain would require application of the alternative conditions the practical issue of designating cells in the mesh as open boundary cells is also more difficult in unstructured mesh models as the indexing is essentially random whereas in structured mesh models open boundaries can be set as a range of i j indices where either i or j is monotonically increasing to specify open boundaries in compas on the mesh perimeter we define a start end and mid geographic location latitude and longitude for the boundary where the mid location lies somewhere between the start and end to obtain the boundary cell indices a bounding perimeter of the mesh is first computed which comprises the cell centres which have a number of valid maps to other cell centres that is less than their number of edges we define the open boundary as the cells on that perimeter from the start location passing through the mid location and terminating at the end location 3 2 mesh generation use of a trisk based formulation in compas imposes strict constraints on the quality of the underlying unstructured grids utilised meshes are required to be orthogonal centroidal and well centred collections of polygonal cells and dual triangles typically defined in terms of voronoi diagrams and their dual delaunay triangulations these requirements constrain the geometry of the mesh cell edges must be perpendicular to the line joining adjacent cell centres triangle vertices must be positioned at the centre of mass of each polygonal cell and cell vertices must lie in the interior of their associated dual triangles in addition to these discretisation based constraints meshes are typically required to conform to the geometry of coastal boundaries and to follow complex user defined mesh spacing distributions generating such grids is non trivial requiring the construction of highly optimised centroidal voronoi tessellations cvts see du et al 1999 and non obtuse delaunay triangulations see vanderzee et al 2010 compas uses the unstructured meshing library jigsaw engwirda 2017 to accomplish these tasks jigsaw incorporates a range of delaunay based mesh generation and optimisation algorithms including off centre type delaunay refinement techniques erten and üngör 2010 engwirda and ivers 2016 and hybrid mesh optimisation strategies engwirda 2018 these methods are designed to build very high quality delaunay voronoi type meshes in complex domains and have proven successful in generating the optimised orthogonal centroidal and well centred grids required by compas the overall meshing workflow consists of a series of user guided and automated steps 1 a domain boundary and mesh spacing distribution weighting function is defined by the model user the boundary is represented as a collection of polygons polylines and fixed vertices the mesh spacing distribution is a scalar function h x specifying the variation of target cell edge length throughout the domain 2 an off centre delaunay refinement algorithm engwirda and ivers 2016 is used to generate a triangulation of the domain conforming to the boundary definition and following imposed mesh spacing constraints the refinement process continues until a sufficiently high quality restricted delaunay triangulation is generated satisfying various bounds on cell quality size and boundary approximation fidelity see section 3 2 1 for additional details 3 a voronoi grid is assembled from the triangulation with each polygonal cell formed by joining the orthogonal centres of the dual triangles adjacent to each vertex in the triangulation the orthogonal centre of a given triangle is the centre of its circumball the circle passing through its vertices 4 mesh optimisation techniques are used to improve the quality of the final mesh through a combination of cvt like vertex movement transformations of cell topology and vertex insertion removal engwirda 2017 2018 the shape and size of the polygonal cells and dual triangles are iteratively improved optimisation is designed to enhance both the centroidal and well centred characteristics of the mesh leading to tessellations optimised for the trisk based c grid discretisation described in section 2 a number of novel features designed to support high quality grid generation for coastal domains are incorporated including flexible representations for coastal boundary definitions and techniques to support the construction of high quality mesh spacing distributions jigsaw is incorporated as an inline component in the compas framework facilitating automated domain generation and model configuration options applicable to the domain boundary include sub sampling smoothing and linking and options for the mesh spacing distribution include mapping distance from the coast bathymetry or any other variable read from file to mesh resolution via a series of piecewise linear exponential or cosine functions 3 2 1 flexible domain representation geoscientific datasets often define coastlines and domain polygons containing a multitude of features undesirable for mesh generation being sampled at inappropriate resolution containing sharp corners and or narrow passages the application of conventional meshing tools e g triangle shewchuk 2002 typically results in low quality grids containing small cells and undesirable geometrical features the presence of these artefacts can impose severe restrictions on model time step and must be eliminated in practical model configurations while pre processing techniques ramer 1972 douglas and peucker 1973 can be applied to smooth and simplify piecewise linear geometry definitions it is often difficult to obtain results that lead to optimal meshes especially when complex non uniform mesh spacing constraints are imposed as is typical in coastal model configurations the use of restricted delaunay triangulation r d t techniques edelsbrunner and shah 1997 offers an alternative strategy supporting the generation of meshes that conform approximately to a given boundary definition in contrast to conventional delaunay type meshing kernels r d t based approaches do not seek to triangulate the full input geometry exactly but instead progressively refine an initially coarse tessellation until a satisfactory approximation is obtained this triangulation is then further subdivided to ensure mesh spacing and cell quality constraints are satisfied leading to high quality tessellations that effectively filter out small undesirable features in the geometry definition our r d t type meshing kernel is based on the following procedure 1 a coarse delaunay triangulation d t of the domain is constructed based on a small subset of n vertices drawn from the input geometry typically n 16 with vertices selected to give quasi uniform coverage of the full domain 2 the initial set of edges that approximate the domain boundary is identified by constructing the r d t from the initial d t formed in step 1 by definition edelsbrunner and shah 1997 these restricted delaunay edges are those associated with segments in the dual voronoi diagram that intersect the true boundary see fig 3 3 for details 3 the r d t is progressively refined introducing new vertices to eliminate poor quality edges and or triangles in the mesh an edge e is considered poor if a it is too long such that l α h x where l is the length of the edge h x is sampled at the edge midpoint and α 4 3 by default b it does not approximate the domain geometry with sufficient accuracy such that ϵ β h x where ϵ is the length of the perpendicular projection from the edge midpoint to the true boundary the one sided hausdorff distance h x is sampled at the edge midpoint and β 1 5 by default c optional it does not recover the topology of the true domain geometry a triangle t is considered poor if a it is too large such that 3 r α h x where r is the radius of the circumscribing ball associated with t h x is sampled at the centre of the ball and α 4 3 by default b it is of poor shape such that r l ρ where r is the radius of the circumscribing ball associated with t l is the length of the shortest edge in t and the radius edge threshold ρ 1 05 by default this places an implicit bound on the angles in the mesh with θ a r c s i n 1 2 ρ and θ π 2 a r c s i n 1 2 ρ 4 new vertices are added to the r d t using the off centre refinement rules described in engwirda and ivers 2016 and engwirda 2016 these point placement strategies solve a local optimisation problem for the position of new vertices attempting to place new points such that local mesh spacing and quality constraints are satisfied in an optimal manner the r d t is updated following the insertion of each new vertex allowing the approximation of the geometry to be progressively improved see fig 3 3 for several snapshots of the point insertion process 5 refinement continues until all edge and triangle based constraints are satisfied ensuring that cells in the final mesh satisfy the various imposed mesh spacing quality and approximation accuracy thresholds globally the refinement procedure is priority ordered processing the edge or triangle of worst quality at each iteration the performance of r d t based meshing techniques has been studied previously boissonnat and oudot 2005 cheng et al 2013 confirming that such methods offer robust convergence guaranteed to accurately recover both the geometry and topology of an arbitrary boundary definition as h x 0 following the generation of the initial r d t mesh a sequence of mesh optimisation steps are undertaken to further improve its quality 1 the position of vertices are updated according to an optimal delaunay tessellation odt heuristic each vertex is moved toward the weighted mean of its neighbouring voronoi vertices as per chen and xu 2004 in the present implementation vertices lying on the boundary of the domain remain fixed throughout the iteration 2 the topology of the mesh is updated to ensure the tessellation satisfies the delaunay criterion after adjustment of vertex positions updates are computed incrementally flipping the connectivity of edges sandwiched between neighbouring triangles until all cells are delaunay triangles 3 vertex insertion removal operations are attempted new vertices are inserted and existing vertices removed if such operations improve the local quality of the mesh the optimisation steps described above are applied iteratively with 16 full sweeps of the process conducted by default overall mesh optimisation typically improves the shape and spacing of both the delaunay triangles and voronoi polygons leading to tessellations that are better conditioned for the trisk type numerical formulation described in section 2 additional detail concerning the mesh optimisation procedure is contained in engwirda 2017 2018 in our coastal modelling framework use of this restricted delaunay meshing kernel enables the generation of high quality computational grids given potentially low quality geometry inputs smoothing and re sampling the domain boundary at the desired scales of interest without introducing overly small cells and or geometric artefacts an example domain and mesh for the great barrier reef region of the australian coast is included in fig 3 4 showing how a high resolution gshhg based coastline definition can be approximated using a comparatively low resolution restricted delaunay mesh note that various channels and inlets narrower than the local mesh spacing constraints are excluded from the mesh this behaviour allows a relatively large minimum cell size to be preserved leading to a model configuration with acceptable limits on time step size 3 2 2 mesh resolution design the resolution of the unstructured grid can be tailored to the characteristics of the circulation bathymetry and coastline of the domain and areas of interest of the simulation enabling the exploration of multi scale representations of coastal flows the design of optimal mesh resolution distributions for coastal modelling is an ongoing area of research though a number of heuristics are currently in use throughout the community one popular approach e g lambrechts et al 2008 is to adapt mesh spacing to the geometry and bathymetry of the domain considering a combination of distance to coast barotropic wave speed and user defined constraints 3 3 h x min β d d x β w w x h u x where d x x g x is the minimum distance from a point in the domain to its projection on the geometry g x w x g h x is an estimate of the barotropic wave speed given a resting height h x and gravitational acceleration g and h u x represents additional user defined constraints β d β w are relative scaling parameters employing the distance to coast heuristic can be used to enhance resolution along the coastal boundary while matching grid spacing to estimates of free surface wave speed serves to introduce additional mesh resolution in the shelf region and to equilibrate cfl based restrictions on model time step across the domain irrespective of the heuristics employed the generation of high quality meshes requires the construction of mesh spacing distributions that are sufficiently smooth transitioning between regions of large and small grid spacing at rates that enable the formation of relatively undistorted polygonal cells and dual triangles noting that the heuristics in eq 3 3 are typically non smooth defined in terms of discrete coastal geometry and bathymetric data an additional smoothing procedure is employed following persson 2006 a gradient limiting approach is used to construct lipshitz smooth mesh spacing functions given a maximum allowable gradient γ h a fast marching method sethian 1999 sethian and vladimirsky 2000 is employed to solve a variant of the eikonal equation 3 4 max h x γ h γ h given an initial possibly non smooth estimate h 0 x for the mesh spacing distribution the solution of eq 3 4 returns a modified function h x with bounded variation values in h x are limited to ensure the maximum magnitude of spatial gradients does not exceed the threshold γ h at any point in the domain following a fast marching approach values are modified by incrementally working away from local minima if the gradient limits at a given point are violated values are updated in its local neighbourhood until the distribution is sufficiently smooth parts of h x for which the initial gradients already satisfy the threshold γ h remain unperturbed setting smaller values of γ h leads to smoother functions a detailed example is presented in fig 3 4 showing a bathymetrically adapted mesh spacing function and multi scale mesh for the great barrier reef region contours of the gradient limited mesh spacing distribution are drawn h x can be seen to remain smooth and well behaved even in regions of narrow detail adjacent to the archipelago and coastline this in turn leads to a high quality mesh incorporating smooth transitions in cell size 3 3 wetting and drying a cell designated as dry in a model should be reasonably expected to have zero depth and zero velocity through at least one edge bordering that cell these edges and the cell centre should also be omitted from momentum and tracer computation respectively either explicitly or via masking wetting and drying has been practically accomplished in sigma models oey 2005 warner et al 2013 however the sigma vertical coordinate is not the most appropriate for wetting and drying since layers cannot vanish and all cells must always have a non zero water depth oey 2005 on the other hand in z systems the water column need not be represented by all the prescribed layers and sea level may pass through layers to effectively remove a layer from the wet domain all the layers in a column may vanish to create a completely dry column on a c grid the approach of warner et al 2013 places a threshold on water depth at the cell centre usually several cm to tens of cm below which a water column is presumed dry when this occurs flow is restricted to inflow only with no flow allowed out of the cell through the edges while relatively simple to implement this situation does not represent true drying as a the cell still contains water b velocities are still non zero on the edges and c the cell is still included in the wet domain a more rigorous method of drying is the approach of oey 2005 where a depth threshold of the order of mm is placed on the edge depth i e edge thickness where this depth is the maximum depth at centres either side of the edge in the z system if this edge depth falls below the threshold then the velocity at that edge is set to zero cell centre depth is computed via the continuity equation as usual and if this depth falls below the sea floor then sea level is set to the bottom such that the cell contains no water and cell depth is identically zero this cell is then removed from the wet domain for subsequent computation of tracers which retain their last value in that cell the dry edge is also removed from the wet domain until such a time as the edge depth exceeds the threshold i e the maximum depth at centres either side of the edge becomes greater than the threshold the dry cell centre will become wet again when the divergence from all edges surrounding the centre is positive i e more flow is going into the cell through wet edges than flowing out this approach fulfils the three criteria for true drying described above this workflow is housekeeping so far the computation of the pressure gradient becomes more complex in the z system as an edge may be partially wet on one side therefore the edge thicknesses in a column must be decomposed into edges which have centres either side that are a fully wet on either side b partially wet on one side and c completely dry on one side see fig b 1 the pressure gradient formulation is then implemented using the methodology described in appendix b the wetting and drying algorithm is tested by simulating a wetting bore propagating along an initially dry channel the model domain represents a channel 2 km wide and 100 km long with uniform flat bathymetry this is discretised with a quadrilateral grid having spacing of 1000 m in the cross channel direction and 200 m along channel a constant velocity of 1 ms 1 is applied at one end of the initially dry depth 0 channel at the inflow boundary face the elevation is initially set to 0 1 m the quadratic bottom friction coefficient is 0 002 and vertical layer spacing is 0 5 m from 0 to 4 m temperature and salinity are set to 20 c and 35 respectively horizontal viscosity and diffusivity are set to 40 and 0 ms2s 1 respectively and vertical viscosity and diffusivity are constant at 0 05 and 0 01 ms2s 1 respectively the model is allowed to run for 3 h and the solution represents a propagating bore along the channel with a parabolic shape surface elevation profile determined by a balance between the quadratic bottom friction and surface slope the length of the bore is related to the depth at the inflow by l g d 2 2 c d u 2 where d is the depth at the inflow and u is the velocity at the inflow 1 ms 1 this relation is compared to the model solution in fig 3 5a showing good agreement with model and theory the bore profile at 1 h intervals is shown in fig 3 5b illustrating the parabolic shape note also that the depth in front of the bore is zero this simple test demonstrates the functionality of the wetting and drying algorithm used in compas 3 4 high order tracer advection often unstructured models apply low order approximations for tracer advection mpas uses 3rd and 4th order flux corrected transport fct schemes using the approach of skamarock and gassmann 2011 the flux correction zalesak 1979 is applied to maintain monotonicity which can be expensive numerically due to the limiting procedure and to a much lesser extent the solution of a first order scheme to obtain the flux limiter the approach of skamarock and gassmann 2011 relies on using a quadratic polynomial with coefficients obtained using a least squares fit to obtain the second derivative of tracers at edges via formal differentiation of that polynomial this method is also applied in compas but is taken a step further to use a least squares fit to reconstruct tracer values perpendicular to edges that are not accessible by direct mappings to cell centres from that edge if this is performed then monotonic advection schemes may be used and avoid the requirement of the fct scheme while computational saving is achieved in doing this more computation is required to obtain a larger number of coefficients in the least squares fit note that the ultimate limiter achieves monotonicity for 1 dimensional schemes and on 2 dimensional structured grids operator splitting is used to achieve monotonicity a 2 dimensional limiter is strictly required for the arbitrary meshes used here however the approach outlined here can be applied to any scheme and we do not observe monotonicity violations in test cases performed so far fig 3 6 illustrates the problem encountered when using higher order advection schemes on unstructured meshes with reference to fig 3 6 the quickest leonard 1991 scheme for example computes fluxes at the edge f i 1 2 as 3 5 f i 1 2 1 2 t i 1 t i 1 1 2 q i 1 2 t i t i 1 1 6 1 6 q i 1 2 2 c u r v c u r v t i 2 t i 1 t i 2 q i 1 2 0 c u r v t i 1 2 t i t i 1 q i 1 2 0 where q u 1 δ t h 2 is the courant number at cell edges h 2 is the distance between cell centres note that this scheme is not monotonic unless a limiter is applied here we use the ultimate limiter of leonard 1991 this limiter introduces normalised tracer variables at the cell faces 3 6 t i t i t u t d t u t i 1 2 t i 1 2 t u t d t u where t u is the tracer concentration at the upstream cell centre and t d is the tracer concentration at the downstream cell centre the monotonic solution is obtained if e g section 3 2 leonard 1991 3 7 t i 1 2 t i q i 1 2 for 0 t i 1 t i t i 1 2 1 for 0 t i 1 t i 1 2 t i for t i 0 o r t i 1 to implement the quickest scheme we require a set of 4 uniformly spaced values oriented along a line perpendicular to the edge f i 1 2 due to the layout of the unstructured grid the values at t i 1 and t i 2 may not be accessible by direct mappings to cell centres from the edge at f i 1 2 in this case a pentagon adjoins a hexagon in the i 1 direction so that the value at i 2 maps around the corner to cell t i 2 in fig 3 6 the correct value to use in the quickest computation should lie at the location of the green dot we use the quadratic least squares interpolation to reconstruct this value using values 1 to n p e at locations of the red dots in the least squares estimation if a local coordinate system x y is set up with local axis normal and tangential to the edge then the quadratic polynomial used is 3 8 t x y c 0 c 1 x c 2 y c 3 x 2 c 4 x y c 5 y 2 weights to calculate the quadratic polynomial coefficients c 0 t o c 5 are computed at model start up using singular value decomposition svd using a unit scalar field and cached for use throughout the run for every edge e and n th coefficient c n the svd procedure will generate weights b e n i where i 1 n p e corresponds to each tracer cell centre red dots in fig 3 6 in this case n p e 9 used in the least squares fit the n th coefficient for edge e c e n is recovered by the sum of these weights multiplied by the tracer value at that cell centre e g 3 9 c e n i 1 n p e b e n i t i given an x y relative to the centre of edge e then the tracer value at that location is approximated using eq 3 8 where the coefficients are obtained using eq 3 9 for that edge in the local coordinate system a value at 3 δ n is required to be computed for use in the advection algorithm eq 3 5 where δ n is the distance from the edge to each adjacent cell centre i e x 3 δ n and y 0 in the polynomial so that only weights associated with coefficients that are a function of x need be saved in order to estimate values at t i 1 and t i 2 e g in the example above coefficients c o c 1 and c 3 the approach of using least squares reconstructions to interpolate locally one dimensional values outside of direct mappings can be extended to any advection scheme that requires these values for higher order terms we have also implemented an unstructured variant of van leer s 1979 scheme using this approach see below these tracer advection schemes have been tested in an idealised domain an attractive feature of the trisk numerics is that it will operate on orthogonal curvilinear grids so tests can be performed using traditional advection schemes built for rectangular grids as a benchmark solution our test domain consists of a flat bottomed basin 20 m depth forced by a 1 m semi diurnal tide at the eastern boundary and connected to a 30 km long estuary of depth 5 m at the head and 10 m at the mouth delivering a flow of 100 m3s 1 a 0 1 nm 2 westerly wind blows over the domain the grid resolution is 200 m and the test runs for 30 days fig 3 7 shows solutions using various advection schemes parameterisations are identical in all simulations except for the advection scheme for the purpose of assessing the advection schemes the structured ultimate quickest solution is considered the benchmark solution with surface salinity shown in fig 3 7a because this scheme is monotone positive definite possesses low numerical diffusion and uses direct mappings which are possible on a quad grid to the tracer values e g t i 1 and t i 2 used for the 2nd derivative in the algorithm i e no approximations to these values are used the unstructured ultimate quickest uses the least squares interpolation to reconstruct these outmost tracer values hence any differences to the benchmark are due only to this approximation these are shown in fig 3 7b as the root mean squared salinity error rmse relative to the benchmark results using this scheme are very similar to the benchmark with largest error of 0 5 psu in the high salinity tongue intruding into lower salinity water in the north west of the basin the scheme of van leer 1979 has also been cast in unstructured form unstructured vanleer using the least squares reconstructions fig 3 7c and here differences to the benchmark are due to these reconstructions in addition to the inherent properties of the scheme the rmse again compares favourably to the benchmark albeit slightly more degraded compared to the unstructured ultimate quickest the unstructured 3rd order fct scheme fig 3 7d uses the least squares interpolation to approximate the second derivative directly and the larger rms errors indicate a more diffuse solution than the benchmark likely due to the use of the first order solution to construct the anti diffusive fluxes in the fct scheme all these unstructured schemes are viable candidates for generalised unstructured meshes they are however more numerically expensive speed comparisons are presented in table 3 1 note that several other schemes have also been included in this comparison structured van leers fct schemes and runtime ratios have been normalised to the fastest scheme structured vanleer the unstructured vanleer appears to be a good balance between computational efficiency and accuracy 3 5 other schemes smagorinsky horizontal closure smagorinsky 1963 is a popular method to prescribe horizontal diffusion and viscosity coefficients in coastal models as the magnitude of mixing scales with the amount of shear present in the flow mpas uses the analogous leith 1996 formulation in preference due to its performance in models with eddy permitting resolution in compas we include an option for smagorinsky mixing to be implemented where the tensors required to compute the smagorinsky mixing are computed from rotated reconstructions of cell centred east and north velocity vectors other functionality desired in the coastal domain is inherited from the framework of herzfeld 2006 with no requirement for modification to unstructured meshes this functionality mostly applies to schemes that operate in the vertical and includes 2 equation turbulence close and surface fluxes 4 idealised application to demonstrate the model is functional we first apply it to an idealised test that has an analytic solution the test we choose is that of an alongshore wind applied to an infinitely long channel with a sloping bottom this test case was considered by chapman 1985 and palma and matano 1998 2001 to assess various open boundary conditions and provides an opportunity in this study to exercise the open boundary infrastructure the use of cyclic open boundaries emulates an infinite coastline chapman 1985 hence when using this condition boundary error is minimised and we may compare the model directly to the analytic solution the analytic solution exists for a linear model where constant wind stress is applied in a longshore direction assuming cross shelf transport and alongshore sea level gradient are small then steady state t transport u is given by chapman 1985 eq 4 5 4 1 u d τ s ρ r where d is the water depth τ s is the wind stress ρ is the density and r is the linear friction coefficient note u is the transport hence velocity u u d the steady state sea surface slope is given by chapman 1985 eq 4 6 4 2 ζ y f τ s ρ g r l 2 y where l is the width of the channel and it is assumed ζ 0 at y l 2 mid channel the adjustment time for u to reach steady state is h r which at the deepest point is 2 5 days using a wind stress of 0 1 nm 2 in a zonal channel 500 km wide the dimensions of this domain are the same as the test domain used by palma and matano 1998 except the southern hemisphere is considered with depths at the southern and northern boundaries of 50 and 110 m respectively linear resistance coefficient r 0 0005 ms 1 coriolis 1 028 10 4 s 1 and ρ 1024 76 kgm 3 then eq 4 1 gives an along shore depth averaged velocity of 0 195 ms 1 the cross shore depth averaged velocity is zero and elevation at the coast from eq 4 2 is 0 49 m slope of 2 05 10 6 this result assumes a linear depth averaged model is used and a non linear 3 d model with quadratic bottom friction is expected to give different results two models were set up with a quadrilateral quad and regular hexagonal hex mesh so that both normal and tangential velocities could be implemented with cyclic boundary conditions resolution was 20 km for quad and distance between centres of 25 km for hex both models used 24 vertical layers the mellor yamada 2 0 turbulence closure scheme was used and horizontal viscosity and diffusivity were 2000 and 200 m2s 1 respectively sea level and currents at the coast when a steady state was achieved 12 days are shown in table 4 1 the results of which compare favourably with theory the evolution of sea level and velocity is shown in fig 4 1 note that the hex sea level initially overshoots the quad case and has a tendency to increase after the adjustment time this is a consequence of the cyclic normal boundary velocities unaligned with the flow for some boundary cell faces on a hexagonal cell making the cyclic boundary sensitive to small perturbations in the flow it is generally difficult to implement cyclic boundaries on hexagonal meshes unless the mesh is perfectly regular on a plane i e not on a spheroid however since this small deviation is related to the cyclic boundary implementation rather than the model dynamic core this test demonstrates that compas is capable of reproducing an accurate wind driven response especially for quad in an idealised domain and shows that both the open boundary infrastructure and basic dynamic core are behaving appropriately 5 realistic application to demonstrate the utility of compas we apply it to a realistic domain subjected to full forcing mechanisms and compare it to observations the domain chosen for the application is the storm bay d entrecasteaux channel and derwent estuary region in south east tasmania australia fig 4 1 we choose to simulate a flood event that will exercise the trisk coastal numerics specifically the open boundaries that introduce basin scale dynamics into the region through a seaward boundary and freshwater flow through two river boundaries momentum advection that represents the inertia of the freshwater flow sub gridscale parameterisation that stabilises the momentum advection while not adversely dissipating the flow high order tracer advection that preserves the frontal boundaries of the flow nonlinear coriolis that turns the flood plume to the left southern hemisphere and various meshing configurations using different weighting functions the storm bay area is dominated by local forcing notably freshwater inputs from the huon and derwent rivers in late summer storm bay may be impacted from offshore by the east australian current water flowing down the east coast of tasmania and in winter the region is influenced by the zeehan current flowing down the west coast these current systems are introduced into the model via the open boundaries the model is nested within a larger scale regional model covering the whole of tasmania and bass strait fig 5 1 which in turn is nested within the global ofam model oke et al 2008 low frequency sea level from the global model is superimposed with 8 tidal constituents m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 q1 from the tpxo global model egbert and erofeeva 2002 and applied at the boundary of the regional model the local model is subsequently nested within the regional model and therefore inherits both low frequency and tidal signals surface fluxes are derived from the australian bureau of meteorology s operational atmospheric models access a puri et al 2012 http www bom gov au nwp doc access nwpdata shtml at a resolution of 12 km heat fluxes applied at the surface boundary condition were computed from standard meteorological variables provided by access a wet and dry bulb temperature air pressure wind speed and cloud amount using short and longwave calculations outlined in zillman 1972 and the bulk method for sensible and latent heat using bulk coefficients of kondo 1975 for the surface freshwater fluxes precipitation was provided by access a and evaporation was computed from the latent heat flux wind speed was converted to stress using the bulk scheme of large and pond 1981 the model was run from 1 june 2015 to 20 june 2015 during which both huon and derwent rivers were in flood delivering fresh water into storm bay and fortunately coincided with the deployment of a slocum glider that was used for validation glider profiles are sampled at higher resolution than the model and therefore resolve finer scale dynamics which are absent in the model this makes quantitative comparison difficult and to overcome this we bring the glider toward the model by sub sampling the glider data onto the model grid as opposed to interpolating the model output onto the glider trajectory the glider observations are averaged into model volumetric cells at discrete time intervals and subsequently viewed as a time series allowing quantitative assessment of the model s performance using standard time series metrics root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae correlation coefficient cc bias willmott scores d in addition to coincident model and glider variables a horizontal neighbourhood can be defined around the glider location in the model and fuzzy verification techniques ebert 2008 may be used to assess the extent of any double penalty issues for this study a simple bound is placed around the glider variable representing minimum and maximum values of the variable in the model within the neighbourhood if the glider observation falls within these bounds we can assume the model is reproducing observed dynamics within a length scale representing a tolerable displacement of features in terms of ebert s decision model definition useful forecast predicts the observed variable within an area having a length scale that represents a tolerable displacement of a feature in the model additionally a mooring was deployed in storm bay at 43 315 s 147 623 e from which near surface 15 m temperature could be compared to the model and sea level at hobart 42 882 s 147 327 e was also available for comparison three unstructured grids were constructed and simulated using weighting functions representing bathymetry distance from the coast and salinity fig 5 2 denoted bathy coast and salt respectively this allows the role of discretisation and convergence of the solution to be assessed as well as demonstrating the meshing capability of compas the definition of each of these meshes is summarised in table 5 1 where a piecewise linear change in resolution was applied with the piecewise limits shown the salinity distribution used for the salt weighting was taken from an alternative structured model on 29 july 2018 additionally a structured orthogonal curvilinear quadrilateral grid quad was constructed based on a polar type cell distribution where minimum resolution is achieved at the grid edge along the offshore open boundary and resolution increases landward in a north westward direction resolution in this grid ranged from 66 to 956 m note that this grid contains up to double the number of surface wet cells as the unstructured meshes these models contain three open boundaries one offshore boundary skirting the shelf edge and two river boundaries supplying freshwater flows from the huon and derwent rivers the freshwater flows are input using the method described in herzfeld 2015 and the offshore boundary uses the condition described in herzfeld and andrewartha 2012 the rivers are represented to beyond the salt wedge propagation and tidal limit this is achieved by adding a 2 d laterally averaged orthogonal curvilinear grid with the mesh fig 5 3 since the mesh is defined as a series of independent cell specifications it is relatively simple to create a new set of cells representing the curvilinear river and patch these into the mesh by referencing one edge to a common set of coordinates this is something that is difficult to achieve in a structured grid or unstructured meshes that solely use triangles the advantage of using a quadrilateral curvilinear grid for this section is that there is no cross river resolution that would unduly compromise the required time step the models use the mellor yamada 2 0 turbulence closure model mellor and yamada 1982 the k ε model of burchard et al 1998 was also trialled but this seemed to overmix the freshwater plume in the estuary the unstructured ultimate quickest scheme was used for tracer advection and the smagorinsky horizontal mixing was implemented for bathy coast and salt with an empirical constant of 0 1 added to a defined base rate of 80 m2s 1 with areal scaling on the mesh the quad grid used biharmonic smagorinsky viscosity constant of 0 1 with a base rate of 14 7 105 m4s 1 also scaled by cell area all models used horizontal diffusivity of zero sea level at hobart and temperature at the storm bay mooring fig 5 1 metrics are reported in table 5 2 all models exhibit very good skill at predicting the tide willmott score of 0 96 for salt and also skilfully capture the low frequency variability the observed temperature exhibits some diurnal oscillations of up to 0 6 c that are not captured by the model hence while the rmse is low the correlation and willmott score show reduced skill both the temperature and low frequency records are too short to adequately assess model performance resulting from dynamics at longer timescales e g weather band or seasonal scales however results do indicate that the model is not performing erroneously the time period was chosen to assess the response to a flood plume event into storm bay so we now turn attention to the glider data freshwater flows down the huon and derwent rivers peak at 1290 and 235 m3s 1 respectively on 9 june 2015 the derwent river is regulated higher upstream in its catchment such that controlled volumes are released downstream consequently flow is usually less than the huon huon flow typically turns left into d entrecasteaux channel herzfeld and andrewartha 2010 eventually exiting the northern channel into storm bay this characteristic is also observed in all model meshes where a well defined plume is observed after the flood peak on 10 and 11 june fig 5 4a and salinity is persistently lower in the northern d entrecasteaux during this time enhanced shear and vorticity is observed in the velocity field which translates to elevated values for the smagorinsky mixing coefficient fig 5 4b derwent flow tends to head south eastward across storm bay this is also observed in the model although peak flows were on 9 june the maximum plume extent in storm bay due to the derwent flow occurred around 16 june this is a consequence of the lag in the plume transiting the estuary but also favourable wind and tide conditions combining to push the freshwater plume further into storm bay at this time the glider data fig 5 5 reflects this event with minimum surface salinity occurring on 16 june and thereafter increasing as the glider heads south eastward into more marine waters while in the fresh plume 16 june the glider time series shows numerous spikes of low salinity these correspond to the instances when the glider reaches the surface to record low salinity 32 then returns to depths of around 30 m with an associated increase in salinity to 35 as the glider heads further into storm bay and away from the flood plume the salinity becomes homogeneous to depths of 90 m with no evidence of a surface fresh layer the glider comparisons are shown in table 5 3 with a plot of the highest skill comparison for the coast model in fig 5 5 comparisons to observation in this figure also include the minimum and maximum temperature or salinity values found in the model in the neighbourhood of the glider location where the neighbourhood in this case is chosen as a 3 km diameter over the glider location a snapshot of the coast salinity distribution at 0000 16 june 2015 when freshwater intrusion into storm bay was maximum is provided in fig 5 6 for reference included in this figure is the glider trajectory and a distance scale finally a plot of coast salinity using time on the x axis and depth on the y axis is shown in fig 5 7 for qualitative comparison all models capture the intrusion of the freshwater plume into storm bay with the most accurate representation being the coast model which has a skill score of 0 91 for temperature and 0 96 for salinity these skill scores were computed at the model location coincident with that of the glider in some cases e g 1900 16 june the maximum salinity in the neighbourhood exhibits even better correlation to observation when the glider enters the plume at the surface fig 5 5 this indicates that while the freshwater plume is present its location is displaced in space slightly to result in some double penalty error confounding the quantitative skill metrics the neighbourhood diameter 3 km is somewhat subjective however when considered in the context of the spatial scale of the plume extent it seems a reasonable amount with which the exact plume position may be displaced as the glider enters marine waters further south the model shows a small bias of low temperature 0 1 c and high salinity 0 2 the temperature of the freshwater input is not measured and in this case we use the low pass filtered air temperature as the river temperature which appears to be introducing a low temperature bias this is observed in fig 5 5 as the spikes in the model time series when the glider is in the southern open water of storm bay after 17 june little variability in model skill is observed as a function of the model grid used the best response is provided by the coast model although all coast bathy and salt models provide accurate responses while the salt model has resolution specifically optimised along the freshwater plume trajectory the coast and bathy models also use weighting functions that deliver comparable resolution in these areas the quad model delivers the worst performance most likely due to high resolution not being allocated to the full path of the flood plume in particular the lack of high resolution in the more narrow reaches of the upper estuary it is encouraging to see a level of convergence of the solution across the different meshes since if this were not the case it would make the process of model calibration as a function of the mesh an exceedingly difficult one overall the response of the model when the trisk numerics are exercised is favourable in this case 6 conclusion an unstructured model is presented using the trisk numerics in the horizontal such that momentum advection is discretised using the vector invariant form coriolis uses the nonlinear advective approach where planetary vorticity is added to relative vorticity and tangential velocities are computed via the method of thuburn et al 2009 in the vertical a structured approach is adopted allowing access to z or σ vertical coordinates implementation of wetting and drying in z coordinates and access to a suite of 2 equation turbulence closure schemes this model adds to the pool of unstructured models that are capable of producing viable solutions in the coastal zone the point of difference is that our model operates on the dual of a c grid delaunay triangulation thus dispensing with the need to control spurious modes that are known to exist on c grid triangulations use of the c grid retains the good representation of propagating gravity waves on the mesh the trisk numerics support other attractive features vis conservation of potential vorticity a coriolis term that supports stationary modes and conserves energy and a computationally competitive implementation of momentum advection using the vector invariant approach coastal enhancements include the addition of a full open boundary suite where for active boundary forcing the scheme of herzfeld and andrewartha 2012 was found to be naturally well suited to unstructured approaches and delivered the high quality solutions seen in structured models a wetting and drying scheme was implemented where a depth threshold was applied to edges allowing cell centres to completely dry and new high order advection schemes were implemented by extending the approach of skamarock and gassmann 2011 a further attractive feature of compas is the inline generation of high quality meshes using the jigsaw mesh generation software this software is specifically designed to produce high quality meshes conforming to the requirements of trisk numerics vis orthogonal centroidal and well centred meshes additionally advanced techniques are used to produce power meshes and the mesh may be built on stereographic projections we have tested the model by assessing several idealised tests and an event based simulation in a realistic application south eastern tasmania against observations in the latter case the event was a freshwater flood discharge in an estuary emptying into a bay subject to full forcing this simulation exercised relevant aspects of the new coastal code vis momentum advection horizontal sub gridscale parameterisation high order tracer advection open boundary conditions and the jigsaw mesh generation with various weighting functions the results of the test indicated that these new discretisations in the coastal ocean code are performing favourably the model was also shown to produce viable solutions in idealised test cases whilst its performance to date is promising further applications and extended use is required to gauge its strengths and assess limitations it is hoped that this coastal implementation of the trisk numerics is a useful addition to the existing pool of

appreciate the encouragement of the mpas developers in pursuing this work appendix a 2d mode and time stepping the solutions to the equations of motion contain both fast moving surface gravity waves and slower moving internal waves it is advantageous from a computational efficiency perspective to separate these two types of motion allowing the fast moving waves to be solved on a smaller time step this is accomplished using mode splitting where eq 2 2 is vertically integrated to provide equations for the velocity transport i e 2d mode or barotropic mode which are then used via the vertical integral of eq 2 1 to provide the surface elevation the vertical integration of eq 2 2 removes all vertical structure for a variable x the vertical average is defined as a 1 x 1 h ζ h ζ x d z 1 d h ζ x d z eq 2 1 subject to vertical integration yields using 2 8 a 2 ζ t d u 0 where u is the vertically averaged type equation here velocity the vertical integral of eq 2 2 gives a 3 u t η k u 1 h 2 ρ 0 p a n g ρ t o p ζ n 1 d h k d r y g h 2 ρ z ζ ρ n d z d z k d h u τ s d ρ t o p τ b d ρ t o p ξ k u u 2 2 with ξ k u and where ringler et al 2013 section a 5 a 4 u u u the last two terms of eq a 3 represent the advection of this fluctuating velocity u and are called the dispersion terms mellor 2002 eq 22 rather than evaluate this explicitly eq a 4 is used and these terms are equal to the vertical average of the 3d velocity advection minus the 2d velocity advection e g a 5 ξ k u u 2 2 k u k u u 2 2 k u k u u 2 2 also d h u is computed using eq 2 3 with u substituted for u and ρ t o p and ρ b o t are surface and bottom density respectively the pressure gradient is computed using the method outlined in appendix b the bottom stress computed using bottom velocity vertical integral of momentum advection involving u in eq a 5 and the pressure gradient vertical integral are calculated prior to the 2d mode and held constant throughout the 2d time integrations the 2d mode in turn provides the surface elevation for use in the 3d mode the flow of control is illustrated in fig a 1 we choose not to use a time filter in this feedback so as to maintain consistency with the continuity and conservation equation with consistency defined by gross et al 2002 this is equivalent to the delta function filter discussed by shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 after the 2d mode is complete the 3d velocities are adjusted so that their vertical integral is equal to the 2d velocities it is possible to execute compas in 2d mode only this essentially only solves the vertically integrated equations to provide velocity transports and surface elevation leading to large savings in execution time compas uses leapfrog time stepping for momentum and euler forward time stepping for tracers the euler forward time stepping derivative in a simple one dimensional advection equation is approximated as a 6 c t 1 c t δ t u c t d x for some variable c this is a first order taylor approximation which is explicit in time since the function c d t is evaluated at the time level t as opposed to t 1 the euler scheme is unstable kowalik and murty 1993 p163 and requires the presence of some diffusion to stabilise it rood 1987 this scheme was chosen for tracers since an array containing tracer values at the backward time level is not required as this can become expensive in biogeochemical models using 60 state variables the leapfrog time derivative is second order accurate and in a simple one dimensional advection equation is approximated as a 7 f t 1 f t 1 2 u δ t f t d x for some momentum variable f solutions to the leapfrog scheme contain contributions representing physical related to the differential equation solved and computational related to the structure of the numerical equation modes the latter alternates on every timestep and is an undesirable artefact of the leapfrog scheme this computational mode can however be removed by the use of a filter such as that of asselin 1972 a 8 f t f t 0 5 υ f t 1 2 f t f t 1 where υ is a constant typically 0 1 compatibility between the 2d and 3d modes of the model and hence conservation is achieved by integrating the 2d fluxes over the 3d time steps and adjusting the 3d velocities once the 2d step is complete so that the vertical integral of the 3d fluxes is equal to the time integrated 2d fluxes this ensures that the change in sea level over the 3d time step as computed by the 2d equations is equal to the total divergence of 3d fluxes above any given layer see below the leapfrog method makes this summation over the 2d step difficult shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 consider fig a 2 where the 3d mode operates on a time step δ t 3 and the 2d mode has a time step δ t 2 with δ t 3 i r δ t 2 in this case i r 8 the leapfrog scheme advances any variable by 2 δ t 2 using the values of the variable at time t δ t 2 and t according to eq a 7 this time stepping is represented by the arrows in fig a 2 the 2d momentum fluxes must be integrated from time t to t δ t 3 according to a 9 u f l u x t t δ t 3 u t d h 1 δ t for some time increment δ t to be defined later if consistency and thus conservation is to be maintained between the 2d and 3d modes then a 10 u f l u x u f l u x h ζ u t δ t 3 h 1 δ t 3 d z integrating eq 2 1 from layer z to the surface using 2 8 with leibnitz s rule and noting z ζ 0 a 11 ζ t w z u z where w z is the vertical velocity through layer z and u z z ζ u d z is vertically integrated velocity at time t δ t 3 above layer z therefore the volume change in a water column over the time period δ t 3 is equal to the divergence of the vertical integral of the flux above that layer including the contribution of vertical fluxes the volume balance for the layer thickness this may be expressed as a 12 ζ t δ t 3 ζ t δ t 3 w z δ t 3 u z eq a 12 relates the vertical velocities to the change in sea level and if this is satisfied then conservation in the tracer equations is achieved if z h and w h 0 no flow through the bottom then eq a 12 becomes a 13 ζ t δ t 3 ζ t δ t 3 u z if eq a 10 holds then eq a 13 reverts to the continuity equation for the 2d mode eq 2 13 it is clear that for eq a 10 to hold the 2d fluxes must be integrated in time such that the time increment in eq a 9 δ t 2 δ t 2 i e on only every 2nd step of the leapfrog i e the summation of fluxes takes place on only those times depicted by the bottom sequence of arrows in fig a 2 this is only possible if i r is an even number hence the leapfrog scheme is limited by the condition that the ratio of δ t 3 δ t 2 must be even appendix b pressure term for wetting and drying the hydrostatic equation p ρ g d z can be integrated from any depth z to the surface ζ to give the pressure at the level z p b 1 p p a g z

n d z where ρ ζ is the density at the surface in the wetting and drying discretisation used in compas the surface gradient is not explicitly evaluated rather this term enters the pressure balance through a summation of cell thickness above and including cell faces that are completely or partially dry this approach is adopted to cope with wetting and drying in which the surface elevation in adjacent wet cells to an edge may be separated by many layers this situation is illustrated in fig b 1 where cells c m and c p are cells either side of edge e dz e k edge thickness for edge e at layer
