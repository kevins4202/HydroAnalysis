13575,an assessment of the susceptibility of the raw and treated drinking water to microplastics mp contamination was conducted because of the inherent low density and size 5 mm of mp that enhances the mobility and pervasiveness in environmental media although the ecological and physiological effects of mp is still under scrutiny but assessing the vulnerability of the drinking water system is paramount to the development of ameliorating strategies for the possible impacts the susceptibility was evaluated using the transport pathway and dynamics of mp in soil matrix and the treatment efficiency of the municipal dwtp mp is more prevalent in the surface water system than the groundwater gw system despite the high removal efficiency of the surface water fed dwtp the product still contained undesirable magnitude of mp low mp concentration was reported in the water produced from gw fed dwtp despite the fact that soil is the sink of mp the mobility within the matrix is very low the low mobility was attributed to the occurrence of upward flow caused by reverse pathway which is enhanced by the inherent low density and size of mp keywords microplastics drinking water groundwater surface water freshwater aquifer 1 introduction plastic the genealogy from which microplastics mp emanate are ubiquitous because of the inherent advantages that promote the diverse applications thus it is expedient to posit that mp are also pervasive on the principle of size definitions mp are classified as either primary or secondary microplastics the primary mp are produced to be microscopic in size and are part of the ingredients of cosmetic compounding 109 air blasting media 91 drug vectors 102 and virgin plastic pellets typically 2 5 mm in diameter a combination of physical biological and chemical processes impacted on the structural integrity of the bulk plastic which induced fragmentation 83 to produce secondary mp in a recent treatise 1 the different underlying mechanisms of the bulk plastic fragmentation were elucidated to include photooxidation by uv light hydrolysis mechanical fracture due to sand abrasion or water turbulence or bio assimilation by microorganisms this is an indication that the sizes shapes densities and physicochemical properties of the mp produced is greatly dependent on the environmental factors and the material from which the plastic is made in order to understand the pathways of mp contamination of environmental matrix by mp a conceptual box model fig 1 was designed by re 2 the mp in cosmetics e g scrubs toothpastes air blasting media and apparels get into the environment through industrial or domestic drainage systems 3 about 65 million mp particles are released into the environment from wastewater treatment works on daily basis 3 stormwater sewers wind currents and degradation of surface and buried large plastic debris in soils and landfills are major sources of mp contamination in the environment 107 3 the sewage sludge which is abundant in mp is also a source of mp pollution 93 78 through all these routes the leachate creates pathway in soil for the mp to get into the groundwater gw system 4 they also accumulate in the soil and later remobilized by rainfall and or irrigation into different aquatic ecosystems it is noteworthy that the mp contamination of potable water is far more dangerous than any other route e g fish and seafood this is because the magnitude of daily water consumption greatly outweighs the quantity of fish and seafood consumed and the pathway from the drinking water source to the household tap is much shorter 2 considering the vast products and activities that produce mp the potential for potable water contamination is very high the low density and size of mp 5 mm have been identified as contributors to the widespread transport and distribution across large distances in environmental media 90 5 thus considering the mode of entry of mp into the environment the pervasiveness and the inherent features that promotes the dispersibility it is hereby hypothesized that the potable water sources and the treated potable water are greatly susceptible to mp contamination previously a critical review of the occurrence of mp in drinking water has been presented from different viewpoints danopoulos et al 6 presented a critical appraisal of available research reports on mp contamination of drinking waters and the assessment of the state of evidence and quantification of human exposures a review that provided an in depth appraisal of the interactions of mp with current wastewater treatment operations was provided by enfrin et al 1 the mechanism of generation occurrence fate impact and the potential solution to reduce the interactions between wastewater treatment operations were highlighted from the perspective of quality assurance and quantitative approach the occurrence of mp in drinking water and its freshwater sources in terms of concentration polymer type shape and size distribution were reviewed by koelmans et al 7 in the present treatise a holistic determination of the vulnerability of potable water sources i e gw surface water and municipal water treatment plant to mp contamination is elucidated via the determination of the possible route of contamination 2 microplastic contamination of raw and treated potable water sources the detection of mp in surface water groundwater gw and wastewater 8 engendered a pertinent question on the susceptibility of our drinking water to mp contamination 7 thus far few studied which reported the presence of microplastics in tap water and bottled water 9 12 have attempted to address this issue recently it was estimated 105 that 1 mt of mp enter the environment annually and more than 50 of these evade any form of treatment or management thus the issue of mp contamination elicited gravitas attention from scientist engineers and policy makers on the pretext of the impending ecological impacts of mp legislation to abolish it as ingredients of personal care products in the usa by july 1 2017 13 was proposed under schedule 1 of the canadian environmental protection act 14 mp was listed as an undesirable toxicant owing to the promulgation as a voluntary elimination by industry in 2017 in the united kingdom and australia industries have stopped the incorporation in product formulas generally potable water is derived from array of sources but the surface water gw and the municipal water treatment plant constitute the major sources oftentimes the surface water is made potable through the conventional treatment plant or consumed raw especially in the least developed region of the world the decision to treat gw before consumption or consumed raw without any form of treatment greatly depends on the quality characteristics despite the affirmation of the presence of mp in different environmental matrix the nature of toxicity of mp is yet to be satisfactorily ascertained but the potential toxicity cannot be ignored premised on the handling of the different sources of potable water from the source to the household tap the human consumption of mp is highly probable the direct consumption of raw gw or surface water without treatment is an assurance of mp consumption if any is present in the matrix the passage of feed water through the municipal drinking water treatment plant dwtp cannot ensure complete removal if the fact that mp is one of the emerging contaminants that the conventional dwtp was not actually designed for the removal in order to understand the status of our potable water concerning mp contamination the present treatise aimed at a systematic review of the susceptibility of the drinking water sources and the feed water to the dwtp to mp contamination 2 1 freshwater systems an overview of research reports since the bourgeoning interest in the environmental contamination of mp has focused more on marine environment than any other environmental matrix the occurrence of mp in the atlantic ocean has been reported as far back as 1974 87 other reports on marine mp that focused on the source analytical method abundance spatial and temporal distribution transport behavior and ecological effects have been presented 80 81 99 82 106 108 the occurrence of mp of diverse origins and compositions have been detected in different freshwater sources 5 of north america in the los angeles basin 15 the north shore channel of chicago 16 the st lawrence river 17 and the great lakes 18 20 in europe in lake geneva 21 the italian lake garda 22 the austrian danube river 23 the german elbe mosel neckar and rhine rivers 24 and the uk tamar estuary 25 and in asia in lake hovsgol mongolia 26 the mp concentrations of selected aquatic resources are presented in table 1 the mp contamination in lake winnipeg the 11th largest global freshwater ecosystem was quantified and compared with the report of eriksen et al 20 on other large canadian lakes 27 this study provided data on the occurrence of mp in canadian freshwater ecosystems and the relative extent of mp pollution across the canadian freshwater systems surface water samples were collected between 2014 and 2016 and analyzed for the occurrence of mp the magnitude of mp detected were within the same range of those reported for the laurentian great lakes fibrous secondary mp formed the major mp contaminant detected in the sample the magnitude of mp detected in the north basin were higher than that of the south basin of the lake in the first year i e 2014 only the average lake wide concentration for the study period were comparable and not statistically different the sem edx analysis revealed that an average of about twenty three percent 23 of particles isolated were non plastic materials this study contributed to the assertion that mp contamination of surface water is prevalent even in less densely populated freshwater ecosystems premised on the abundant data on marine mp contamination and the very few data on mp contamination of freshwater a critical appraisal of the issue of mp in freshwater was conducted to document the prevailing understanding the knowledge gaps and propose the future research directions 5 the study revealed that both the freshwater systems and marine systems may share similarities in terms of the mode of mp transport occurrence quantification and the possible impacts differences between freshwater and marine systems include the proximity of freshwater to the point sources of mp pollution the relatively smaller sizes of freshwater systems and the difference in the spatial and temporal transport of particulates in the two systems these identified differences were posited to influence the characteristics size type shape abundance and dynamics of mp in the two systems 5 globally china produces the largest amount of plastic materials and plastic wastes 38 39 the plastic wastes are not properly managed thus they littered the environment and ultimately get into the aquatic ecosystems where they degrade into mp 38 40 41 few investigations that have been conducted zhang et al 42 on the three gorges reservoir 43 taihu lake zhang et al 44 tibet plateau lakes 45 wuhan urban lakes and xiangxi bay 46 on the occurrence of mp in china surface water confirmed the presence in appreciable concentrations thus a wake up call on the need for concerted efforts to understand the pollution load of mp in its freshwater systems is apt on this note the occurrence and features of suspended microplastics in mp in surface waters of dongting lake and hong lake two important lakes in the middle reaches of the yangtze river were investigated 32 the presence of mp in dongting lake and hong lake ranged between 900 and 2800 and 1250 and 4650 n m3 respectively colorful and fibrous mp dominated the species identified and 20 of the total mp particles were 330 μm fig 2 the mp identified were derived mainly from polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp the need to adopt a standard technique for sampling and protocols for categorization to ease global data comparison were advocated consequent upon the limited reportage of mp in freshwater and the influence of intensive anthropogenic activity on freshwater qualities the mp load of the third largest chinese lake the taihu lake was investigated 103 the study investigated the presence of mp in water sediments and a representative organism from the ecosystem i e the asian clam corbicula fluminea of taihu lake it was postulated that this organism could be a bio monitor of mp pollution in this freshwater system the mp concentration detected in the different samples ranged between 0 01 106 and 6 8 106 items km2 in plankton net samples 3 4 and 25 8 items l in surface water 11 0 and 234 6 items kg dw in sediments and 0 2 and 12 5 items g ww in asian clams the magnitude of mp detected in plankton net samples from the southeast and in the sediments from the northwest areas of the lake were the highest globally the highest level of mp in plankton net sample for any freshwater lakes was reported in this study the highest mp load in the sediment from the northwest area of the lake positively correlated with the highest pollution load of this same area of the lake as shown in the chlorophyll a and total phosphorus values the mp detected were characterized by fibrous morphology 100 1000 μm in size and cellophane in composition ratios that ranged between 38 and 3810 was reported for the mp in clams to the respective sediment sample and the correlation between the ratio and mp concentration in sediment was negative the study concluded that in the taihu lake the sediment organism and the water contained high concentrations of mp 2 2 groundwater the leachate from refuse dump the general use of plastic mulch and indiscriminate discharge of sewage sludge and irrigation activities are great contributors to the accumulation of mp in soils 47 48 the annual projection of plastics dumped on soils was 4 23 times higher than that of ocean 40 oftentimes studies on mp usually focused on other environmental media other than the gw system which created paucity of information on mp in the gw system 49 48 generally the threat of mp contamination of water bodies usually aimed at surface waters mainly oceans and rivers but gw contamination is often ignored mp has been detected in gw and the potential and preferential downward pathways created by earthworms have been reported 4 11 the few studies that have investigated the presence of mp in gw include re 2 bouwman et al 50 and mintenig et al 11 it is challenging to understand investigate and control gw pollution because it is hidden in the aquifer and that investigation only begin after the gw contamination 2 it was posited that gw protection and management is important because mp often serve as carriers of toxic pollutants into the aquifer system 2 efforts to elucidate the gaps and challenges of mp contamination of gw with specific to synthetic microfibers revealed that the contamination of the gw occurred through leaching and infiltration of the soil 2 thus it was recommended that studies should be commissioned to identify the possible pathways of mp contamination of the gw to forestall the imminent widespread contamination that engenders the decontamination option it has been revealed that out of the global landmass about twenty percent 20 is karst 51 and that the karst aquifer is about a quarter ¼ of the global potable water resource 52 furthermore the rare troglobitic faunal species inhabit the karst ecosystems which makes them susceptible to the contamination of the ecosystem 51 karst aquifer is a creviced carbonate rock that is overlain by cover collapse sinkholes thus the open nature makes them susceptible to contamination 51 since one of the ecological threats of mp is the tendency to act as the carrier of persistent organic pollutants pops 53 54 and mp is prevalent in our natural ecosystem it was hypothesized panno et al 55 that an investigation into the presence abundance and the environmental drivers of mp in karst gw systems is expedient the presence of mp and the associated anthropogenic contaminants were determined in the gw derived from wells and springs in karst regions panno et al 55 illinois usa the study revealed the presence of mp with other anthropogenic contaminants in the gw samples fibrous mp were detected with a maximum concentration of 15 2 particles l since a correlation was established between the presence of mp and other water characteristics e g phosphate chloride and triclosan fig 3 the septic system was fingered as the mp source it was recommended that a more detailed studies of the mp dynamics of the karst ecosystems should be engaged to ascertain the sources of mp contamination of the gw and to evaluate the potential biological effects of mp on sensitive gw food webs premised on the report of schymanski et al 12 that the identified mp in bottled drinking water was caused by the contamination from the packaging materials it was postulated 56 57 that in order to assess the risks of mp to human health the actual exposure and pathways to mp contamination must be ascertained on this note mintenig et al 11 identified mp in potable water derived from the purification of gw the concentrations of mp detected in both the raw water and potable water ranged between 0 and 7 m p m3 the mp identified using ftir imaging include polyethylene polyamide polyester polyvinylchloride or epoxy resin since the overall average of 0 7 m p m3 considered as low contamination 20 μm and a negligible human exposure it was concluded that the detected mp possibly got into the drinking water through the abrasion of the plastic materials used during drinking water purification and transport from the gw wells to household taps 2 3 municipal drinking water treatment plant concerning the assessment of the ability of municipal drinking water treatment plants dwtp to remove mp from the feed water or the mp concentrations in treated water only one study has been reported thus far in order to bridge the research gap on mp in drinking water the occurrence of mp in in feed freshwaters into the dwtp and the treated drinking water was determined 58 feed water samples from three different sources which included large and small water reservoirs and a river were collected the mps in the feed and treated water were quantified the particle size was classified and both the morphotypes and composition of the detected mp were elucidated mp concentrations that ranged between 1473 34 and 3605 497 particles l and 338 76 and 628 28 particles l were reported in the feed and drinking water respectively about 95 of the mp which were either fragments or fibrous were 10 μm in all the water samples investigated although about 12 different materials constituted the mp detected but 70 comprised of polyethylene terephthalate polypropylene and polyethylene the ability of the conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps to remove fractions of the mp was ascertained 58 it was observed that about 100 1000 particles m3 of mp especially the smaller fractions in the effluent escaped the treatment system 59 93 98 89 104 in order to reconcile the wide gap between the reported concentrations of mp in drinking water sources and the need to develop a method for generating a reliable and trusted data the use of two complimentary techniques of μftir and py gcms to quantify mp in a distribution system of a swedish high performance dwtp was adopted 60 the method successfully determined mp quality quantity shape and size 20 μm in drinking water and the mp load in the drinking water positively corelated with the quality of the treatment procedure the study showed that the potential annual intake of mp is 1 per person an indication that potable water produced from such high performance treatment system is of low risk to human health 3 assessment of susceptibility of raw and treated potable water a review of the different sources of potable water and the feed water to the municipal dwtp showed that the danger of mp of our drinking water is real despite the paucity of information on the occurrence and dynamics of mp in the aqua matrix the few studies that have been reported confirmed the presence at different magnitude shape and chemical composition the occurrence and size distribution of mp in the feed water for dwtp were presented in a critical review that summarizes the occurrence of mp in drinking water 61 considering the aforementioned conventional sources of drinking water i e the gw surface water and dwtp and the feed water to these sources the two major factors that promote the vulnerability of both the raw and treated potable water to mp contaminations include the treatment efficiency of the municipal dwtp and the transport and dynamics of mp in the soil matrix 3 1 treatment efficiency of municipal dwtp since the feedwater to the municipal dwtp is usually obtained from freshwater sources the literature review presented in section 2 1 clearly showed that the feedwater to the dwtp is awash of mp thus reducing or removing the danger of mp consumption by humans becomes the sole responsibility of the municipal dwtp in order to ascertain the role of the municipal dwtp in the removal of mp from the feedwater system the efficacy of three municipal dwtp in the urban areas of the czech republic was assessed for the treatment of mp in feedwater 58 all the municipal dwtp showed appreciable mp removal efficiency a mean value of 83 but the magnitude of mp in the drinking water produced was still high the use of two stage separation system instead of the single conventional sand filtration positively influenced the mp removal efficiency although no standard has been promulgated for the mp concentration in drinking water but the danger inherent in the consumption demands that a total removal should be targeted in any drinking water treatment operation the mp removal efficiencies of treatment plants that use gw as the feed water were investigated 11 the oldenburg east frisian water board which supplies the drinking water for an area of 7500 km2 in the north western part of germany was the focus the mp in samples obtained from different points of the supply chain fig 4 which included the water purification steps transportation and supply were studied the mp concentrations in the samples ranged between 0 and 7 m p m3 for both the raw and drinking water with an overall average concentration of 0 7 m p m3 the compositions of the particles identified using ftir microscopy coupled to a focal plane array detector were polyethylene pe polyamide pa polyester pest polyvinylchloride pvc and epoxy resin blank sample contamination was observed with 27 76 mean value 45 fibres and attributed to the contamination during sample handling the study showed no difference in the magnitude of the detected mp concentrations between the different treatment steps which indicated that mp contamination did not occur during any of the treatment operation the fragments of mp identified ranged between 50 150 μm and made up of pest pvc pe pa and epoxy resin some of these polymers were part of the materials used in the water purification and supply operations for example the corrosion tendencies of tanks are usually mitigated with epoxy resin coatings pipes are made of pvc or pe and fittings with pa the abrasion of plastic during operation was attributed to the level of mp contamination in the water samples tested the mp contamination during sample handling was also attributed to the non reproducible results obtained from the determination of mp in honey 95 100 and beer 92 94 it was concluded that the low mp 20 μm contamination recorded for both the raw gw i e the feedwater and treated drinking water occurred through the abrasion of the hardware used for water treatment storage and transportation and not the direct gw contamination 3 2 mp transport pathways and dynamics with the caveat that a uniform piston type of flow occurs soils serve as effective barrier to the applied contaminants 62 however since the occurrence of preferential flow is pervasive in soils 63 65 a fast transport of contaminants through the soil profile occurs and the protective capacity of the soil is compromised the preferential flow in soil is induced by macropores formation which is induced by weathering vegetation and soil fauna 66 67 thus it is difficult to elucidate the mode of contaminant transport in natural soil because macroporous soils are characterized by highly transient irregular flow paths in order to understand the vertical mobility of mp in the soil subsurface which has remained largely undefined due to the paucity of scientific data mp penetration in sand soil column reactor was investigated 68 the theoretical basis or this study hinged on the reports 68 70 that the initial concentration and the volume of infiltration liquid determine the mobility of contaminants within the vadose zone some other studies showed that the vertical mobility greatly depends on the length of penetrable interconnected pore space pathways with first flush and wet dry cycles being an important mechanism 71 73 o connor et al 68 assessed the influence of mp properties and environmental parameters on the vertical mobility of mp the study investigated the vertical mobility of five different granular shapes mp i e four polyethylene pe and one polypropylene pp particles of various sizes and densities in a fixed bed of sand the influence of initial mp concentration the volume of infiltration liquid and the effect of first flush by wetting and drying cycles were investigated using the wet dry cycle trend a forecast of 100 year penetration depths using weather data for 347 cities across china was implemented the study showed that the tendency of mp embedded in sandy soil phase on a long term is very high and could threaten the subterranean fauna or the gw the mobility of the pe of smaller size was the highest and the number of the wet dry cycles is directly proportional to the mobility depth the volume of infiltration liquid and the initial mp concentration showed minimal impacts on the depth of penetration of mp it was posited that the risk of mp migration would be better appreciated if other parameters on mp mobility is studied to understand the real life situation 74 and to consider whether the removal of mps sources in soils should be considered the results of the forecast for 100 year penetration depths showed that the average calculated penetration depth was 5 24 m with beijing municipality and hebei henan and hubei provinces considered to be the most vulnerable the study on the elucidation of the transport of mp in a shallow alluvial aquifer showed the size dependency of mp transport in this medium 75 mp of 1 5 μm can be transported in significant amounts in sand and gravel aquifers and the retardation and filtration processes did not efficiently attenuate mp in groundwater at the study site since there is paucity of information on the specific mechanism of mp mobility in porous media the ability of mp to accumulate and the process of mobility through an analogous soil system was studied 76 the study was predicated on the hypothesis that the percolation and accumulation of mp in porous media is a function of size morphology and the size of pore throats between solid grains the study revealed that the fate and pattern of mp behavior in soil is dependent on the size shape type aggregation state e g with organics prior to entry into the soil and the variable soil conditions e g soil type temperature and water regime the first data on the sinking rates of high density plastic fragments in aquatic system showed the positive correlation with the particle density ballent et al 79 and the hydrodynamic conditions e g river outflow wind stress and tidal forces browne et al 2010 collignon et al 86 and ballent et al 79 weathering and biofouling also alter the mp particle density 99 microorganism infestation of mp serve as a ballast which promotes the downward migration of the floating particles 96 88 the incorporation of mp into phytoplankton aggregates or faecal pellets present in the water matrix enhances the rate and depth of sinking in the water column 85 84 97 findings from a sinking experiment kowalski et al 77 conducted with different polymer particles in aquatic system with varying salinity gave a different perspective on the influence of particle density on the sinking ability of mp it was postulated that the mp sinking velocity was not solely dependent on mp density size and fluid density but also on the mp shape which is a deviation from the theoretical position this implied that the evaluation of sinking velocities from theoretical calculations which assumes the sinking of perfect spheres mp is not tenable and cannot represent the true sinking pattern of mp kowalski et al 77 it was opined that the use of the aged and fouled mp would have provided a comprehensive close to nature profile of the sinking pattern 4 standpoint on the susceptibility of potable water to mp contamination the comparison of the findings from the very few reports on the mp contamination of the drinking water produced from the municipal dwtp that is fed with the gw and surface water showed the hiatus in the magnitude of mp contamination between the two feedwater sources the water produced from the surface water fed dwtp showed appreciable concentration of mp despite the substantial amount of mp removed during the treatment operations in the gw fed system the magnitude of mp contamination detected in the drinking water produced was very low and this low value was attributed to the contamination from plastic materials used during the transportation storage and treatment the higher contamination level of the surface water fed dwtp was attributed to the higher mp contamination in the feedwater the emerging nature of mp as a contaminant that was not factored into the design of the municipal dwtp was also a contributor in the surface water fed dwtp the effects of the type of treatment technology manifested in the magnitude of mp removal but more studies were recommended to establish this fact if a positive correlation can be established between the mp removal efficiency and the treatment technology efforts need to be geared towards the development of requisite technology that can be easily incorporated into the conventional dwtp for this purpose in the gw fed dwtp the very low magnitude of mp contamination can be attributed to the role of the soil matrix which acted as a barrier to the mp transport in the soil matrix although the occurrence of preferential flow occasioned by macropore formation can enhance the rate of transport within the soil matrix but the mp dynamics which is influenced by the organic fraction and the calcium phase help to moderate both the rate and degree of mobility within the soil matrix premised on the data generated from the study on the vertical transport of mp of different functional groups and sizes which showed a positive influence of wet dry cycling the forecast for 100 year penetration depth was generated the average value calculated for the potential subsurface mp transport for china was 5 42 m in 100 year the forecasted low mp mobility within the soil matrix could be attributed to the very low gw contamination recorder in the raw gw samples consequent upon the large number of plastics products dumped on the soil the soil is considered a sink of mp and a higher contamination of the gw is expected the report by o connor et al 68 showed that the length of penetrable pathways of mp neither correlated with the volume of infiltration liquid applied nor with the initial mp dosage on the soil matrix this implied that despite the possible high concentration of mp in soil it does not translate to higher rate of transport with higher or continuous rain water percolation through the soil this observation was ascribed to the fact that once the saturation limit of the soil pore spaces is attained a reverse pathway is created for mp to migrate in an upward direction 68 the ability of mp to engage in upward migration was attributed to its relative inherent low specific density the study revealed that the depth of mp transport in the soil matrix was not directly proportional to the initial mp concentration on the soil surface a comparison of the mp concentrations in the gw derived from a karst 55 aquifer illinois usa and non karst aquifer 11 revealed that the nature of the aquifer that encased the gw greatly influences the magnitude of mp contamination of the gw system in the non karst gw out of the twenty four samples 24 no mp was detected in fourteen 14 of the samples 1 m p particle m3 was determined in five 05 samples four 4 samples contained between 1 and 3 m p particle m3 and one 01 sample contained 7 m p particle m3 in the karst gw the occurrence of mp in sixteen 16 out of the seventeen 17 gw samples investigated was reported with a median concentration of 6 4 particles l and a maximum of 15 2 particles l the sinkholes in the karst aquifer which act as localized drainage features lead directly to crevices that are part of the underlying karst aquifers were ascribed to the relative greater vulnerability of this gw system thus it could be posited that despite the low mp contamination potential of the gw the magnitude of the contaminations is dependent on the nature of the aquifer 5 conclusion evidences abound on the occurrence of mp in the raw and treated drinking water at varying magnitude the magnitude of mp contamination is far higher in surface water than in the gw system the transport pathway and dynamics of mp in the soil matrix and the treatment efficiency of the municipal dwtp were the two factors that determine the susceptibility of the raw and drinking water to mp contamination the source of the feedwater to the municipal dwtp greatly affects the magnitude of mp contamination in the drinking water produced the surface water fed dwtp produced drinking water with undesirable mp concentration while very low mp contamination was observed in the gw fed dwtp the nature of aquifer influenced the concentration of mp in the gw the karst aquifer showed higher susceptibility to mp contamination than the non karst aquifer gw the mobility and dynamics of mp in soil matrix is dependent on the organic fraction and ca phase the mp mobility in the soil matrix is neither a function of the infiltration volume nor the initial mp concentrations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13575,an assessment of the susceptibility of the raw and treated drinking water to microplastics mp contamination was conducted because of the inherent low density and size 5 mm of mp that enhances the mobility and pervasiveness in environmental media although the ecological and physiological effects of mp is still under scrutiny but assessing the vulnerability of the drinking water system is paramount to the development of ameliorating strategies for the possible impacts the susceptibility was evaluated using the transport pathway and dynamics of mp in soil matrix and the treatment

contained undesirable magnitude of mp low mp concentration was reported in the water produced from gw fed dwtp despite the fact that soil is the sink of mp the mobility within the matrix is very low

oftentimes the surface water is made potable through the conventional treatment plant or consumed raw especially in the least developed region of the world the decision to treat gw before consumption or consumed raw without any form of treatment greatly depends on the quality characteristics despite the affirmation of the presence of mp in different environmental matrix the nature of toxicity of mp is yet to be satisfactorily ascertained but the potential toxicity cannot be ignored premised on the handling of the different sources of potable water from the source to the household tap the human consumption of mp is highly probable the direct consumption of raw gw or surface water without treatment is an assurance of mp consumption if any is present in the matrix the passage of feed water through the municipal drinking water treatment plant dwtp cannot ensure complete removal if the fact that mp is one of the emerging contaminants that the conventional dwtp was not actually designed for the removal in order to understand the status of our potable water concerning mp contamination the present treatise aimed at a systematic review of the susceptibility of the drinking water sources and the feed water to the dwtp to mp contamination 2 1 freshwater systems an overview of research reports since the bourgeoning interest in the environmental contamination of mp has focused more on marine environment than any other environmental matrix the occurrence of mp in the atlantic ocean has been reported as far back as 1974 87 other reports on marine mp that focused on the source analytical method abundance spatial and temporal distribution transport behavior and ecological effects have been presented 80 81 99 82 106 108 the occurrence of mp of diverse origins and compositions have been detected in different freshwater sources 5 of north america in the los angeles basin 15 the north shore channel of chicago 16 the st lawrence river 17 and the great lakes 18 20 in europe in lake geneva 21 the italian lake garda 22 the austrian danube river 23 the german elbe mosel neckar and rhine rivers 24 and the uk tamar estuary 25 and in asia in lake hovsgol mongolia 26 the mp concentrations of selected aquatic resources are presented in table 1 the mp contamination in lake winnipeg the 11th largest global freshwater ecosystem was quantified and compared with the report of eriksen et al 20 on other large canadian lakes 27 this study provided data on the occurrence of mp in canadian freshwater ecosystems and the relative extent of mp pollution across the canadian freshwater systems surface water samples were collected between 2014 and 2016 and analyzed for the occurrence of mp the magnitude of mp detected were within the same range of those reported for the laurentian great lakes fibrous secondary mp formed the major mp contaminant detected in the sample the magnitude of mp detected in the north basin were higher than that of the south basin of the lake in the first year i e 2014 only the average lake wide concentration for the study period were comparable and not statistically different the sem edx analysis revealed that an average of about twenty three percent 23 of particles isolated were non plastic materials this study contributed to the assertion that mp contamination of surface water is prevalent even in less densely populated freshwater ecosystems premised on the abundant data on marine mp contamination and the very few data on mp contamination of freshwater a critical appraisal of the issue of mp in freshwater was conducted to document the prevailing understanding the knowledge gaps and propose the future research directions 5 the study revealed that both the freshwater systems and marine systems may share similarities in terms of the mode of mp transport occurrence quantification and the possible impacts differences between freshwater and marine systems include the proximity of freshwater to the point sources of mp pollution the relatively smaller sizes of freshwater systems and the difference in the spatial and temporal transport of particulates in the two systems these identified differences were posited to influence the characteristics size type shape abundance and dynamics of mp in the two systems 5 globally china produces the largest amount of plastic materials and plastic wastes 38 39 the plastic wastes are not properly managed thus they littered the environment and ultimately get into the aquatic ecosystems where they degrade into mp 38 40 41 few investigations that have been conducted zhang et al 42 on the three gorges reservoir 43 taihu lake zhang et al 44 tibet plateau lakes 45 wuhan urban lakes and xiangxi bay 46 on the occurrence of mp in china surface water confirmed the presence in appreciable concentrations thus a wake up call on the need for concerted efforts to understand the pollution load of mp in its freshwater systems is apt on this note the occurrence and features of suspended microplastics in mp in surface waters of dongting lake and hong lake two important lakes in the middle reaches of the yangtze river were investigated 32 the presence of mp in dongting lake and hong lake ranged between 900 and 2800 and 1250 and 4650 n m3 respectively colorful and fibrous mp dominated the species identified and 20 of the total mp particles were 330 μm fig 2 the mp identified were derived mainly from polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp the need to adopt a standard technique for sampling and protocols for categorization to ease global data comparison were advocated consequent upon the limited reportage of mp in freshwater and the influence of intensive anthropogenic activity on freshwater qualities the mp load of the third largest chinese lake the taihu lake was investigated 103 the study investigated the presence of mp in water sediments and a representative organism from the ecosystem i e the asian clam corbicula fluminea of taihu lake it was postulated that this organism could be a bio monitor of mp pollution in this freshwater system the mp concentration detected in the different samples ranged between 0 01 106 and 6 8 106 items km2 in plankton net samples 3 4 and 25 8 items l in surface water 11 0 and 234 6 items kg dw in sediments and 0 2 and 12 5 items g ww in asian clams the magnitude of mp detected in plankton net samples from the southeast and in the sediments from the northwest areas of the lake were the highest globally the highest level of mp in plankton net sample for any freshwater lakes was reported in this study the highest mp load in the sediment from the northwest area of the lake positively correlated with the highest pollution load of this same area of the lake as shown in the chlorophyll a and total phosphorus values the mp detected were characterized by fibrous morphology 100 1000 μm in size and cellophane in composition ratios that ranged between 38 and 3810 was reported for the mp in clams to the respective sediment sample and the correlation between the ratio and mp concentration in sediment was negative the study concluded that in the taihu lake the sediment organism and the water contained high concentrations of mp 2 2 groundwater the leachate from refuse dump the general use of plastic mulch and indiscriminate discharge of sewage sludge and irrigation activities are great contributors to the accumulation of mp in soils 47 48 the annual projection of plastics dumped on soils was 4 23 times higher than that of ocean 40 oftentimes studies on mp usually focused on other environmental media other than the gw system which created paucity of information on mp in the gw system 49 48 generally the threat of mp contamination of water bodies usually aimed at surface waters mainly oceans and rivers but gw contamination is often ignored mp has been detected in gw and the potential and preferential downward pathways created by earthworms have been reported 4 11 the few studies that have investigated the presence of mp in gw include re 2 bouwman et al 50 and mintenig et al 11 it is challenging to understand investigate and control gw pollution because it is hidden in the aquifer and that investigation only begin after the gw contamination 2 it was posited that gw protection and management is important because mp often serve as carriers of toxic pollutants into the aquifer system 2 efforts to elucidate the gaps and challenges of mp contamination of gw with specific to synthetic microfibers revealed that the contamination of the gw occurred through leaching and infiltration of the soil 2 thus it was recommended that studies should be commissioned to identify the possible pathways of mp contamination of the gw to forestall the imminent widespread contamination that engenders the decontamination option it has been revealed that out of the global landmass about twenty percent 20 is karst 51 and that the karst aquifer is about a quarter ¼ of the global potable water resource 52 furthermore the rare troglobitic faunal species inhabit the karst ecosystems which makes them susceptible to the contamination of the ecosystem 51 karst aquifer is a creviced carbonate rock that is overlain by cover collapse sinkholes thus the open nature makes them susceptible to contamination 51 since one of the ecological threats of mp is the tendency to act as the carrier of persistent organic pollutants pops 53 54 and mp is prevalent in our natural ecosystem it was hypothesized panno et al 55 that an investigation into the presence abundance and the environmental drivers of mp in karst gw systems is expedient the presence of mp and the associated anthropogenic contaminants were determined in the gw derived from wells and springs in karst regions panno et al 55 illinois usa the study revealed the presence of mp with other anthropogenic contaminants in the gw samples fibrous mp were detected with a maximum concentration of 15 2 particles l since a correlation was established between the presence of mp and other water characteristics e g phosphate chloride and triclosan fig 3 the septic system was fingered as the mp source it was recommended that a more detailed studies of the mp dynamics of the karst ecosystems should be engaged to ascertain the sources of mp contamination of the gw and to evaluate the potential biological effects of mp on sensitive gw food webs premised on the report of schymanski et al 12 that the identified mp in bottled drinking water was caused by the contamination from the packaging materials it was postulated 56 57 that in order to assess the risks of mp to human health the actual exposure and pathways to mp contamination must be ascertained on this note mintenig et al 11 identified mp in potable water derived from the purification of gw the concentrations of mp detected in both the raw water and potable water ranged between 0 and 7 m p m3 the mp identified using ftir imaging include polyethylene polyamide polyester polyvinylchloride or epoxy resin since the overall average of 0 7 m p m3 considered as low contamination 20 μm and a negligible human exposure it was concluded that the detected mp possibly got into the drinking water through the abrasion of the plastic materials used during drinking water purification and transport from the gw wells to household taps 2 3 municipal drinking water treatment plant concerning the assessment of the ability of municipal drinking water treatment plants dwtp to remove mp from the feed water or the mp concentrations in treated water only one study has been reported thus far in order to bridge the research gap on mp in drinking water the occurrence of mp in in feed freshwaters into the dwtp and the treated drinking water was determined 58 feed water samples from three different sources which included large and small water reservoirs and a river were collected the mps in the feed and treated water were quantified the particle size was classified and both the morphotypes and composition of the detected mp were elucidated mp concentrations that ranged between 1473 34 and 3605 497 particles l and 338 76 and 628 28 particles l were reported in the feed and drinking water respectively about 95 of the mp which were either fragments or fibrous were 10 μm in all the water samples investigated although about 12 different materials constituted the mp detected but 70 comprised of polyethylene terephthalate polypropylene and polyethylene the ability of the conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps to remove fractions of the mp was ascertained 58 it was observed that about 100 1000 particles m3 of mp especially the smaller fractions in the effluent escaped the treatment system 59 93 98 89 104 in order to reconcile the wide gap between the reported concentrations of mp in drinking water sources and the need to develop a method for generating a reliable and trusted data the use of two complimentary techniques of μftir and py gcms to quantify mp in a distribution system of a swedish high performance dwtp was adopted 60 the method successfully determined mp quality quantity shape and size 20 μm in drinking water and the mp load in the drinking water positively corelated with the quality of the treatment procedure the study showed that the potential annual intake of mp is 1 per person an indication that potable water produced from such high performance treatment system is of low risk to human health 3 assessment of susceptibility of raw and treated potable water a review of the different sources of potable water and the feed water to the municipal dwtp showed that the danger of mp of our drinking water is real despite the paucity of information on the occurrence and dynamics of mp in the aqua matrix the few studies that have been reported confirmed the presence at different magnitude shape and chemical composition the occurrence and size distribution of mp in the feed water for dwtp were presented in a critical review that summarizes the occurrence of mp in drinking water 61 considering the aforementioned conventional sources of drinking water i e the gw surface water and dwtp and the feed water to these sources the two major factors that promote the vulnerability of both the raw and treated potable water to mp contaminations include the treatment efficiency of the municipal dwtp and the transport and dynamics of mp in the soil matrix 3 1 treatment efficiency of municipal dwtp since the feedwater to the municipal dwtp is usually obtained from freshwater sources the literature review presented in section 2 1 clearly showed that the feedwater to the dwtp is awash of mp thus reducing or removing the danger of mp consumption by humans becomes the sole responsibility of the municipal dwtp in order to ascertain the role of the municipal dwtp in the removal of mp from the feedwater system the efficacy of three municipal dwtp in the urban areas of the czech republic was assessed for the treatment of mp in feedwater 58 all the municipal dwtp showed appreciable mp removal efficiency a mean value of 83 but the magnitude of mp in the drinking water produced was still high the use of two stage separation system instead of the single conventional sand filtration positively influenced the mp removal efficiency although no standard has been promulgated for the mp concentration in drinking water but the danger inherent in the consumption demands that a total removal should be targeted in any drinking water treatment operation the mp removal efficiencies of treatment plants that use gw as the feed water were investigated 11 the oldenburg east frisian water board which supplies the drinking water for an area of 7500 km2 in the north western part of germany was the focus the mp in samples obtained from different points of the supply chain fig 4 which included the water purification steps transportation and supply were studied the mp concentrations in the samples ranged between 0 and 7 m p m3 for both the raw and drinking water with an overall average concentration of 0 7 m p m3 the compositions of the particles identified using ftir microscopy coupled to a focal plane array detector were polyethylene pe polyamide pa polyester pest polyvinylchloride pvc and epoxy resin blank sample contamination was observed with 27 76 mean value 45 fibres and attributed to the contamination during sample handling the study showed no difference in the magnitude of the detected mp concentrations between the different treatment steps which indicated that mp contamination did not occur during any of the treatment operation the fragments of mp identified ranged between 50 150 μm and made up of pest pvc pe pa and epoxy resin some of these polymers were part of the materials used in the water purification and supply operations for example the corrosion tendencies of tanks are usually mitigated with epoxy resin coatings pipes are made of pvc or pe and fittings with pa the abrasion of plastic during operation was attributed to the level of mp contamination in the water samples tested the mp contamination during sample handling was also attributed to the non reproducible results obtained from the determination of mp in honey 95 100 and beer 92 94 it was concluded that the low mp 20 μm contamination recorded for both the raw gw i e the feedwater and treated drinking water occurred through the abrasion of the hardware used for water treatment storage and transportation and not the direct gw contamination 3 2 mp transport pathways and dynamics with the caveat that a uniform piston type of flow occurs soils serve as effective barrier to the applied contaminants 62 however since the occurrence of preferential flow is pervasive in soils 63 65 a fast transport of contaminants through the soil profile occurs and the protective capacity of the soil is compromised the preferential flow in soil is induced by macropores formation which is induced by weathering vegetation and soil fauna 66 67 thus it is difficult to elucidate the mode of contaminant transport in natural soil because macroporous soils are characterized by highly transient irregular flow paths in order to understand the vertical mobility of mp in the soil subsurface which has remained largely undefined due to the paucity of scientific data mp penetration in sand soil column reactor was investigated 68 the theoretical basis or this study hinged on the reports 68 70 that the initial concentration and the volume of infiltration liquid determine the mobility of contaminants within the vadose zone some other studies showed that the vertical mobility greatly depends on the length of penetrable interconnected pore space pathways with first flush and wet dry cycles being an important mechanism 71 73 o connor et al 68 assessed the influence of mp properties and environmental parameters on the vertical mobility of mp the study investigated the vertical mobility of five different granular shapes mp i e four polyethylene pe and one polypropylene pp particles of various sizes and densities in a fixed bed of sand the influence of initial mp concentration the volume of infiltration liquid and the effect of first flush by wetting and drying cycles were investigated using the wet dry cycle trend a forecast of 100 year penetration depths using weather data for 347 cities across china was implemented the study showed that the tendency of mp embedded in sandy soil phase on a long term is very high and could threaten the subterranean fauna or the gw the mobility of the pe of smaller size was the highest and the number of the wet dry cycles is directly proportional to the mobility depth the volume of infiltration liquid and the initial mp concentration showed minimal impacts on the depth of penetration of mp it was posited that the risk of mp migration would be better appreciated if other parameters on mp mobility is studied to understand the real life situation 74 and to consider whether the removal of mps sources in soils should be considered the results of the forecast for 100 year penetration depths showed that the average calculated penetration depth was 5 24 m with beijing municipality and hebei henan and hubei provinces considered to be the most vulnerable the study on the elucidation of the transport of mp in a shallow alluvial aquifer showed the size dependency of mp transport in this medium 75 mp of 1 5 μm can be transported in significant amounts in sand and gravel aquifers and the retardation and filtration processes did not efficiently attenuate mp in groundwater at the study site since there is paucity of information on the specific mechanism of mp mobility in porous media the ability of mp to accumulate and the process of mobility through an analogous soil system was studied 76 the study was predicated on the hypothesis that the percolation and accumulation of mp in porous media is a function of size morphology and the size of pore throats between solid grains the study revealed that the fate and pattern of mp behavior in soil is dependent on the size shape type aggregation state e g with organics prior to entry into the soil and the variable soil conditions e g soil type temperature and water regime the first data on the sinking rates of high density plastic fragments in aquatic system showed the positive correlation with the particle density ballent et al 79 and the hydrodynamic conditions e g river outflow wind stress and tidal forces browne et al 2010 collignon et al 86 and ballent et al 79 weathering and biofouling also alter the mp particle density 99 microorganism infestation of mp serve as a ballast which promotes the downward migration of the floating particles 96 88 the incorporation of mp into phytoplankton aggregates or faecal pellets present in the water matrix enhances the rate and depth of sinking in the water column 85 84 97 findings from a sinking experiment kowalski et al 77 conducted with different polymer particles in aquatic system with varying salinity gave a different perspective on the influence of particle density on the sinking ability of mp it was postulated that the mp sinking velocity was not solely dependent on mp density size and fluid density but also on the mp shape which is a deviation from the theoretical position this implied that the evaluation of sinking velocities from theoretical calculations which assumes the sinking of perfect spheres mp is not tenable and cannot represent the true sinking pattern of mp kowalski et al 77 it was opined that the use of the aged and fouled mp would have provided a comprehensive close to nature profile of the sinking pattern 4 standpoint on the susceptibility of potable water to mp contamination the comparison of the findings from the very few reports on the mp contamination of the drinking water produced from the municipal dwtp that is fed with the gw and surface water showed the hiatus in the magnitude of mp contamination between the two feedwater sources the water produced from the surface water fed dwtp showed appreciable concentration of mp despite the substantial amount of mp removed during the treatment operations in the gw fed system the magnitude of mp contamination detected in the drinking water produced was very low and this low value was attributed to the contamination from plastic materials used during the transportation storage and treatment the higher contamination level of the surface water fed dwtp was attributed to the higher mp contamination in the feedwater the emerging nature of mp as a contaminant that was not factored into the design of the municipal dwtp was also a contributor in the surface water fed dwtp the effects of the type of treatment technology manifested in the magnitude of mp removal but more studies were recommended to establish this fact if a positive correlation can be established between the mp removal efficiency and the treatment technology efforts need to be geared towards the development of requisite technology that can be easily incorporated into the conventional dwtp for this purpose in the gw fed dwtp the very low magnitude of mp contamination can be attributed to the role of the soil matrix which acted as a barrier to the mp transport in the soil matrix although the occurrence of preferential flow occasioned by macropore formation can enhance the rate of transport within the soil matrix but the mp dynamics which is influenced by the organic fraction and the calcium phase help to moderate both the rate and degree of mobility within the soil matrix premised on the data generated from the study on the vertical transport of mp of different functional groups and sizes which showed a positive influence of wet dry cycling the forecast for 100 year penetration depth was generated the average value calculated for the potential subsurface mp transport for china was 5 42 m in 100 year the forecasted low mp mobility within the soil matrix could be attributed to the very low gw contamination recorder in the raw gw samples consequent upon the large number of plastics products dumped on the soil the soil is considered a sink of mp and a higher contamination of the gw is expected the report by o connor et al 68 showed that the length of penetrable pathways of mp neither correlated with the volume of infiltration liquid applied nor with the initial mp dosage on the soil matrix this implied that despite the possible high concentration of mp in soil it does not translate to higher rate of transport with higher or continuous rain water percolation through the soil this observation was ascribed to the fact that once the saturation limit of the soil pore spaces is attained a reverse pathway is created for mp to migrate in an upward direction 68 the ability of mp to engage in upward migration was attributed to its relative inherent low specific density the study revealed that the depth of mp transport in the soil matrix was not directly proportional to the initial mp concentration on the soil surface a comparison of the mp concentrations in the gw derived from a karst 55 aquifer illinois usa and non karst aquifer 11 revealed that the nature of the aquifer that encased the gw greatly influences the magnitude of mp contamination of the gw system in the non karst gw out of the twenty four samples 24 no mp was detected in fourteen 14 of the samples 1 m p particle m3 was determined in five 05 samples four 4 samples contained between 1 and 3 m p particle m3 and one 01 sample contained 7 m p particle m3 in the karst gw the occurrence of mp in sixteen 16 out of the seventeen 17 gw samples investigated was reported with a median concentration of 6 4 particles l and a maximum of 15 2 particles l the sinkholes in the karst aquifer which act as localized drainage features lead directly to crevices that are part of the underlying karst aquifers were ascribed to the relative greater vulnerability of this gw system thus it could be posited that despite the low mp contamination potential of the gw the magnitude of the contaminations is dependent on the nature of the aquifer 5 conclusion evidences abound on the occurrence of mp in the raw and treated drinking water at varying magnitude the magnitude of mp contamination is far higher in surface water than in the gw system the transport pathway and dynamics of mp in the soil matrix and the treatment efficiency of the municipal dwtp were the two factors that determine the susceptibility of the raw and drinking water to mp contamination the source of the feedwater to the municipal dwtp greatly affects the magnitude of mp contamination in the drinking water produced the surface water fed dwtp produced drinking water with undesirable mp concentration while very low mp contamination was observed in the gw fed dwtp the nature of aquifer influenced the concentration of mp in the gw the karst aquifer showed higher susceptibility to mp contamination than the non karst aquifer gw the mobility and dynamics of mp in soil matrix is dependent on the organic fraction and ca phase the mp mobility in the soil matrix is neither a function of the infiltration volume nor the initial mp concentrations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13576,in this study two iron precursors feso4 and fecl3 were used for the synthesis of iron particles via a reduction reaction with kbh4 detailed characterizations were carried out using x ray diffractometry scanning electron microscopy and magnetic analysis the results showed ferromagnetic submicron particles with different proportions of fe and fe3o4 the particles were tested as catalysts for the discoloration of methyl orange mo in heterogeneous fenton process the results show that the nature of the precursor impacted the activity of the obtained product in fact 78 83 and 42 36 of mo were discolored after 5 min of reaction in the presence of the catalysts synthesized with feso4 and fecl3 respectively with h2o2 at 1 mm and 40 c coupling ultrasounds with heterogeneous fenton process reduced the time for total discoloration to 4 and 10 min with the same samples respectively regardless of the conditions used the sample synthesized with feso4 possessed the highest potential for mo discoloration keywords iron precursor kbh4 reduction magnetic character heterogeneous fenton process ultrasounds 1 introduction the widespread of contaminants in surface water and soils has become a critical issue due to population growth and rapid progress of industrialization the contaminants persisting in environment include heavy metals inorganic and organic components they are harmful and need to be removed 1 6 dyes are among the organic contaminants found in wastewater because of their large utilization in many fields most of them are recalcitrant and exhibit toxicity to humans and aquatic organisms in the last decades different methods have been developed for wastewater treatment such as adsorption extraction bioremediation and ultra and nanofiltration 7 some of them have better outcomes than others advanced oxidation processes aops are increasingly adopted in the treatment of organic pollutants because of their high performance mild conditions and large spectrum of utilization they are based on the formation of hydroxyl radicals possessing powerful oxidation capacity e0 2 1 v to degrade the recalcitrant contaminants 8 the hydroxyl radicals may be generated by different aops methods such as o3 uv o3 h2o2 uv h2o2 uv h2o2 o3 sonolysis processes homogeneous and heterogeneous fenton processes etc oxidation process using the activation of h2o2 by soluble fe2 to generate hydroxyl radicals is referred to as fenton s reagent and takes place through the haber weiss mechanism 9 1 fe2 aq h2o2 fe3 ho oh the formation of iron sludge is a severe weakness of this process this problem may be solved by using a solid catalyst which facilitates its separation and recycling and avoids secondary pollution sub micron and nanoparticles of iron and iron oxides have been largely considered in many fields due to their good chemical and thermal stability non toxicity biocompatibility magnetic character and low cost these properties have led to useful applications in catalysis batteries magnetic pigments and fluids water treatment gas sensors and information storage media 10 13 it is known that the physico chemical properties of a catalyst are fundamentally related to the synthesis method several techniques have been developed to synthesize iron and its oxides including chemical precipitation thermal decomposition sol gel hydrothermal ball milling mechanical alloying and chemical reduction the chemical reduction could be the most widely used method because of its rapidness and facility it used several reducing reagents such as hydrazine glycerol hydroxylamine hydrochloride and borohydride potassium sodium borohydride is used in ketones conversion to alcohols 14 and for hydrogen storage in fuel cells 15 it is also used in the synthesis of different metals such as iron 16 in the literature several studies reported the preparation of iron via the reduction by nabh4 and the utilization of the obtained product in chemical reactions in a paper iron supported by reduced graphene oxide fe fe3o4 rgo was synthesized by reduction of fecl3 with nabh4 and the product was used as photocatalyst in in the oxidation of orange ii the catalyst allowed the degradation of 94 14 of the dye molecule after 180 min with a xenon lamp of 150 w simulating sunlight 17 pure metallic iron fe was synthesized by reduction of fecl3 with nabh4 under n2 atmosphere the formed particles were applied in the reductive discoloration of methyl orange 18 a rapid discoloration of the dye molecules was obtained with iron dosage of 0 5 g l at 40 c and ph 6 in another study scrap iron was used as generator of iron after leaching process with citric acid at 0 5 m the resultant leached iron was converted to fe3o4 nanoparticles by reduction with nabh4 and further calcination at 400 c for 2 h the product was formed by particles with 7 nm in size which showed peroxidase like activity making them usable for phenol detection 19 many other papers reported the synthesis and application of iron based catalysts which all agreed that the easy recovery of such solids with a simple magnetic field represents a key issue regarding its potential application it is worth noting that most of the studies found in literature used one precursor to synthesize iron based material while different operational parameters are varied to produce the desired particle size and shape 20 21 the nature of metallic precursor may also affect the physico chemical characteristics of the solid and not enough data are available regarding this point in this study two precursors of iron were tested for the synthesis of fe fe3o4 by reduction with kbh4 under air open air was expressively used to explore the effect of aerated condition on the formation of iron oxide with the two precursors the synthesized products were characterized by xrd sem and magnetic analyses and applied in a discoloration process of methyl orange mo used as model substrate methyl orange mo a heterocyclic aromatic chemical compound is one of the well known acidic anionic dyes that is widely used in textile printing paper food and research laboratories 22 in this study the discoloration of mo was investigated by using iron alone iron coupled with h2o2 with ultrasounds and the combination of the three parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 iron synthesis iron particles were synthesized by pouring in drop wise manner 25 ml of kbh4 fluka 97 at 0 5 m into the same volume of two iron precursors feso4 7h2o sigma aldrich 99 and fecl3 sigma aldrich 99 9 at 0 1 m the experiments were conducted in a cylindrical pyrex vessel of 150 ml under air the mixtures were mechanically agitated 250 rpm to avoid the agglomeration of the particles around magnetic bar leading to difficulties for their recovery the formation of the particles was instantaneous because of the strong reducing character of kbh4 but the experiments were lasted for 30 min in the two cases to implement the same operation conditions the black particles were after that washed with deionized water and dried at 30 c in oven 2 2 particles characterization and phpzc determination x ray diffraction patterns used to identify the phase constitution were obtained with a rigaku ultima iv x ray diffractometer using cuk α radiation λ 1 5406 å in step mode between 20 and 80 using a step size of 0 02 s the surface morphology was examined by fei quanta 250 feg scanning electron microscope the hysteresis loops m h loops were recorded by a vibrating sample magnetometer micro sense at room temperature because the magnetization saturation changes with the amount of the sample the results were divided on the sample s weight the phpzc of the solids were determined by a method reported elsewhere 23 this method consisted on mixing 1 g of the solid with 20 ml of co2 free distilled water the sample was manually agitated over a period of 48 h after which the ph of the mixture was taken as phpzc 2 3 methyl orange discoloration experiments the fenton like activities of the two samples were evaluated by monitoring the discoloration of methyl orange fluka 99 the concentration of mo was determined by using a jenway 6705uv vis spectrometer at 508 nm during the discoloration process at regular time intervals 3 ml of the reaction solution was collected with a syringe from the reactor for absorbance measurements in an optical quartz cell after which they were recovered back into the solution the discoloration efficiency of mo was calculated from the difference of initial absorbance a0 and the absorbance at different time intervals at 2 d i s c o l o r a t i o n e f f i c i e n c y a 0 a t a 0 x 100 in a typical experiment 0 02 g of iron the mass was previously optimized was added to 100 ml of mo at 5 10 5 mol l 16 mg l at 40 c and ph adjusted to 3 by using h2so4 the solution was kept under mechanical agitation at a moderate speed 100 rpm to maintain the uniformity of the system the study was conducted in the absence and presence of hydrogen peroxide at different concentrations 0 3 1 6 and 10 mm the effect of ultrasounds was also investigated by using a branson b200 device generating 40 khz of ultrasounds frequency working with on off mode 2 4 in situ h2o2 quantification in acidic medium iron may produce in situ h2o2 under oxic conditions via the reduction of oxygen in this study the selected discoloration experiment for which the quantification of h2o2 produced in situ is needed was repeated without the presence of mo 3 ml of water at selected time intervals were withdrawn for h2o2 analysis by titration with permanganate according to the reaction 24 3 2mno4 5h2o2 6h 2 mn2 5o2 8h2o 3 results and discussion 3 1 xrd and sem analyses for simplification rs and rc are referred to the products synthesized with feso4 and fecl3 respectively preliminary synthesis tests were conducted at 25 and 60 c in order to check whether heating affected the kinetic of the reduction reaction visual observations have shown that the amount of the formed particles strongly decreased when synthesis temperature increased from 25 to 60 c this was probably due to the fact that kbh4 which produced easily h2 has lost the gas by heating before it reacted properly with iron precursors the experiments were thus conducted in colder bath at 5 c high amount of particles was obtained in the two cases with almost the same yield efficiencies in both cases an increase of temperature upon the addition of kbh4 of about 3 c was observed exothermic the characterization of the products by xrd shows well crystalline samples which exhibited peaks located at 2θ 30 3 35 7 43 4 53 6 57 3 and 62 9 which can be assigned to α fe3o4 and one strong peak located at 2θ 44 35 corresponding to α fe fig 1 magnetite was present in both samples because the experiments were conducted in open reactor which allows the oxidation of a part of the product it can be seen also that the proportions of fe0 and fe3o4 in the two samples are different table 1 and that the amount of fe0 was more important in rs than in rc this may be due to the fact that the reduction from fe2 to fe0 feso4 was easier than that from fe3 to fe0 fecl3 on the other hand it is possible that the presence of chloride anion could have affected the formation of metallic iron in fact it was reported that the presence of chloride ions promoted the oxidation of metals and retards the growth of the particles 25 this may explain the high amount of fe3o4 present on rc compared to rs despite the presence of enough amount of kbh4 during the reduction process available to react with fecl3 the crystallite sizes of fe0 in the samples calculated by scherrer method were 21 48 and 22 53 nm for rs and rc respectively while those of magnetite were 99 88 and 21 61 nm respectively all peaks of the samples can be indexed to face centered cubic fcc fe3o4 with the lattice constants of 8 25 å rs and 8 28 å rc and that of iron fe0 are indexed to face centered cubic fcc fe0 with the lattice constants of 2 82 å rs and 2 83 å rc sem image of rs shows that the sample is mainly formed by great spherical particles with size of about 750 nm with finer ones with size of about 166 nm the sample rc exhibited finer powder formed by chain like agglomerated particles with size varying from 83 to 415 nm here also the effect of the precursor of rc containing chlorides could be the cause of the finesses of the particle size the aggregation in both cases might result from the inherent magnetism of the particles 3 2 magnetic measurements the magnetic properties were investigated by vsm system at room temperature with the field sweeping from 10000 to 10000 oe fig 2 shows the hysteresis loops of the two samples the magnetic hysteresis loops indicate their ferromagnetism at room temperature ferromagnetic materials are magnetized easily and when a field is applied and then removed the magnetization does not return to its original value this phenomenon is referred to as hysteresis the magnetism in ferromagnetic materials is caused by the alignment patterns of their constituent atoms which act as elementary electromagnets the values of saturation magnetization ms were 168 48 and 121 45 emu g for rs and rc respectively and the coercivity values hc of the same samples were 228 and 220 oe hc may be relied to the crystallite size of iron the samples rs and rc exhibit almost similar values of 228 and 220 oe respectively which crystallites sizes of fe were not greatly different 21 48 and 22 53 nm respectively on the other hand the highest value of saturation magnetization 168 48 emu g was obtained with the sample with the highest content of fe rs 3 3 discoloration of methyl orange in the presence of iron the saturation magnetizations of the two samples were sufficient for magnetic separation with external magnet 26 the discoloration of mo was tested with the solids alone solids with h2o2 with ultrasound and then the three conditions together 3 3 1 mo removal in the presence of iron the discoloration reaction was tested with the solids in neutral medium no change in absorbance values was observed after 3 h with both samples the same experiments were repeated in acidic medium at ph 3 with the solid rs the discoloration registered 25 92 after 60 min and increased slightly to 41 17 after 210 min after which it stabilized the discoloration in the presence of rc was weaker and stabilized at 18 3 after 60 min fig 3 in heterogeneous system the discoloration may be due to adsorption or oxidation or both to distinguish between these processes the phpzc of the solids were determined the values found were 8 3 and 9 4 for rc and rs respectively these values favored the adsorption of the anionic mo onto the positively charged surfaces of the samples but this did not occur in neutral medium thus the discoloration observed in acidic medium was likely due to the oxidation process in fact in oxic conditions the corrosion of fe0 into fe2 is accompanied by the production of h2o2 from the reduction of o2 4 fe0 fe2 2e 5 o2 2h 2e h2o2 magnetite could also be dissolved in acidic medium 27 6 fe3o4 8h fe2 2fe3 4h2o the presence of h2o2 with the dissolved iron allowed the fenton process to take place generating hydroxyl radicals according to haber weiss reaction eq 1 among both components only the corrosion of fe produced h2o2 since rs contained 75 07 fe and rc 33 46 this may explain the higher effectiveness of rs which produced more peroxide to evidence the formation of hydrogen peroxide permanganate method was used it was found the formation of 0 55 0 7 and 0 82 mm with rs and 0 22 0 34 and 0 59 mm with rc after 10 30 and 60 min respectively furthermore fe3o4 is known to be more stable than fe 28 and fe is present as minor component in rc this fact may explain the low reactivity and the rapid stability of the discoloration process observed with rc since less iron could be leached and even so the amount of h2o2 formed from rc was likely not enough to promote fenton process the leached iron from both solids was analyzed with triazine method 29 the results show the presence of 0 07 and 0 04 mg l with rs and rc after 60 min and 0 9 and 0 1 mg l with the same solids after 120 min these values are less than the allowed amount in dumped water 2 mg l on the other hand the discoloration was found to stop immediately after the solids were magnetically removed removal made after 30 min from the reaction medium this indicates that the discoloration reaction takes place mainly on the solid surfaces in the literature metallic iron was found to play an important role in the discoloration process when present with magnetite in fact fe is a reducing reagent its presence with fe3o4 helps to reduce the oxidized sites via electron transfer from iron to magnetite occurring at the interface metal oxide 30 7 fe0 2fe3 magnetite 3fe2 magnetite this electron transfer is the key of the reactivity of such composites as reported by regan et al 31 who found that at the interface fe0 fe3o4 several layers of the metal were oxidized while several layers of the oxide were reduced proving the exchange of electrons between the two phases our results have shown that the sample rs exhibited a gradual increase in mo discoloration up to 210 min while the reaction with rc stopped after 60 min it is possible that the high content of fe in rs has favored a rapid reduction of fe3 magnetite to fe2 magnetite regenerating thereby the active sites and maintaining the discoloration process of mo for longer time nevertheless the results show relative stable solids which were not very active as catalysts when used alone despite the evident effectiveness of rs due to the higher fe content this while the presence of oxidant externally added may improve the discoloration process 3 3 2 mo removal by fenton oxidation hydrogen peroxide is considered as a main source of hydroxyl radicals in fenton process many authors claimed that iron powder and hydrogen peroxide is a more favorable system for discoloration of dye than classical fenton reagent soluble fe2 the catalytic activities of both samples for methyl orange discoloration as function of hydrogen peroxide concentration are shown in fig 4 the results show fast discolorations obtained at low h2o2 concentrations 0 3 mm and 1 mm after 5 min the reactions registered 44 48 and 25 92 with rs and rc respectively with 0 3 mm while with 1 mm it attained 78 83 and 42 36 with the same samples after the same period of time in the presence of rs total discoloration was obtained after 15 min with 0 3 mm and after 10 min with 1 mm with increasing the concentration of h2o2 to 6 mm and 10 mm the discoloration reactions were prolonged and the samples registered clear differences in the reaction rates in fact after 5 min one registered 20 04 and 4 27 with rs and rc respectively with h2o2 at 6 mm and 7 89 and 1 86 with the same samples after the same reaction time with h2o2 at 10 mm in the presence of rs the discoloration stabilized at 95 after 20 min with 6 mm and after 35 min with 10 mm it should be noted that at high h2o2 concentration 10 mm in the presence of rc the reaction shows slow first stage of about 10 min this slow process was assigned to the induction period during which no measurable reaction occurred no induction period was observed with rs regardless of h2o2 concentration used this may indicate the existence of more reactive surface species on rs that even the presence of high amount of h2o2 could not inhibit the progress of the reaction as it seems to be the case with rc the catalytic efficiency of rs was always higher than that of rc in all cases and the optimal conditions regarding the concentration of h2o2 was 1 mm at this h2o2 concentration 1 mm the results registered by the samples were almost close it is likely that the optimal conditions have masked the effect of the nature of the solids only when the concentration of h2o2 was increased to 6 mm and 10 mm the difference in the reactivity of the samples was clearly observable the slowness of the reaction was reported by bremner et al to be due to the passivation of iron surface that becomes important with increasing the concentration of h2o2 32 they also observed a rapid increase in ph of the solution upon the addition of highly concentrated h2o2 solution leading to the rapid formation of ferric ions whose solubility dropped at around ph 3 and accelerated thereby the deposition of an oxide passivation layer on the solid surface the slowness of the reaction may also be due to the fact that excessive h2o2 contributed to hydroxyl radicals consumption resulting in the production of ho 2 and o2 with less oxidation potentials thereby impeding the degradation of the dye molecules 33 34 8 oh h2o2 ho 2 h2o 9 ho 2 oh h2o o2 consequently the reaction slowed down in this case the clear difference in mo discoloration may indicate that the progress of radicalar reactions initiated by h2o2 at high concentrations was affected by the surface composition fig 5 shows mo spectra registered during its discoloration in the presence of the two samples with h2o2 at 6 mm despite the identical experimental conditions used the peaks characteristic of mo plummeted rapidly with rs within 20 min and more slowly with rc within 40 min reflecting different reactivities of the solid surfaces on the other hand the catalytic activity of both solids was tested in fenton reaction iron h2o2 system for three consecutive runs with h2o2 at 1 mm total discoloration was attained after 45 min with rs and 60 min with rc while 10 and 20 min were sufficient for rs and rc respectively to reach the same results in the first run this shows that changes have occurred on the surface characteristics of both solids but which were not severe as the reaction time for total discoloration remained acceptable in both cases both samples contained fe3o4 and fe0 in different proportions the two components activated differently hydrogen peroxide the activation of h2o2 by fe0 occurred via a two electrons transfer from the particle surfaces to h2o2 35 10 fe h2o2 2h fe2 2h2o 11 fe2 h2o2 fe3 ho oh magnetite is a spinel iron oxide with chemical structure fe iii tet fe ii fe iii octo4 which means that it contains both fe2 and fe3 where fe2 can be reversibly oxidized and reduced in the same structure the generation of radicals in the presence of magnetite was reported to occur as follows 36 12 fe ii magnetite h2o2 aq fe iii magnetite ho oh 13 fe iii magnetite h2o2 aq fe ii magnetite ho2 h 14 fe iii magnetite ho2 fe ii magnetite o2 h the presence of fe2 magnetite might play the role of electron donor to h2o2 to form ho radicals and initiate the fenton reaction 37 38 other authors reported that h2o2 activation by fe3o4 begins with the formation of a complex between fe iii and h2o2 referred as fe iii h2o2 which is converted into fe ii and followed by successive radicalar reactions producing hydroxyl radicals 39 15 fe iii h2o2 fe iii h2o2 16 fe iii h2o2 fe ii ho2 h 17 fe iii ho2 fe ii o2 h 18 fe ii fe iii fe iii ho oh it was reported that the reduction of fe iii to fe ii by hydrogen peroxide is a slow process which may restrict the efficiency of the solid in fenton reaction 40 in the case of rs it is likely that the iron redox cycle was improved by the presence of high amount of fe which ensured a continuous transfer of electrons to the surface bounded fe iii and thus enhanced the degradation process 3 3 3 mo removal by us iron oxidation ultrasound with its unique physical and chemical effects is an important technology for recalcitrant chemicals treatment sonochemical effects are attributed to the phenomena that results from cavitation which is the formation growth and subsequent collapse of cavities generating high localized temperature and pressure sites named as hot spot under these conditions water molecules are dissociated allowing the generation of highly reactive species such as oh h ho 2 o and h2o2 41 19 h2o h oh 20 o2 2o 21 oh oh h2o2 22 h2o2 2 oh where refers to the ultrasonic irradiation these highly oxidizing radicals provide the main driving mechanism for the efficient degradation of pollutants 35 the ultrasonic process was applied to the system containing 0 02 g solid mo acidified at ph 3 mechanically agitated at 100 rpm and 40 c the results show two stages in mo discoloration a first rapid stage of 16 min with rs and 6 min with rc during which the discoloration attained 72 42 and 26 15 respectively and a second stage during which the discoloration progressed very slowly attaining 84 18 and 32 47 with rs and rc respectively after 60 min fig 6 alone rs and rc registered 25 92 and 18 3 after the same reaction time 60 min it is reported that ultrasound in a heterogeneous system increased the surface defect and the number of active sites on the solid and helped in increase in mass transfer as well as fragmentation process fragmentation process reduces the particle size of the solids leading to increase the surface area and the available active sites 42 this may explain the rapid first stages but the stabilization in the second stages despite the application of ultrasounds indicated that us was not able to produce enough radicals probably because less h2o2 was formed during the ultrasonic irradiation thus the enhancement observed in the first stages were likely due to surface area increase the particles were agglomerated and oxidant formation without being sufficient to ensure a continuity of the reaction over time the solid rc seems to respond difficultly to the effect of us when compared to rs its stability because of the high content of fe3o4 may here also be the cause on the other hand the system iron h2o2 was more efficient than iron us with both solids since 10 and 20 min were sufficient for rs and rc respectively to reach total discoloration of mo in the presence of 1 mm h2o2 while after the same period of times 72 42 and 27 56 were registered with the same samples respectively with the system iron us the presence of oxidant h2o2 externally supplemented was more effective in mo discoloration than its in situ production by ultrasounds 3 3 4 mo removal by us fenton oxidation in order to reduce the discoloration time the combination of the heterogeneous fenton process iron h2o2 with ultrasounds us was tested with different concentrations of h2o2 0 3 1 6 and 10 mm a much higher efficiency was obtained with this system as total dye discoloration was attained after only 4 and 10 min with rs and rc respectively with h2o2 at 1 mm fig 7 without ultrasounds the reaction needed 10 and 20 min respectively for total discoloration with both solids at the same h2o2 concentration fig 4 in this case the degradation efficiency was improved due to the additional oh generated from the homogeneous us h2o2 us h2o and heterogeneous iron h2o2 furthermore the presence of nucleation sites on the catalyst surfaces promoted the formation of cavities and consequently improved the degradation efficiency despite the increase in discoloration rate rc remained less effective than rs and at high h2o2 concentration 10 mm the induction time was still observed but its duration was shortened to 5 min instead of 10 min registered in rc h2o2 system nevertheless iron h2o2 us system has superior capacity for mo discoloration than iron h2o2 or iron us systems the disappearance of color during the discoloration of mo may be described as a pseudo first order reaction kinetic for which the following equation may be used 23 ln a 0 a k t the eq 23 was applied for the results of iron h2o2 us systems fig 7a b the values of rate constants obtained with rs h2o2 us were 0 466 1 348 0 388 and 0 23 min 1 for peroxide concentrations of 0 3 1 6 and 10 mm respectively and 0 198 0 383 0 118 and 0 067 min 1 with rc for the same h2o2 concentrations it can be seen that with the four h2o2 concentrations tested the rate constants registered with rs were around 2 3 6 times higher than those registered with rc fig 7c d this difference in the results may likely be due to the effect of their compositions in the literature papers dealing with samples containing different fe0 and fe3o4 contents and their effects on the degradation processes were not found almost all studies used one component such as fe0 fe3o4 or fe2o3 in fenton or sono fenton processes while varying the operation conditions for example reactive orange 107 was degraded in the presence of fe3o4 h2o2 us process 43 complete dye removal was obtained with 0 8 g l magnetite nanoparticles 10 mm h2o2 and 24 khz after 25 min of reaction in another study basic violet 10 was treated by sono fenton process using nano sized magnetite produced by ball mill 44 the optimal conditions were ph 3 catalyst dosage 1 5 g l h2o2 36 mm and ultrasonic power of 450 w l thereby removing 75 94 of the dye molecules after 120 min phenol degradation was studied by using fe h2o2 us system 35 it was found that 90 of phenol degradation was obtained after 24 h of silent degradation after applying only a few minutes of ultrasound at the outset tetracycline degradation under ultrasonic assisted fenton process was studied over magnetite 28 it was found that 93 6 of the component was removed after 60 min using 1 g l of magnetite 150 mmol l h2o2 ph 3 7 22 c and ultrasound power of 80 w all these studies confirmed superior capacity of the combined iron h2o2 us system on the other hand the degradation of methyl orange was also investigated by heterogeneous fenton process under different conditions using different iron products for example 0 1 g of nano fe3o4 supported by muscovite was used to degrade 98 of mo 100 mg l after 60 min at ph 3 and 25 c 45 nano sized iron particles synthesized by plant extract were used for the degradation of mo it was found the discoloration of 77 of mo 25 mg l after 6 h using 10 mg of iron powder and h2o2 at 3 mm 46 alginate fe2 fe3 was used as catalyst for the discoloration of mo the optimal conditions were found to be ph 3 using initial mo concentration of 20 ppm and 1 mm of h2o2 at room temperature 47 one can observe that the time for total discoloration for the different experiments reported above was somewhat long when compared with that obtained with iron synthesized in this study 10 min with rs in the system rs h2o2 which decreased to 4 min in the system rs h2o2 us because one used whether metallic iron or magnetite alone this shows that their combination may be of great interest as they accelerate greatly the reaction rate fig 8 shows the comparison between the results obtained with different systems it can be seen that in both cases the system iron h2o2 us allowed rapid discoloration process followed by the system iron h2o2 iron us and then iron alone the values of rate constants calculated table 2 show also that the systems containing rs were remarkably more efficient than those containing rc since the constant rates registered with rs were more than 3 times those registered with rc in almost all cases from the results obtained in this study one can conclude that the best heterogeneous catalyst is that combining magnetite and metallic iron with the proportion of the latter being enough high to ensure the regeneration of fe3o4 active sites 4 conclusion in this study two iron precursors were used to synthesize fe0 fe3o4 by a chemical reduction method using kbh4 as reductant at 5 c under air the samples were spherical in shape and agglomerated because of their magnetic character the samples synthesized with feso4 and fecl3 contained 75 07 and 33 46 of fe0 respectively the sample prepared with feso4 exhibited the highest magnetization saturation and phpzc value contained the greatest percentage of fe0 and possessed the highest potential for h2o2 driven fenton treatment of methyl orange the presence of high content of fe0 helped at maintaining a high reduction rate of the fe3 magnetite oxidized phases regenerating thereby the active fe2 magnetite species the results show also that the discoloration process was mainly due to heterogeneous reaction as the leaching of the samples during the process was insignificant with the addition of ultrasounds to heterogeneous fenton system the degradation efficiency was significantly enhanced as total discoloration was obtained after only 4 and 10 min with iron synthesized with feso4 and fecl3 respectively the results obtained show that the efficiency of the catalyst depended greatly on the nature of the iron precursor therefore the choice of the appropriate precursor is primordial to ensure the presence of the desired component especially when this component fe0 in this case is essential in a practical application such as in fenton process on the other hand the utilization of such magnetic catalysts simplified greatly their recovery and reusability providing

13576,in this study two iron precursors feso4 and fecl3 were used for the synthesis of iron particles via a reduction reaction with kbh4 detailed characterizations were carried out using x ray diffractometry scanning electron microscopy and magnetic analysis the results showed ferromagnetic submicron particles with different proportions of fe and fe3o4 the particles were tested as catalysts for the discoloration of methyl orange mo in heterogeneous fenton process the results show that the nature of the precursor impacted the activity of the obtained product in fact 78 83 and 42 36 of mo were discolored after 5 min of reaction in the presence of the catalysts synthesized with feso4 and fecl3 respectively with h2o2 at 1 mm and 40 c coupling ultrasounds with heterogeneous fenton process reduced the time for total discoloration to 4 and 10 min with the same samples respectively regardless of the conditions used the sample synthesized with feso4 possessed the highest potential for mo discoloration keywords iron precursor kbh4 reduction magnetic character heterogeneous fenton process ultrasounds 1 introduction the widespread of contaminants in surface water and soils has become a critical issue due to population growth and rapid progress of industrialization the contaminants persisting in environment include heavy metals inorganic and organic components they are harmful and need to be removed 1 6 dyes are among the organic contaminants found in wastewater because of their large utilization in many fields most of them are recalcitrant and exhibit toxicity to humans and aquatic organisms in the last decades different methods have been developed for wastewater treatment such as adsorption extraction bioremediation and ultra and nanofiltration 7 some of them have better outcomes than others advanced oxidation processes aops are increasingly adopted in the treatment of organic pollutants because of their high performance mild conditions and large spectrum of utilization they are based on the formation of hydroxyl radicals possessing powerful oxidation capacity e0 2 1 v to degrade the recalcitrant contaminants 8 the hydroxyl radicals may be generated by different aops methods such as o3 uv o3 h2o2 uv h2o2 uv h2o2 o3 sonolysis processes homogeneous and heterogeneous fenton processes etc oxidation process using the activation of h2o2 by soluble fe2 to generate hydroxyl radicals is referred to as fenton s reagent and takes place through the haber weiss mechanism 9 1 fe2 aq h2o2 fe3 ho oh the formation of iron sludge is a severe weakness of this process this problem may be solved by using a solid catalyst which facilitates its separation and recycling and avoids secondary pollution sub micron and nanoparticles of iron and iron oxides have been largely considered in many fields due to their good chemical and thermal stability non toxicity biocompatibility magnetic character and low cost these properties have led to useful applications in catalysis batteries magnetic pigments and fluids water treatment gas sensors and information storage media 10 13 it is known that the physico chemical properties of a catalyst are fundamentally related to the synthesis method several techniques have been developed to synthesize iron and its oxides including chemical precipitation thermal decomposition sol gel hydrothermal ball milling mechanical alloying and chemical reduction the chemical reduction could be the most widely used method because of its rapidness and facility it used several reducing reagents such as hydrazine glycerol hydroxylamine hydrochloride and borohydride potassium sodium borohydride is used in ketones conversion to alcohols 14 and for hydrogen storage in fuel cells 15 it is also used in the synthesis of different metals such as iron 16 in the literature several studies reported the preparation of iron via the reduction by nabh4 and the utilization of the obtained product in chemical reactions in a paper iron supported by reduced graphene oxide fe fe3o4 rgo was synthesized by reduction of fecl3 with nabh4 and the product was used as photocatalyst in in the oxidation of orange ii the catalyst allowed the degradation of 94 14 of the dye molecule after 180 min with a xenon lamp of 150 w simulating sunlight 17 pure metallic iron fe was synthesized by reduction of fecl3 with nabh4 under n2 atmosphere the formed particles were applied in the reductive discoloration of methyl orange 18 a rapid discoloration of the dye molecules was obtained with iron dosage of 0 5 g l at 40 c and ph 6 in another study scrap iron was used as generator of iron after leaching process with citric acid at 0 5 m the resultant leached iron was converted to fe3o4 nanoparticles by reduction with nabh4 and further calcination at 400 c for 2 h the product was formed by particles with 7 nm in size which showed peroxidase like activity making them usable for phenol detection 19 many other papers reported the synthesis and application of iron based catalysts which all agreed that the easy recovery of such solids with a simple magnetic field represents a key issue regarding its potential application it is worth noting that most of the studies found in literature used one precursor to synthesize iron based material while different operational parameters are varied to produce the desired particle size and shape 20 21 the nature of metallic precursor may also affect the physico chemical characteristics of the solid and not enough data are available regarding this point in this study two precursors of iron were tested for the synthesis of fe fe3o4 by reduction with kbh4 under air open air was expressively used to explore the effect of aerated condition on the formation of iron oxide with the two precursors the synthesized products were characterized by xrd sem and magnetic analyses and applied in a discoloration process of methyl orange mo used as model substrate methyl orange mo a heterocyclic aromatic chemical compound is one of the well known acidic anionic dyes that is widely used in textile printing paper food and research laboratories 22 in this study the discoloration of mo was investigated by using iron alone iron coupled with h2o2 with ultrasounds and the combination of the three parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 iron synthesis iron particles were synthesized by pouring in drop wise manner 25 ml of kbh4 fluka 97 at 0 5 m into the same volume of two iron precursors feso4 7h2o sigma aldrich 99 and fecl3 sigma aldrich 99 9 at 0 1 m the experiments were conducted in a cylindrical pyrex vessel of 150 ml under air the mixtures were mechanically agitated 250 rpm to avoid the agglomeration of the particles around magnetic bar leading to difficulties for their recovery the formation of the particles was instantaneous because of the strong reducing character of kbh4 but the experiments were lasted for 30 min in the two cases to implement the same operation conditions the black particles were after that washed with deionized water and dried at 30 c in oven 2 2 particles characterization and phpzc determination x ray diffraction patterns used to identify the phase constitution were obtained with a rigaku ultima iv x ray diffractometer using cuk α radiation λ 1 5406 å in step mode between 20 and 80 using a step size of 0 02 s the surface morphology was examined by fei quanta 250 feg scanning electron microscope the hysteresis loops m h loops were recorded by a vibrating sample magnetometer micro sense at room temperature because the magnetization saturation changes with the amount of the sample the results were divided on the sample s weight the phpzc of the solids were determined by a method reported elsewhere 23 this method consisted on mixing 1 g of the solid with 20 ml of co2 free distilled water the sample was manually agitated over a period of 48 h after which the ph of the mixture was taken as phpzc 2 3 methyl orange discoloration experiments the fenton like activities of the two samples were evaluated by monitoring the discoloration of methyl orange fluka 99 the concentration of mo was determined by using a jenway 6705uv vis spectrometer at 508 nm during the discoloration process at regular time intervals 3 ml of the reaction solution was collected with a syringe from the reactor for absorbance measurements in an optical quartz cell after which they were recovered back into the solution the discoloration efficiency of mo was calculated from the difference of initial absorbance a0 and the absorbance at different time intervals at 2 d i s c o l o r a t i o n e f f i c i e n c y a 0 a t a 0 x 100 in a typical experiment 0 02 g of iron the mass was previously optimized was added to 100 ml of mo at 5 10 5 mol l 16 mg l at 40 c and ph adjusted to 3 by using h2so4 the solution was kept under mechanical agitation at a moderate speed 100 rpm to maintain the uniformity of the system the study was conducted in the absence and presence of hydrogen peroxide at different concentrations 0 3 1 6 and 10 mm the effect of ultrasounds was also investigated by using a branson b200 device generating 40 khz of ultrasounds frequency working with on off mode 2 4 in situ h2o2 quantification in acidic medium iron may produce in situ h2o2 under oxic conditions via the reduction of oxygen in this study the selected discoloration experiment for which the quantification of h2o2 produced in situ is needed was repeated without the presence of mo 3 ml of water at selected time intervals were withdrawn for h2o2 analysis by titration with permanganate according to the reaction 24 3 2mno4 5h2o2 6h 2 mn2 5o2 8h2o 3 results and discussion 3 1 xrd and sem analyses for simplification rs and rc are referred to the products synthesized with feso4 and fecl3 respectively preliminary synthesis tests were conducted at 25 and 60 c in order to check whether heating affected the kinetic of the reduction reaction visual observations have shown that the amount of the formed particles strongly decreased when synthesis temperature increased from 25 to 60 c this was probably due to the fact that kbh4 which produced easily h2 has lost the gas by heating before it reacted properly with iron precursors the experiments were thus conducted in colder bath at 5 c high amount of particles was obtained in the two cases with almost the same yield efficiencies in both cases an increase of temperature upon the addition of kbh4 of about 3 c was observed exothermic the characterization of the products by xrd shows well crystalline samples which exhibited peaks located at 2θ 30 3 35 7 43 4 53 6 57 3 and 62 9 which can be assigned to α fe3o4 and one strong peak located at 2θ 44 35 corresponding to α fe fig 1 magnetite was present in both samples because the experiments were conducted in open reactor which allows the oxidation of a part of the product it can be seen also that the proportions of fe0 and fe3o4 in the two samples are different table 1 and that the amount of fe0 was more important in rs than in rc this may be due to the fact that the reduction from fe2 to fe0 feso4 was easier than that from fe3 to fe0 fecl3 on the other hand it is possible that the presence of chloride anion could have affected the formation of metallic iron in fact it was reported that the presence of chloride ions promoted the oxidation of metals and retards the growth of the particles 25 this may explain the high amount of fe3o4 present on rc compared to rs despite the presence of enough amount of kbh4 during the reduction process available to react with fecl3 the crystallite sizes of fe0 in the samples calculated by scherrer method were 21 48 and 22 53 nm for rs and rc respectively while those of magnetite were 99 88 and 21 61 nm respectively all peaks of the samples can be indexed to face centered cubic fcc fe3o4 with the lattice constants of 8 25 å rs and 8 28 å rc and that of iron fe0 are indexed to face centered cubic fcc fe0 with the lattice constants of 2 82 å rs and 2 83 å rc sem image of rs shows that the sample is mainly formed by great spherical particles with size of about 750 nm with finer ones with size of about 166 nm the sample rc exhibited finer powder formed by chain like agglomerated particles with size varying from 83 to 415 nm here also the effect of the precursor of rc containing chlorides could be the cause of the finesses of the particle size the aggregation in both cases might result from the inherent magnetism of the particles 3 2 magnetic measurements the magnetic properties were investigated by vsm system at room temperature with the field sweeping from 10000 to 10000 oe fig 2 shows the hysteresis loops of the two samples the magnetic hysteresis loops indicate their ferromagnetism at room temperature ferromagnetic materials are magnetized easily and when a field is applied and then removed the magnetization does not return to its original value this phenomenon is referred to as hysteresis the magnetism in ferromagnetic materials is caused by the alignment patterns of their constituent atoms which act as elementary electromagnets the values of saturation magnetization ms were 168 48 and 121 45 emu g for rs and rc respectively and the coercivity values hc of the same samples were 228 and 220 oe hc may be relied to the crystallite size of iron the samples rs and rc exhibit almost similar values of 228 and 220 oe respectively which crystallites sizes of fe were not greatly different 21 48 and 22 53 nm respectively on the other hand the highest value of saturation magnetization 168 48 emu g was obtained with the sample with the highest content of fe rs 3 3 discoloration of methyl orange in the presence of iron the saturation magnetizations of the two samples were sufficient for magnetic separation with external magnet 26 the discoloration of mo was tested with the solids alone solids with h2o2 with ultrasound and then the three conditions together 3 3 1 mo removal in the presence of iron the discoloration reaction was tested with the solids in neutral medium no change in absorbance values was observed after 3 h with both samples the same experiments were repeated in acidic medium at ph 3 with the solid rs the discoloration registered 25 92 after 60 min and increased slightly to 41 17 after 210 min after which it stabilized the discoloration in the presence of rc was weaker and stabilized at 18 3 after 60 min fig 3 in heterogeneous system the discoloration may be due to adsorption or oxidation or both to distinguish between these processes the phpzc of the solids were determined the values found were 8 3 and 9 4 for rc and rs respectively these values favored the adsorption of the anionic mo onto the positively charged surfaces of the samples but this did not occur in neutral medium thus the discoloration observed in acidic medium was likely due to the oxidation process in fact in oxic conditions the corrosion of fe0 into fe2 is accompanied by the production of h2o2 from the reduction of o2 4 fe0 fe2 2e 5 o2 2h 2e h2o2 magnetite could also be dissolved in acidic medium 27 6 fe3o4 8h fe2 2fe3 4h2o the presence of h2o2 with the dissolved iron allowed the fenton process to take place generating hydroxyl radicals according to haber weiss reaction eq 1 among both components only the corrosion of fe produced h2o2 since rs contained 75 07 fe and rc 33 46 this may explain the higher effectiveness of rs which produced more peroxide to evidence the formation of hydrogen peroxide permanganate method was used it was found the formation of 0 55 0 7 and 0 82 mm with rs and 0 22 0 34 and 0 59 mm with rc after 10 30 and 60 min respectively furthermore fe3o4 is known to be more stable than fe 28 and fe is present as minor component in rc this fact may explain the low reactivity and the rapid stability of the discoloration process observed with rc since less iron could be leached and even so the amount of h2o2 formed from rc was likely not enough to promote fenton process the leached iron from both solids was analyzed with triazine method 29 the results show the presence of 0 07 and 0 04 mg l with rs and rc after 60 min and 0 9 and 0 1 mg l with the same solids after 120 min these values are less than the allowed amount in dumped water 2 mg l on the other hand the discoloration was found to stop immediately after the solids were magnetically removed removal made after 30 min from the reaction medium this indicates that the discoloration reaction takes place mainly on the solid surfaces in the literature metallic iron was found to play an important role in the discoloration process when present with magnetite in fact fe is a reducing reagent its presence with fe3o4 helps to reduce the oxidized sites via electron transfer from iron to magnetite occurring at the interface metal oxide 30 7 fe0 2fe3 magnetite 3fe2 magnetite this electron transfer is the key of the reactivity of such composites as reported by regan et al 31 who found that at the interface fe0 fe3o4 several layers of the metal were oxidized while several layers of the oxide were reduced proving the exchange of electrons between the two phases our results have shown that the sample rs exhibited a gradual increase in mo discoloration up to 210 min while the reaction with rc stopped after 60 min it is possible that the high content of fe in rs has favored a rapid reduction of fe3 magnetite to fe2 magnetite regenerating thereby the active sites and maintaining the discoloration process of mo for longer time nevertheless the results show relative stable solids which were not very active as catalysts when used alone despite the evident effectiveness of rs due to the higher fe content this while the presence of oxidant externally added may improve the discoloration process 3 3 2 mo removal by fenton oxidation hydrogen peroxide is considered as a main source of hydroxyl radicals in fenton process many authors claimed that iron powder and hydrogen peroxide is a more favorable system for discoloration of dye than classical fenton reagent soluble fe2 the catalytic activities of both samples for methyl orange discoloration as function of hydrogen peroxide concentration are shown in fig 4 the results show fast discolorations obtained at low h2o2 concentrations 0 3 mm and 1 mm after 5 min the reactions registered 44 48 and 25 92 with rs and rc respectively with 0 3 mm while with 1 mm it attained 78 83 and 42 36 with the same samples after the same period of time in the presence of rs total discoloration was obtained after 15 min with 0 3 mm and after 10 min with 1 mm with increasing the concentration of h2o2 to 6 mm and 10 mm the discoloration reactions were prolonged and the samples registered clear differences in the reaction rates in fact after 5 min one registered 20 04 and 4 27 with rs and rc respectively with h2o2 at 6 mm and 7 89 and 1 86 with the same samples after the same reaction time with h2o2 at 10 mm in the presence of rs the discoloration stabilized at 95 after 20 min with 6 mm and after 35 min with 10 mm it should be noted that at high h2o2 concentration 10 mm in the presence of rc the reaction shows slow first stage of about 10 min this slow process was assigned to the induction period during which no measurable reaction occurred no induction period was observed with rs regardless of h2o2 concentration used this may indicate the existence of more reactive surface species on rs that even the presence of high amount of h2o2 could not inhibit the progress of the reaction as it seems to be the case with rc the catalytic efficiency of rs was always higher than that of rc in all cases and the optimal conditions regarding the concentration of h2o2 was 1 mm at this h2o2 concentration 1 mm the results registered by the samples were almost close it is likely that the optimal conditions have masked the effect of the nature of the solids only when the concentration of h2o2 was increased to 6 mm and 10 mm the difference in the reactivity of the samples was clearly observable the slowness of the reaction was reported by bremner et al to be due to the passivation of iron surface that becomes important with increasing the concentration of h2o2 32 they also observed a rapid increase in ph of the solution upon the addition of highly concentrated h2o2 solution leading to the rapid formation of ferric ions whose solubility dropped at around ph 3 and accelerated thereby the deposition of an oxide passivation layer on the solid surface the slowness of the reaction may also be due to the fact that excessive h2o2 contributed to hydroxyl radicals consumption resulting in the production of ho 2 and o2 with less oxidation potentials thereby impeding the degradation of the dye molecules 33 34 8 oh h2o2 ho 2 h2o 9 ho 2 oh h2o o2 consequently the reaction slowed down in this case the clear difference in mo discoloration may indicate that the progress of radicalar reactions initiated by h2o2 at high concentrations was affected by the surface composition fig 5 shows mo spectra registered during its discoloration in the presence of the two samples with h2o2 at 6 mm despite the identical experimental conditions used the peaks characteristic of mo plummeted rapidly with rs within 20 min and more slowly with rc within 40 min reflecting different reactivities of the solid surfaces on the other hand the catalytic activity of both solids was tested in fenton reaction iron h2o2 system for three consecutive runs with h2o2 at 1 mm total discoloration was attained after 45 min with rs and 60 min with rc while 10 and 20 min were sufficient for rs and rc respectively to reach the same results in the first run this shows that changes have occurred on the surface characteristics of both solids but which were not severe as the reaction time for total discoloration remained acceptable in both cases both samples contained fe3o4 and fe0 in different proportions the two components activated differently hydrogen peroxide the activation of h2o2 by fe0 occurred via a two electrons transfer from the particle surfaces to h2o2 35 10 fe h2o2 2h fe2 2h2o 11 fe2 h2o2 fe3 ho oh magnetite is a spinel iron oxide with chemical structure fe iii tet fe ii fe iii octo4 which means that it contains both fe2 and fe3 where fe2 can be reversibly oxidized and reduced in the same structure the generation of radicals in the presence of magnetite was reported to occur as follows 36 12 fe ii magnetite h2o2 aq fe iii magnetite ho oh 13 fe iii magnetite h2o2 aq fe ii magnetite ho2 h 14 fe iii magnetite ho2 fe ii magnetite o2 h the presence of fe2 magnetite might play the role of electron donor to h2o2 to form ho radicals and initiate the fenton reaction 37 38 other authors reported that h2o2 activation by fe3o4 begins with the formation of a complex between fe iii and h2o2 referred as fe iii h2o2 which is converted into fe ii and followed by successive radicalar reactions producing hydroxyl radicals 39 15 fe iii h2o2 fe iii h2o2 16 fe iii h2o2 fe ii ho2 h 17 fe iii ho2 fe ii o2 h 18 fe ii fe iii fe iii ho oh it was reported that the reduction of fe iii to fe ii by hydrogen peroxide is a slow process which may restrict the efficiency of the solid in fenton reaction 40 in the case of rs it is likely that the iron redox cycle was improved by the presence of high amount of fe which ensured a continuous transfer of electrons to the surface bounded fe iii and thus enhanced the degradation process 3 3 3 mo removal by us iron oxidation ultrasound with its unique physical and chemical effects is an important technology for recalcitrant chemicals treatment sonochemical effects are attributed to the phenomena that results from cavitation which is the formation growth and subsequent collapse of cavities generating high localized temperature and pressure sites named as hot spot under these conditions water molecules are dissociated allowing the generation of highly reactive species such as oh h ho 2 o and h2o2 41 19 h2o h oh 20 o2 2o 21 oh oh h2o2 22 h2o2 2 oh where refers to the ultrasonic irradiation these highly oxidizing radicals provide the main driving mechanism for the efficient degradation of pollutants 35 the ultrasonic process was applied to the system containing 0 02 g solid mo acidified at ph 3 mechanically agitated at 100 rpm and 40 c the results show two stages in mo discoloration a first rapid stage of 16 min with rs and 6 min with rc during which the discoloration attained 72 42 and 26 15 respectively and a second stage during which the discoloration progressed very slowly attaining 84 18 and 32 47 with rs and rc respectively after 60 min fig 6 alone rs and rc registered 25 92 and 18 3 after the same reaction time 60 min it is reported that ultrasound in a heterogeneous system increased the surface defect and the number of active sites on the solid and helped in increase in mass transfer as well as fragmentation process fragmentation process reduces the particle size of the solids leading to increase the surface area and the available active sites 42 this may explain the rapid first stages but the stabilization in the second stages despite the application of ultrasounds indicated that us was not able to produce enough radicals probably because less h2o2 was formed during the ultrasonic irradiation thus the enhancement observed in the first stages were likely due to surface area increase the particles were agglomerated and oxidant formation without being sufficient to ensure a continuity of the reaction over time the solid rc seems to respond difficultly to the effect of us when compared to rs its stability because of the high content of fe3o4 may here also be the cause on the other hand the system iron h2o2 was more efficient than iron us with both solids since 10 and 20 min were sufficient for rs and rc respectively to reach total discoloration of mo in the presence of 1 mm h2o2 while after the same period of times 72 42 and 27 56 were registered with the same samples respectively with the system iron us the presence of oxidant h2o2 externally supplemented was more effective in mo discoloration than its in situ production by ultrasounds 3 3 4 mo removal by us fenton oxidation in order to reduce the discoloration time the combination of the heterogeneous fenton process iron h2o2 with ultrasounds us was tested with different concentrations of h2o2 0 3 1 6 and 10 mm a much higher efficiency was obtained with this system as total dye discoloration was attained after only 4 and 10 min with rs and rc respectively with h2o2 at 1 mm fig 7 without ultrasounds the reaction needed 10 and 20 min respectively for total discoloration with both solids at the same h2o2 concentration fig 4 in this case the degradation efficiency was improved due to the additional oh generated from the homogeneous us h2o2 us h2o and heterogeneous iron h2o2 furthermore the presence of nucleation sites on the catalyst surfaces promoted the formation of cavities and consequently improved the degradation efficiency despite the increase in discoloration rate rc remained less effective than rs and at high h2o2 concentration 10 mm the induction time was still observed but its duration was shortened to 5 min instead of 10 min registered in rc h2o2 system nevertheless iron h2o2 us system has superior capacity for mo discoloration than iron h2o2 or iron us systems the disappearance of color during the discoloration of mo may be described as a pseudo first order reaction kinetic for which the following equation may be used 23 ln a 0 a k t the eq 23 was applied for the results of iron h2o2 us systems fig 7a b the values of rate constants obtained with rs h2o2 us were 0 466 1 348 0 388 and 0 23 min 1 for peroxide concentrations of 0 3 1 6 and 10 mm respectively and 0 198 0 383 0 118 and 0 067 min 1 with rc for the same h2o2 concentrations it can be seen that with the four h2o2 concentrations tested the rate constants registered with rs were around 2 3 6 times higher than those registered with rc fig 7c d this difference in the results may likely be due to the effect of their compositions in the literature papers dealing with samples containing different fe0 and fe3o4 contents and their effects on the degradation processes were not found almost all studies used one component such as fe0 fe3o4 or fe2o3 in fenton or sono fenton processes while varying the operation conditions for example reactive orange 107 was degraded in the presence of fe3o4 h2o2 us process 43 complete dye removal was obtained with 0 8 g l magnetite nanoparticles 10 mm h2o2 and 24 khz after 25 min of reaction in another study basic violet 10 was treated by sono fenton process using nano sized magnetite produced by ball mill 44 the optimal conditions were ph 3 catalyst dosage 1 5 g l h2o2 36 mm and ultrasonic power of 450 w l thereby removing 75 94 of the dye molecules after 120 min phenol degradation was studied by using fe h2o2 us system 35 it was found that 90 of phenol degradation was obtained after 24 h of silent degradation after applying only a few minutes of ultrasound at the outset tetracycline degradation under ultrasonic assisted fenton process was studied over magnetite 28 it was found that 93 6 of the component was removed after 60 min using 1 g l of magnetite 150 mmol l h2o2 ph 3 7 22 c and ultrasound power of 80 w all these studies confirmed superior capacity of the combined iron h2o2 us system on the other hand the degradation of methyl orange was also investigated by heterogeneous fenton process under different conditions using different iron products for example 0 1 g of nano fe3o4 supported by muscovite was used to degrade 98 of mo 100 mg l after 60 min at ph 3 and 25 c 45 nano sized iron particles synthesized by plant extract were used for the degradation of mo it was found the discoloration of 77 of mo 25 mg l after 6 h using 10 mg of iron powder and h2o2 at 3 mm 46 alginate fe2 fe3 was used as catalyst for the discoloration of mo the optimal conditions were found to be ph 3 using initial mo concentration of 20 ppm and 1 mm of h2o2 at room temperature 47 one can observe that the time for total discoloration for the different experiments reported above was somewhat long when compared with that obtained with iron synthesized in this study 10 min with rs in the system rs h2o2 which decreased to 4 min in the system rs h2o2 us because one used whether metallic iron or magnetite alone this shows that their combination may be of great interest as they accelerate greatly the reaction rate fig 8 shows the comparison between the results obtained with different systems it can be seen that in both cases the system iron h2o2 us allowed rapid discoloration process followed by the system iron h2o2 iron us and then iron alone the values of rate constants calculated table 2 show also that the systems containing rs were remarkably more efficient than those containing rc since the constant rates registered with rs were more than 3 times those registered with rc in almost all cases from the results obtained in this study one can conclude that the best heterogeneous catalyst is that combining magnetite and metallic iron with the proportion of the latter being enough high to ensure the regeneration of fe3o4 active sites 4 conclusion in this study two iron precursors were used to synthesize fe0 fe3o4 by a chemical reduction method using kbh4 as reductant at 5 c under air the samples were spherical in shape and agglomerated because of their magnetic character the samples synthesized with feso4 and fecl3 contained 75 07 and 33 46 of fe0 respectively the sample prepared with feso4 exhibited the highest magnetization saturation and phpzc value contained the greatest percentage of fe0 and possessed the highest potential for h2o2 driven fenton treatment of methyl orange the presence of high content of fe0 helped at maintaining a high reduction rate of the fe3 magnetite oxidized phases regenerating thereby the active fe2 magnetite species the results show also that the discoloration process was mainly due to heterogeneous reaction as the leaching of the samples during the process was insignificant with the addition of ultrasounds to heterogeneous fenton system the degradation efficiency was significantly enhanced as total discoloration was obtained after only 4 and 10 min with iron synthesized with feso4 and fecl3 respectively the results obtained show that the efficiency of the catalyst depended greatly on the nature of the iron precursor therefore the choice of the appropriate precursor is primordial to ensure the presence of the desired component especially when this component fe0 in this case is essential in a practical application such as in fenton process on the other hand the utilization of such magnetic catalysts simplified greatly their recovery and reusability providing

13577,food waste fw treatment via pyrolysis can be a promising method to reduce the amount of fw and produce value added products such as biochar in this study fw was converted to food waste based biochar fwb as a coagulant aid for wastewater treatment the solution ph increasing ability of fwb prepared at different pyrolysis temperatures 350 450 550 650 750 and 850 c pyrolysis time 1 2 4 6 and 8 h and heating rates 5 10 and 20 c min were compared by mixing biochar and deionized water 1 5 w v for 30 min and their physicochemical properties were characterized by ftir xrd and xrf analyses the optimum pyrolysis conditions for fwb to increase the solution ph were 750 c 10 c min and 6 h copper coagulation was significantly enhanced as the fwb dose increased along with polyaluminum chloride pac moreover the addition of fwb as a coagulation aid improved sludge dewaterability and organic dye removal furthermore the combination of fwb and pac could also be used to treat industrial plating wastewater containing various heavy metals at different concentrations which makes fwb a promising coagulation aid keywords food waste biochar pyrolysis conditions coagulant aid wastewater treatment 1 introduction heavy metals are released into the water worldwide through a variety of activities such as military industrial agricultural and waste disposal industrial plating wastewater is also a major source of various types of harmful heavy metals e g copper chromium nickel zinc etc at high concentrations of up to several hundred mg l 1 these heavy metals are considered persistent bioaccumulating toxic and pose a serious threat to aquatic life and humans therefore the removal of heavy metals has attracted considerable interest 2 consequently various treatment technologies have been developed to remove heavy metals from wastewater such as coagulation 3 adsorption 4 ion exchange 5 electrodialysis 6 and membrane separation 7 coagulation a physicochemical process that enhances the settleability of suspended particulate matter by the addition of chemical or biological agents is the most economical effective and conventional process for removing various contaminants including metal ions in wastewater treatment 8 iron and aluminum based coagulants have been commonly used in the coagulation process and polyaluminum chloride pac has been found to be superior in removing particulates and or organic matter in some water and wastewater conditions 9 10 however despite the advantages e g short retention times and low capital costs many disadvantages have been reported such as high chemical costs for precipitation and ph adjustment substantial sludge production due to overdose and problems associated with dewatering and disposal of produced sludge 11 12 to overcome the inherent shortcomings associated with the use of these conventional coagulants recent research continues to increasingly focus on the development of effective coagulants and coagulant aids several coagulant aids used with pac to improve the removal efficiency of various contaminants are presented in table 1 on the other hand adsorption on activated carbon has been known to be a suitable alternative for wastewater treatment and many studies have been conducted on a hybrid process of an integrated coagulation adsorption system 27 28 zhang et al 29 used powdered activated carbon ballasted coagulation for enhanced removal of bio refractory dissolved organic matter from cassava distillery wastewater lopez et al 30 reported the effect of dosing sequence on the removal of the persistent pesticide metaldehyde using powdered activated carbon with coagulation in addition superior adsorption performance of biochar compared to activated carbon has been reported suggesting the use of biochar as a cost effective adsorbent 31 enhanced removal of organics by combined coagulation adsorption system with biochar has also been reported 32 33 meanwhile significant amounts of food waste fw approximately 1 3 billion tons per year according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao are produced globally in various sectors such as agricultural products households and restaurant residual waste 34 these are generally watery and contain protein rich organic material which can easily rot under ambient conditions causing odor and leachate problems which is a serious concern in many countries 35 among the disposal methods of fw landfill and animal feeding have recently been banned in many countries and composting is limited by the reaction time and additional transportation costs post composting although anaerobic digestion of fw has received much attention for the production of biogas it requires high initial costs and is difficult to operate 36 the most widely used thermal treatment process for various wastes can also be an option for fw treatment as it can ultimately reduce the amount of fw and produce value added products such as biochar xue et al 37 reported that biochars made from various food wastes can function as valuable adsorbents for the removal of ammonia nitrogen from aqueous solutions chu et al 38 showed the catalytic activity of magnetic biochar derived from food waste in a heterogeneous sono fenton like process for the removal of organic dyes from aqueous solutions however the application of food waste based biochar fwb as a coagulant aid has not been reported therefore in this study various pyrolysis conditions for the conversion of fw to biochar as a coagulant aid were evaluated by comparing the solution ph rising ability and the developed fwb was applied to copper removal along with pac the copper and dye removal efficiencies of fwb and the produced sludge dewaterability were compared with those of other coagulant aids heavy metal removal in industrial plating wastewater was also evaluated using pac along with fwb as a coagulant aid 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals

biochar fwb production to prepare the fwb 25 g of fw was pyrolyzed at 350 450 550 650 750 and 850 c using a muffle furnace fhx 03 daihan scientific seoul korea at a heating rate of 10 c min for 6 h then the pyrolyzed fwb was ground using a mortar and pestle the ph of the fwb was measured with a ph meter orion star a211 thermo scientific orion seoul korea in a 1 5 w v mixture of biochar and deionized water for 30 min to investigate the effect of pyrolysis time on the ph of fwb fw was heated for 1 2 4 6 and 8 h at 750 c with a heating rate of 10 c min the effect of the heating rate was also evaluated by heating for 6 h after reaching 750 c with a heating rate of 5 10 and 20 c min 2 3 characteristics of fwb the fwb composition was measured using x ray fluorescence xrf zsx primus rigaku japan the surface functional groups of the fwb were measured using fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflectance ftir atr spectroscopy nicolet is50 thermo massachusetts usa with a mid

coagulation experiments the copper concentration in the solution was fixed at 3 mg l the dose tests were conducted with fwb doses of 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 g l after 5 min of reaction pac was added and the mixture was stirred for 5 min then the solution was settled for 30 min and filtered using a vacuum pump with a glass microfiber gf c filter the residual copper concentration of the filtrate was measured using icp oes the effect of reaction time was investigated for 3 5 7 9 and 11 min with an fwb dose of 0 6 g l the removal of copper and organic dyes with other coagulant aids such as sodium carbonate and bentonite were compared in the same process mb was used as a model dye and the concentration of mb was determined with a uv vis spectrophotometer at 665 nm neo s2117 neogen korea the dewaterability of the final products was compared using an analytical balance and desiccator at room temperature for 60 min coagulation experiments were conducted using industrial plating wastewater diluted ten times with deionized water the adsorption kinetics were estimated with copper and mb the concentration of copper and mb in kinetic experiments were 30 mg l and 50 μm respectively and the dose of fwb was fixed with 0 06 g l for isotherm the experiment was conducted with mb the different concentrations of mb 5 200 μm was used with 0 1 g l of fwb the samples were filtered and measured by icp oes and uv vis spectrophotometer all experiments were performed in replicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of pyrolysis conditions on ph 3 1 1 effect of pyrolysis temperature basically the removal of heavy metals from wastewater can be accomplished by precipitation as the hydroxides at evaluated ph thus the effect of the pyrolysis temperature on the fwb ph was investigated fig 1 a the ph increased from 11 54 0 02 13 57 0 02 with increasing temperature from 350 to 750 c but decreased slightly at 850 c 13 41 0 03 these values indicate that the ph of the fwb increases as the pyrolysis temperature increases the increase in ph is related to the formation of alkaline minerals in the biochar ash the fwb pyrolyzed below 750 c may contain more carbonate groups containing alkaline compounds and oxygen 39 40 according to kawamoto et al 41 cellulose and hemicellulose are converted to levoglucosan which produces levoglucosenone 2 3 butanedione and 5 methylfurfural these products belong to oxygen functional groups that increase the ph of the biochar when the pyrolysis temperature exceeded 350 c the alkaline salts generated by pyrolysis were separated from the organic compounds and the ph of the fwb increased to 10 40 42 43 some types of biochar made with food materials tend to increase the ph as the pyrolysis temperature increases the effect of pyrolysis temperature on biochar ph with various organic materials is shown in table 3 ding 43 indicated that the ph value is correlated with the pyrolysis temperature which may influence the formation of alkalis in addition the ash ratio in the final product increased as the pyrolysis temperature increased resulting in a higher ph 39 this can be confirmed from the results of the biochar yield corresponding to the temperature fig s1 3 1 2 effect of pyrolysis time and heating rate the effect of pyrolysis time on ph was evaluated fig 1 b the ph at 2 4 6 and 8 h were similar however the result at 1 h was smaller than the other pyrolysis times this means that if the pyrolysis time is longer than a certain time the ph of the fwb has a constant value thus the pyrolysis time has an insignificant effect on the ph of the fwb compared to the pyrolysis temperature 51 the influence of the heating rate on the ph of the fwb was also tested fig 1 c the ph values were 13 3 13 7 and 13 4 at heating rates of 5 10 and 20 c min respectively however the values did not differ significantly even though the heating rate was significantly correlated with biochar ph according to a previous linear model study on biochar properties 52 3 2 characterization of food waste based biochar fwb to estimate the functional group and composition ftir and xrd of fwb pyrolyzed at 150 450 and 750 c 6 h 10 c min were analyzed as shown in the ftir spectra fig 2 the peaks at 875 cm 1 1030 cm 1 and 1410 cm 1 were assigned to calcium oxide cao whereas the peak at 2850 cm 1 was attributed to calcium carbonate caco3 53 the ph difference between biochars exposed to different pyrolysis temperature was determined based on the crystal structure generated at a specific temperature as the pyrolysis temperature increased the number of cao peaks increased thus the fwb produced at lower temperatures had a lower ph value with fewer peaks the xrd peaks of fwb produced at 150 450 and 750 c also support the ft ir results fig 3 the peaks indicated calcium oxide jcpds 48 1467 at 31 54 35 96 and 53 82 calcium carbonate jcpds 05 0586 at 23 08 29 48 35 96 39 42 47 62 and 48 54 potassium oxide

increased in the xrd pattern of the 750 c biochar the peaks of calcium carbonate prominently increased and patterns of calcium oxide and potassium dioxide emerged these alkaline compounds dissolve in solution and increase the solution ph 40 57 the surface morphology of the fwbs were measured via fesem fig s2 as shown in the fesem images the pores on fwbs surface increased as the pyrolysis temperature increased from 150 to 750 c which was in good agreement with the specific surface area and pore volume analysis results table s1 based on the bet analyses the specific surface area of fwb pyrolyzed at 150 c was negligible but increased to 4 85 m2 g for fwb pyrolyzed at 450 c and to 62 69 m2 g for fwb pyrolyzed at 750 c the total pore volume of fwbs also increased to 0 036 and 0 053 cm3 g as the pyrolysis temperature increased to 450 and 750 c the chemical composition of the fwb generated at 750 c was also determined by xrf table 4 calcium oxide 58 48 accounted for more than half of the mass percent followed by phosphorus pentoxide 10 66 and potassium oxide 9 65 these xrf data also support that the ph of biochar can be alkaline eds mapping confirmed that these elements were uniformly distributed over the fwb surface fig s3 in addition the tg curve of the fwb pyrolyzed at 750 c were obtained with a heating rate of 10 c min fig s4 moisture m ash a and volatile matter vm content were obtained from the tg curve for proximity analysis table s2 here m and a are the observed mass loss at 105 c and 600 c respectively under air flow and vm is considered as the mass loss

nitrogen flows carbon c hydrogen h oxygen o and proximate analysis fixed carbon fcpa contents can be estimated using eqs 1 4 58 thus fwb consisted of 19 16 c 1 79 h and 11 54 o and fcpa was 20 52 1 c

investigated with increasing doses of fwb fig 4 a the residual copper concentration decreased as the dose of fwb increased and the water quality standard of copper 1 0 mg l was satisfied with a 0 4 g l dose 0 15 0 05 mg l pac 20 mg l without fwb was not practical for copper coagulation the enhanced copper coagulation by fwb addition could be due to the nucleation of copper precipitates with increasing ph and their adsorption onto the fwb reaction time is another important factor that affects the coagulation process the residual copper concentration drastically decreased to the equilibrium concentration within 3 min and was maintained fig 4 b thus the enhanced copper coagulation combining pac with fwb could be completed within a few minutes the deconvoluted spectra of fwb and fwb after cu coagulation are presented in fig 5 the 3 peaks at c1s originated from c c c o and c o at 284 6 285 4 and 288 5 ev do not appear to have changed much after the cu coagulation while similar peaks from other studies in biochar xps results 59 62 o1s of fwb was also deconvoluted into c o c o c at 531 2 and 532 3 ev 63 after cu coagulation the o1s peak was shifted to left apparently due to the coagulation of pac onto the fwb surface at 533 4 and 532 3 ev for h2o and al oh 3 64 it is known that the al oh 3 flocs are formed when using pac as a coagulant 65 therefore peaks from al oh 3 are observed at o1s the peak of al2p after copper coagulation was also observed which is seen as an amorphous aluminum hydroxide 64 the peaks at 933 6 and 934 8 ev of cu2p3 2 after copper coagulation was also detected where copper is seen in the form of cuo and cu oh 2 66 these results are attributed to copper deposited in the form of cu oh 2 being converted to cuo during the drying process 3 4 comparative study with other coagulant aids 3 4 1 copper coagulation with bentonite and sodium carbonate bentonite and sodium carbonate were also used as coagulant aids to compare the effect of contaminant removal so as to clarify the role of fwb in coagulation using pac experiments were conducted using 0 4 g l dose of bentonite and sodium carbonate respectively instead of fwb and the other experimental conditions were the same of these sodium carbonate also known as soda ash is a white powder and is particularly useful to control solution ph of low alkalinity water because it can provide both hydroxide and bicarbonate alkalinity 67 it was effective in aiding copper coagulation fig 6 a this is because the ph of the solution increases with the addition of sodium carbonate 10 90 0 05 and the dissolved carbonate ions are rapidly trapped by copper to form precipitated nuclei of copper hydroxide and copper carbonate and coagulation proceeds preferentially 68 69 bentonite is a clay mineral particle with two sheets of silica tetrahedron and one sheet of aluminum octahedron the basal surface has a permanent negative charge and the edge surface has a ph dependent charge 70 in our experimental conditions bentonite reduced the ph of the solution 4 14 0 06 and the copper removal by bentonite addition was negligible fig 6 a 3 4 2 comparison of organic dye removal meanwhile the use of bentonite an eco friendly natural clay as a coagulant aid has been known to greatly improve the sedimentation properties without altering the ph of wastewater 71 bentonite can even provide nuclei to accelerate the coagulation process in low turbidity water as well as adsorb hydrophobic organic matter such as organic dyes methylene blue mb was used as a model dye to facilitate comparison and more than 62 of mb could be removed through physicochemical adsorption with bentonite fig 6 b 72 74 interestingly 5 μm mb was completely removed with the same amount of fwb indicating that fwb could enhance heavy metal coagulation and simultaneously remove significant amounts of organic matter from wastewater previous studies have shown that the main mechanism for mb removal by biochars derived from different waste materials was electrostatic interactions 75 76 however although sodium carbonate is known as an auxiliary coagulant that influence the behavior of coagulant by imparting alkalinity to the textile wastewater 77 78 the removal of mb by the addition of sodium carbonate was negligible fig 6 b 3 4 3 produced sludge dewaterability the dewaterability of sludge produced from various coagulant aids was compared by the weight change in a desiccator fig 6 c compared to bentonite and sodium carbonate the weight of sludge produced from fwb decreased more rapidly and approximately half of the weight was removed during 60 min this is because fwb forms rigid lattice structures as skeleton builders which allow moisture to permeate easily and enhance sludge dewaterability 79 similar enhancement of sludge dewaterability have been also reported when using sludge based biochar 80 81 given these results and considering copper coagulation efficiency organic matter removal and sludge handling fwb is a better coagulation aid for wastewater treatment 3 5 adsorption kinetics and isotherm to investigate adsorption kinetics of copper and mb pseudo first eq 5 and pseudo second models eq 6 were used with kinetic experiment results 5 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 6 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where qe and qt are the adsorption capacity mg g at equilibrium and certain time t respectively k1 is pseudo first order rate constant min and k2 is pseudo second order rate constant g mg min the adsorption kinetic modeling of copper and mb are shown in fig s5 the pseudo first and pseudo second order rate and correlation coefficients are presented in table s3 the correlation coefficients indicate that the pseudo second model well described the copper and mb adsorption on fwb this indicates that chemisorption is involved in the adsorption of copper and mb to fwb 5 the qe of pseudo second order model for copper and mb was 128 65 mg g and 21 39 mg g respectively the isotherm of mb adsorption was estimated by fitting the langmuir eq 7 and freundlich eq 8 models fig s6 7 q e q 0 k l c e 1 k l c e 8 q e k f c e 1 n where ce is the equilibrium concentration mg l q0 is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g kl is a langmuir constant that related to adsorption capacity mg g kf is a freundlich constant and n is the adsorption intensity the isotherm modeling parameter and correlation coefficients are presented in table s4 mb adsorption process was well fitted to langmuir isotherm model suggesting that mb adsorption onto fwb occurred by a homogeneous monolayer adsorption process 35 the maximum adsorption capacity of mb on fwb calculated from langmuir isotherm was 55 59 mg g 3 6 industrial plating wastewater treatment the applicability of fwb for metal removal from industrial plating wastewater was also evaluated fig 7 the residual copper concentration decreased from 2 64 0 09 to 0 05 0 01 mg l as the fwb dose increased from 0 0 1 0 g l fig 7 a the copper concentration was marginally lower than the water quality standard 1 mg l with 0 6 g l of fwb dose which means more fwb is required to remove copper from industrial plating wastewater compared to copper solution prepared with distilled water fig 4 a this is because the various components present in the wastewater compete with the active sites on the fwb surface interfering with copper removal 82 the concentration of chromium decreased rapidly with increasing fwb dose even though it was contained in high concentrations 13 23 0 19 mg l in the industrial plating wastewater fig 7 b the chromium water quality standard 0 5 mg l was satisfied with a 1 0 g l fwb dose 0 17 0 09 mg l the superior removal of chromium is because the higher the valency the more effective the coagulation action according to the schultz hardy rule trivalent ions are over ten times more effective than divalent ions 83 in contrast the removal of nickel was significantly lower than that of other heavy metals and similar results have been reported in several studies 1 84 the lower affinity of nickel for fwb could be due to the higher hydrolysis constants of nickel pk 9 9 compared to copper pk 7 7 85 approximately 56 of nickel could be removed with a 1 0 g l fwb dose the concentration of calcium increased with increasing fwb dose and reached an equilibrium of approximately 63 mg l for fwb doses above 0 6 g l meanwhile the effluent solution ph after treatment with fwb and pac increased from 3 48 0 06 6 93 0 03 as the fwb dose increased fig 8 a in particular heavy metal removal by fwb was significantly different from heavy metal precipitation according to solution ph simulated using visual minteq 3 1 software fig 8 b reionization of the heavy metals in relation to the ph increase was not observed 3 7 recommendation for future works the enormous amount of food waste from various sources is an environmental burden if disposed of improperly therefore producing value added products while reducing the amount of waste through thermochemical conversion can be an ideal option for food waste 34 among thermochemical conversion technologies pyrolysis appears to be the most attractive due to its low pollutant emissions and diverse products formation recently pyrolysis using microwaves has attracted attention to overcome the problem of poor heat transfer due to non selective heating of the existing pyrolysis in microwave pyrolysis heat transfer is more efficient because heat is generated within the core of the material by the interaction of microwaves and biomass according to existing studies microwave pyrolysis of biomass produces biochar as its main product which can be widely used in pollution control catalysis and energy storage fields 86 liew et al 87 used microwave pyrolysis to produce biochar from palm kernel shell which have a high heating value 23 26 mj kg and zero sulfur content that is almost similar to conventional coal su et al 88 reported that microwave pyrolysis biochar which has micropores and high specific surface area is suitable for use as a biological carrier for growing nitrifying bacteria for water treatment therefore it is expected to be able to efficiently convert food waste into engineered biochar by utilizing the rapid heat transfer of microwave pyrolysis 4 conclusion food waste based biochar fwb as a coagulant aid was successfully prepared under various pyrolysis conditions fwb prepared at higher temperature more effectively enhanced the solution ph which was derived from different compositions of fwb according to the pyrolysis temperature the alkaline compounds contained in fwb increased with temperature resulting in a solution ph of 13 57 0 02 by adding fwb 1 5 w v pyrolyzed at 750 c at a heating rate of 10 c min for 6 h copper coagulation was enhanced by the addition of fwb which depicts the preferred use of fwb as a coagulant aid in combination with pac moreover the addition of fwb improved sludge dewaterability and organic dye removal it is also applicable to the treatment of industrial plating wastewater containing various heavy metals at different concentrations these results demonstrate the potential use of fwb as a promising coagulant aid for wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements this work was supported by the national

13577,food waste fw treatment via pyrolysis can be a promising method to reduce the amount of fw and produce value added products such as biochar in this study fw was converted to food waste based biochar fwb as a coagulant aid for wastewater treatment the solution ph increasing ability of fwb prepared at different pyrolysis temperatures 350 450 550 650 750 and 850 c pyrolysis time 1 2 4 6 and 8 h and heating rates 5 10 and 20 c min were compared by mixing biochar and deionized water 1 5 w v for 30 min and their physicochemical properties were characterized by ftir xrd and xrf analyses the optimum pyrolysis conditions for fwb to increase the solution ph were 750 c 10 c min and 6 h copper coagulation was significantly enhanced as the fwb dose increased along with polyaluminum chloride pac moreover the addition of fwb as a coagulation aid improved sludge dewaterability and organic dye removal furthermore the combination of fwb and pac could also be used to treat industrial plating wastewater containing various heavy metals at different concentrations which makes fwb a promising coagulation aid keywords food waste biochar pyrolysis conditions coagulant aid wastewater treatment 1 introduction heavy metals are released into the water worldwide through a variety of activities such as military industrial agricultural and waste disposal industrial plating wastewater is also a major source of various types of harmful heavy metals e g copper chromium nickel zinc etc at high concentrations of up to several hundred mg l 1 these heavy metals are considered persistent bioaccumulating toxic and pose a serious threat to aquatic life and humans therefore the removal of heavy metals has attracted considerable interest 2 consequently various treatment technologies have been developed to remove heavy metals from wastewater such as coagulation 3 adsorption 4 ion exchange 5 electrodialysis 6 and membrane separation 7 coagulation a physicochemical process that enhances the settleability of suspended particulate matter by the addition of chemical or biological agents is the most economical effective and conventional process for removing various contaminants including metal ions in wastewater treatment 8 iron and aluminum based coagulants have been commonly used in the coagulation process and polyaluminum chloride pac has been found to be superior in removing particulates and or organic matter in some water and wastewater conditions 9 10 however despite the advantages e g short retention times and low capital costs many disadvantages have been reported such as high chemical costs for precipitation and ph adjustment substantial sludge production due to overdose and problems associated with dewatering and disposal of produced sludge 11 12 to overcome the inherent shortcomings associated with the use of these conventional coagulants recent research continues to increasingly focus on the development of effective coagulants and coagulant aids several coagulant aids used with pac to improve the removal efficiency of various contaminants are presented in table 1 on the other hand adsorption on activated carbon has been known to be a suitable alternative for wastewater treatment and many studies have been conducted on a hybrid process of an integrated coagulation adsorption system 27 28 zhang et al 29 used powdered activated carbon ballasted coagulation for enhanced removal of bio refractory dissolved organic matter from cassava distillery wastewater lopez et al 30 reported the effect of dosing sequence on the removal of the persistent pesticide metaldehyde using powdered activated carbon with coagulation in addition superior adsorption performance of biochar compared to activated carbon has been reported suggesting the use of biochar as a cost effective adsorbent 31 enhanced removal of organics by combined coagulation adsorption system with biochar has also been reported 32 33 meanwhile significant amounts of food waste fw approximately 1 3 billion tons per year according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao are produced globally in various sectors such as agricultural products households and restaurant residual waste 34 these are generally watery and contain protein rich organic material which can easily rot under ambient conditions causing odor and leachate problems which is a serious concern in many countries 35 among the disposal methods of fw landfill and animal feeding have recently been banned in many countries and composting is limited by the reaction time and additional transportation costs post composting although anaerobic digestion of fw has received much attention for the production of biogas it requires high initial costs and is difficult to operate 36 the most widely used thermal treatment process for various wastes can also be an option for fw treatment as it can ultimately reduce the amount of fw and produce value added products such as biochar xue et al 37 reported that biochars made from various food wastes can function as valuable adsorbents for the removal of ammonia nitrogen from aqueous solutions chu et al 38 showed the catalytic activity of magnetic biochar derived from food waste in a heterogeneous sono fenton like process for the removal of organic dyes from aqueous solutions however the application of food waste based biochar fwb as a coagulant aid has not been reported therefore in this study various pyrolysis conditions for the conversion of fw to biochar as a coagulant aid were evaluated by comparing the solution ph rising ability and the developed fwb was applied to copper removal along with pac the copper and dye removal efficiencies of fwb and the produced sludge dewaterability were compared with those of other coagulant aids heavy metal removal in industrial plating wastewater was also evaluated using pac along with fwb as a coagulant aid 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals

a211 thermo fisher scientific usa and the heavy metal composition was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes optima 8300 perkin elmer usa 2 2 food waste based biochar fwb production to prepare the fwb 25 g of fw was pyrolyzed at 350 450 550 650 750 and 850 c using a muffle furnace fhx 03 daihan scientific seoul korea at a heating rate of 10 c min for 6 h then the pyrolyzed fwb was ground using a mortar and pestle the ph of the fwb was measured with a ph meter orion star a211 thermo scientific orion seoul korea in a 1 5 w v mixture of biochar and deionized water for 30 min to investigate the effect of pyrolysis time on the ph of fwb fw was heated for 1 2 4 6 and 8 h at 750 c with a heating rate of 10 c min the effect of the heating rate was also evaluated by heating for 6 h after reaching 750 c with a heating rate of 5 10 and 20 c min 2 3 characteristics of fwb the fwb composition was measured using x ray fluorescence xrf zsx primus rigaku japan the surface functional groups of the fwb were measured using fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflectance ftir atr spectroscopy nicolet is50 thermo massachusetts usa with a mid infrared 4000 400 cm 1 source the crystalline structure of fwb was investigated by scanning the biochar with an x ray powder diffractometer xrd d max 2500 v pc rigaku japan covering a two theta range of 2 0 to 90 0 at a step of 0 02 a surface area analyzer asap2420 micromeritics usa was used for surface analysis the measurements were performed at 195 85 c using nitrogen gas surface morphology and elemental mapping were observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope energy dispersive spectrometer fe sem eds jsm 6700 f jeol japan the thermogravimetric tg analysis was conducted by simultaneous thermal analyser mass spectrometer sta 409 pc qms 403 c netzsch german xps was also performed to confirm the characteristics of fwb and the fwb after cu coagulation using a k alpha thermo fisher scientific united kingdom with al kα radiation hv 1253 6 ev the binding energies for the high resolution spectra were calibrated by setting c1s at 284 6 ev 2 4 coagulation experiments for the coagulation experiments the copper concentration in the solution was fixed at 3 mg l the dose tests were conducted with fwb doses of 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 g l after 5 min of reaction pac was added and the mixture was stirred for 5 min then the solution was settled for 30 min and filtered using a vacuum pump with a glass microfiber gf c filter the residual copper concentration of the filtrate was measured using icp oes the effect of reaction time was investigated for 3 5 7 9 and 11 min with an fwb dose of 0 6 g l the removal of copper and organic dyes with other coagulant aids such as sodium carbonate and bentonite were compared in the same process mb was used as a model dye and the concentration of mb was determined with a uv vis spectrophotometer at 665 nm neo s2117 neogen korea the dewaterability of the final products was compared using an analytical balance and desiccator at room temperature for 60 min coagulation experiments were conducted using industrial plating wastewater diluted ten times with deionized water the adsorption kinetics were estimated with copper and mb the concentration of copper and mb in kinetic experiments were 30 mg l and 50 μm respectively and the dose of fwb was fixed with 0 06 g l for isotherm the experiment was conducted with mb the different concentrations of mb 5 200 μm was used with 0 1 g l of fwb the samples were filtered and measured by icp oes and uv vis spectrophotometer all experiments were performed in replicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of pyrolysis conditions on ph 3 1 1 effect of pyrolysis temperature basically the removal of heavy metals from wastewater can be accomplished by precipitation as the hydroxides at evaluated ph thus the effect of the pyrolysis temperature on the fwb ph was investigated fig 1 a the ph increased from 11 54 0 02 13 57 0 02 with increasing temperature from 350 to 750 c but decreased slightly at 850 c 13 41 0 03 these values indicate that the ph of the fwb increases as the pyrolysis temperature increases the increase in ph is related to the formation of alkaline minerals in the biochar ash the fwb pyrolyzed below 750 c may contain more carbonate groups containing alkaline compounds and oxygen 39 40 according to kawamoto et al 41 cellulose and hemicellulose are converted to levoglucosan which produces levoglucosenone 2 3 butanedione and 5 methylfurfural these products belong to oxygen functional groups that increase the ph of the biochar when the pyrolysis temperature exceeded 350 c the alkaline salts generated by pyrolysis were separated from the organic compounds and the ph of the fwb increased to 10 40 42 43 some types of biochar made with food materials tend to increase the ph as the pyrolysis temperature increases the effect of pyrolysis temperature on biochar ph with various organic materials is shown in table 3 ding 43 indicated that the ph value is correlated with the pyrolysis temperature which may influence the formation of alkalis in addition the ash ratio in the final product increased as the pyrolysis temperature increased resulting in a higher ph 39 this can be confirmed from the results of the biochar yield corresponding to the temperature fig s1 3 1 2 effect of pyrolysis time and heating rate the effect of pyrolysis time on ph was evaluated fig 1 b the ph at 2 4 6 and 8 h were similar however the result at 1 h was smaller than the other pyrolysis times this means that if the pyrolysis time is longer than a certain time the ph of the fwb has a constant value thus the pyrolysis time has an insignificant effect on the ph of the fwb compared to the pyrolysis temperature 51 the influence of the heating rate on the ph of the fwb was also tested fig 1 c the ph values were 13 3 13 7 and 13 4 at heating rates of 5 10 and 20 c min respectively however the values did not differ significantly even though the heating rate was significantly correlated with biochar ph according to a previous linear model study on biochar properties 52 3 2 characterization of food waste based biochar fwb to estimate the functional group and composition ftir and xrd of fwb pyrolyzed at 150 450 and 750 c 6 h 10 c min were analyzed as shown in the ftir spectra fig 2 the peaks at 875 cm 1 1030 cm 1 and 1410 cm 1 were assigned to calcium oxide cao whereas the peak at 2850 cm 1 was attributed to calcium carbonate caco3 53 the ph difference between biochars exposed to different pyrolysis temperature was determined based on the crystal structure generated at a specific temperature as the pyrolysis temperature increased the number of cao peaks increased thus the fwb produced at lower temperatures had a lower ph value with fewer peaks the xrd peaks of fwb produced at 150 450 and 750 c also support the ft ir results fig 3 the peaks indicated calcium oxide jcpds 48 1467 at 31 54 35 96 and 53 82 calcium carbonate jcpds 05 0586 at 23 08 29 48 35 96 39 42 47 62 and 48 54 potassium oxide

increased in the xrd pattern of the 750 c biochar the peaks of calcium carbonate prominently increased and patterns of calcium oxide and potassium dioxide emerged these alkaline compounds dissolve in solution and increase the solution ph 40 57 the surface morphology of the fwbs were measured via fesem fig s2 as shown in the fesem images the pores on fwbs surface increased as the pyrolysis temperature increased from 150 to 750 c which was in good agreement with the specific surface area and pore volume analysis results table s1 based on the bet analyses the specific surface area of fwb pyrolyzed at 150 c was negligible but increased to 4 85 m2 g for fwb pyrolyzed at 450 c and to 62 69 m2 g for fwb pyrolyzed at 750 c the total pore volume of fwbs also increased to 0 036 and 0 053 cm3 g as the pyrolysis temperature increased to 450 and 750 c the chemical composition of the fwb generated at 750 c was also determined by xrf table 4 calcium oxide 58 48 accounted for more than half of the mass percent followed by phosphorus pentoxide 10 66 and potassium oxide 9 65 these xrf data also support that the ph of biochar can be alkaline eds mapping confirmed that these elements were uniformly distributed over the fwb surface fig s3 in addition the tg curve of the fwb pyrolyzed at 750 c were obtained with a heating rate of 10 c min fig s4 moisture m ash a and volatile matter vm content were obtained from the tg curve for proximity analysis table s2 here m and a are the observed mass loss at 105 c and 600 c respectively under air flow and vm is considered as the mass loss between 105 and 600 c in tg curves obtained under nitrogen flow the experimental fixed carbon fc is determined as the mass difference in the mass loss between 105 and 600 c under air and under nitrogen flows carbon c hydrogen h oxygen o and proximate analysis fixed carbon fcpa contents can be estimated using eqs 1 4 58 thus fwb consisted of 19 16 c 1 79 h and 11 54 o and fcpa was 20 52 1 c

investigated with increasing doses of fwb fig 4 a the residual copper concentration decreased as the dose of fwb increased and the water quality standard of copper 1 0 mg l was satisfied with a 0 4 g l dose 0 15 0 05 mg l pac 20 mg l without fwb was not practical for copper coagulation the enhanced copper coagulation by fwb addition could be due to the nucleation of copper precipitates with increasing ph and their adsorption onto the fwb reaction time is another important factor that affects the coagulation process the residual copper concentration drastically decreased to the equilibrium concentration within 3 min and was maintained fig 4 b thus the enhanced copper coagulation combining pac with fwb could be completed within a few minutes the deconvoluted spectra of fwb and fwb after cu coagulation are presented in fig 5 the 3 peaks at c1s originated from c c c o and c o at 284 6 285 4 and 288 5 ev do not appear to have changed much after the cu coagulation while similar peaks from other studies in biochar xps results 59 62 o1s of fwb was also deconvoluted into c o c o c at 531 2 and 532 3 ev 63 after cu coagulation the o1s peak was shifted to left apparently due to the coagulation of pac onto the fwb surface at 533 4 and 532 3 ev for h2o and al oh 3 64 it is known that the al oh 3 flocs are formed when using pac as a coagulant 65 therefore peaks from al oh 3 are observed at o1s the peak of al2p after copper coagulation was also observed which is seen as an amorphous aluminum hydroxide 64 the peaks at 933 6 and 934 8 ev of cu2p3 2 after copper coagulation was also detected where copper is seen in the form of cuo and cu oh 2 66 these results are attributed to copper deposited in the form of cu oh 2 being converted to cuo during the drying process 3 4 comparative study with other coagulant aids 3 4 1 copper coagulation with bentonite and sodium carbonate bentonite and sodium carbonate were also used as coagulant aids to compare the effect of contaminant removal so as to clarify the role of fwb in coagulation using pac experiments were conducted using 0 4 g l dose of bentonite and sodium carbonate respectively instead of fwb and the other experimental conditions were the same of these sodium carbonate also known as soda ash is a white powder and is particularly useful to control solution ph of low alkalinity water because it can provide both hydroxide and bicarbonate alkalinity 67 it was effective in aiding copper coagulation fig 6 a this is because the ph of the solution increases with the addition of sodium carbonate 10 90 0 05 and the dissolved carbonate ions are rapidly trapped by copper to form precipitated nuclei of copper hydroxide and copper carbonate and coagulation proceeds preferentially 68 69 bentonite is a clay mineral particle with two sheets of silica tetrahedron and one sheet of aluminum octahedron the basal surface has a permanent negative charge and the edge surface has a ph dependent charge 70 in our experimental conditions bentonite reduced the ph of the solution 4 14 0 06 and the copper removal by bentonite addition was negligible fig 6 a 3 4 2 comparison of organic dye removal meanwhile the use of bentonite an eco friendly natural clay as a coagulant aid has been known to greatly improve the sedimentation properties without altering the ph of wastewater 71 bentonite can even provide nuclei to accelerate the coagulation process in low turbidity water as well as adsorb hydrophobic organic matter such as organic dyes methylene blue mb was used as a model dye to facilitate comparison and more than 62 of mb could be removed through physicochemical adsorption with bentonite fig 6 b 72 74 interestingly 5 μm mb was completely removed with the same amount of fwb indicating that fwb could enhance heavy metal coagulation and simultaneously remove significant amounts of organic matter from wastewater previous studies have shown that the main mechanism for mb removal by biochars derived from different waste materials was electrostatic interactions 75 76 however although sodium carbonate is known as an auxiliary coagulant that influence the behavior of coagulant by imparting alkalinity to the textile wastewater 77 78 the removal of mb by the addition of sodium carbonate was negligible fig 6 b 3 4 3 produced sludge dewaterability the dewaterability of sludge produced from various coagulant aids was compared by the weight change in a desiccator fig 6 c compared to bentonite and sodium carbonate the weight of sludge produced from fwb decreased more rapidly and approximately half of the weight was removed during 60 min this is because fwb forms rigid lattice structures as skeleton builders which allow moisture to permeate easily and enhance sludge dewaterability 79 similar enhancement of sludge dewaterability have been also reported when using sludge based biochar 80 81 given these results and considering copper coagulation efficiency organic matter removal and sludge handling fwb is a better coagulation aid for wastewater treatment 3 5 adsorption kinetics and isotherm to investigate adsorption kinetics of copper and mb pseudo first eq 5 and pseudo second models eq 6 were used with kinetic experiment results 5 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 6 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where qe and qt are the adsorption capacity mg g at equilibrium and certain time t respectively k1 is pseudo first order rate constant min and k2 is pseudo second order rate constant g mg min the adsorption kinetic modeling of copper and mb are shown in fig s5 the pseudo first and pseudo second order rate and correlation coefficients are presented in table s3 the correlation coefficients indicate that the pseudo second model well described the copper and mb adsorption on fwb this indicates that chemisorption is involved in the adsorption of copper and mb to fwb 5 the qe of pseudo second order model for copper and mb was 128 65 mg g and 21 39 mg g respectively the isotherm of mb adsorption was estimated by fitting the langmuir eq 7 and freundlich eq 8 models fig s6 7 q e q 0 k l c e 1 k l c e 8 q e k f c e 1 n where ce is the equilibrium concentration mg l q0 is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g kl is a langmuir constant that related to adsorption capacity mg g kf is a freundlich constant and n is the adsorption intensity the isotherm modeling parameter and correlation coefficients are presented in table s4 mb adsorption process was well fitted to langmuir isotherm model suggesting that mb adsorption onto fwb occurred by a homogeneous monolayer adsorption process 35 the maximum adsorption capacity of mb on fwb calculated from langmuir isotherm was 55 59 mg g 3 6 industrial plating wastewater treatment the applicability of fwb for metal removal from industrial plating wastewater was also evaluated fig 7 the residual copper concentration decreased from 2 64 0 09 to 0 05 0 01 mg l as the fwb dose increased from 0 0 1 0 g l fig 7 a the copper concentration was marginally lower than the water quality standard 1 mg l with 0 6 g l of fwb dose which means more fwb is required to remove copper from industrial plating wastewater compared to copper solution prepared with distilled water fig 4 a this is because the various components present in the wastewater compete with the active sites on the fwb surface interfering with copper removal 82 the concentration of chromium decreased rapidly with increasing fwb dose even though it was contained in high concentrations 13 23 0 19 mg l in the industrial plating wastewater fig 7 b the chromium water quality standard 0 5 mg l was satisfied with a 1 0 g l fwb dose 0 17 0 09 mg l the superior removal of chromium is because the higher the valency the more effective the coagulation action according to the schultz hardy rule trivalent ions are over ten times more effective than divalent ions 83 in contrast the removal of nickel was significantly lower than that of other heavy metals and similar results have been reported in several studies 1 84 the lower affinity of nickel for fwb could be due to the higher hydrolysis constants of nickel pk 9 9 compared to copper pk 7 7 85 approximately 56 of nickel could be removed with a 1 0 g l fwb dose the concentration of calcium increased with increasing fwb dose and reached an equilibrium of approximately 63 mg l for fwb doses above 0 6 g l meanwhile the effluent solution ph after treatment with fwb and pac increased from 3 48 0 06 6 93 0 03 as the fwb dose increased fig 8 a in particular heavy metal removal by fwb was significantly different from heavy metal precipitation according to solution ph simulated using visual minteq 3 1 software fig 8 b reionization of the heavy metals in relation to the ph increase was not observed 3 7 recommendation for future works the enormous amount of food waste from various sources is an environmental burden if disposed of improperly therefore producing value added products while reducing the amount of waste through thermochemical conversion can be an ideal option for food waste 34 among thermochemical conversion technologies pyrolysis appears to be the most attractive due to its low pollutant emissions and diverse products formation recently pyrolysis using microwaves has attracted attention to overcome the problem of poor heat transfer due to non selective heating of the existing pyrolysis in microwave pyrolysis heat transfer is more efficient because heat is generated within the core of the material by the interaction of microwaves and biomass according to existing studies microwave pyrolysis of biomass produces biochar as its main product which can be widely used in pollution control catalysis and energy storage fields 86 liew et al 87 used microwave pyrolysis to produce biochar from palm kernel shell which have a high heating value 23 26 mj kg and zero sulfur content that is almost similar to conventional coal su et al 88 reported that microwave pyrolysis biochar which has micropores and high specific surface area is suitable for use as a biological carrier for growing nitrifying bacteria for water treatment therefore it is expected to be able to efficiently convert food waste into engineered biochar by utilizing the rapid heat transfer of microwave pyrolysis 4 conclusion food waste based biochar fwb as a coagulant aid was successfully prepared under various pyrolysis conditions fwb prepared at higher temperature more effectively enhanced the solution ph which was derived from different compositions of fwb according to the pyrolysis temperature the alkaline compounds contained in fwb increased with temperature resulting in a solution ph of 13 57 0 02 by adding fwb 1 5 w v pyrolyzed at 750 c at a heating rate of 10 c min for 6 h copper coagulation was enhanced by the addition of fwb which depicts the preferred use of fwb as a coagulant aid in combination with pac moreover the addition of fwb improved sludge dewaterability and organic dye removal it is also applicable to the treatment of industrial plating wastewater containing various heavy metals at different concentrations these results demonstrate the potential use of fwb as a promising coagulant aid for wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements this work was supported by the national

13578,magnetic cuo fe3o4 biochar cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles were successfully synthesized by two steps of coprecipitation and calcination and were characterized as a heterogeneous catalyst to activate peroxymonosulfate for bisphenol a bpa degradation the reaction process and mechanism of heterogeneous catalyst adsorption and synergistic catalytic oxidation for the removal of bpa in cuo fe3o4 bc pms system were extensively evaluated in view of the practical applications results indicated that the addition of cuo achieved a high removal efficiency of bpa in a wide ph range bpa removal efficiency reached 100 in 30 min by using 2 0 g l cuo fe3o4 bc and 5 mm pms at a ph of 9 0 and so4 played an essential role in the degradation process the synergistic effect of copper ions and iron ions accelerated the circulation of fe ii fe iii and cu i cu ii which improved the electron transfer on the catalyst surface and increased the free radical generation rate cuo fe3o4 and bc achieved a synergistic effect between adsorption and catalysis the stability and reusability of cuo fe3o4 bc pms system offer an approach in organic pollutant wastewater treatment since it has great advantages of high removal efficiency conducting under neutral conditions energy saving and avoiding the common issues in traditional fenton reactions keywords bisphenol a cuo fe3o4 bc peroxymonosulfate sulfate radicals heterogeneous aops 1 introduction bisphenol a 2 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bpa one of the industrial raw materials has been widely used in manufacturing processes such as polycarbonate epoxy resin and flame retardant 1 however due to its potential impact on high toxicity human health and recalcitrant nature bpa is also regarded as a concerned organic contaminant especially in industrial wastewater 2 advanced oxidation processes aops are reported to be a desirable technology for the degradation of bpa since aops are based on reactive oxygen species and utilize a variety of highly oxidizing active radicals 3 moreover compared with homogeneous aops heterogeneous aops which hold higher degradation efficiency are more effective and economical in bpa degradation process 4 5 recently sulfate radicals so4 based heterogeneous aops showed strong oxidation performance for treating organic pollutants such as bpa 6 comparing with hydroxyl radicals oh so4 hold more stable and higher redox potential 7 techniques such as ultraviolet uv irradiation heat 8 and transition metals 9 10 were used to activate persulfate ps or peroxymonosulfate pms for so4 generation copper oxide cuo and iron oxide fe3o4 are the most commonly used transition metal oxides in heterogeneous catalyst 11 12 cuo showed higher catalytic activity in heterogeneous aops which could effectively activate ps under neutral conditions 13 cuo pms system was used for phenol degradation which could achieve high catalytic activity at the same time the quenching experiment results revealed that cuo could activate pms to produce both so4 and o h radicals however the reusable of cuo and the copper ions leached were not involved in the study 14 in addition iron base bimetallic nanocomposites were reported to be an effective catalyst toward organic contaminant due to the synergistic effect between bimetals 15 17 the combined cuo fe3o4 nanoparticles could utilize the high catalytic activity of cuo and magnetism of fe3o4 and results showed that the composite nanoparticles demonstrated an excellent catalytic ability to generate so4 radicals 18 however due to its own magnetic effect fe3o4 tends to gather together in the reaction process which reduces the specific surface area of the material covers up the active sites on the surface of the material and weakens the catalytic activity of the catalyst 19 biochar bc which hold huge specific surface area and rich pore structure was proved to be an effective support material and could provide more active positions for metal nanoparticles 20 22 the nano iron nickel bimetallic biochar ni fe bc prepared from wheat straw biochar was reported that bc could inhibit the agglomeration of ni or fe and for prevent metal leaching 23 till now there is limited information on the feasibility and characteristic of cuo fe3o4 bc magnetic composite used to activate pms for organic pollutants degradation in this study magnetic nano cuo fe3o4 bc composite as a heterogeneous catalyst was synthesized by two steps of coprecipitation and calcination for activating pms to generate free radicals subsequently the properties of cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles were explored and the effects of experimental parameters such as initial ph pms concentration and catalyst load on the catalytic activity of cuo fe3o4 bc pms system were investigated additionally the stability and reusability of cuo fe3o4 bc were evaluated based on cycle experiments accordingly the mechanism of cuo fe3o4 bc activating pms to produce free radicals including the reaction process and mechanism of heterogeneous catalyst adsorption and degradation of bpa was systematically determined finally the advantages and implications associated with the development of a cost efficient method for the treatment of organic wastewater were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials bpa khso5 feso4 7h2o cucl2 2h2o h2so4 naoh hcl ch3oh c2h6o c4h10o were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd all the purity specifications of the reagents were analytical pure biochar bc as the protoplast material was produced by pyrolysis of deciduous leaves of platanus orientalis jinan shandong china 2 2 preparation of cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles the cleaned leaves were dried in oven at 80 c for 2 h and crushed into powder the obtained powder was placed in a tubular furnace at 600 c for 2 h under continuous nitrogen gas purging with the nitrogen gas flowrate at 1 l min then the mixture was soaked with 1 m hcl for 24 h to remove the inorganic components and washed with deionized water for several times and the material of bc was achieved after dried in an oven at 80 c for 12 h and the temperature increase rate in the oven was 5 min cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles were developed by means of two step method of coprecipitation and calcination to obtain the ingredient feso4 7h2o and cucl2 2h2o were mixed with a mass of 1 668 g and 0 051 g fe cu molar ratio of 20 in 100 ml of deionized water respectively subsequently 2 g bc prepared above was added to the mixture under the condition of continuous stirring typically 3 m naoh solution was dropwise added to adjust the ph of the ingredient to 10 11 the as resulted mixture was further placed in an autoclave at 80 c for 4 h after the reaction the ingredients were washed with ultrapure water and absolute ethanol to neutrality dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 2 h and final product cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles were obtained to make a comparison cuo nanoparticle was achieved by pyrolysis of cucl2 2h2o at 80 c for 4 h with the same preparation method as cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles fe3o4 nanoparticles were obtained by a one step coprecipitation synthesis method with fe ii fe iii molar ratio of 1 2 using feso4 7h2o and fecl3 6h2o 2 3 catalytic degradation experiment batch experiments were carried out in serum vials the cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles were disseminated in 10 ml of 20 mg l bpa solution the dosage of cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles were 0 5 2 0 g l and pms with the amount of 3 5 mm was added to start the bpa degradation before the degradation the adsorption desorption equilibrium was established for 10 min 24 the initial ph was adjusted with 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh and the serum bottles were placed in a constant temperature shaker with a rotational speed of 200 rpm at 25 c quenching reaction conducted by adding excess ethanol to 1 ml sample which was taken from serum bottles and filtered with a 0 22 μm microporous filter then analyzed in this experiment the influence of various parameters on bpa degradation were investigated including catalyst load 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 mg l pms concentration 3 5 and 7 mm and initial ph 5 7 8 9 10 and 12 the catalyst was separated and recovered by a magnet washed dried and reused under the same experimental conditions the four cycles of adsorption magnetic separation desorption were tested each experiment was done in triplicate and the results were determined in averaged value 2 4 characterization of cuo fe3o4 bc composites x ray powder diffraction xrd bruker d8 diffractometer was used to analyze the crystal structure of samples with a wavelength of 0 15418 nm and a radiation of cu kα the surface morphology and particle size of cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles were figured on a scanning electron microscope sem in addition the chemical structure of the catalyst was characterized through x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi with voltage range of 0 1000 ev at the same time the surface bonding of prepared materials was examined by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir vertex 70 5 5 dimethylpyrroline n oxide dmpo was used as a free radical trapping agent to measure the content of free radicals in the reaction process by electron spin resonance esr the bet was applied to measure the specific surface area pore volume and pore diameter of the composites the test parameters were frequency 100 khz central magnetic field 327 0 mt scanning time 30 s and microwave power 1 mw 2 5 chemical analysis the concentrations of bpa were determined by high performance liquid chromatography system hplc p1201 elite inc china with a wavelength of 278 nm the separation column was set by an amethyst c18 p column 5 μm 4 6 150 mm at 30 c the mobile phase was the mixture volume of 70 30 of methanol and water with influent volume was 25 μl and 1 0 ml min of flow rate 3 results and discussion 3 1 the characterization of cuo fe3o4 bc nanocomposites the morphology and particle size of bc fe3o4 and cuo fe3o4 bc were depicted in figs s1 s3 results showed that bc exhibited spherical shape with particle size about 50 nm fig s1 while in fig s2 most fe3o4 particles were agglomerated together with the magnetic force 25 fig s3 demonstrated that particles of cuo fe3o4 bc have a smaller particle size of about 10 nm the sem images of bc and cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles in fig s4 to s5 furthered confirming that fe3o4 and cuo were in a decentralized form and the nanoparticles were dispersed on the surface of biochar evenly as previous study reported that bc could decentralize metal oxide 26 bc materials hold considerable folds and pores which provide not only a larger specific surface area of the materials but also better conditions for bc to support cuo and fe3o4 particles the xrd pattern of cuo fe3o4 bc at 2θ from 10 to 70 was presented in fig 1 it could be concluded that the peaks were well matched with standard fe3o4 jcpds file no 65 3107 and cuo jcpds file no 45 0937 27 the diffraction peaks at 30 1 35 5 43 2 57 0 and 62 7 corresponded to the 220 311 400 511 440 planes of fe3o4 respectively 25 similarly the diffraction peaks at 38 9 48 7 66 2 and 68 1 matches to 111 202 311 and 220 crystal planes of cuo respectively 25 the results indicated that the prepared materials were compounds of cuo crystals and fe3o4 crystals and the existence of biochar did not destroy the crystal structure of fe3o4 and cuo in addition ft ir spectra of bc and cuo fe3o4 bc were illustrated in fig 2 it was revealed that peaks at 3340 cm 1 and 1685 cm 1 matched with h o and co bonds of bc respectively 28 the peaks on cuo fe3o4 bc at 570 cm 1 was the typical fe o bond in fe3o4 while peaks of 667 cm 1 and 875 cm 1 represent the cu o bond and the expansion vibration of fe oh bond caused the peak of 1340 cm 1 these results indicated that the nano cuo fe3o4 bc composition was successfully prepared with high crystallinity the specific surface area sbet single point adsorption total pore volume vt t plot micropore volume vm and bjh desorption average pore diameter 4 v a dp of bc and nanocomposites were measured table s1 after pyrolysis at 600 the sbet of bc was 56 83 m2 g while the sbet of cuo fe3o4 bc was 78 88 m2 g which indicated that higher specific surface area of cuo fe3o4 bc promoted to the adsorption performance of the catalyst compared with bc and cuo fe3o4 bc the increase in sbet might be due to the loading of cuo and fe3o4 nanoparticles on the surface of bc while the decrease in volume vm might be caused by the development of nanoparticles inside of the bc pores it was reported that the adsorption capacity of the material increased with the increase of specific surface area 29 at the same time as the catalytic reaction is a surface controlled process it was generally believed that the larger the surface area of the catalyst the more active sites on its surface 30 which further increased the possibility of contact and reaction between the catalyst and pollutants 3 2 catalytic properties of cuo fe3o4 bc pms system the degradation efficiencies of bpa under different catalytic systems within 30 min were investigated fig 3 the ph was 9 0 concentrations of bc cuo fe3o4 and cuo fe3o4 bc were 2 0 g l and bpa concentration was 20 mg l pms has no ability to degrade bap with the absence of oxidant since bpa was rarely removed within 30 min simultaneously when only fe3o4 was added in the bpa contained wastewater a little reduction of bpa was achieved via fe3o4 adsorption effect which was consistent with previous study 31 while in the presence of bc alone the removal efficiency of bpa was 13 76 which was mainly due to the adsorption of bc the bpa removal efficiencies in bc pms fe3o4 pms and cuo pms systems were 25 49 27 53 and 47 68 respectively the results above indicated that during the bpa degradation process the active free radicals could be generated via the activation of pms with the addition of bc fe3o4 or cuo in particular bpa removal efficiency reached 74 01 after the addition of fe3o4 nanoparticles to the cuo pms system the increasement of bpa removal efficiency in cuo fe3o4 pms may be caused by the synergistic effect of cuo fe3o4 composite material which achieved a higher catalytic activity notebly in cuo fe3o4 bc pms system bpa removal efficiency was 100 and the removal rate was obviously higher than cuo fe3o4 pms system whithin 30 min these results showed that cuo fe3o4 bc pms system has excellent catalytic activity for bpa degradation one reason was that cuo and fe3o4 nanoparticles could initiate pms to generate active free radicals so4 and o h to achieve a rapid degradation of bpa which was coordinant with previous study 32 ding et al also found that the presentation of cu and fe into cuo and fe3o4 could promote the catalytic capacity of fe3o4 or cuo 33 another reason was that bc was proved to have huge specific surface area which could adsorb pollutant to the catalyst surface and increase the concentration of pollutants on the catalyst surface 34 because of the synergism between cuo fe3o4 and bc cuo and fe3o4 nanoparticles showed strong catalytic effect in pms activation therefore the relative mass transfer rate and the chemical reaction rate of the reactive sites were improved 3 3 effects of reaction parameters in cuo fe3o4 bc pms system the degradation of bpa at various parameters including different initial ph values catalyst load and initial pms concentrations in cuo fe3o4 bc pms system were explored fig 4 as demonstrated in fig 4a different ph values 5 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 10 0 and 12 0 were investigated the removal efficiency of bpa increased from 44 7 to 100 with the initial ph value increased from 5 0 9 0 the complete removal of bpa was achieved at ph of 9 0 within 30 min however a further increase in the ph value accompanied by a gradual decline in the bpa removal efficiency especially when ph was increased to 12 0 the bpa removal efficiency was only 11 18 the results above indicated that cuo fe3o4 bc pms system could achieve high catalytic efficiency in a wide range of ph superior to traditional fenton reaction which must carry out under strong acid conditions ph 2 3 5 35 37 this was mainly due to the influence of ph on the isoelectric point phpzc and catalytic performance of metal oxides it was reported that the ph and phpzc of the solution was related to the surface charge of metal oxides 38 ren et al found that the highest ozone degradation efficiency occurred when the ph of the solution was near the phpzc of the heterogeneous catalyst nife2o4 39 as the phpzc of cuo and fe3o4 was around 10 0 and 7 5 respectively the phpzc of cuo fe3o4 nanoparticles amounted to 9 0 33 in addition as the acidity coefficient pka of pms is 9 4 the form of pms mainly depends on the ph of the wastewater 40 obviously cuo fe3o4 nanocomposites demonstrated positive charge in the ph range of 9 0 at the same time pms existed in the form of hso5 under acidic and neutral 5 5 ph 8 5 conditions while under alkaline conditions 8 5 ph 13 0 it existed as so5 33 when the ph was maintained above 9 0 the surface of cuo fe3o4 nanoparticles was negatively charged which produced repulsive force and the repulsive force of static charge could reduce the chance of interaction between pms and cuo fe3o4 nanoparticles resulting in a decrease of bpa degradation efficiency in contrast when the ph values below 9 0 the surface of cuo fe3o4 nanoparticles was positively charged which promoted the attractive contact between pms and cuo fe3o4 nanoparticles the effect of cuo fe3o4 bc catalyst load 0 5 2 0 g l on bpa removal efficiency was depicted in fig 4b the bpa removal efficiency gradually improved and reached 100 at the concentration of 2 0 g l this mainly because the active sites in the system increased with the increase of catalyst load which in turn improved the contact probability of pollutant molecules with catalyst 41 on the other hand on the surface of the nanoparticles the adsorption capacity of bc could improve the removal efficiency of bpa furtherly fig 4c displayed the influence of different initial pms concentrations on bpa degradation performance in the cuo fe3o4 bc pms system bpa removal efficiency increased from 81 84 to 100 with initial pms concentration improved from 3 to 5 mm however the bpa removal efficiency was declined to 84 23 as initial pms concentration further increased from 5 to 7 mm it was found that the amount of so4 and oh mainly depended on the concentration of pms and excess addition of pms would inhibit the so4 and oh generation eqs 1 3 42 1 o h h s o 5 s o 5 h 2 o 2 o h s o 5 s o 5 o h 3 s o 4 h s o 5 s o 4 2 h s o 5 3 4 stability and reusability of cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles in order to evaluate the stability and reusability of cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles the cuo fe3o4 bc catalyst was reused for bpa degradation at the end of degradation experiment the catalyst was magnetically separated washed alternately with the mixture of ethanol and deionized water and dried in the oven for 2 h with the temperature of 80 for reuse after 4 runs for recycling the bpa degradation efficiency remained above 80 fig 5 a the results demonstrated that cuo fe3o4 bc catalyst hold excellent catalytic stability and reusability meanwhile the bpa degradation efficiency in the first analyse was higher than the fourth experiment which mainly due to the loss of cuo fe3o4 particles from the catalyst surface in addition with the increasing reused run of the catalyst the pollutants adsorbed by bc gradually accumulated which were not washed out during the parsing process 43 the reduction of bc adsorption capacity could decrease the contact between pollutants and catalyst which result in the lower of bpa degradation efficiency in the 4th recycling run in addition metal leaching of the cuo fe3o4 bc pms were investigated in the first cycle of degradation process when the concentration of catalyst was 2 0 g l 0 34 mg l cu ions were detected in 30 min while fe ions were not detected it was reported that high amount of fe ions leaching of catalyst could cause secondary pollution and increase the treatment cost 7 therefore the cuo fe3o4 bc catalyst showed a good stability and make it possible in practical application in fig 6 a cuo fe3o4 bc catalyst exhibited s like magnetization hysteresis loop with a saturation magnetic strength of 75 emu g at room temperature which indicated that the catalyst was superparamagnetic fig 6b demonstrated that under the condition of external magnetic field the synthesized nanoparticles could be easily separated from wastewater and could be reused the superparamagnetic of the catalyst hold great advantages in practical application and could be recovered easily and quickly 3 5 adsorption and activation mechanisms of cuo fe3o4 bc pms system for bpa degradation it was reported that metal based catalyst activation of pms mainly produced four types of active radicals so4 o h peroxysulfate so5 and singlet oxygen 1o2 44 a quenching experiment was carried out to detect the involved radical species in the cuo fe3o4 bc pms system with ethanol etoh and tert butyl alcohol tba as quenching reagents 45 etoh is a commonly used quenching agents for oh k 1 6 7 7 108 m 1s 1 and so4 k 1 2 2 8 107 m 1s 1 while tba was utilized for oh k 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 46 as depicted in fig 7 without the addition of etoh and tba bpa removal efficiency reached 100 in 30 min when tba was added into the system tba pms molar ratio was 1000 1 the bpa removal efficiency was reduced to 48 7 however almost no bpa was degraded when etoh etoh pms molar ratio of 1000 1 was added into the system it could be speculated that in the degradation bpa both oh and so4 were participated in the process and so4 played a dominant role in order to verify the free radical species electron spin resonance esr was used with dmpo as a probe as shown in fig 8 there was no signal peaks demonstrated when single pms added into bpa wastewater while in the cuo fe3o4 bc pms system dmpo x was produced this characteristic peak appeared because of the interaction between dmpo and so4 and o h 47 the results further confirmed that in cuo fe3o4 bc system both so4 and o h were produced which could catalyze the degradation of bpa after the addition of etoh and tba the peak signal intensity of dmpo x was significantly weakened nevertheless the peak intensity in the presence of etoh was significantly lower than that of tba which concluded that in cuo fe3o4 bc pms system so4 was the main active radical species the xps spectra of cuo fe3o4 bc were recorded before and after the degradation experiment fig s6 as illustrated in fig s6a the wide survey scan of xps spectra indicated the existence of c 1s o 1s fe 2p and cu 2p in the catalyst after reaction the elements above rarely changed which revealed that the nanoparticles were stable and reusable in fig s6b the main peaks of fe 2p spectra at 724 6 and 710 7 ev indicated the occurrence of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 of fe3o4 in the nanoparticles respectively 48 meanwhile the peak position at 710 7 and 713 5 ev could be indexed to the fe ii and fe iii 49 for the xps spectra of cu 2p region fig s6c the main peak at binding energy of 934 1 ev is assigned to cu ii 50 and the peaks at 941 3 ev is basically similar to that of dominated cu ii oxide species 51 after degradation the lower binding energy at 933 2 ev demonstrated that cu ii was transferred to cu i as previous study reported 52 xps spectra of c 1s were shown in fig s6d two peaks centered at 285 7 and 288 0 ev could be attributed to the c 1s spectra in c c c o and c o c c o fe respectively meanwhile the activation mechanism of pms by cuo fe3o4 bc catalyst was explored fig 9 in the process cu ii was reduced to cu i with pms reacted with cuo to produce so5 eq 4 and cu i transferred an electron to fe iii and became cu ii due to the oxidation reduction potential of fe iii fe ii 0 77 v was higher than that of cu ii cu i 0 17 v eq 5 53 the copper ions and iron ions accelerated the circulation of cuprous ions and ferrous ions in the reaction system besides some cu i may react with hso5 to be oxidized to cu ii and so4 was released into the solution eq 6 fe ii also reacted with hso5 to form fe iii eq 7 radical of o h also could be produced in the process so4 react with h2o eq 8 54 afterwards because the surface of biochar was rich in oxygen containing functional groups biochar could also activate pms to generate so4 eq 9 and eq 10 55 furthermore the resulting highly oxidizing so4 and o h decomposed the bpa molecule which was the main reason of bpa degradation eq 11 the increase in the electron transfer rate on the catalyst surface improved the generation efficiency of free radicals in the system and the increase in the concentration of active species accelerated the degradation reactions 56 4 c u i i h s

which could improve the bpa degradation efficiency therefore for the cuo fe3o4 bc pms system the synergy between adsorption and catalysis could significantly improve the bpa removal efficiency 3 6

peroxymonosulfate for bisphenol a bpa degradation the reaction process and mechanism of heterogeneous catalyst adsorption and synergistic catalytic oxidation for the removal of bpa in cuo fe3o4 bc pms system were extensively evaluated in view of the practical applications results indicated that the addition of cuo achieved a high removal efficiency of bpa in a wide ph range bpa removal efficiency reached 100 in 30 min by using 2 0 g l cuo fe3o4 bc and 5 mm pms at a ph of 9 0 and so4 played an essential role in the degradation process the synergistic effect of copper ions and iron ions accelerated the circulation of fe ii fe iii and cu i cu ii which improved the electron transfer on the catalyst surface and increased the free radical generation rate cuo fe3o4 and bc achieved a synergistic effect between adsorption and catalysis the stability and reusability of cuo fe3o4 bc pms system offer an approach in organic pollutant wastewater treatment since it has great advantages of high removal efficiency conducting under neutral conditions energy saving and avoiding the common issues in traditional fenton reactions keywords bisphenol a cuo fe3o4 bc peroxymonosulfate sulfate radicals heterogeneous aops 1 introduction bisphenol a 2 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bpa one of the industrial raw materials has been widely used in manufacturing processes such as polycarbonate epoxy resin and flame retardant 1 however due to its potential impact on high toxicity human health and recalcitrant nature bpa is also regarded as a concerned organic contaminant especially in industrial wastewater 2 advanced oxidation processes aops are reported to be a desirable technology for the degradation of bpa since aops are based on reactive oxygen species and utilize a variety of highly oxidizing active radicals 3 moreover compared with homogeneous aops heterogeneous aops which hold higher degradation efficiency are more effective and economical in bpa degradation process 4 5 recently sulfate radicals so4 based heterogeneous aops showed strong oxidation performance for treating organic pollutants such as bpa 6 comparing with hydroxyl radicals oh so4 hold more stable and higher redox potential 7 techniques such as ultraviolet uv irradiation heat 8 and transition metals 9 10 were used to activate persulfate ps or peroxymonosulfate pms for so4 generation copper oxide cuo and iron oxide fe3o4 are the most commonly used transition metal oxides in heterogeneous catalyst 11 12 cuo showed higher catalytic activity in heterogeneous aops which could effectively activate ps under neutral conditions 13 cuo pms system was used for phenol degradation which could achieve high catalytic activity at the same time the quenching experiment results revealed that cuo could activate pms to produce both so4 and o h radicals however the reusable of cuo and the copper ions leached were not involved in the study 14 in addition iron base bimetallic nanocomposites were reported to be an effective catalyst toward organic contaminant due to the synergistic effect between bimetals 15 17 the combined cuo fe3o4 nanoparticles could utilize the high catalytic activity of cuo and magnetism of fe3o4 and results showed that the composite nanoparticles demonstrated an excellent catalytic ability to generate so4 radicals 18 however due to its own magnetic effect fe3o4 tends to gather together in the reaction process which reduces the specific surface area of the material covers up the active sites on the surface of the material and weakens the catalytic activity of the catalyst 19 biochar bc which hold huge specific surface area and rich pore structure was proved to be an effective support material and could provide more active positions for metal nanoparticles 20 22 the nano iron nickel bimetallic biochar ni fe bc prepared from wheat straw biochar was reported that bc could inhibit the agglomeration of ni or fe and for prevent metal leaching 23 till now there is limited information on the feasibility and characteristic of cuo fe3o4 bc magnetic composite used to activate pms for organic pollutants degradation in this study magnetic nano cuo fe3o4 bc composite as a heterogeneous catalyst was synthesized by two steps of coprecipitation and calcination for activating pms to generate free radicals subsequently the properties of cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles were explored and the effects of experimental parameters such as initial ph pms concentration and catalyst load on the catalytic activity of cuo fe3o4 bc pms system were investigated additionally the stability and reusability of cuo fe3o4 bc were evaluated based on cycle experiments accordingly the mechanism of cuo fe3o4 bc activating pms to produce free radicals including the reaction process and mechanism of heterogeneous catalyst adsorption and degradation of bpa was systematically determined finally the advantages and implications associated with the development of a cost efficient method for the treatment of organic wastewater were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials bpa khso5 feso4 7h2o cucl2 2h2o h2so4 naoh hcl ch3oh c2h6o c4h10o were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd all the purity specifications of the reagents were analytical pure biochar bc as the protoplast material was produced by pyrolysis of deciduous leaves of platanus orientalis jinan shandong china 2 2 preparation of cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles the cleaned leaves were dried in oven at 80 c for 2 h and crushed into powder the obtained powder was placed in a tubular furnace at 600 c for 2 h under continuous nitrogen gas purging with the nitrogen gas flowrate at 1 l min then the mixture was soaked with 1 m hcl for 24 h to remove the inorganic components and washed with deionized water for several times and the material of bc was achieved after dried in an oven at 80 c for 12 h and the temperature increase rate in the oven was 5 min cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles were developed by means of two step method of coprecipitation and calcination to obtain the ingredient feso4 7h2o and cucl2 2h2o were mixed with a mass of 1 668 g and 0 051 g fe cu molar ratio of 20 in 100 ml of deionized water respectively subsequently 2 g bc prepared above was added to the mixture under the condition of continuous stirring typically 3 m naoh solution was dropwise added to adjust the ph of the ingredient to 10 11 the as resulted mixture was further placed in an autoclave at 80 c for 4 h after the reaction the ingredients were washed with ultrapure water and absolute ethanol to neutrality dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 2 h and final product cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles were obtained to make a comparison cuo nanoparticle was achieved by pyrolysis of cucl2 2h2o at 80 c for 4 h with the same preparation method as cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles fe3o4 nanoparticles were obtained by a one step coprecipitation synthesis method with fe ii fe iii molar ratio of 1 2 using feso4 7h2o and fecl3 6h2o 2 3 catalytic degradation experiment batch experiments were carried out in serum vials the cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles were disseminated in 10 ml of 20 mg l bpa solution the dosage of cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles were 0 5 2 0 g l and pms with the amount of 3 5 mm was added to start the bpa degradation before the degradation the adsorption desorption equilibrium was established for 10 min 24 the initial ph was adjusted with 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh and the serum bottles were placed in a constant temperature shaker with a rotational speed of 200 rpm at 25 c quenching reaction conducted by adding excess ethanol to 1 ml sample which was taken from serum bottles and filtered with a 0 22 μm microporous filter then analyzed in this experiment the influence of various parameters on bpa degradation were investigated including catalyst load 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 mg l pms concentration 3 5 and 7 mm and initial ph 5 7 8 9 10 and 12 the catalyst was separated and recovered by a magnet washed dried and reused under the same experimental conditions the four cycles of adsorption magnetic separation desorption were tested each experiment was done in triplicate and the results were determined in averaged value 2 4 characterization of cuo fe3o4 bc composites x ray powder diffraction xrd bruker d8 diffractometer was used to analyze the crystal structure of samples with a wavelength of 0 15418 nm and a radiation of cu kα the surface morphology and particle size of cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles were figured on a scanning electron microscope sem in addition the chemical structure of the catalyst was characterized through x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi with voltage range of 0 1000 ev at the same time the surface bonding of prepared materials was examined by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir vertex 70 5 5 dimethylpyrroline n oxide dmpo was used as a free radical trapping agent to measure the content of free radicals in the reaction process by electron spin resonance esr the bet was applied to measure the specific surface area pore volume and pore diameter of the composites the test parameters were frequency 100 khz central magnetic field 327 0 mt scanning time 30 s and microwave power 1 mw 2 5 chemical analysis the concentrations of bpa were determined by high performance liquid chromatography system hplc p1201 elite inc china with a wavelength of 278 nm the separation column was set by an amethyst c18 p column 5 μm 4 6 150 mm at 30 c the mobile phase was the mixture volume of 70 30 of methanol and water with influent volume was 25 μl and 1 0 ml min of flow rate 3 results and discussion 3 1 the characterization of cuo fe3o4 bc nanocomposites the morphology and particle size of bc fe3o4 and cuo fe3o4 bc were depicted in figs s1 s3 results showed that bc exhibited spherical shape with particle size about 50 nm fig s1 while in fig s2 most fe3o4 particles were agglomerated together with the magnetic force 25 fig s3 demonstrated that particles of cuo fe3o4 bc have a smaller particle size of about 10 nm the sem images of bc and cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles in fig s4 to s5 furthered confirming that fe3o4 and cuo were in a decentralized form and the nanoparticles were dispersed on the surface of biochar evenly as previous study reported that bc could decentralize metal oxide 26 bc materials hold considerable folds and pores which provide not only a larger specific surface area of the materials but also better conditions for bc to support cuo and fe3o4 particles the xrd pattern of cuo fe3o4 bc at 2θ from 10 to 70 was presented in fig 1 it could be concluded that the peaks were well matched with standard fe3o4 jcpds file no 65 3107 and cuo jcpds file no 45 0937 27 the diffraction peaks at 30 1 35 5 43 2 57 0 and 62 7 corresponded to the 220 311 400 511 440 planes of fe3o4 respectively 25 similarly the diffraction peaks at 38 9 48 7 66 2 and 68 1 matches to 111 202 311 and 220 crystal planes of cuo respectively 25 the results indicated that the prepared materials were compounds of cuo crystals and fe3o4 crystals and the existence of biochar did not destroy the crystal structure of fe3o4 and cuo in addition ft ir spectra of bc and cuo fe3o4 bc were illustrated in fig 2 it was revealed that peaks at 3340 cm 1 and 1685 cm 1 matched with h o and co bonds of bc respectively 28 the peaks on cuo fe3o4 bc at 570 cm 1 was the typical fe o bond in fe3o4 while peaks of 667 cm 1 and 875 cm 1 represent the cu o bond and the expansion vibration of fe oh bond caused the peak of 1340 cm 1 these results indicated that the nano cuo fe3o4 bc composition was successfully prepared with high crystallinity the specific surface area sbet single point adsorption total pore volume vt t plot micropore volume vm and bjh desorption average pore diameter 4 v a dp of bc and nanocomposites were measured table s1 after pyrolysis at 600 the sbet of bc was 56 83 m2 g while the sbet of cuo fe3o4 bc was 78 88 m2 g which indicated that higher specific surface area of cuo fe3o4 bc promoted to the adsorption performance of the catalyst compared with bc and cuo fe3o4 bc the increase in sbet might be due to the loading of cuo and fe3o4 nanoparticles on the surface of bc while the decrease in volume vm might be caused by the development of nanoparticles inside of the bc pores it was reported that the adsorption capacity of the material increased with the increase of specific surface area 29 at the same time as the catalytic reaction is a surface controlled process it was generally believed that the larger the surface area of the catalyst the more active sites on its surface 30 which further increased the possibility of contact and reaction between the catalyst and pollutants 3 2 catalytic properties of cuo fe3o4 bc pms system the degradation efficiencies of bpa under different catalytic systems within 30 min were investigated fig 3 the ph was 9 0 concentrations of bc cuo fe3o4 and cuo fe3o4 bc were 2 0 g l and bpa concentration was 20 mg l pms has no ability to degrade bap with the absence of oxidant since bpa was rarely removed within 30 min simultaneously when only fe3o4 was added in the bpa contained wastewater a little reduction of bpa was achieved via fe3o4 adsorption effect which was consistent with previous study 31 while in the presence of bc alone the removal efficiency of bpa was 13 76 which was mainly due to the adsorption of bc the bpa removal efficiencies in bc pms fe3o4 pms and cuo pms systems were 25 49 27 53 and 47 68 respectively the results above indicated that during the bpa degradation process the active free radicals could be generated via the activation of pms with the addition of bc fe3o4 or cuo in particular bpa removal efficiency reached 74 01 after the addition of fe3o4 nanoparticles to the cuo pms system the increasement of bpa removal efficiency in cuo fe3o4 pms may be caused by the synergistic effect of cuo fe3o4 composite material which achieved a higher catalytic activity notebly in cuo fe3o4 bc pms system bpa removal efficiency was 100 and the removal rate was obviously higher than cuo fe3o4 pms system whithin 30 min these results showed that cuo fe3o4 bc pms system has excellent catalytic activity for bpa degradation one reason was that cuo and fe3o4 nanoparticles could initiate pms to generate active free radicals so4 and o h to achieve a rapid degradation of bpa which was coordinant with previous study 32 ding et al also found that the presentation of cu and fe into cuo and fe3o4 could promote the catalytic capacity of fe3o4 or cuo 33 another reason was that bc was proved to have huge specific surface area which could adsorb pollutant to the catalyst surface and increase the concentration of pollutants on the catalyst surface 34 because of the synergism between cuo fe3o4 and bc cuo and fe3o4 nanoparticles showed strong catalytic effect in pms activation therefore the relative mass transfer rate and the chemical reaction rate of the reactive sites were improved 3 3 effects of reaction parameters in cuo fe3o4 bc pms system the degradation of bpa at various parameters including different initial ph values catalyst load and initial pms concentrations in cuo fe3o4 bc pms system were explored fig 4 as demonstrated in fig 4a different ph values 5 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 10 0 and 12 0 were investigated the removal efficiency of bpa increased from 44 7 to 100 with the initial ph value increased from 5 0 9 0 the complete removal of bpa was achieved at ph of 9 0 within 30 min however a further increase in the ph value accompanied by a gradual decline in the bpa removal efficiency especially when ph was increased to 12 0 the bpa removal efficiency was only 11 18 the results above indicated that cuo fe3o4 bc pms system could achieve high catalytic efficiency in a wide range of ph superior to traditional fenton reaction which must carry out under strong acid conditions ph 2 3 5 35 37 this was mainly due to the influence of ph on the isoelectric point phpzc and catalytic performance of metal oxides it was reported that the ph and phpzc of the solution was related to the surface charge of metal oxides 38 ren et al found that the highest ozone degradation efficiency occurred when the ph of the solution was near the phpzc of the heterogeneous catalyst nife2o4 39 as the phpzc of cuo and fe3o4 was around 10 0 and 7 5 respectively the phpzc of cuo fe3o4 nanoparticles amounted to 9 0 33 in addition as the acidity coefficient pka of pms is 9 4 the form of pms mainly depends on the ph of the wastewater 40 obviously cuo fe3o4 nanocomposites demonstrated positive charge in the ph range of 9 0 at the same time pms existed in the form of hso5 under acidic and neutral 5 5 ph 8 5 conditions while under alkaline conditions 8 5 ph 13 0 it existed as so5 33 when the ph was maintained above 9 0 the surface of cuo fe3o4 nanoparticles was negatively charged which produced repulsive force and the repulsive force of static charge could reduce the chance of interaction between pms and cuo fe3o4 nanoparticles resulting in a decrease of bpa degradation efficiency in contrast when the ph values below 9 0 the surface of cuo fe3o4 nanoparticles was positively charged which promoted the attractive contact between pms and cuo fe3o4 nanoparticles the effect of cuo fe3o4 bc catalyst load 0 5 2 0 g l on bpa removal efficiency was depicted in fig 4b the bpa removal efficiency gradually improved and reached 100 at the concentration of 2 0 g l this mainly because the active sites in the system increased with the increase of catalyst load which in turn improved the contact probability of pollutant molecules with catalyst 41 on the other hand on the surface of the nanoparticles the adsorption capacity of bc could improve the removal efficiency of bpa furtherly fig 4c displayed the influence of different initial pms concentrations on bpa degradation performance in the cuo fe3o4 bc pms system bpa removal efficiency increased from 81 84 to 100 with initial pms concentration improved from 3 to 5 mm however the bpa removal efficiency was declined to 84 23 as initial pms concentration further increased from 5 to 7 mm it was found that the amount of so4 and oh mainly depended on the concentration of pms and excess addition of pms would inhibit the so4 and oh generation eqs 1 3 42 1 o h h s o 5 s o 5 h 2 o 2 o h s o 5 s o 5 o h 3 s o 4 h s o 5 s o 4 2 h s o 5 3 4 stability and reusability of cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles in order to evaluate the stability and reusability of cuo fe3o4 bc nanoparticles the cuo fe3o4 bc catalyst was reused for bpa degradation at the end of degradation experiment the catalyst was magnetically separated washed alternately with the mixture of ethanol and deionized water and dried in the oven for 2 h with the temperature of 80 for reuse after 4 runs for recycling the bpa degradation efficiency remained above 80 fig 5 a the results demonstrated that cuo fe3o4 bc catalyst hold excellent catalytic stability and reusability meanwhile the bpa degradation efficiency in the first analyse was higher than the fourth experiment which mainly due to the loss of cuo fe3o4 particles from the catalyst surface in addition with the increasing reused run of the catalyst the pollutants adsorbed by bc gradually accumulated which were not washed out during the parsing process 43 the reduction of bc adsorption capacity could decrease the contact between pollutants and catalyst which result in the lower of bpa degradation efficiency in the 4th recycling run in addition metal leaching of the cuo fe3o4 bc pms were investigated in the first cycle of degradation process when the concentration of catalyst was 2 0 g l 0 34 mg l cu ions were detected in 30 min while fe ions were not detected it was reported that high amount of fe ions leaching of catalyst could cause secondary pollution and increase the treatment cost 7 therefore the cuo fe3o4 bc catalyst showed a good stability and make it possible in practical application in fig 6 a cuo fe3o4 bc catalyst exhibited s like magnetization hysteresis loop with a saturation magnetic strength of 75 emu g at room temperature which indicated that the catalyst was superparamagnetic fig 6b demonstrated that under the condition of external magnetic field the synthesized nanoparticles could be easily separated from wastewater and could be reused the superparamagnetic of the catalyst hold great advantages in practical application and could be recovered easily and quickly 3 5 adsorption and activation mechanisms of cuo fe3o4 bc pms system for bpa degradation it was reported that metal based catalyst activation of pms mainly produced four types of active radicals so4 o h peroxysulfate so5 and singlet oxygen 1o2 44 a quenching experiment was carried out to detect the involved radical species in the cuo fe3o4 bc pms system with ethanol etoh and tert butyl alcohol tba as quenching reagents 45 etoh is a commonly used quenching agents for oh k 1 6 7 7 108 m 1s 1 and so4 k 1 2 2 8 107 m 1s 1 while tba was utilized for oh k 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 46 as depicted in fig 7 without the addition of etoh and tba bpa removal efficiency reached 100 in 30 min when tba was added into the system tba pms molar ratio was 1000 1 the bpa removal efficiency was reduced to 48 7 however almost no bpa was degraded when etoh etoh pms molar ratio of 1000 1 was added into the system it could be speculated that in the degradation bpa both oh and so4 were participated in the process and so4 played a dominant role in order to verify the free radical species electron spin resonance esr was used with dmpo as a probe as shown in fig 8 there was no signal peaks demonstrated when single pms added into bpa wastewater while in the cuo fe3o4 bc pms system dmpo x was produced this characteristic peak appeared because of the interaction between dmpo and so4 and o h 47 the results further confirmed that in cuo fe3o4 bc system both so4 and o h were produced which could catalyze the degradation of bpa after the addition of etoh and tba the peak signal intensity of dmpo x was significantly weakened nevertheless the peak intensity in the presence of etoh was significantly lower than that of tba which concluded that in cuo fe3o4 bc pms system so4 was the main active radical species the xps spectra of cuo fe3o4 bc were recorded before and after the degradation experiment fig s6 as illustrated in fig s6a the wide survey scan of xps spectra indicated the existence of c 1s o 1s fe 2p and cu 2p in the catalyst after reaction the elements above rarely changed which revealed that the nanoparticles were stable and reusable in fig s6b the main peaks of fe 2p spectra at 724 6 and 710 7 ev indicated the occurrence of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 of fe3o4 in the nanoparticles respectively 48 meanwhile the peak position at 710 7 and 713 5 ev could be indexed to the fe ii and fe iii 49 for the xps spectra of cu 2p region fig s6c the main peak at binding energy of 934 1 ev is assigned to cu ii 50 and the peaks at 941 3 ev is basically similar to that of dominated cu ii oxide species 51 after degradation the lower binding energy at 933 2 ev demonstrated that cu ii was transferred to cu i as previous study reported 52 xps spectra of c 1s were shown in fig s6d two peaks centered at 285 7 and 288 0 ev could be attributed to the c 1s spectra in c c c o and c o c c o fe respectively meanwhile the activation mechanism of pms by cuo fe3o4 bc catalyst was explored fig 9 in the process cu ii was reduced to cu i with pms reacted with cuo to produce so5 eq 4 and cu i transferred an electron to fe iii and became cu ii due to the oxidation reduction potential of fe iii fe ii 0 77 v was higher than that of cu ii cu i 0 17 v eq 5 53 the copper ions and iron ions accelerated the circulation of cuprous ions and ferrous ions in the reaction system besides some cu i may react with hso5 to be oxidized to cu ii and so4 was released into the solution eq 6 fe ii also reacted with hso5 to form fe iii eq 7 radical of o h also could be produced in the process so4 react with h2o eq 8 54 afterwards because the surface of biochar was rich in oxygen containing functional groups biochar could also activate pms to generate so4 eq 9 and eq 10 55 furthermore the resulting highly oxidizing so4 and o h decomposed the bpa molecule which was the main reason of bpa degradation eq 11 the increase in the electron transfer rate on the catalyst surface improved the generation efficiency of free radicals in the system and the increase in the concentration of active species accelerated the degradation reactions 56 4 c u i i h s

which could improve the bpa degradation efficiency therefore for the cuo fe3o4 bc pms system the synergy between adsorption and catalysis could significantly improve the bpa removal efficiency 3 6 implication of cuo fe3o4 bc pms system in phenolic organic wastewater treatment currently aops are the main methods for phenolic organic pollutant degradation heterogeneous aops has the advantages of safe reaction conditions environmentally friendly simple operation and short reaction time compared with previous aops systems table 1 cuo fe3o4 bc pms provided a more efficient and economical alternative for phenolic degradation from wastewater comparing with the reported processes catalysts cuo fe3o4 bc are rich in iron species which are abundant in nature and cheaper in price 57 59 the porous structure of the catalyst increased its specific surface area and reduced the mass transfer resistance of the substance which could provide more active sites for the reaction cuo fe3o4 bc catalyst could achieve a high removal efficiency of bpa 100 in a wide range of ph 5 9 overcoming the disadvantage of the traditional fenton reaction which must be carried out under strict acid conditions 60 63 furthermore the adsorption of biochar promoted the contact between catalyst and pms as well as radicals and organic pollutants in addition under the condition of external magnetic field the catalyst can be easily separated from the aqueous solution for reuse and the degradation efficiency of bpa remained as high as 80 after 4 times cuo fe3o4 bc pms system showed potential of catalyst recyclability and cost saving compared with previous studies 64 66 the cuo fe3o4 bc pms system combined the high catalytic of cuo and the magnetic of fe3o4 with the porous features of bc which offered a more promising technology for the removal of refractory organic pollutants from wastewater 4 conclusions the cuo fe3o4 bc nanocomposite which attributed iron and copper oxide nanoparticles loaded onto bc were applied as a heterogeneous catalyst to activate pms for bpa degradation in the cuo fe3o4 bc pms system bpa removal efficiency reached 100 in 30 min by using 2 0 g l cuo fe3o4 bc and 5 mm pms at a ph of 9 0 and so4 played an essential role in the degradation process the synergistic effect of copper ions and iron ions accelerated the circulation of fe ii fe iii and cu i cu ii which could promote the electron transfer on the catalyst surface and increase the generation of free radicals meanwhile the adsorption of biochar improved the contact and reaction of bpa molecules with free radicals and contributed to bpa degradation cuo fe3o4 bc nanocomposite was proved to be stable and reusable since the bpa degradation efficiency remained above 80 after four runs the cuo fe3o4 bc pms system combined the high catalytic of cuo and the efficient magnetic of fe3o4 with the porous properties of biochar which offered a more promising technology for the removal of

212 40 kg h followed by the case which uses mesityl oxide for the liquid liquid extraction e g 34 759 80 kg h and by the case involving cyclohexanone e g 37 490 60 kg h the lowest steam consumption is registered also in the case of cyclohexanone usage e g 47 56 gj h while the lowest power consumption corresponds to mesityl oxide usage e g 11 20 mj h the simulation results are then used to perform an environmental analysis quantified in terms of environmental key performance indicators embedding several solvents production methods as well as various fuels our life cycle assessment leads to the conclusions that the most environmentally friendly design is phenol removal using cyclohexanone as a solvent whose provision comes from cyclohexane which in turn is produced from benzene in conjunction with steam production from natural gas for instance the lowest global warming potential indicator score is about 342 kg co2 equivalents per kg of phenol while the same indicator for the worst solvent i e toluene produced using reforming technology and steam being produced using hard coal as fuel is almost double e g 341 94 kg co2 equivalents per kg of phenol vs 575 30 co2 equivalents

trichlorofluoromethane tep terrestrial toxicity potential wt weight 1 introduction the efficient removal of toxic substances from industrial wastewater is considered to be a topic of paramount importance and interest 1 wastewaters from different industries can contain different quantities of phenols for instance the concentration of phenol from refineries are in the range 6 500 mg l from cooking operations from 28 to 3900 mg l while the one derived from coal processing is about 9 6800 mg l 2 one of the industries which generates considerable quantities of phenolic wastewater is the iron and steel industry iron and steel industry plays a significant role in the development of a country steel being a valuable construction material steel production process being a raw material and labour intensive process exhibits high energy consumption which is considered one of its major drawbacks it is also known that the environmental emissions from the iron and steel industry are quite significant therefore ecological regulations impose strict limits on iron and steel production phases 3 one crucial step in the steel production process is represented by coke production coke is the main product of the coke production process a cradle to gate life cycle assessment lca study of coke production process focused on blowing cooler system sulphur ammonia and benzene recovery systems was performed by li and co authors 4 despite the broad perspective of the study it does not take into consideration the phenol removal from wastewater besides coke a harmful by products of coke production is represented by coke oven wastewater which contains highly hazardous contaminants such as phenol and other related compounds ammonia thiocyanide cyanide sulphides heterocyclic nitrogenous compounds as well as poly nuclear aromatic compounds 5 6 since phenol is known as a dangerous pollutant due to its strong toxicity for aquatic life and humans alike it is essential to remove it from effluent water the average phenol concentration in wastewater from steel cooking facilities is 2000 mg l equivalent to 0 2 wt which is also used in the simulations presented in this paper furthermore its usage in various industries makes it valuable enough to recover and reuse phenol and its compounds have carcinogenic effects even when they are present in low concentrations 7 consequently in several countries phenol and its compounds have been included into high priority pollutants lists and their removal is considered a necessary task to protect health and ecosystems 8 besides the environmental factor phenol is a valuable chemical for many plastics bisphenol a precursor to polycarbonates and epoxide resins phenolic resins bakelite cyclohexanone precursor to nylon but also herbicides and pharmaceutical drugs aspirin 9 for this reason it s important to recover the phenol from wastewater and reuse it as a raw material many techniques and processes have been employed for treatment of phenolic wastewater as reported in the scientific literature 10 11 these works assign each method to a conventional or advanced category describing principles applications advantages and drawbacks of each technique among the conventional methods a multitude of technologies can be retrieved as shown in fig 1 traditional i steam or azeotropic distillation based on relative volatility of phenol is often used as well as ii extraction of phenol using various solvents for instance cui and co authors studied phenol removal utilizing a mixture of methyl isobutyl ketone mibk and toluene 12 cesari and co authors studied the phenol removal using choline bis trifluoromethylsulfonyl imide as solvent 13 mesityl oxide as a novel extractant was investigated by feng s research group 14 the usage of biomass based solvents for the extraction process was the subject of an interesting research carried out by li and co authors 15 finally liquid liquid ll extraction of phenol using ionic liquid was investigated by sas and co authors 16 conventional methods also include iii adsorption on various substrate e g olive mill solid waste 7 supported nanoparticles 17 or activated carbons 18 iv biological degradation 19 20 v coagulation flocculation 21 and vi chemical oxidation using various substances such as ferrate based 22 or permanganate based chemicals 23 due to the great interest around the phenol removal from wastewater more advanced techniques dedicated to this purpose have been studied by numerous research groups concerning oxidations phenomena advanced processes comprehend fenton and electro fenton 24 25 peroxide usage 26 27 wet air oxidation 28 ozone oxidation 29 electrochemical oxidation 30 steam plasma jet degradation 31 photocatalytic oxidation 32 and uv h2o2 treatment 33 another advanced application contemplates the phenol removal using membrane based separations 34 35 a selection of notable examples includes extractive membrane bioreactors 36 trickle bed reactor reverse osmosis process 37 nanofiltration 38 pervaporation 39 photocatalytic membrane reactors 40 and membrane distillation 41 our attention was focused on the ll extraction method its fundamentals reside on the basic separation of the wastewater stream into two or more effluent streams depending whether the wastewater contains high quantities of other pollutants and if the processes take place all at once one of which must contain the target compound which is represented by phenol in our study 42 the ll process generally exhibits three main stages the actual pollutant extraction solute removal and solvent recovery the critical step in the design of a ll separation process is the identification of the most suitable solvent the best way to undertake solvent screening is to rely on molecular modeling methods for the in silico estimation of the relevant thermodynamic properties chen and co authors used conductor like screening model segment activity coefficient cosmo sac model for screening solvents to extract phenol from aqueous solutions 43 they compared commonly used solvents taken from different families namely alkanes arenes alcohols ethers esters and ketones cosmo sac is a quantum mechanics method for thermodynamic properties estimation which adopts the chemical structure of the molecules and does not employ any adjustable parameter for the estimation of mixture properties 44 45 solvent screening can be easily accomplished by comparing selectivity and solvent power both quantities can be calculated for infinite dilution activity coefficients of solvents in water and in phenol the solvent screening performed by chen and co authors 43 highlights a preference for ketones ethers and esters for phenol extraction due to their relatively high distribution coefficients and selectivity however since extraction operations are industrially conducted above 333 k esters and ethers become unsuitable due to the formation of azeotropes with water at working temperatures for these reasons we decided to focus on three industrially employed ketones i e mibk mesityl oxide and cyclohexanone comparing their performance with traditional solvents such as benzene toluene cyclohexane and ethylbenzene this paper aims at comparing technically but also from an environmental standpoint ll extraction method using different solvents the comparison between different solvents for ll extraction applications taking into account their molecular structure their efficiencies 43 their price and their environmental impact 46 have already been performed by other research groups the production technologies of the solvents the production of steam used for solvent recovery as well as the electricity generation to run the machineries was not included yet in the environmental analysis this is fundamental in order to reach a broad perspective of the whole supply chain of the system 2 methods and tools 2 1 processes description and modelling assumptions seven cases of phenol removal from wastewater using ll extraction are discussed in the present paper a flowrate of 100 tons h of raw wastewater is considered in each case in order to be able to compare them the chosen flowrate represents an average value for a coke wastewater plant 47 the initial phenol concentration in the wastewater is assumed to be 2000 mg l the goal is to reduce the phenol concentration under 0 2 mg l this value representing the european limit for phenol in wastewater 48 all the simulations presented were performed using chemcad 49 process simulator software version 6 5 6 two categories of solvents have been chosen to perform the ll extraction of phenol as shown in table 1 the first category is represented by aromatics and cycloalkanes such as benzene toluene ethylbenzene cyclohexane cases 1 4 which are quite common solvents the second category is represented by ketones such as mibk cyclohexanone and mesityl oxide cases 5 7 high distribution coefficients high selectivities and high solvent power to extract phenol from water are reported in the scientific literature for this category of solvents 43 stressing their importance as promising substances for phenol extraction next section contains several details about the cases under investigation phenol extraction with various solvents is schematically represented in fig 2 this plant model uses a ll extractor where the solvent removes phenol from wastewater the phenolic water is fed to the plant at 30 c from the top of the extractor while the solvent enters from the bottom both at atmospheric pressure the phenol is extracted at the top of the ll extractor the obtained stream containing a mixture of phenol and solvent enters the solvent recovery column concentrated phenol is obtained as a residue while the solvent is recovered as distillate and recycled water stream mixed with some solvent from the bottom of the ll extractor is then sent to the raffinate column almost pure water is obtained at the bottom of this column the recycled solvent stream from the solvent recovery column is pumped and mixed with the raffinate column distillate stream and integrated with solvent make up the mixed solvent stream is cooled down to 30 c in a heat exchanger and sent to the ll extractor low pressure steam is used in the raffinate and solvent recovery distillation columns the assumptions used in process modelling and simulation are summarised in table 2 the thermodynamic model chosen for describing the cases under study is non random two liquid nrtl which has been selected based on the components and plant operation conditions i e temperature and pressure nrtl binary interaction parameters have been taken form the chemcad internal data base and checked versus phase equilibria data vapour liquid equilibria vle and liquid liquid equilibria lle the nrtl model is able to represent vle quite well and gives the correct size and shape of the miscibility gap for all the ternary diagrams considered in this work for the binary lle the model shows an average relative deviation of solubility mole fraction in the aqueous phase of 0 54 average among the seven water solvents systems with a maximum value of 3 2 table 3 2 2 environmental evaluation using life cycle assessment lca lca methodology is focused on the evaluation of the environmental impacts generated by manufacturing usage and disposal of products materials and chemicals its principles and procedures are reported in the international standard organization iso series 14 040 guidelines 50 51 allowing the estimation of the emissions regarding each environmental compartment i e soil water and atmosphere it is based on the material and energy balances related to the overall life cycle of the product system under investigation which comprehends extraction of raw materials manufacturing distribution use phase recycling final disposal and the transportations between life cycle stages 52 the results of life cycle studies are presented using various environmental indicators which encompass a multitude of environmental issues avoiding burden shifting among the environmental compartments the lca methodology as extensively discussed on a series of publications 53 54 prescribes the fulfilment of four stages as follows 1 goal and scope definition this stage requires the practitioner to specify the aim of the study the system boundaries the quality of data source the assumptions and limitations introduced and the functional unit i e the amount of final product on which the life cycle input output streams are normalized 2 life cycle inventory analysis lci during this step the practitioner needs to collect the mass and energy balances of the product system under investigation the employment of primary data is preferred since actual process data provide highest accuracy in comparison to secondary data which are retrieved on acknowledged databases i e ecoinvent 55 or gabi 56 3 life cycle impact assessment lcia this phase assigns specific environmental impacts to inventory data through recognized characterization factors which typify the contribution of each substance to a determined impact category providing harmonization on a shared unit of measure 4 life cycle interpretation this stage provides an evaluation of the results obtained by previous steps although the interpretation comes last it embeds the overall lca procedure including comments and recommendations adapted to the goal and scope previously defined usually sensitivity analysis and uncertainty are assessed during this phase 57 gabi software was used to perform the present lca study gabi is one of the most popular decision support lca software for product sustainability used in numerous applications such as design products for low environmental impact improve efficiency or develop profiles of carbon water and product environmental footprints 56 the functional unit to which all the quantities are reported is one kilogram of phenol extracted the plant is considered to be located in central europe material and energy balances derived from the simulation phase 58 as well as data from the gabi database are used in the present lca study the present lca study envisages a cradle to gate perspective considering all the life cycle phases from resource extraction cradle to the production plant gate before entering the market the assessment performed in the current research study considers the production of the solvents i e benzene toluene cyclohexane ethylbenzene mibk cyclohexanone and mesityl oxide the production of steam used to recover the solvents after the extraction phase as well as the production of electricity to run the machineries the production technologies of the solvents as well as the production of steam used for solvent recovery but also the electricity production to run the machineries were not considered in the environmental analysis performed by other research groups the authors consider that the inclusion of these aspects in the environmental evaluation is fundamental in order to reach a broad perspective of the whole supply chain of the system the cases which are taken into consideration as well as the boundary conditions are presented in figs 3 and 4 some details regarding figs 3 and 4 and the cases under study considered in the lca should be provided i the first number in each case study denotes the solvent used for phenol extraction as reported in table 4 ii the production technologies for the solvents are denoted with capital letters i e a b c and d where a represents benzene or toluene production from pyrolysis fuel cyclohexane from benzene ethylbenzene production mix mibk from acetone acetone from cumene etc iii the fuel used for the steam generation necessary for solvent recovery is denoted with small letters i e a for natural gas b for hard coal and c for biomass according to table 4 for instance case 1aa represents phenol extraction using benzene as a solvent benzene being produced from pyrolysis fuel and steam is produced from natural gas case 2bc represents phenol removal using toluene as a solvent toluene being produced using reforming technology and steam is produced using biomass as a fuel case 5ab represents phenol extraction using mibk as a solvent mibk being produced from acetone acetone in turn is produced from cumene and steam is produced from hard coal case 7bc represents phenol removal using mesityl oxide as a solvent mesityl oxide being produced from acetone acetone is produced from isopropanol and steam is produced using biomass as fuel a total number of 42 subcases have been defined for the lca comparison the subcases are distributed as presented in table 5 details regarding the technologies used for solvent production are provided in table 6 table 7 contains details regarding the lca assumptions for steam production using three different sources i e natural gas hard coal and biomass lci is the lca phase focused on the quantification of inputs and outputs data 59 due to the vast amount of data used in the present analysis for all the subcases a relevant example of an lci used in the present study can be found in table 8 after the inputs and outputs quantification the next step of an lca study is represented by the lcia phase the cml 2001 method assessment available in gabi software 56 was used for environmental evaluation and comparison our choice is based on two fundamental reasons 1 we wanted to avoid the subjectivity and uncertainty of endpoint approach and 2 cml 2001 has been recognized as one of the most well established and world widely used methodology 60 the method was developed by the university of leiden netherlands and it considers the following impact categories global warming potential gwp acidification potential ap eutrophication potential ep ozone depletion potential odp aquatic depletion potential adp freshwater aquatic toxicity potential faetp human toxicity potential htp photochemical oxidation potential pcop terrestrial toxicity potential tep and marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential maetp 61 life cycle interpretation is the technique used for identifying quantifying checking and evaluating the lca results useful conclusions and recommendations for the study are the main outputs of the interpretation phase the interpretation of the environmental indicators is presented in section 3 the present study is subjected to the following limitations we do not envisage the production of the machinery for solvents production as well as the machinery used in the extraction process the construction of infrastructure or the construction of trains and trucks for transportation however the impacts related to machinery production looks negligible in relation with the functional unit endorsed in our study therefore the results are not considerably influenced by this assumption 3 results and discussions 3 1 results and discussions on process modelling and simulation the raw wastewater stream is set to 100 tons h for all cases with a phenol content representing 0 2 wt the goal in all cases is to lower the phenol concentration in the clean water under 20 mg l parameters such as solvent power and selectivity play a crucial role in removal efficiency table 9 reports the input output streams of each process simulation it is possible to notice how the raw wastewater input stream is the same in all seven cases e g 200 kg h of phenol and 99 800 kg h of water and that different quantities of solvents are needed for each extraction the lowest quantity of solvent is used in case 6 e g 34 212 40 kg h which uses cyclohexanone as solvent followed by case 7 e g 34 759 80 kg h which employs mesityl oxide and by case 3 e g 37 490 60 kg h using cyclohexane the highest quantity of solvent is used in case 2 toluene being the solvent for ll extraction it can be also noticed that higher quantities of solvents are present in the phenol stream when aromatics are used in comparison with ketones the higher quantities of solvents present in the output phenol streams in the aromatics cycloalkanes cases lead to lower quality of the output phenol stream the exception is represented by cyclohexane case 3 when 1 12 kg h of cyclohexane is found on the final phenol stream considering the ketones cases the lowest quantity of solvent retrieved in the phenol stream appears in case 7 e g 0 47 kg h when mesityl oxide is used table 10 shows the steam and electricity consumptions for all cases under study it can be noticed that the lowest steam consumption is obtained in case 3 e g 47 56 gj h while the highest steam consumption is obtained in case 5 case 7 when mesityl oxide is used has the lowest value for power consumption e g 11 20 mj h in a power consumption ranking case 7 is followed by case 6 e g 18 79 mj h and by case 3 e g 28 13 mj h cases 3 6 and 7 seem to be the best options considering the lowest quantity of solvent employed and the lowest power consumption taking into account also the steam consumption for case 7 and case 6 these quantities are higher compared to case 3 the final decision on the best solvent will be based on the technical evaluation as well as on the environmental one sensitivity analysis performed on extraction processes of interest indicates that as expected all processes are sensitive to reflux ratio and number of stages in the distillation column the reflux ratio was modified with 5 with respect to the original value the same range being also valid for the number of stages the effects of these modifications are similar for all the systems investigated in this work and can be summarized in the graphs in figs 5 and 6 the main effects of the sensitivity studies are that energy consumption depends on both the reflux ratio and the number of stages while phenol purity is not affected and the solvent lost in water phase is negligible this is valid for all the systems investigated 3 2 results and discussions on environmental assessment environmental evaluation results were generated using gabi software version 8 for each of the 42 subcases the results for the seven cases and 42 subcases are reported in the supplementary information material as a first task all the subcases correspondent to each case were compared and the best two configurations for each solvent were selected for further comparison see table 11 for instance for case 1 the lowest values for all impact categories are obtained in subcases 1ba and 1bb see table s1 these cases correspond to phenol extraction using benzene as a solvent benzene being produced via reforming and steam being produced from natural gas i e subcase 1ba or from hard coal i e subcase 1bb from table s1 it can also be noticed a competition between subcases 1bb and 1bc where steam is produced from biomass even if lower values for gwp impact and adpfossil indicators can be noticed in subcase 1bc all the other impact categories are lower in subcase 1bb consequently subcases 1ba and 1bb were chosen as best subcases for case 1 the same conclusions are valid for case 2 the environmental results for case 2 are reported in table s2 the best values are observed in subcases 2ba and 2bb these subcases correspond to phenol extraction using toluene as solvent toluene being produced using reforming technology and steam being produced from natural gas or from hard coal when case 3 is considered see table s3 the lowest values for nine out of ten impact indicators i e ap ep odp adpfossil faetp htp pcop tep maetp are obtained by subcases 3aa and 3ab these correspond to phenol extraction using cyclohexane as a solvent cyclohexane being produced from benzene and the steam used to regenerate the cyclohexane comes from natural gas i e subcase 3aa or from hard coal i e subcase 3ab the same conclusion is valid for case 4 when ethylbenzene is used as a solvent for phenol removal the best two subcases belonging to case 4 are subcase 4aa and 4ab see table s4 for case 5 the environmental indicators are reported in table s5 the best two subcases from the six subcases considered appear in subcases 5aa and 5ab mibk is used as a solvent in subcases 5aa and 5ab the solvent is produced from acetone acetone being produced from cumene the steam requested in the proposed processes is considered to be generated using natural gas i e subcase 5aa or hard coal i e subcase 5ab as fuels analysing case 6 see table s6 when cyclohexanone is used as a solvent for phenol extraction the best subcases are represented by 6aa and 6ab cyclohexane is produced from benzene and steam as in the previous cases is produced from natural gas or from hard coal table s7 summarizes the environmental indicators for case 7 from the six subcases taken into account the best values are obtained by subcase 7aa and 7ab mesityl oxide is produced from cumene steam from natural gas and from hard coal is used in subcase 7aa and 7ab respectively discussions about the best values obtained in all seven cases are presented in the next section see table 11 3 2 1 gwp indicator discussing the values reported in table 11 it can be noticed that the highest gwp is obtained in subcase 2bb e g 575 30 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol followed by subcase 4ab e g 572 46 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol the major contributors to the gwp values are the toluene production process using reforming technology for subcase 2bb and ethylbenzene production process using technology mix for subcase 4ab toluene production using reforming technology contributes with 88 74 to the total 575 30 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol while ethylbenzene production represents 92 34 of the total 572 46 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol a common characteristic of 2bb and 4ab subcases is the utilisation of hard coal for steam generation indeed higher amounts of co2 are released when hard coal is used compared to the subcases when natural gas or biomass are involved in steam generation from the total gwp values previously mentioned steam generation contributes with 11 26 in subcase 2bb while the same process contributes with 7 66 in subcase 4ab among the other cases the lowest values are obtained in subcase 6aa e g 341 94 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol followed by subcase 6ab e g 364 71 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol subcase 6aa correspond to phenol extraction using cyclohexanone cyclohexanone being produced from cyclohexane which in turn is produced from benzene the percentage correspondent to solvent production to the total 341 94 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol is 88 65 the rest being represented by the steam generation using natural gas an interesting discussion between the gwp indicators obtained in case 3 and case 6 is presented in the next section the two cases refer to the usage of cyclohexane as solvent for ll extraction respectively the usage of cyclohexanone which is derived from cyclohexane differences in the gwp indicator between cyclohexane case 3 and cyclohexanone case 6 come from different quantities of solvent steam and electricity used in the two cases in the cylohexane case i e case 3aa a gravity analysis on the gwp value e g 406 04 and 341 94 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol for cases 3aa and 6aa respectively provides the following evidences 387 40 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol correspond to cyclohexane production 18 6 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol is due to steam production and a small quantity corresponds to electricity generation in the cylohexanone case i e case 6aa the total gwp value e g 341 94 kg co2 equivalents kg phenol is the sum of 303 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol which corresponds to solvent production 38 8 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol coming from steam production and the rest is generated by electricity production in the cyclohexane case case 3 from table 3 it can be noticed that the quantity of solvent stream to the extractor including recycling is 37 491 kg h while for cyclohexanone case 6 is 34 213 kg h these recycled streams contain 37 479 75 kg h of pure cyclohexane component weight is 99 97 respectively about 27 076 17 kg h of pure cyclohexanone component weight is 79 14 these quantities of pure solvent will be the major contributor to the gwp indicator considering steam consumption see table 10 the quantity of steam used in case 3 is lower compared to the quantity of steam used in case 6 e g 17 844 10 kg h vs 37 172 40 kg h consequently a higher gwp due to steam production is obtained for case 6 considering electricity consumption see table 10 for case 3 when cyclohexane is used as a solvent for phenol extraction the total electricity consumption is 34 26 mj h in case 6 when cyclohexanone is used for phenol removal the electricity consumption will be lower compared to case 3 e g 31 56 mj h vs 34 26 mj h 3 2 2 ap indicator the highest values for ap indicator correspond to subcases 4ab and 4aa e g 1 77 kg so2 equivalents per kg phenol respectively 1 73 kg so2 equivalents per kg phenol ethylbenzene is used as a solvent in both subcases ethylbenzene being produced using mix technology in subcase 4ab hard coal is the steam source while in subcase 4aa natural gas is the fuel source for steam generation solvent production process contributes with 92 34 in subcase 4ab with 95 in subcase 4aa to the total ap indicator value relevant substances which influence the ap indicator are sox nox hcl hf and nh3 for ethylbenzene case according to thinkstep database for one kg of solvent 2 85 10 3 kg of no2 4 06 10 2 kg of so2 2 83 10 5 kg of hcl and 1 06 10 6 kg hf 8 32 10 9 kg ammonia are released into the air lower values for this impact indicator are obtained in subcases 6aa e g 0 42 kg so2 equivalents per kg phenol and 6ab e g 0 47 kg so2 equivalents per kg phenol for instance ap obtained in subcase 6aa is more than four times lower than the highest value e g 0 42 kg so2 equivalents per kg phenol vs 1 77 kg so2 equivalents per kg phenol while ap obtained in subcase 6ab is decreased by a factor of 3 77 compared to the highest value e g 0 47 kg so2 equivalents per kg phenol vs 1 77 kg so2 equivalents per kg phenol in both subcases 6aa and 6ab phenol is extracted using cyclohexanone cyclohexanone being produced from cyclohexane which in turn is produced from benzene different steam sources are used in these subcases in particular natural gas is used in subcase 6aa and hard coal is used in subcase 6ab solvent production process contributes with 93 73 in subcase 6aa and 82 76 in subcase 6ab in the cyclohexanone case for the production of one kg of cyclohexanone 1 38 10 3 kg of no2 1 28 10 3 kg of so2 6 00 10 6 kg of hcl and 1 43 10 10 kg hf 9 11 10 6 kg ammonia are released into the air 3 2 3 ep indicator according to table 11 high values for eutrophication potential impact indicator are obtained in subcases 4ab and 4aa e g 11 20 10 2 kg po4 3 equivalents per kg phenol 10 80 10 2 kg po4 3 equivalents per kg phenol respectively the lowest value for ep indicator e g 4 21 10 2 kg po4 3 equivalents per kg phenol is gained by subcase 6aa corresponding to phenol extraction using cyclohexanone cyclohexanone being produced from cyclohexane which in turn is produced from benzene from the total 4 21 10 2 kg po4 3 equivalents per kg phenol the percentage correspondent to solvent production is 90 49 the rest being represented by the steam generation process from natural gas low values for ep impact indicator are also registered for subcase 6ab e g 0 47 10 2 kg po4 3 equivalents per kg phenol from the above mentioned value 0 38 10 2 kg po4 3 equivalents per kg phenol is due to the solvent production while 9 71 10 3 kg po4 3 equivalents per kg phenol is due to the steam production process in subcase 6ab steam is generated from coal relevant substances which influence the ep impact indicator are ammonia and nitrogen oxides for the production of one kg of cyclohexanone for instance the quantities of ammonia and nitrogen oxides released into the atmosphere are the same as those reported in the ap indicator 3 2 4 odp indicator odp indicator has the highest values in subcases 5aa and 5ab in both subcases mibk is obtained from acetone which in turn is obtained from cumene acetone production process using cumene as a raw material is the main responsible for the elevated values of subcases 5aa and 5aa the solvent production contribution to the total odp indicator is about 97 52 in subcase 5aa while in subcase 5ab is about 96 65 hydrogen production followed by steam generation and electricity generation are other processes which have a small contribution on this impact indicator hydrogen was assumed to be produced using mixed technologies i e steam reforming water electrolysis and steam cracking of ethane or naphtha subcases 6aa and 6ab give the lowest values for the odp indicator for instance in subcase 6aa from the total 1 13 10 9 kg r11 equivalents per kg phenol 98 48 is due to the solvent production process the rest being generated by the steam process 3 2 5 adpfossil indicator the highest values for adpfossil indicator are obtained by subcases 2bb and 2ba e g 30 720 mj per kg phenol and 30 712 mj per kg phenol respectively these subcases are defined in table 4 solvent production is the process with major contribution to adpfossil in subcase 2bb toluene production represents 97 87 of the total adpfossil indicator while in subcase 2ba it represents 97 84 of the total adpfossil indicator the lowest values for this indicator are registered in subcases 6aa and 6ab with values about three times lower compared to subcase 2bb 3 2 6 faetp htp and tep impact indicators similar values for the subcases correspondent to each solvent are reported for faetp htp and tep impact categories for instance case 1 subcases 1ba and 1bb have the faetp value around 9 kg 1 4 dcb equivalents per kg phenol this happens because within the same case study the process that mainly contributes to this indicator is the solvent production process which exhibits the same emissions in all subcases correspondent to each case indeed the steam generation process phenol removal and electricity generation process have negligible influence on faetp htp and tep indicators the lowest values for impact indicators are registered for subcases 6aa and 6ab for instance in subcase 6aa the share of the solvent production process to the faetp indicator is as follows from the total 2 52 kg 1 4 dcb equivalents per kg phenol 2 48 kg 1 4 dcb equivalents per kg phenol comes from the solvent production process and the difference is represented by the effluent water stream which contains small traces of solvent if the htp indicator is considered for subcase 6aa from the total value e g 9 18 kg 1 4 dcb equivalents per kg phenol 97 82 is due to the solvent production process and 2 18 is due to the steam generation using natural gas as fuel source 3 2 7 pcop indicator low values for pcop impact indicator are reported in all subcases summarised in table 11 it can be noticed that the subcases corresponding to the same solvent case have the same pcop value this is because the solvent production process which is the major contributor to this impact category has the same impact for the subcases corresponding to each case the lowest values are encountered in subcases 6aa and 6ab e g 0 10 kg ethylene equivalents per kg phenol 3 2 8 maetp impact indicator maetp impact indicator gives also the best results in subcase 6aa e g 7 544 kg 1 4 dcb equivalents per kg phenol followed by 3aa e g 9 606 kg 1 4 dcb equivalents per kg phenol fig 7 presents the main sub processes contributing to maetp indicator as shown in fig 7 the main contributor to maetp indicator is represented by the solvent production followed by the steam production process the highest impact for maetp impact indicator is registered for subcase 2bb counting the best values for all the impact indicators presented in table 11 it can be concluded that i the lowest values for all impact categories are gained by subcase 6aa followed by subcase 6ab ii the next lower values for various impact categories are encountered in subcases 3aa and 7aa iii there is a competition between subcases 3aa and 7aa in fact seven out of ten indicators i e ep ap htp odp pcop maetp and tep score lower values for subcase 3aa while the others three indicators i e gwp adpfossil and faetp are lower for subcase 7aa v the best solvent for phenol removal using liquid liquid extraction is cyclohexanone the regeneration of the solvent should be performed using steam produced from natural gas 4 conclusions seven different solvents i e benzene toluene cyclohexane ethylbenzene mibk cyclohexanone and mesityl oxide employed for treatment of phenol wastewater from an integrated steel plant using liquid liquid extraction are compared in the present study the comparison was performed based on process modelling and simulation data to obtain information for environmental assessment using lca methodology the simulations performed using chemcad process simulator were conducted at the same raw wastewater flowrate of 100 tons h with a phenol content of 0 2 wt representing average industrial data the simulation results show that the best three solvents from the technical viewpoint i e quantity of solvent steam and electricity employed are cyclohexane cyclohexanone and mesityl oxide a sensitivity analysis was also performed on extraction processes exhibiting a relationship between process results and process parameters such as reflux ratio and number of stages in the distillation column material and energy data generated by simulations were then used to perform an environmental evaluation based on lca methodology

13579,the steel industry is currently a major water pollution source releasing high quantities of chemicals one of the pollutants is phenol known for its toxicity even when it is present in low concentrations liquid liquid extraction employing various aromatics and cycloalkanes i e benzene toluene cyclohexane ethylbenzene and ketones i e methyl isobutyl ketone cyclohexanone and mesityl oxide as solvents is studied in the present paper a comparison among the seven solvents is performed based on process modelling simulation tools and life cycle assessment lca the simulations of the seven cases under study are conducted at the same wastewater flowrate of 100 tons h with a phenol content of 0 2 wt and compared using various parameters i e quantity of solvent steam and power used quantity of solvent present in the output phenol streams the simulation results show that the lowest quantity of solvent is registered in the phenol removal which uses cyclohexanone as solvent e g 34 212 40 kg h followed by the case which uses mesityl oxide for the liquid liquid extraction e g 34 759 80 kg h and by the case involving cyclohexanone e g 37 490 60 kg h the lowest steam consumption is registered also in the case of cyclohexanone usage e g 47 56 gj h while the lowest power consumption corresponds to mesityl oxide usage e g 11 20 mj h the simulation results are then used to perform an environmental analysis quantified in terms of environmental key performance indicators embedding several solvents production methods as well as various fuels our life cycle assessment leads to the conclusions that the most environmentally friendly design is phenol removal using cyclohexanone as a solvent whose provision comes from cyclohexane which in turn is produced from benzene in conjunction with steam production from natural gas for instance the lowest global warming potential indicator score is about 342 kg co2 equivalents per kg of phenol while the same indicator for the worst solvent i e toluene produced using reforming technology and steam being produced using hard coal as fuel is almost double e g 341 94 kg co2 equivalents per kg of phenol vs 575 30 co2 equivalents

trichlorofluoromethane tep terrestrial toxicity potential wt weight 1 introduction the efficient removal of toxic substances from industrial wastewater is considered to be a topic of paramount importance and interest 1 wastewaters from different industries can contain different quantities of phenols for instance the concentration of phenol from refineries are in the range 6 500 mg l from cooking operations from 28 to 3900 mg l while the one derived from coal processing is about 9 6800 mg l 2 one of the industries which generates considerable quantities of phenolic wastewater is the iron and steel industry iron and steel industry plays a significant role in the development of a country steel being a valuable construction material steel production process being a raw material and labour intensive process exhibits high energy consumption which is considered one of its major drawbacks it is also known that the environmental emissions from the iron and steel industry are quite significant therefore ecological regulations impose strict limits on iron and steel production phases 3 one crucial step in the steel production process is represented by coke production coke is the main product of the coke production process a cradle to gate life cycle assessment lca study of coke production process focused on blowing cooler system sulphur ammonia and benzene recovery systems was performed by li and co authors 4 despite the broad perspective of the study it does not take into consideration the phenol removal from wastewater besides coke a harmful by products of coke production is represented by coke oven wastewater which contains highly hazardous contaminants such as phenol and other related compounds ammonia thiocyanide cyanide sulphides heterocyclic nitrogenous compounds as well as poly nuclear aromatic compounds 5 6 since phenol is known as a dangerous pollutant due to its strong toxicity for aquatic life and humans alike it is essential to remove it from effluent water the average phenol concentration in wastewater from steel cooking facilities is 2000 mg l equivalent to 0 2 wt which is also used in the simulations presented in this paper furthermore its usage in various industries makes it valuable enough to recover and reuse phenol and its compounds have carcinogenic effects even when they are present in low concentrations 7 consequently in several countries phenol and its compounds have been included into high priority pollutants lists and their removal is considered a necessary task to protect health and ecosystems 8 besides the environmental factor phenol is a valuable chemical for many plastics bisphenol a precursor to polycarbonates and epoxide resins phenolic resins bakelite cyclohexanone precursor to nylon but also herbicides and pharmaceutical drugs aspirin 9 for this reason it s important to recover the phenol from wastewater and reuse it as a raw material many techniques and processes have been employed for treatment of phenolic wastewater as reported in the scientific literature 10 11 these works assign each method to a conventional or advanced category describing principles applications advantages and drawbacks of each technique among the conventional methods a multitude of technologies can be retrieved as shown in fig 1 traditional i steam or azeotropic distillation based on relative volatility of phenol is often used as well as ii extraction of phenol using various solvents for instance cui and co authors studied phenol removal utilizing a mixture of methyl isobutyl ketone mibk and toluene 12 cesari and co authors studied the phenol removal using choline bis trifluoromethylsulfonyl imide as solvent 13 mesityl oxide as a novel extractant was investigated by feng s research group 14 the usage of biomass based solvents for the extraction process was the subject of an interesting research carried out by li and co authors 15 finally liquid liquid ll extraction of phenol using ionic liquid was investigated by sas and co authors 16 conventional methods also include iii adsorption on various substrate e g olive mill solid waste 7 supported nanoparticles 17 or activated carbons 18 iv biological degradation 19 20 v coagulation flocculation 21 and vi chemical oxidation using various substances such as ferrate based 22 or permanganate based chemicals 23 due to the great interest around the phenol removal from wastewater more advanced techniques dedicated to this purpose have been studied by numerous research groups concerning oxidations phenomena advanced processes comprehend fenton and electro fenton 24 25 peroxide usage 26 27 wet air oxidation 28 ozone oxidation 29 electrochemical oxidation 30 steam plasma jet degradation 31 photocatalytic oxidation 32 and uv h2o2 treatment 33 another advanced application contemplates the phenol removal using membrane based separations 34 35 a selection of notable examples includes extractive membrane bioreactors 36 trickle bed reactor reverse osmosis process 37 nanofiltration 38 pervaporation 39 photocatalytic membrane reactors 40 and membrane distillation 41 our attention was focused on the ll extraction method its fundamentals reside on the basic separation of the wastewater stream into two or more effluent streams depending whether the wastewater contains high quantities of other pollutants and if the processes take place all at once one of which must contain the target compound which is represented by phenol in our study 42 the ll process generally exhibits three main stages the actual pollutant extraction solute removal and solvent recovery the critical step in the design of a ll separation process is the identification of the most suitable solvent the best way to undertake solvent screening is to rely on molecular modeling methods for the in silico estimation of the relevant thermodynamic properties chen and co authors used conductor like screening model segment activity coefficient cosmo sac model for screening solvents to extract phenol from aqueous solutions 43 they compared commonly used solvents taken from different families namely alkanes arenes alcohols ethers esters and ketones cosmo sac is a quantum mechanics method for thermodynamic properties estimation which adopts the chemical structure of the molecules and does not employ any adjustable parameter for the estimation of mixture properties 44 45 solvent screening can be easily accomplished by comparing selectivity and solvent power both quantities can be calculated for infinite dilution activity coefficients of solvents in water and in phenol the solvent screening performed by chen and co authors 43 highlights a preference for ketones ethers and esters for phenol extraction due to their relatively high distribution coefficients and selectivity however since extraction operations are industrially conducted above 333 k esters and ethers become unsuitable due to the formation of azeotropes with water at working temperatures for these reasons we decided to focus on three industrially employed ketones i e mibk mesityl oxide and cyclohexanone comparing their performance with traditional solvents such as benzene toluene cyclohexane and ethylbenzene this paper aims at comparing technically but also from an environmental standpoint ll extraction method using different solvents the comparison between different solvents for ll extraction applications taking into account their molecular structure their efficiencies 43 their price and their environmental impact 46 have already been performed by other research groups the production technologies of the solvents the production of steam used for solvent recovery as well as the electricity generation to run the machineries was not included yet in the environmental analysis this is fundamental in order to reach a broad perspective of the whole supply chain of the system 2 methods and tools 2 1 processes description and modelling assumptions seven cases of phenol removal from wastewater using ll extraction are discussed in the present paper a flowrate of 100 tons h of raw wastewater is considered in each case in order to be able to compare them the chosen flowrate represents an average value for a coke wastewater plant 47 the initial phenol concentration in the wastewater is assumed to be 2000 mg l the goal is to reduce the phenol concentration under 0 2 mg l this value representing the european limit for phenol in wastewater 48 all the simulations presented were performed using chemcad 49 process simulator software version 6 5 6 two categories of solvents have been chosen to perform the ll extraction of phenol as shown in table 1 the first category is represented by aromatics and cycloalkanes such as benzene toluene ethylbenzene cyclohexane cases 1 4 which are quite common solvents the second category is represented by ketones such as mibk cyclohexanone and mesityl oxide cases 5 7 high distribution coefficients high selectivities and high solvent power to extract phenol from water are reported in the scientific literature for this category of solvents 43 stressing their importance as promising substances for phenol extraction next section contains several details about the cases under investigation phenol extraction with various solvents is schematically represented in fig 2 this plant model uses a ll extractor where the solvent removes phenol from wastewater the phenolic water is fed to the plant at 30 c from the top of the extractor while the solvent enters from the bottom both at atmospheric pressure the phenol is extracted at the top of the ll extractor the obtained stream containing a mixture of phenol and solvent enters the solvent recovery column concentrated phenol is obtained as a residue while the solvent is recovered as distillate and recycled water stream mixed with some solvent from the bottom of the ll extractor is then sent to the raffinate column almost pure water is obtained at the bottom of this column the recycled solvent stream from the solvent recovery column is pumped and mixed with the raffinate column distillate stream and integrated with solvent make up the mixed solvent stream is cooled down to 30 c in a heat exchanger and sent to the ll extractor low pressure steam is used in the raffinate and solvent recovery distillation columns the assumptions used in process modelling and simulation are summarised in table 2 the thermodynamic model chosen for describing the cases under study is non random two liquid nrtl which has been selected based on the components and plant operation conditions i e temperature and pressure nrtl binary interaction parameters have been taken form the chemcad internal data base and checked versus phase equilibria data vapour liquid equilibria vle and liquid liquid equilibria lle the nrtl model is able to represent vle quite well and gives the correct size and shape of the miscibility gap for all the ternary diagrams considered in this work for the binary lle the model shows an average relative deviation of solubility mole fraction in the aqueous phase of 0 54 average among the seven water solvents systems with a maximum value of 3 2 table 3 2 2 environmental evaluation using life cycle assessment lca lca methodology is focused on the evaluation of the environmental impacts generated by manufacturing usage and disposal of products materials and chemicals its principles and procedures are reported in the international standard organization iso series 14 040 guidelines 50 51 allowing the estimation of the emissions regarding each environmental compartment i e soil water and atmosphere it is based on the material and energy balances related to the overall life cycle of the product system under investigation which comprehends extraction of raw materials manufacturing distribution use phase recycling final disposal and the transportations between life cycle stages 52 the results of life cycle studies are presented using various environmental indicators which encompass a multitude of environmental issues avoiding burden shifting among the environmental compartments the lca methodology as extensively discussed on a series of publications 53 54 prescribes the fulfilment of four stages as follows 1 goal and scope definition this stage requires the practitioner to specify the aim of the study the system boundaries the quality of data source the assumptions and limitations introduced and the functional unit i e the amount of final product on which the life cycle input output streams are normalized 2 life cycle inventory analysis lci during this step the practitioner needs to collect the mass and energy balances of the product system under investigation the employment of primary data is preferred since actual process data provide highest accuracy in comparison to secondary data which are retrieved on acknowledged databases i e ecoinvent 55 or gabi 56 3 life cycle impact assessment lcia this phase assigns specific environmental impacts to inventory data through recognized characterization factors which typify the contribution of each substance to a determined impact category providing harmonization on a shared unit of measure 4 life cycle interpretation this stage provides an evaluation of the results obtained by previous steps although the interpretation comes last it embeds the overall lca procedure including comments and recommendations adapted to the goal and scope previously defined usually sensitivity analysis and uncertainty are assessed during this phase 57 gabi software was used to perform the present lca study gabi is one of the most popular decision support lca software for product sustainability used in numerous applications such as design products for low environmental impact improve efficiency or develop profiles of carbon water and product environmental footprints 56 the functional unit to which all the quantities are reported is one kilogram of phenol extracted the plant is considered to be located in central europe material and energy balances derived from the simulation phase 58 as well as data from the gabi database are used in the present lca study the present lca study envisages a cradle to gate perspective considering all the life cycle phases from resource extraction cradle to the production plant gate before entering the market the assessment performed in the current research study considers the production of the solvents i e benzene toluene cyclohexane ethylbenzene mibk cyclohexanone and mesityl oxide the production of steam used to recover the solvents after the extraction phase as well as the production of electricity to run the machineries the production technologies of the solvents as well as the production of steam used for solvent recovery but also the electricity production to run the machineries were not considered in the environmental analysis performed by other research groups the authors consider that the inclusion of these aspects in the environmental evaluation is fundamental in order to reach a broad perspective of the whole supply chain of the system the cases which are taken into consideration as well as the boundary conditions are presented in figs 3 and 4 some details regarding figs 3 and 4 and the cases under study considered in the lca should be provided i the first number in each case study denotes the solvent used for phenol extraction as reported in table 4 ii the production technologies for the solvents are denoted with capital letters i e a b c and d where a represents benzene or toluene production from pyrolysis fuel cyclohexane from benzene ethylbenzene production mix mibk from acetone acetone from cumene etc iii the fuel used for the steam generation necessary for solvent recovery is denoted with small letters i e a for natural gas b for hard coal and c for biomass according to table 4 for instance case 1aa represents phenol extraction using benzene as a solvent benzene being produced from pyrolysis fuel and steam is produced from natural gas case 2bc represents phenol removal using toluene as a solvent toluene being produced using reforming technology and steam is produced using biomass as a fuel case 5ab represents phenol extraction using mibk as a solvent mibk being produced from acetone acetone in turn is produced from cumene and steam is produced from hard coal case 7bc represents phenol removal using mesityl oxide as a solvent mesityl oxide being produced from acetone acetone is produced from isopropanol and steam is produced using biomass as fuel a total number of 42 subcases have been defined for the lca comparison the subcases are distributed as presented in table 5 details regarding the technologies used for solvent production are provided in table 6 table 7 contains details regarding the lca assumptions for steam production using three different sources i e natural gas hard coal and biomass lci is the lca phase focused on the quantification of inputs and outputs data 59 due to the vast amount of data used in the present analysis for all the subcases a relevant example of an lci used in the present study can be found in table 8 after the inputs and outputs quantification the next step of an lca study is represented by the lcia phase the cml 2001 method assessment available in gabi software 56 was used for environmental evaluation and comparison our choice is based on two fundamental reasons 1 we wanted to avoid the subjectivity and uncertainty of endpoint approach and 2 cml 2001 has been recognized as one of the most well established and world widely used methodology 60 the method was developed by the university of leiden netherlands and it considers the following impact categories global warming potential gwp acidification potential ap eutrophication potential ep ozone depletion potential odp aquatic depletion potential adp freshwater aquatic toxicity potential faetp human toxicity potential htp photochemical oxidation potential pcop terrestrial toxicity potential tep and marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential maetp 61 life cycle interpretation is the technique used for identifying quantifying checking and evaluating the lca results useful conclusions and recommendations for the study are the main outputs of the interpretation phase the interpretation of the environmental indicators is presented in section 3 the present study is subjected to the following limitations we do not envisage the production of the machinery for solvents production as well as the machinery used in the extraction process the construction of infrastructure or the construction of trains and trucks for transportation however the impacts related to machinery production looks negligible in relation with the functional unit endorsed in our study therefore the results are not considerably influenced by this assumption 3 results and discussions 3 1 results and discussions on process modelling and simulation the raw wastewater stream is set to 100 tons h for all cases with a phenol content representing 0 2 wt the goal in all cases is to lower the phenol concentration in the clean water under 20 mg l parameters such as solvent power and selectivity play a crucial role in removal efficiency table 9 reports the input output streams of each process simulation it is possible to notice how the raw wastewater input stream is the same in all seven cases e g 200 kg h of phenol and 99 800 kg h of water and that different quantities of solvents are needed for each extraction the lowest quantity of solvent is used in case 6 e g 34 212 40 kg h which uses cyclohexanone as solvent followed by case 7 e g 34 759 80 kg h which employs mesityl oxide and by case 3 e g 37 490 60 kg h using cyclohexane the highest quantity of solvent is used in case 2 toluene being the solvent for ll extraction it can be also noticed that higher quantities of solvents are present in the phenol stream when aromatics are used in comparison with ketones the higher quantities of solvents present in the output phenol streams in the aromatics cycloalkanes cases lead to lower quality of the output phenol stream the exception is represented by cyclohexane case 3 when 1 12 kg h of cyclohexane is found on the final phenol stream considering the ketones cases the lowest quantity of solvent retrieved in the phenol stream appears in case 7 e g 0 47 kg h when mesityl oxide is used table 10 shows the steam and electricity consumptions for all cases under study it can be noticed that the lowest steam consumption is obtained in case 3 e g 47 56 gj h while the highest steam consumption is obtained in case 5 case 7 when mesityl oxide is used has the lowest value for power consumption e g 11 20 mj h in a power consumption ranking case 7 is followed by case 6 e g 18 79 mj h and by case 3 e g 28 13 mj h cases 3 6 and 7 seem to be the best options considering the lowest quantity of solvent employed and the lowest power consumption taking into account also the steam consumption for case 7 and case 6 these quantities are higher compared to case 3 the final decision on the best solvent will be based on the technical evaluation as well as on the environmental one sensitivity analysis performed on extraction processes of interest indicates that as expected all processes are sensitive to reflux ratio and number of stages in the distillation column the reflux ratio was modified with 5 with respect to the original value the same range being also valid for the number of stages the effects of these modifications are similar for all the systems investigated in this work and can be summarized in the graphs in figs 5 and 6 the main effects of the sensitivity studies are that energy consumption depends on both the reflux ratio and the number of stages while phenol purity is not affected and the solvent lost in water phase is negligible this is valid for all the systems investigated 3 2 results and discussions on environmental assessment environmental evaluation results were generated using gabi software version 8 for each of the 42 subcases the results for the seven cases and 42 subcases are reported in the supplementary information material as a first task all the subcases correspondent to each case were compared and the best two configurations for each solvent were selected for further comparison see table 11 for instance for case 1 the lowest values for all impact categories are obtained in subcases 1ba and 1bb see table s1 these cases correspond to phenol extraction using benzene as a solvent benzene being produced via reforming and steam being produced from natural gas i e subcase 1ba or from hard coal i e subcase 1bb from table s1 it can also be noticed a competition between subcases 1bb and 1bc where steam is produced from biomass even if lower values for gwp impact and adpfossil indicators can be noticed in subcase 1bc all the other impact categories are lower in subcase 1bb consequently subcases 1ba and 1bb were chosen as best subcases for case 1 the same conclusions are valid for case 2 the environmental results for case 2 are reported in table s2 the best values are observed in subcases 2ba and 2bb these subcases correspond to phenol extraction using toluene as solvent toluene being produced using reforming technology and steam being produced from natural gas or from hard coal when case 3 is considered see table s3 the lowest values for nine out of ten impact indicators i e ap ep odp adpfossil faetp htp pcop tep maetp are obtained by subcases 3aa and 3ab these correspond to phenol extraction using cyclohexane as a solvent cyclohexane being produced from benzene and the steam used to regenerate the cyclohexane comes from natural gas i e subcase 3aa or from hard coal i e subcase 3ab the same conclusion is valid for case 4 when ethylbenzene is used as a solvent for phenol removal the best two subcases belonging to case 4 are subcase 4aa and 4ab see table s4 for case 5 the environmental indicators are reported in table s5 the best two subcases from the six subcases considered appear in subcases 5aa and 5ab mibk is used as a solvent in subcases 5aa and 5ab the solvent is produced from acetone acetone being produced from cumene the steam requested in the proposed processes is considered to be generated using natural gas i e subcase 5aa or hard coal i e subcase 5ab as fuels analysing case 6 see table s6 when cyclohexanone is used as a solvent for phenol extraction the best subcases are represented by 6aa and 6ab cyclohexane is produced from benzene and steam as in the previous cases is produced from natural gas or from hard coal table s7 summarizes the environmental indicators for case 7 from the six subcases taken into account the best values are obtained by subcase 7aa and 7ab mesityl oxide is produced from cumene steam from natural gas and from hard coal is used in subcase 7aa and 7ab respectively discussions about the best values obtained in all seven cases are presented in the next section see table 11 3 2 1 gwp indicator discussing the values reported in table 11 it can be noticed that the highest gwp is obtained in subcase 2bb e g 575 30 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol followed by subcase 4ab e g 572 46 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol the major contributors to the gwp values are the toluene production process using reforming technology for subcase 2bb and ethylbenzene production process using technology mix for subcase 4ab toluene production using reforming technology contributes with 88 74 to the total 575 30 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol while ethylbenzene production represents 92 34 of the total 572 46 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol a common characteristic of 2bb and 4ab subcases is the utilisation of hard coal for steam generation indeed higher amounts of co2 are released when hard coal is used compared to the subcases when natural gas or biomass are involved in steam generation from the total gwp values previously mentioned steam generation contributes with 11 26 in subcase 2bb while the same process contributes with 7 66 in subcase 4ab among the other cases the lowest values are obtained in subcase 6aa e g 341 94 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol followed by subcase 6ab e g 364 71 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol subcase 6aa correspond to phenol extraction using cyclohexanone cyclohexanone being produced from cyclohexane which in turn is produced from benzene the percentage correspondent to solvent production to the total 341 94 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol is 88 65 the rest being represented by the steam generation using natural gas an interesting discussion between the gwp indicators obtained in case 3 and case 6 is presented in the next section the two cases refer to the usage of cyclohexane as solvent for ll extraction respectively the usage of cyclohexanone which is derived from cyclohexane differences in the gwp indicator between cyclohexane case 3 and cyclohexanone case 6 come from different quantities of solvent steam and electricity used in the two cases in the cylohexane case i e case 3aa a gravity analysis on the gwp value e g 406 04 and 341 94 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol for cases 3aa and 6aa respectively provides the following evidences 387 40 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol correspond to cyclohexane production 18 6 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol is due to steam production and a small quantity corresponds to electricity generation in the cylohexanone case i e case 6aa the total gwp value e g 341 94 kg co2 equivalents kg phenol is the sum of 303 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol which corresponds to solvent production 38 8 kg co2 equivalents per kg phenol coming from steam production and the rest is generated by electricity production in the cyclohexane case case 3 from table 3 it can be noticed that the quantity of solvent stream to the extractor including recycling is 37 491 kg h while for cyclohexanone case 6 is 34 213 kg h these recycled streams contain 37 479 75 kg h of pure cyclohexane component weight is 99 97 respectively about 27 076 17 kg h of pure cyclohexanone component weight is 79 14 these quantities of pure solvent will be the major contributor to the gwp indicator considering steam consumption see table 10 the quantity of steam used in case 3 is lower compared to the quantity of steam used in case 6 e g 17 844 10 kg h vs 37 172 40 kg h consequently a higher gwp due to steam production is obtained for case 6 considering electricity consumption see table 10 for case 3 when cyclohexane is used as a solvent for phenol extraction the total electricity consumption is 34 26 mj h in case 6 when cyclohexanone is used for phenol removal the electricity consumption will be lower compared to case 3 e g 31 56 mj h vs 34 26 mj h 3 2 2 ap indicator the highest values for ap indicator correspond to subcases 4ab and 4aa e g 1 77 kg so2 equivalents per kg phenol respectively 1 73 kg so2 equivalents per kg phenol ethylbenzene is used as a solvent in both subcases ethylbenzene being produced using mix technology in subcase 4ab hard coal is the steam source while in subcase 4aa natural gas is the fuel source for steam generation solvent production process contributes with 92 34 in subcase 4ab with 95 in subcase 4aa to the total ap indicator value relevant substances which influence the ap indicator are sox nox hcl hf and nh3 for ethylbenzene case according to thinkstep database for one kg of solvent 2 85 10 3 kg of no2 4 06 10 2 kg of so2 2 83 10 5 kg of hcl and 1 06 10 6 kg hf 8 32 10 9 kg ammonia are released into the air lower values for this impact indicator are obtained in subcases 6aa e g 0 42 kg so2 equivalents per kg phenol and 6ab e g 0 47 kg so2 equivalents per kg phenol for instance ap obtained in subcase 6aa is more than four times lower than the highest value e g 0 42 kg so2 equivalents per kg phenol vs 1 77 kg so2 equivalents per kg phenol while ap obtained in subcase 6ab is decreased by a factor of 3 77 compared to the highest value e g 0 47 kg so2 equivalents per kg phenol vs 1 77 kg so2 equivalents per kg phenol in both subcases 6aa and 6ab phenol is extracted using cyclohexanone cyclohexanone being produced from cyclohexane which in turn is produced from benzene different steam sources are used in these subcases in particular natural gas is used in subcase 6aa and hard coal is used in subcase 6ab solvent production process contributes with 93 73 in subcase 6aa and 82 76 in subcase 6ab in the cyclohexanone case for the production of one kg of cyclohexanone 1 38 10 3 kg of no2 1 28 10 3 kg of so2 6 00 10 6 kg of hcl and 1 43 10 10 kg hf 9 11 10 6 kg ammonia are released into the air 3 2 3 ep indicator according to table 11 high values for eutrophication potential impact indicator are obtained in subcases 4ab and 4aa e g 11 20 10 2 kg po4 3 equivalents per kg phenol 10 80 10 2 kg po4 3 equivalents per kg phenol respectively the lowest value for ep indicator e g 4 21 10 2 kg po4 3 equivalents per kg phenol is gained by subcase 6aa corresponding to phenol extraction using cyclohexanone cyclohexanone being produced from cyclohexane which in turn is produced from benzene from the total 4 21 10 2 kg po4 3 equivalents per kg phenol the percentage correspondent to solvent production is 90 49 the rest being represented by the steam generation process from natural gas low values for ep impact indicator are also registered for subcase 6ab e g 0 47 10 2 kg po4 3 equivalents per kg phenol from the above mentioned value 0 38 10 2 kg po4 3 equivalents per kg phenol is due to the solvent production while 9 71 10 3 kg po4 3 equivalents per kg phenol is due to the steam production process in subcase 6ab steam is generated from coal relevant substances which influence the ep impact indicator are ammonia and nitrogen oxides for the production of one kg of cyclohexanone for instance the quantities of ammonia and nitrogen oxides released into the atmosphere are the same as those reported in the ap indicator 3 2 4 odp indicator odp indicator has the highest values in subcases 5aa and 5ab in both subcases mibk is obtained from acetone which in turn is obtained from cumene acetone production process using cumene as a raw material is the main responsible for the elevated values of subcases 5aa and 5aa the solvent production contribution to the total odp indicator is about 97 52 in subcase 5aa while in subcase 5ab is about 96 65 hydrogen production followed by steam generation and electricity generation are other processes which have a small contribution on this impact indicator hydrogen was assumed to be produced using mixed technologies i e steam reforming water electrolysis and steam cracking of ethane or naphtha subcases 6aa and 6ab give the lowest values for the odp indicator for instance in subcase 6aa from the total 1 13 10 9 kg r11 equivalents per kg phenol 98 48 is due to the solvent production process the rest being generated by the steam process 3 2 5 adpfossil indicator the highest values for adpfossil indicator are obtained by subcases 2bb and 2ba e g 30 720 mj per kg phenol and 30 712 mj per kg phenol respectively these subcases are defined in table 4 solvent production is the process with major contribution to adpfossil in subcase 2bb toluene production represents 97 87 of the total adpfossil indicator while in subcase 2ba it represents 97 84 of the total adpfossil indicator the lowest values for this indicator are registered in subcases 6aa and 6ab with values about three times lower compared to subcase 2bb 3 2 6 faetp htp and tep impact indicators similar values for the subcases correspondent to each solvent are reported for faetp htp and tep impact categories for instance case 1 subcases 1ba and 1bb have the faetp value around 9 kg 1 4 dcb equivalents per kg phenol this happens because within the same case study the process that mainly contributes to this indicator is the solvent production process which exhibits the same emissions in all subcases correspondent to each case indeed the steam generation process phenol removal and electricity generation process have negligible influence on faetp htp and tep indicators the lowest values for impact indicators are registered for subcases 6aa and 6ab for instance in subcase 6aa the share of the solvent production process to the faetp indicator is as follows from the total 2 52 kg 1 4 dcb equivalents per kg phenol 2 48 kg 1 4 dcb equivalents per kg phenol comes from the solvent production process and the difference is represented by the effluent water stream which contains small traces of solvent if the htp indicator is considered for subcase 6aa from the total value e g 9 18 kg 1 4 dcb equivalents per kg phenol 97 82 is due to the solvent production process and 2 18 is due to the steam generation using natural gas as fuel source 3 2 7 pcop indicator low values for pcop impact indicator are reported in all subcases summarised in table 11 it can be noticed that the subcases corresponding to the same solvent case have the same pcop value this is because the solvent production process which is the major contributor to this impact category has the same impact for the subcases corresponding to each case the lowest values are encountered in subcases 6aa and 6ab e g 0 10 kg ethylene equivalents per kg phenol 3 2 8 maetp impact indicator maetp impact indicator gives also the best results in subcase 6aa e g 7 544 kg 1 4 dcb equivalents per kg phenol followed by 3aa e g 9 606 kg 1 4 dcb equivalents per kg phenol fig 7 presents the main sub processes contributing to maetp indicator as shown in fig 7 the main contributor to maetp indicator is represented by the solvent production followed by the steam production process the highest impact for maetp impact indicator is registered for subcase 2bb counting the best values for all the impact indicators presented in table 11 it can be concluded that i the lowest values for all impact categories are gained by subcase 6aa followed by subcase 6ab ii the next lower values for various impact categories are encountered in subcases 3aa and 7aa iii there is a competition between subcases 3aa and 7aa in fact seven out of ten indicators i e ep ap htp odp pcop maetp and tep score lower values for subcase 3aa while the others three indicators i e gwp adpfossil and faetp are lower for subcase 7aa v the best solvent for phenol removal using liquid liquid extraction is cyclohexanone the regeneration of the solvent should be performed using steam produced from natural gas 4 conclusions seven different solvents i e benzene toluene cyclohexane ethylbenzene mibk cyclohexanone and mesityl oxide employed for treatment of phenol wastewater from an integrated steel plant using liquid liquid extraction are compared in the present study the comparison was performed based on process modelling and simulation data to obtain information for environmental assessment using lca methodology the simulations performed using chemcad process simulator were conducted at the same raw wastewater flowrate of 100 tons h with a phenol content of 0 2 wt representing average industrial data the simulation results show that the best three solvents from the technical viewpoint i e quantity of solvent steam and electricity employed are cyclohexane cyclohexanone and mesityl oxide a sensitivity analysis was also performed on extraction processes exhibiting a relationship between process results and process parameters such as reflux ratio and number of stages in the distillation column material and energy data generated by simulations were then used to perform an environmental evaluation based on lca methodology different subcases were considered in the lca each one deriving from the combination of various solvent production routes as well as various fuels for steam production details about the lca phases and discussions regarding the most significant environmental indicators i e gwp ap adpfossil faetp htp tep pcop maetp are provided the most environmentally friendly design from the 42 subcases considered was phenol removal using cyclohexanone cyclohexanone being produced from cyclohexane which in turn is produced from benzene the steam used from solvent regeneration using natural gas as raw material
