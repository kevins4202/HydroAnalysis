24360,this article introduces the tropical biomass carbon application the tb c app a web application available on the permanent link www tropicalbiomass com the tb c app requires as input attributes the smallest and largest diameters number of trees ha 1 basal area ha 1 and parameters of the diameter beta distribution describing stand structure the app delivers outputs at two levels 1 stand level including mean aboveground biomass agb and carbon agc in mg ha 1 along with confidence intervals cis as measures of uncertainty and 2 tree level estimates with agb and diameter for every simulated tree phase 1 of the project tb c comprises four brazilian forest and non forest formations campinarana floresta estacional floresta ombrofila and savana this article aims to i describe the algorithm written for the tb c app and ii present results of phase 1 this first phase counts on a standardized database of 1 428 trees with field measured dry agb from plots across the different formations which is the largest tree biomass database compiled so far in brazil model uncertainties were incorporated into the modeling process allowing computation of cis through an uncertainty approach the total variance of residuals of agb was also modeled aiming at predicting cis as a function of the quantity of agb an analysis of reliability of the equations implemented in the tb c app indicates that more than 95 n 64 000 of the true agb s fit into the ci outputted by the tb c app a comparison with other approaches in the literature shows significant agreement with previous estimates and more conservative estimates where previously published estimates disagreed with the tb c app we cite as advantages of the tb c app i reliability of the outputs ii a user friendly layout iii agb and agc estimates provided along with robust cis and iv estimates at the stand and tree levels with consistent totals a biomass dataset containing information on 64 000 plots is also delivered as supplement of this paper keywords web application amazon forest forest carbon aboveground biomass uncertainty analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction forests are known to play important roles in global biogeochemical cycles especially in the carbon c cycle dixon et al 1994 brown et al 1993 houghton 2003a forests cover 31 of the world s total land area totaling about 4 06 billion hectares fao unep 2020 forests and forest soils are large c pools especially tropical forests morais et al 2020 david et al 2017 and deforestation of them is emitting increasingly more c into the atmosphere brown et al 1993 houghton 2003b this means that global warming forecasts and climate surveys rely on among other things accurate quantification and monitoring of the global forest c le toan et al 2011 more than half of the world s forests are in only five countries the russian federation brazil canada the united states of america and china fao unep 2020 fao 2020 and global surveys e g mitchard et al 2013 saatchi et al 2011 and reports from fao 2020 suggest that the most c stocked forests are situated in the tropics across the tropics forests vary in terms of structure tree density canopy height etc which affect the c stored in them mitchard et al 2013 saatchi et al 2011 and makes forest c stock variation a challenge to quantify for example brazil has a large variation in c stocks observed across its territory nogueira et al 2008 david et al 2017 including large portions of the amazon as well as lesser known areas with lower forest c storage e g savannah david et al 2017 with knowledge of the different types of forest species composition and structure forest c storage can be better estimated using forest type specific modeling henry et al 2015 jara et al 2015 the tropical biomass carbon hereafter tb c project introduced here offers an interactive open access web application the tb c app built with a robust modeling technique the main purpose of the project is to help researchers by providing estimates of aboveground biomass agb and carbon agc with more reliability than approaches which don t consider forest type variability the tb c app also outputs confidence intervals cis for agb and agc based on a model uncertainty analysis delivering estimates of forest biomass and carbon along with cis is very important to accurately characterize uncertainties in estimates qin et al 2020 fu et al 2017 in recent years generic and global equations have been increasingly more used citing the pan tropical biomass equation from chave et al 2014 and several other equations recommended by fao through sandra brown s surveys e g brown and iverson 1992 brown et al 1989 brown 1977 these broad scale equations are helpful in the absence of published equations and of samples collected more locally however modelers must be aware that misdealing conclusions may be drawn while using generic equations to make predictions beyond broader national levels henry et al 2015 jara et al 2015 for example ngomanda et al 2014 found differences in biomass estimates of 40 between forest specific vs generic models notable differences between two or more biomass models are not uncommon see e g studies by ribeiro et al 2011 and ketterings et al 2001 likely because underlying allometric equations may not agree with each other fearnside 1992 through experience and data analysis we confirmed the existence of many comparable i e recommended for a same forest type equations that do not deliver consistent values for example when we computed the stand level agb sum of agb of all trees in a plot with different equations consulted in the literature the largest differences of agb per unit area showed a twofold difference even some well known biomass equations for moist and wet forests brown 1977 brown and iverson 1992 brown et al 1989 showed significant inconsistencies in agb per unit area nogueira et al 2008 there are many reasons for the discrepancies but one important one is that such equations have been calibrated using different datasets another reason is that forest sites such as those found in the amazon forest have a large agb variability within forests of the same type or successional stages as has been shown in studies by nogueira et al 2015 malhi et al 2006 and houghton et al 2001 following henry et al 2015 and jara et al 2015 the tb c was derived from the belief that global forest c stocks could be better predicted if every country had its own forest specific equations our aim in this paper is to present results of phase 1 of the tb c as well as disclosing the algorithm of the tb c app tips for use limitations and other issues related to the application are also addressed this paper also provides a new biomass dataset informing forest variables at the plot level resulting from simulations involving the bootstrap technique 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the brazilian institute of statistical geography acronym ibge classifies the terrestrial vegetation of brazil into six large national forest and non forest formations campinarana floresta estacional floresta ombrofila savana estepe and vegetation with marine influence ibge 2012 the first four comprise our study area for phase 1 of the tb c project campinarana floresta estacional floresta ombrofila and savana together cover an area of 4 390 652 km² mapa 2020 representing 51 5 of the brazilian territory information on these national formations is described in the supplement to this paper supplemental section 1 2 2 data our database is a compilation of tree samples selected in the four forest and non forest remnants located in the four national formations studied here about 62 of our database comes from brazilian research on forest biomass while the remaining 38 data is a subset of the global database published by chave et al 2014 see table 1 s for more information related to data sources and visit www tropicalbiomass com to locate the sample areas on the map of brazil samples were taken within nine brazilian states amazonas mato grosso minas gerais pará paraná rio grande do sul rondônia roraima and santa catarina following definitions stated in fao 2004 these remnants differ in 1 successional stage varying from young to climax vegetation and 2 type of vegetation including primary secondary and modified natural forest at least 21 among 31 remnants had past natural and or human disturbances e g wildfire presence of cattle observed when field data were collected one remark is that wildfires commonly occur in savanas and campinaranas either naturally or human induced santana et al 2018 silveira et al 2016 ramos neto and pivello 2000 tree samples allowed in the database were constrained in three ways first no tree sample could come from forest plantations or agroforestry systems this constraint was imposed due to expected differences in bole and crown shapes that trees may assume while growing in natural forest formations in relation to human altered vegetation which affect allometric scaling relationships ali et al 2019 pretzsch et al 2015 goodman et al 2014 the second condition is that tree agb had to be directly measured weighed on a scale and not converted from volume to biomass using a mean wood density or estimated with biomass equations third we limited our database to woody self standing tree species only the mass of other aboveground forest components including shrub like and herbaceous species palms and ferns litter or any dead mass were not included in this study all trees were felled and had their fresh agb measured in field including trunk branches and leaves fresh samples of these tree compartments were collected and taken to a laboratory for kiln drying then dry agb of the trees was obtained from fresh field measured weights and lab measured moisture content the number of trees sampled by forest non forest formation is presented in table 1 as well as the main descriptive statistics of sample trees dry agb tree diameter and total height except for the campinarana formation trees were sampled in at least two subclasses of forest non forest see table 1s for more details for campinarana and savana tree diameter is 1 cm whereas for floresta estacional and floresta ombrofila diameters are 5 cm the rationality in considering two minimum diameters is because the diameter structures of campinarana and savana especially campinarana are largely composed by many thin trees in relation to floresta estacional and floresta ombrofila tree stem diameters were measured at breast height dbh 1 3 m above base except in campinarana where diameter was measured at ground level denoted as d0 because trees with bole taller than 1 3 m are scarce studies as sullivan et al 2018 chave et al 2014 and feldpausch et al 2011 were our reference for stablishing the minimum diameters fig 1s illustrates allometric relationships between dry agb in the ln scale and total height as a function of tree diameter 2 3 the tb c application 2 3 1 general information for users the tb c app is an interactive web application programmed in r using the r package shiny chang et al 2020 the tb c app visit https www tropicalbiomass com to use the application allows users to set the input attributes related to stand and tree variables see upper half of table 2 s and outputs biomass and carbon at stand and tree levels see lower half of table 2s the tb c app is designed to provide easily and quickly estimates of agb and agc with more reliability than unspecific approaches the app also outputs cis for agb and agc based on a model uncertainty analysis the app requires that users a select one of the four forest non forest formations b select the level of information stand or diameter class desired for the output attributes c insert information from census or sample based inventory of the trees observed in the forest e g diameter range and tree density and d select parameters α and β of the beta distribution see how to obtain parameters α and β in the discussion section under tips for use the beta distribution was adopted as the probability density function p d f to portray the diameter distribution of the forest chosen for its flexibility and because it allows the lower and upper diameters of the distribution to be set to predict forest biomass and carbon for any stem diameter range the outputs of the tb c app are delivered at two levels stand and tree which are described in the sections that follow 2 3 2 stand level outputs of the tb c app the major stand level outputs of the tb c app are a table of stand level biomass and carbon in mg ha 1 and their uncertainties as well as basal area in ha 1 this includes an illustration of the diameter distribution of the forest whose shape is sensitive to the parameters α and β of the beta distribution and whose range is controlled by the smallest and largest diameters specified 2 3 2 1 algorithm for implementation the following subsections describes the step by step process for reproducing the algorithm implemented for stand level outputs an overview of it is presented in fig 1 a tree selection and plot simulation we developed an approach that combines monte carlo mc simulation and bootstrapping techniques to select trees from our database and then simulate 1 ha plots the idea was first to simulate field plots via mc simulation with tree dbhs following the beta distribution gupta and nadarajah 2004 and second to select trees via bootstrap from the database obeying the dbh distribution of the simulated plots simulated 1 ha plots were created in accordance with the parameters of the beta distribution generating the number of trees ha 1 within dbh classes the role of this was to ensure that all possible combinations of stand attributes set by the user in the tb c app were captured the following steps describe the algorithm for selecting trees from our database used to simulate the plots i combine the parameters of the beta distribution eq 1 assuming α β 0 5 1 0 2 0 5 0 this step creates 24 16 combinations of α β 1 f x α β γ α β γ α γ β x α 1 1 x β 1 where 0 x 1 α and β are parameters of the distribution ii for the p th combination of parameters obtained in step i create a random size n vector x that follows the beta distribution where n is a random number between 100 3 000 that represents the number of trees ha 1 iii obtain x x d where x is a size n vector of dbhs and d is a random number between the minimum and maximum dbhs observed in the forest non forest formation table 1 iv split the dbh distribution observed in x into 10 equal size classes v for every dbh class select randomly with replacement trees from the database obeying the frequency of the class vi replicate steps i v 1 000 times vii repeat steps i vi for every forest non forest formation the seven steps above provide 16 000 replications per forest non forest formation 64 000 in total which corresponds to the set of simulated plots note that these plots differ from each other in tree density diameter range and shape of the diameter distribution curve next for the j th simulated plot we computed agb in mg ha 1 eq 2 basal area in m² ha 1 eq 3 lorey s height eq 4 and number of trees n j the application of the lorey s height follows what saatchi et al 2011 recommend 2 a g b j i 1 n j b t r e e i j 1 000 3 b a j π i 1 n j d b h i j 2 40 000 4 h l o r e y j i 1 n j d b h i j 2 h t i j i 1 n j d b h i j 2 where b t r e e i j dry agb in kg of the i th tree in the j th plot d b h i j is diameter at breast height in cm of the i th tree in the j th plot h t i j is total height in m of the i th tree in the j th plot n j is the number of trees in the j th plot π is the constant pi for campinarana d b h i j is replaced by d 0 i j b stand level modeling and uncertainty analysis the next procedure is to test predictions of agb in mg ha 1 from stand level models we examined the contribution of the set of variables ba hlorey n available to predict agb per unit area and noted that the lorey s height plays an important role in the modeling confirming mitchard et al 2013 s and saatchi et al 2011 s statements to this effect we also noted that each forest non forest formation has its own pattern of lorey s height differing in sill elevation of stand agb as fig 2s supplementary file shows this observation reveals a variation in height among the formations as reported in other studies as sullivan et al 2018 and feldpausch et al 2011 with this we noticed that the agb in mg ha 1 should be modeled through specific to formation models after testing a large number of models and settings for variables in the agb modeling we observed two important issues first the lorey s height had no longer significant contribution in the modeling when ba and n were input variables this occurred because the formation type grouping sufficiently homogenized the data in terms of lorey s height second we verified that the agb model performed much better while using the ln ln scale as also reported in many studies especially in chave et al 2014 the best performing model for all forest non forest formations is presented in eq 5 from this model specific to formation agb equations were obtained 5 l n a g b j β 0 β 1 ln b a j β 2 l n n j ε where β i model parameters ε model residual eq 5 was chosen among the various models tested giving priority to the best residual dispersion and the lowest residual standard error to fit eq 5 we implemented an algorithm for executing modeling with uncertainty the latter based on the m out of n bootstrap bickel et al 1994 bickel and ren 1995 those plots simulated in the previous subsection corresponded to our bootstrapped samples the part of the algorithm that generates the model coefficients can be reproduced as follows i split randomly the set of simulated plots ntotal 16 000 per forest non forest formation into two portions 70 for model calibration ncalib 11 200 per formation and 30 for model validation nvalid 4 800 per formation ii for the calibration dataset obtain r a g b j m a x a g b j λ where m a x a g b j is the maximum a g b j in the dataset and λ is a random number between 1 10 iii from the calibration dataset select randomly with replacement nselected plots with a g b j r a g b where nselected is a random number between 100 300 iv use the subset selected in the earlier step for fitting eq 5 and obtain β i v repeat step ii iv for the validation dataset the idea with steps ii iii is to force biomass variability from low to high stock the m out of n bootstrap in our case n ntotal and m nselected was chosen rather than the original bootstrap technique mainly as a means of mitigating the computation burden caused by the size of ntotal the arbitrary definition of nselected see step iii comes from the good performance of the approximation m n seen in section 4 of bickel and ren 1995 the following steps give continuity to the algorithm and are followed to compute cis for agb and agc with model uncertainty quantification the method we applied to compute ci is based on rubin 1987 p 75 81 proper for surveys with replications vi apply β i obtained in step iv in the validation dataset for estimating agb in mg ha 1 i e a g b j vii for the validation dataset take the pairs a g b j a g b j in their original scale and obtain q eq 6 q eq 7 and u eq 8 6 q j 1 n s e l e c t e d a g b j n s e l e c t e d 7 q j 1 n s e l e c t e d a g b j n s e l e c t e d 8 u v a r a g b j a g b j n s e l e c t

where q r e p and u r e p parac are respectively q and u of the m th replication x obtain the variance among the m replications i e b m eq 11 and the total variance of q q m i e t m eq 12 11 b m v a r q r e p 12 t m u m 1 1 m b m xi replicate steps ii x 250 times xii repeat steps i xi for every forest non forest formation the role of step viii is to capture m times a certain class of q average quantity of agb step xi is responsible for ensuring that all possible classes of q be captured 250 times each with this the algorithm forces the selection since low to high agb stocks for model calibration providing 250 pairs of q m t m per forest non forest formation the relationship between q m and t m is plotted in fig 3s supplementary file the maximum tm observed in each class of q was selected and then we fit eq 13 using the pairs q m maximum t m 13 l n m a x t m 10 β 0 β 1 ln q m β 2 ε where m a x t m maximum total variance of q q m in eq 13 q m is the estimate of eq 5 in the original scale i e a g b j eq 13 is applied to provide estimates of cis for any quantity of agb and agc computed respectively as in eq 14 and eq 15 the conversion factor 2 1 was applied to convert agb into agc which is a generic factor recommended by ipcc 2006 14 a g b j t v α 2 m a x t m 15 1 2 a g b j t v α 2 m a x t m in eqs 14 15 v m 1 1 1 r 2 r 1 1 m b m u m and 1 α is the confidence level 95 for this study and for users of the tb c app t v can be safely approximated to 1 96 the last estimators we computed were the absolute and relative errors for agb in mg ha 1 respectively expressed by eq 16 and eq 17 16 e a t v α 2 m a x t m 17 e r 100 t v α 2 m a x t m a g b j in brief the mean agb tabulated in stand level outputs of the tb c app is obtained through eq 5 agc is half of agb cis for the mean agb and agc are obtained through eqs 14 15 and the errors are given by eqs 16 17 2 3 2 2 reliability of output attributes the reliability of stand level attributes provided by the tb c app was analyzed this analysis is different from the uncertainty analysis previous subsection where cis and errors were mathematically modeled the aim of the analysis of reliability is to estimate the odds of an observed agb mg ha 1 fitting into the ci delivered by the tb c to that end we used the set of 16 000 per forest non forest formation simulated plots originated in item a subsection 2 3 2 1 recall that the observed true agb in all these simulated plots is known in the first step eq 14 was used to estimate the ci for the agb in mg ha 1 for every simulated plot and then we computed the number of plots whose true value of agb fitted into the ci assuming the observed agb in mg ha 1 obtained as in eq 2 as our reference recall that the full set of 16 000 plots contains a variety of shapes of diameter distribution among plots since parameters α and β ranged between 0 5 5 0 see step i item a subsection 2 3 2 1 in the second analysis we selected from the set of 16 000 plots those plots whose diameter distribution follows the reverse j shaped curve the number of plots in which the true agb fits into the ci was similarly computed we assumed as a reverse j shaped curve any data distribution with combination of parameters α 1 0 and β 2 0 the idea with this is to examine the tb c app s outputs in conditions that resembles tropical forests since the diameter distribution in these forests typically follows the reverse j shaped curve david et al 2019 2 3 2 3 comparison with agb surveys tb c app s outputs were also contrasted with equations estimates from other surveys we consulted the literature aiming to verify if agbs per unit area observed in other studies fit into the ci outputted by the app or if published allometric equations produce agb values statistically similar to the tb c app articles were selected if 1 a g b b a and n were tabulated per unit area in this case we directly inputted the tabulated n and b a into the tb c app and analyzed if the tabulated agb fitted into the ci for the agb 2 tree allometric equations were available in the article when allometric equations were used we summed up the predicted agb of all simulated trees to reach agb per unit area and then verified if this sum fits into the ci for the stand level agb output of the tb c app to compare tb c app s outputs with existing allometric equations we executed four scenarios which can be reproduced by readers to this readers need to access the tb c app permanent link www tropicalbiomass com and setting the input attributes presented in table 4 one remark is that to reach the exact agb estimates presented in table 4 the exact basal area shown in that table must be used we simulated scenarios only for floresta ombrofila given the low availability of biomass equations for the other formations 2 3 3 tree level outputs of the tb c app tree level outputs of the tb c app see table 2s characterize the diameter and agb of all trees of the simulated stands these trees are the same as those in the diameter distribution at the stand level described in the previous section 2 3 3 1 algorithm for implementation tree level modeling tree level modeling is possible because the algorithm of the tb c app generates a set of tree diameters see step iii item a subsection 2 3 2 1 whenever it is run this means that the algorithm outlined for the app allows one to estimate tree agb as a function of tree diameter however studies such as feldpausch et al 2011 2012 have demonstrated the important contribution of the total height of the trees as an auxiliary predictor in tree agb models we followed the methods delineated by feldpausch et al 2012 to predict tree height as a function tree diameter to be next inputted into the tree agb model we tested the same functions described in feldpausch et al 2012 to predict the height diameter relationship these authors eqs 3 5 to predict tree agb we adapted feldpausch et al 2012 s eqs 1 2 adaptations consisted of replacing the predictor specific gravity ρ w by total height in their eq 1 thus eliminating ρ w from their eq 2 both equations became therefore dependent on diameter square and total height of the tree these adaptations were necessary because when the app runs it simulates trees with no knowledge of species genus or family which are the minimum information to estimate ρ w a third model eq 18 was tested in which tree agb was modeled on the ln ln scale as a function of diameter square only 18 ln b t r e e i j β 0 β 1 ln d b h i j 2 ε for campinarana d b h i j is replaced by d 0 i j goodness of fit statistics indicated eq 18 as the best model thus eliminating the need for tree height to be known this finding was similar to the stand level modeling of agb where the lorey s height had little contribution when data were grouped into forest non forest formations eq 18 was fit also using a bootstrap approach the following steps describe the algorithm we utilized i select randomly with reposition n trees from the database n trees is shown in table 1 ii fit eq 18 with the subset created in step i and save model coefficients iii replicate steps i ii 5 000 times iv obtain the average of the model coefficients over replications v repeat steps i iv for every forest non forest formation 2 3 3 2 compatibility of tree and stand level estimates stand level prediction of agb is obtained through eq 5 while tree level agb is estimated through an individual tree equation eq 18 both equations yield different estimates of agbs for a same stand or plot that is a stand level prediction is not exactly the sum of the predictions for the trees to fix this inconsistency we multiplied every tree agb estimated through eq 18 to the correction factor f c j 1 000 a g b j i i n j b t r e e i j being this factor specific to the j th simulated stand or diameter class so the application of f c j in agb estimates at the tree level ensures that outputs at tree and stand levels have compatibility 3 results model fitting validation and comparisons to other approaches 3 1 stand level modeling of agb and maximum t m eqs 19 22 result from the fitting of eq 5 for every forest non forest formation

seasonal forest ombrophilous forest and savannah eqs 19 22 are those used to predict mean agb and agc both in mg ha 1 at the stand level of the tb c app as previously defined the precision inherent to these four equations was measured through underlying models eqs 23 26 stemmed from an uncertainty approach the accuracy of eqs 19 22 can be visually interpreted with assistance of fig 32 this figure shows the observed vs estimated mean agb for every forest non forest formation the accuracy is revealed while comparing the red and green lines in which the more the lines are overlapped the more accurate is the model clearly the best performance in accuracy occurred for campinarana followed by floresta estacional and floresta ombrofila and lastly for savana as expected the loss in accuracy in general soared as the tree agb increased the fittings of eq 13 originated eqs 23 26 that provide the maximum t m s for every forest non forest formation recall in step x item b subsection 2 3 2 1 that

variability of the quantity of agb per unit area see λ employed in step ii item b subsection 2 3 2 1 3 2 reliability of cis and comparison with existing agb surveys eqs 19 22 were used to predict stand agb in the 16 000 simulated plots and then their cis were computed as in eqs 23 26 to measure the reliability of the cis provided by the tb c app we quantified the number of plots which had the observed agb was contained within the ci table 2 presents the expected percentage of estimates of agb per unit area that fits into the ci these results show that our analytical procedure works well for all forest non forest formations with observed agb contained within the predicted cis greater than 95 of the time this finding met or exceeded the 95 probability level assumed when computing the cis see eqs 14 15 savana had a lower performance 95 but only when the reverse j shaped diameter distribution was assumed the results of the comparisons with other agb surveys are shown in table 3 derived from six published studies which had a g b b a and n available the b a and n from these studies were inputted in the tb c app to generate agb estimates and compared to the value published in each study in most cases the estimated agb from other surveys was contained within the ci s for agb produced by the tb c app in areas of higher density both the studies by brun 2004 and souza et al 2011 showed a much higher estimate than that produced by the tb c app in the florestal estacional table 3 the other two studies which differed significantly in agb prediction from the tb c app were in the savana ribeiro et al 2011 showed a much higher estimate and zimbres et al 2020 showed a much lower estimate at about the same basal area and stem density table 3 the second comparative analysis is with published allometric equations six published biomass equations were available for the floresta ombrofila and used to compute agb of trees within four different scenarios simulated in the tb c app table 4 all of the equations were calibrated with destructively measured biomass data collected in forests each equation gives agb as dry mass of trees including bole branches and leaves as output variable and uses diameter squared or not as the input variable in all equations b t r e e is the predicted dry agb in kg and diameters are in cm 1 nogueira et al 2008 felled 262 trees dbh range 5 124

outside the ci for the tb c app the allometric equations gave much higher estimates of agb 3 3 tree level modeling of agb the equations below are results of fittings of eq 18 for every forest non

for the formations are respectively campinarana seasonal forest ombrophilous forest and savannah eqs 27 30 are those used to predict tree agb in kg presented in the tree level outputs of the tb c app fig 34 shows the observed vs estimated tree agb for every forest non forest formation markers of the graphs in fig 4 represent trees of our database n trees is shown in table 1 in regards to the correction factor f c j applied to the tree level estimates based on eqs 27 30 we noted that f c j followed a normal distribution when the 64 000 plots were simulated for campinarana f c j ranged between 0 93 1 16 average 1 07 for floresta estacional values ranged between 0 85 1 25 average 1 02 for floresta ombrofila between 0 83 1 1 28 average 1 07 and for savana f c j varies between 0 64 1 39 average 1 05 the f c j can be interpreted as follows for campinarana the differences between summing up the biomass of the trees in a plot being this biomass estimated through a tree level model and estimating the plot agb directly through a stand level model vary from 7 0 93 1 00 0 07 100 to 16 1 16 1 00 0 16 100 with an overall difference of 7 1 07 1 00 0 07 100 such differences were a bit larger for floresta estacional 15 25 followed by floresta ombrofila 17 28 and savana 36 39 4 discussion the tb c app can be applied to generate specific estimates of forest biomass and carbon in tropical forests and other treed landscapes in brazil the tb c app has several advantages over other available approaches the app is a user friendly tool that requires only easily obtained input attributes of the forest such as the smallest and largest diameters and number of trees which are routinely assessed in forest inventories unlike for example the well known pantropical biomass equation by chave et al 2014 which requires tree height and wood density the app also provides agb and agc estimates along with cis that are robustly derived from the bootstrap technique involving iterative programming processes another important attribute is the compatibility of the estimates at the stand and tree levels such that stand level estimates generate realistic tree level information and tree level data can be aggregated at the stand level this is an important benefit for forest biomass and carbon assessments because it allows for example that users implement their own algorithm to reproduce the app s estimates of i agb and agc per unit area using eqs 19 22 ii cis for agb and agc per unit area replacing eqs 23 26 in respectively eqs 14 15 and iii tree agb using eqs 27 30 finally all the estimation processes are rapidly computed and with low computational burden in the reminder of the discussion we address the following issues 1 tips for using the app 2 limitations of the app 3 limitations to the uncertainty analysis and 4 reliability of the tb c app tips for using the app when making stand level estimates the user should make sure that b a and n observed in the forest or diameter class are exactly those inputted in the app n can be simply set by using the slide bar ad hoc b a however can be adjusted by changing the smallest and largest diameters n and parameters α and β the b a outputted by the app should be set exactly equal or as close as possible to the b a observed in the forest plots the importance of inputting the most exact values of b a and n possible is because the mean agb is modeled as a function of these two variables see eqs 19 22 at the tree level users should ensure that the diameter distribution of the observed forest is faithfully depicted in the tb c app for this all input attributes are important especially parameters of the beta distribution users may either estimate α and β by parameterization of the beta p d f see applications in lima et al 2015 burkhart and tomé 2012 p 261 298 and zheng and zhou 2010 or approximate them by comparing the diameter distribution depicted in the app with that one observed in their forest plots this last option is simpler and easier and should deliver results generally good enough in general more accurate characterizations of diameter distributions should generate more reliable tree level predictions of agb and agc limitations of the app the main limitations to the tb c app are the underlying data which still has some gaps for example not all subclasses of campinarana and savana see subclasses in table 1s supplementary file are represented within the campinarana the florestada arborizada and gramineo lenhosa subclasses are not part of the database and for savana florestada and estepica florestada the implication of missing subclasses is that the agb models for campinarana and savana may give biased estimates of agb and agc for certain zones within these land types although there is a similarity of tree species among the subclasses another limitation of the tb c app is related to the diameter range while the app allows predictions down to the smallest and largest tree diameters selected by the user losses in precision may occur when users want to estimate agb in stands with many trees smaller or larger than those in the database we consider this as only a minor limitation for stand level estimation because the mean agb mg ha 1 provided by the app is not directly dependent on tree diameter rather it depends on the variability of b a and n that are the input variables of the stand level model as a safeguard we suggest that users observe the agb provided by the app and make sure it does not exceed the largest agb shown in fig 2 in general the agb will rarely exceed such values for tree level this limitation is more significant since the model is calibrated with individual tree information so users should examine if the diameters of the simulated trees that appear in tb c s tree level outputs exceed the largest diameter shown in table 1 and be aware that the agb estimates of these trees are more likely to be unreliable limitations to the uncertainty analysis the uncertainties assessed in this study play the role of providing more robust reliable cis for agb and agc stand level estimates of agb bear uncertainties from three main sources qin et al 2020 fu et al 2017 measurement errors errors in the sampling process and model errors measurement errors are both actual measurement errors on trees and plots and data entry transcription errors we are unaware of any such errors in the data used to calibrate and test the tb c app but research as qin et al 2020 reported that these types of measurement errors are generally of small importance in estimates of agb per unit area uncertainties due to sampling process such as plot size and shape and limitations on sampling design and intensity occur when agb estimates of plots are averaged to then obtain estimates of agb at large scale fu et al 2017 therefore they do not fit into this study because it is limited to the modeling process so the model related uncertainty is one major concern of this study this primary source contemplates secondary sources as model residual and parameter uncertainty these are driven mainly by the size of the calibration dataset variability of input variables and model specification qin et al 2020 mcroberts et al 2015 we assumed that errors associated with model specification were negligible once we exhaustively tested a numerous variety of models and selected the best one the model related uncertainties were incorporated into the modeling process as follows the variability of input variables of eq 5 is ensured with the bootstrap technique note that steps i ii item a subsection 2 3 2 1 provoke variation of plot level attributes as n diameter range and shape of the diameter distribution which end up varying b a first input variable of eq 5 as a consequence also the second input variable of eq 5 n also randomly varies from 100 to 3 000 as can be seen in step ii of this same subsection the operation in step iii item b subsection 2 3 2 1 forces selection of simulated plots in the entire range of b a and n this means that eq 5 is calibrated not only with data that randomly vary in sample size but also that incorporate a large range of variation in input variables reliability of the tb c app as shown in table 2 for all studied formations more than 95 n 16 000 of observed agb s correctly fit into the predicted ci outputted by the tb c app here it is said observed agb s because the real agb in these n simulated plots is known see item a subsection 2 3 2 1 this demonstrates the reliability and robustness of the tb c app looking at comparisons to other systems some agb estimates and equations from published literature corroborate the tb c app s outputs whereas others did not three results of table 3 and 4 deserve special mention one is that barbosa and ferreira 2004 obtained agb through a tree level model whereas the tb c app basis on a stand level model even comparing tree and stand level model estimates shown in table 3 the mean agbs per unit area were very similar each other second the estimate of 63 0 mg ha 1 obtained by ribeiro et al 2011 is much higher than the one provided by the tb c app 39 0 mg ha 1 however these authors reported that their estimate was actually larger than all studies they reviewed sometimes twofold larger or more meaning that the tb c app is more similar to papers reviewed by these authors the results show that in general when there was disagreement the models in the literature gave higher estimates indicating that the tb c app gives conservative estimates third those equations that resulted in values out of the ci outputted by the tb c app see table 4 were generally based on both smaller sample sizes and more restrict spatial coverage this is understandable due to the enormous difficulty in measuring biomass in tropical forests however it highlights that the tb c app is supported by the largest tree biomass database compiled so far in brazil in addition to being developed based on bootstrap and monte carlo approaches and land type specific modeling thus this novel application is expected to give more reliable agb estimates 5 conclusion the tb c project brings new modeling approaches and data to produce novel biomass equations and an application to make use of them the project tb c has unified smaller datasets collected in the four most important forest non forest formations of brazil obeying high standards in data collection and measurement criteria see subsection 2 2 especially the condition of the agb to be destructively measured these standards were recommended by chave et al 2014 as a means of ensuring uniformity of the calibration database one of the greatest contributions of the tb c is to deliver more reliable specific equations to researchers that need to know about the agb and agc stored in brazil s forests as an additional product the project tb c delivers a database of 64 000 simulated plots informing dry agb mg ha 1 density trees ha 1 basal area m² ha 1 lorey s height m and parameters of shape of the diameter distribution these plots are bootstrapped samples originated in steps i vii item a subsection 2 3 2 1 as such we recommend the use of the tb c app as alternative to currently available generic and global equations credit authorship

24360,this article introduces the tropical biomass carbon application the tb c app a web application available on the permanent link www tropicalbiomass com the tb c app requires as input attributes the smallest and largest diameters number of trees ha 1 basal area ha 1 and parameters of the diameter beta distribution describing stand structure the app delivers outputs at two levels 1 stand level including mean aboveground biomass agb and carbon agc in mg ha 1 along with confidence intervals cis as measures of uncertainty and 2 tree level estimates with agb and diameter for every simulated tree phase 1 of the project tb c comprises four brazilian forest and non forest formations campinarana floresta estacional floresta ombrofila and savana this article aims to i describe the algorithm written for the tb c app and ii present results of phase 1 this first phase counts on a standardized database of 1 428 trees with field measured dry agb from plots across the different formations which is the largest tree biomass database compiled so far in brazil model uncertainties were incorporated into the modeling process allowing computation of cis through an uncertainty approach the total variance of residuals of agb was also modeled aiming at predicting cis as a function of the quantity of agb an analysis of reliability of the equations implemented in the tb c app indicates that more than 95 n 64 000 of the true agb s fit into the ci outputted by the tb c app a comparison with other approaches in the literature shows significant agreement with previous estimates and more

of this paper keywords web application amazon forest forest carbon aboveground biomass uncertainty analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction forests are known to play important roles in global biogeochemical cycles especially in the carbon c cycle dixon et al 1994 brown et al 1993 houghton 2003a forests cover 31 of the world s total land area totaling about 4 06 billion hectares fao unep 2020 forests and forest soils are large c pools especially tropical forests morais et al 2020 david et al 2017 and deforestation of them is emitting increasingly more c into the atmosphere brown et al 1993 houghton 2003b this means that global warming forecasts and climate surveys rely on among other things accurate quantification and monitoring of the global forest c le toan et al 2011 more than half of the world s forests are in only five countries the russian federation brazil canada the united states of america and china fao unep 2020 fao 2020 and global surveys e g mitchard et al 2013 saatchi et al 2011 and reports from fao 2020 suggest that the most c stocked forests are situated in the tropics across the tropics forests vary in terms of structure tree density canopy height etc which affect the c stored in them mitchard et al 2013 saatchi et al 2011 and makes forest c stock variation a challenge to quantify for example brazil has a large variation in c stocks observed across its territory nogueira et al 2008 david et al 2017 including large portions of the amazon as well as lesser known areas with lower forest c storage e g savannah david et al 2017 with knowledge of the different types of forest species composition and structure forest c storage can be better estimated using forest type specific modeling henry et al 2015 jara et al 2015 the tropical biomass carbon hereafter tb c project introduced here offers an interactive open access web application the tb c app built with a robust modeling technique the main purpose of the project is to help researchers by providing estimates of aboveground biomass agb and carbon agc with more reliability than approaches which don t consider forest type variability the tb c app also outputs confidence intervals cis for agb and agc based on a model uncertainty analysis delivering estimates of forest biomass and carbon along with cis is very important to accurately characterize uncertainties in estimates qin et al 2020 fu et al 2017 in recent years generic and global equations have been increasingly more used citing the pan tropical biomass equation from chave et al 2014 and several other equations recommended by fao through sandra brown s surveys e g brown and iverson 1992 brown et al 1989 brown 1977 these broad scale equations are helpful in the absence of published equations and of samples collected more locally however modelers must be aware that misdealing conclusions may be drawn while using generic equations to make predictions beyond broader national levels henry et al 2015 jara et al 2015 for example ngomanda et al 2014 found differences in biomass estimates of 40 between forest specific vs generic models notable differences between two or more biomass models are not uncommon see e g studies by ribeiro et al 2011 and ketterings et al 2001 likely because underlying allometric equations may not agree with each other fearnside 1992 through experience and data analysis we confirmed the existence of many comparable i e recommended for a same forest type equations that do not deliver consistent values for example when we computed the stand level agb sum of agb of all trees in a plot with different equations consulted in the literature the largest differences of agb per unit area showed a twofold difference even some well known biomass equations for moist and wet forests brown 1977 brown and iverson 1992 brown et al 1989 showed significant inconsistencies in agb per unit area nogueira et al 2008 there are many reasons for the discrepancies but one important one is that such equations have been calibrated using different datasets another reason is that forest sites such as those found in the amazon forest have a large agb variability within forests of the same type or successional stages as has been shown in studies by nogueira et al 2015 malhi et al 2006 and houghton et al 2001 following henry et al 2015 and jara et al 2015 the tb c was derived from the belief that global forest c stocks could be better predicted if every country had its own forest specific equations our aim in this paper is to present results of phase 1 of the tb c as well as disclosing the algorithm of the tb c app tips for use limitations and other issues related to the application are also addressed this paper also provides a new biomass dataset informing forest variables at the plot level resulting from simulations involving the bootstrap technique 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the brazilian institute of statistical geography acronym ibge classifies the terrestrial vegetation of brazil into six large national forest and non forest formations campinarana floresta estacional floresta ombrofila savana estepe and vegetation with marine influence ibge 2012 the first four comprise our study area for phase 1 of the tb c project campinarana floresta estacional floresta ombrofila and savana together cover an area of 4 390 652 km² mapa 2020 representing 51 5 of the brazilian territory information on these national formations is described in the supplement to this paper supplemental section 1 2 2 data our database is a compilation of tree samples selected in the four forest and non forest remnants located in the four national formations studied here about 62 of our database comes from brazilian research on forest biomass while the remaining 38 data is a subset of the global database published by chave et al 2014 see table 1 s for more information related to data sources and visit www tropicalbiomass com to locate the sample areas on the map of brazil samples were taken within nine brazilian states amazonas mato grosso minas gerais pará paraná rio grande do sul rondônia roraima and santa catarina following definitions stated in fao 2004 these remnants differ in 1 successional stage varying from young to climax vegetation and 2 type of vegetation including primary secondary and modified natural forest at least 21 among 31 remnants had past natural and or human disturbances e g wildfire presence of cattle observed when field data were collected one remark is that wildfires commonly occur in savanas and campinaranas either naturally or human induced santana et al 2018 silveira et al 2016 ramos neto and pivello 2000 tree samples allowed in the database were constrained in three ways first no tree sample could come from forest plantations or agroforestry systems this constraint was imposed due to expected differences in bole and crown shapes that trees may assume while growing in natural forest formations in relation to human altered vegetation which affect allometric scaling relationships ali et al 2019 pretzsch et al 2015 goodman et al 2014 the second condition is that tree agb had to be directly measured weighed on a scale and not converted from volume to biomass using a mean wood density or estimated with biomass equations third we limited our database to woody self standing tree species only the mass of other aboveground forest components including shrub like and herbaceous species palms and ferns litter or any dead mass were not included in this study all trees were felled and had their fresh agb measured in field including trunk branches and leaves fresh samples of these tree compartments were collected and taken to a laboratory for kiln drying then dry agb of the trees was obtained from fresh field measured weights and lab measured moisture content the number of trees sampled by forest non forest formation is presented in table 1 as well as the main descriptive statistics of sample trees dry agb tree diameter and total height except for the campinarana formation trees were sampled in at least two subclasses of forest non forest see table 1s for more details for campinarana and savana tree diameter is 1 cm whereas for floresta estacional and floresta ombrofila diameters are 5 cm the rationality in considering two minimum diameters is because the diameter structures of campinarana and savana especially campinarana are largely composed by many thin trees in relation to floresta estacional and floresta ombrofila tree stem diameters were measured at breast height dbh 1 3 m above base except in campinarana where diameter was measured at ground level denoted as d0 because trees with bole taller than 1 3 m are scarce studies as sullivan et al 2018 chave et al 2014 and feldpausch et al 2011 were our reference for stablishing the minimum diameters fig 1s illustrates allometric relationships between dry agb in the ln scale and total height as a function of tree diameter 2 3 the tb c application 2 3 1 general information for users the tb c app is an interactive web application programmed in r using the r package shiny chang et al 2020 the tb c app visit https www tropicalbiomass com to use the application allows users to set the input attributes related to stand and tree variables see upper half of table 2 s and outputs biomass and carbon at stand and tree levels see lower half of table 2s the tb c app is designed to provide easily and quickly estimates of agb and agc with more reliability than unspecific approaches the app also outputs cis for agb and agc based on a model uncertainty analysis the app requires that users a select one of the four forest non forest formations b select the level of information stand or diameter class desired for the output attributes c insert information from census or sample based inventory of the trees observed in the forest e g diameter range and tree density and d select parameters α and β of the beta distribution see how to obtain parameters α and β in the discussion section under tips for use the beta distribution was adopted as the probability density function p d f to portray the diameter distribution of the forest chosen for its flexibility and because it allows the lower and upper diameters of the distribution to be set to predict forest biomass and carbon for any stem diameter range the outputs of the tb c app are delivered at two levels stand and tree which are described in the sections that follow 2 3 2 stand level outputs of the tb c app the major stand level outputs of the tb c app are a table of stand level biomass and carbon in mg ha 1 and their uncertainties as well as basal area in ha 1 this includes an illustration of the diameter distribution of the forest whose shape is sensitive to the parameters α and β of the beta distribution and whose range is controlled by the smallest and largest diameters specified 2 3 2 1 algorithm for implementation the following subsections describes the step by step process for reproducing the algorithm implemented for stand level outputs an overview of it is presented in fig 1 a tree selection and plot simulation we developed an approach that combines monte carlo mc simulation and bootstrapping techniques to select trees from our database and then simulate 1 ha plots the idea was first to simulate field plots via mc simulation with tree dbhs following the beta distribution gupta and nadarajah 2004 and second to select trees via bootstrap from the database obeying the dbh distribution of the simulated plots simulated 1 ha plots were created in accordance with the parameters of the beta distribution generating the number of trees ha 1 within dbh classes the role of this was to ensure that all possible combinations of stand attributes set by the user in the tb c app were captured the following steps describe the algorithm for selecting trees from our database used to simulate the plots i combine the parameters of the beta distribution eq 1 assuming α β 0 5 1 0 2 0 5 0 this step creates 24 16 combinations of α β 1 f x α β γ α β γ α γ β x α 1 1 x β 1 where 0 x 1 α and β are parameters of the distribution ii for the p th combination of parameters obtained in step i create a random size n vector x that follows the beta distribution where n is a random number between 100 3 000 that represents the number of trees ha 1 iii obtain x x d where x is a size n vector of dbhs and d is a random number between the minimum and maximum dbhs observed in the forest non forest formation table 1 iv split the dbh distribution observed in x into 10 equal size classes v for every dbh class select randomly with replacement trees from the database obeying the frequency of the class vi replicate steps i v 1 000 times vii repeat steps i vi for every forest non forest formation the seven steps above provide 16 000 replications per forest non forest formation 64 000 in total which corresponds to the set of simulated plots note that these plots differ from each other in tree density diameter range and shape of the diameter distribution curve next for the j th simulated plot we computed agb in mg ha 1 eq 2 basal area in m² ha 1 eq 3 lorey s height eq 4 and number of trees n j the application of the lorey s height follows what saatchi et al 2011 recommend 2 a g b j i 1 n j b t r e e i j 1 000 3 b a j π i 1 n j d b h i j 2 40 000 4 h l o r e y j i 1 n j d b h i j 2 h t i j i 1 n j d b h i j 2 where b t r e e i j dry agb in kg of the i th tree in the j th plot d b h i j is diameter at breast height in cm of the i th tree in the j th plot h t i j is total height in m of the i th tree in the j th plot n j is the number of trees in the j th plot π is the constant pi for campinarana d b h i j is replaced by d 0 i j b stand level modeling and uncertainty analysis the next procedure is to test predictions of agb in mg ha 1 from stand level models we examined the contribution of the set of variables ba hlorey n available to predict agb per unit area and noted that the lorey s height plays an important role in the modeling confirming mitchard et al 2013 s and saatchi et al 2011 s statements to this effect we also noted that each forest non forest formation has its own pattern of lorey s height differing in sill elevation of stand agb as fig 2s supplementary file shows this observation reveals a variation in height among the formations as reported in other studies as sullivan et al 2018 and feldpausch et al 2011 with this we noticed that the agb in mg ha 1 should be modeled through specific to formation models after testing a large number of models and settings for variables in the agb modeling we observed two important issues first the lorey s height had no longer significant contribution in the modeling when ba and n were input variables this occurred because the formation type grouping sufficiently homogenized the data in terms of lorey s height second we verified that the agb model performed much better while using the ln ln scale as also reported in many studies especially in chave et al 2014 the best performing model for all forest non forest formations is presented in eq 5 from this model specific to formation agb equations were obtained 5 l n a g b j β 0 β 1 ln b a j β 2 l n n j ε where β i model parameters ε model residual eq 5 was chosen among the various models tested giving priority to the best residual dispersion and the lowest residual standard error to fit eq 5 we implemented an algorithm for executing modeling with uncertainty the latter based on the m out of n bootstrap bickel et al 1994 bickel and ren 1995 those plots simulated in the previous subsection corresponded to our bootstrapped samples the part of the algorithm that generates the model coefficients can be reproduced as follows i split randomly the set of simulated plots ntotal 16 000 per forest non forest formation into two portions 70 for model calibration ncalib 11 200 per formation and 30 for model validation nvalid 4 800 per formation ii for the calibration dataset obtain r a g b j m a x a g b j λ where m a x a g b j is the maximum a g b j in the dataset and λ is a random number between 1 10 iii from the calibration dataset select randomly with replacement nselected plots with a g b j r a g b where nselected is a random number between 100 300 iv use the subset selected in the earlier step for fitting eq 5 and obtain β i v repeat step ii iv for the validation dataset the idea with steps ii iii is to force biomass variability from low to high stock the m out of n bootstrap in our case n ntotal and m nselected was chosen rather than the original bootstrap technique mainly as a means of mitigating the computation burden caused by the size of ntotal the arbitrary definition of nselected see step iii comes from the good performance of the approximation m n seen in section 4 of bickel and ren 1995 the following steps give continuity to the algorithm and are followed to compute cis for agb and agc with model uncertainty quantification the method we applied to compute ci is based on rubin 1987 p 75 81 proper

the mean agb and agc are obtained through eqs 14 15 and the errors are given by eqs 16 17 2 3 2 2 reliability of output attributes the reliability of stand level attributes provided by the tb c app was analyzed this analysis is different from the uncertainty analysis previous subsection where cis and errors were mathematically modeled the aim of the analysis of reliability is to estimate the odds of an observed agb mg ha 1 fitting into the ci delivered by the tb c to that end we used the set of 16 000 per forest non forest formation simulated plots originated in item a subsection 2 3 2 1 recall that the observed true agb in all these simulated plots is known in the first step eq 14 was used to estimate the ci for the agb in mg ha 1 for every simulated plot and then we computed the number of plots whose true value of agb fitted into the ci assuming the observed agb in mg ha 1 obtained as in eq 2 as our reference recall that the full set of 16 000 plots contains a variety of shapes of diameter distribution among plots since parameters α and β ranged between 0 5 5 0 see step i item a subsection 2 3 2 1 in the second analysis we selected from the set of 16 000 plots those plots whose diameter distribution follows the reverse j shaped curve the number of plots in which the true agb fits into the ci was similarly computed we assumed as a reverse j shaped curve any data distribution with combination of parameters α 1 0 and β 2 0 the idea with this is to examine the tb c app s outputs in conditions that resembles tropical forests since the diameter distribution in these forests typically follows the reverse j shaped curve david et al 2019 2 3 2 3 comparison with agb surveys tb c app s outputs were also contrasted with equations estimates from other surveys we consulted the literature aiming to verify if agbs per unit area observed in other studies fit into the ci outputted by the app or if published allometric equations produce agb values statistically similar to the tb c app articles were selected if 1 a g b b a and n were tabulated per unit area in this case we directly inputted the tabulated n and b a into the tb c app and analyzed if the tabulated agb fitted into the ci for the agb 2 tree allometric equations were available in the article when allometric equations were used we summed up the predicted agb of all simulated trees to reach agb per unit area and then verified if this sum fits into the ci for the stand level agb output of the tb c app to compare tb c app s outputs with existing allometric equations we executed four scenarios which can be reproduced by readers to this readers need to access the tb c app permanent link www tropicalbiomass com and setting the input attributes presented in table 4 one remark is that to reach the exact agb estimates presented in table 4 the exact basal area shown in that table must be used we simulated scenarios only for floresta ombrofila given the low availability of biomass equations for the other formations 2 3 3 tree level outputs of the tb c app tree level outputs of the tb c app see table 2s characterize the diameter and agb of all trees of the simulated stands these trees are the same as those in the diameter distribution at the stand level described in the previous section 2 3 3 1 algorithm for implementation tree level modeling tree level modeling is possible because the algorithm of the tb c app generates a set of tree diameters see step iii item a subsection 2 3 2 1 whenever it is run this means that the algorithm outlined for the app allows one to estimate tree agb as a function of tree diameter however studies such as feldpausch et al 2011 2012 have demonstrated the important contribution of the total height of the trees as an auxiliary predictor in tree agb models we followed the methods delineated by feldpausch et al 2012 to predict tree height as a function tree diameter to be next inputted into the tree agb model we tested the same functions described in feldpausch et al 2012 to predict the height diameter relationship these authors eqs 3 5 to predict tree agb we adapted feldpausch et al 2012 s eqs 1 2 adaptations consisted of replacing the predictor specific gravity ρ w by total height in their eq 1 thus eliminating ρ w from their eq 2 both equations became therefore dependent on diameter square and total height of the tree these adaptations were necessary because when the app runs it simulates trees with no knowledge of species genus or family which are the minimum information to estimate ρ w a third model eq 18 was tested in which tree agb was modeled on the ln ln scale as a function of diameter square only 18 ln b t r e e i j β 0 β 1 ln d b h i j 2 ε for campinarana d b h i j is replaced by d 0 i j goodness of fit statistics indicated eq 18 as the best model thus eliminating the need for tree height to be known this finding was similar to the stand level modeling of agb where the lorey s height had little contribution when data were grouped into forest non forest formations eq 18 was fit also using a bootstrap approach the following steps describe the algorithm we utilized i select randomly with reposition n trees from the database n trees is shown in table 1 ii fit eq 18 with the subset created in step i and save model coefficients iii replicate steps i ii 5 000 times iv obtain the average of the model coefficients over replications v repeat steps i iv for every forest non forest formation 2 3 3 2 compatibility of tree and stand level estimates stand level prediction of agb is obtained through eq 5 while tree level agb is estimated through an individual tree equation eq 18 both equations yield different estimates of agbs for a same stand or plot that is a stand level prediction is not exactly the sum of the predictions for the trees to fix this inconsistency we multiplied every tree agb estimated through eq 18 to the correction factor f c j 1 000 a g b j i i n j b t r e e i j being this factor specific to the j th simulated stand or diameter class so the application of f c j in agb estimates at the tree level ensures that outputs at tree and stand levels have compatibility

seasonal forest ombrophilous forest and savannah eqs 19 22 are those used to predict mean agb and agc both in mg ha 1 at the stand level of the tb c app as previously defined the precision inherent to these four equations was measured through underlying models eqs 23 26 stemmed from an uncertainty approach the accuracy of eqs 19 22 can be visually interpreted with assistance of fig 32 this figure shows the observed vs estimated mean agb for every forest non forest formation the accuracy is revealed while comparing the red and green lines in which the more the lines are overlapped the more accurate is the model clearly the best performance in accuracy occurred for campinarana followed by floresta estacional and floresta ombrofila and lastly for savana as expected the loss in accuracy in general soared as the tree agb increased the fittings of eq 13 originated eqs 23 26 that provide the maximum t m s for every forest non forest formation recall in step x item b subsection 2 3 2 1 that

variability of the quantity of agb per unit area see λ employed in step ii item b subsection 2 3 2 1 3 2 reliability of cis and comparison with existing agb surveys eqs 19 22 were used to predict stand agb in the 16 000 simulated plots and then their cis were computed as in eqs 23 26 to measure the reliability of the cis provided by the tb c app we quantified the number of plots which had the observed agb was contained within the ci table 2 presents the expected percentage of estimates of agb per unit area that fits into the ci these results show that our analytical procedure works well for all forest non forest formations with observed agb contained within the predicted cis greater than 95 of the time this finding met or exceeded the 95 probability level assumed when computing the cis see eqs 14 15 savana had a lower performance 95 but only when the reverse j shaped diameter distribution was assumed the results of the comparisons with other agb surveys are shown in table 3 derived from six published studies which had a g b b a and n available the b a and n from these studies were inputted in the tb c app to generate agb estimates and compared to the value published in each study in most cases the estimated agb from other surveys was contained within the ci s for agb produced by the tb c app in areas of higher density both the studies by brun 2004 and souza et al 2011 showed a much higher estimate than that produced by the tb c app in the florestal estacional table 3 the other two studies which differed significantly in agb prediction from the tb c app were in the savana ribeiro et al 2011 showed a much higher estimate and zimbres et al 2020 showed a much lower estimate at about the same basal area and stem density table 3 the second comparative analysis is with published allometric equations six published biomass equations were available for the floresta ombrofila and used to compute agb of trees within four different scenarios simulated in the tb c app table 4 all of the equations were calibrated with destructively measured biomass data collected in forests each equation gives agb as dry mass of trees including bole branches and leaves as output variable and uses diameter squared or not as the input variable in all equations b t r e e is the predicted dry agb in kg and diameters are in cm 1 nogueira et al 2008 felled 262 trees dbh range 5 124

biomass equation comes from chambers et al 2001 with sites of data collection similar to that of nogueira et al 2008 they collected data of 315 trees dbh range 5 100 cm and fit the following equation

of 69 trees see 3 above a fourth equation was obtained by brown et al 1989 b t r e e 13 2579 4 8945 d b h 0 6713 d b h 2 5 the fifth equation we tested is published in brown 1997 and was fit with tree

1992 and brown et al s 1989 s equations in all four scenarios nogueira et al s 2008 and chambers et al s 2001 equation showed no agreement and gave much larger estimates under all the scenarios brown s 1997 equation and overman et al s 1994 equation only agreed with the tb c app s estimates in scenario 1 which was the scenario with the smallest trees in all cases when the allometric equations were outside the ci for the tb c app the allometric equations gave much higher estimates of agb 3 3 tree level modeling of agb the equations below are results of fittings of eq 18 for every forest non

for the formations are respectively campinarana seasonal forest ombrophilous forest and savannah eqs 27 30 are those used to predict tree agb in kg presented in the tree level outputs of the tb c app fig 34 shows the observed vs estimated tree agb for every forest non forest formation markers of the graphs in fig 4 represent trees of our database n trees is shown in table 1 in regards to the correction factor f c j applied to the tree level estimates based on eqs 27 30 we noted that f c j followed a normal distribution when the 64 000 plots were simulated for campinarana f c j ranged between 0 93 1 16 average 1 07 for floresta estacional values ranged between 0 85 1 25 average 1 02 for floresta ombrofila between 0 83 1 1 28 average 1 07 and for savana f c j varies between 0 64 1 39 average 1 05 the f c j can be interpreted as follows for campinarana the differences between summing up the biomass of the trees in a plot being this biomass estimated through a tree level model and estimating the plot agb directly through a stand level model vary from 7 0 93 1 00 0 07 100 to 16 1 16 1 00 0 16 100 with an overall difference of 7 1 07 1 00 0 07 100 such differences were a bit larger for floresta estacional 15 25 followed by floresta ombrofila 17 28 and savana 36 39 4 discussion the tb c app can be applied to generate specific estimates of forest biomass and carbon in tropical forests and other treed landscapes in brazil the tb c app has several advantages over other available approaches the app is a user friendly tool that requires only easily obtained input attributes of the forest such as the smallest and largest diameters and number of trees which are routinely assessed in forest inventories unlike for example the well known pantropical biomass equation by chave et al 2014 which requires tree height and wood density the app also provides agb and agc estimates along with cis that are robustly derived from the bootstrap technique involving iterative programming processes another important attribute is the compatibility of the estimates at the stand and tree levels such that stand level estimates generate realistic tree level information and tree level data can be aggregated at the stand level this is an important benefit for forest biomass and carbon assessments because it allows for example that users implement their own algorithm to reproduce the app s estimates of i agb and agc per unit area using eqs 19 22 ii cis for agb and agc per unit area replacing eqs 23 26 in respectively eqs 14 15 and iii tree agb using eqs 27 30 finally all the estimation processes are rapidly computed and with low computational burden in the reminder of the discussion we address the following issues 1 tips for using the app 2 limitations of the app 3 limitations to the uncertainty analysis and 4 reliability of the tb c app tips for using the app when making stand level estimates the user should make sure that b a and n observed in the forest or diameter class are exactly those inputted in the app n can be simply set by using the slide bar ad hoc b a however can be adjusted by changing the smallest and largest diameters n and parameters α and β the b a outputted by the app should be set exactly equal or as close as possible to the b a observed in the forest plots the importance of inputting the most exact values of b a and n possible is because the mean agb is modeled as a function of these two variables see eqs 19 22 at the tree level users should ensure that the diameter distribution of the observed forest is faithfully depicted in the tb c app for this all input attributes are important especially parameters of the beta distribution users may either estimate α and β by parameterization of the beta p d f see applications in lima et al 2015 burkhart and tomé 2012 p 261 298 and zheng and zhou 2010 or approximate them by comparing the diameter distribution depicted in the app with that one observed in their forest plots this last option is simpler and easier and should deliver results generally good enough in general more accurate characterizations of diameter distributions should generate more reliable tree level predictions of agb and agc limitations of the app the main limitations to the tb c app are the underlying data which still has some gaps for example not all subclasses of campinarana and savana see subclasses in table 1s supplementary file are represented within the campinarana the florestada arborizada and gramineo lenhosa subclasses are not part of the database and for savana florestada and estepica florestada the implication of missing subclasses is that the agb models for campinarana and savana may give biased estimates of agb and agc for certain zones within these land types although there is a similarity of tree species among the subclasses another limitation of the tb c app is related to the diameter range while the app allows predictions down to the smallest and largest tree diameters selected by the user losses in precision may occur when users want to estimate agb in stands with many trees smaller or larger than those in the database we consider this as only a minor limitation for stand level estimation because the mean agb mg ha 1 provided by the app is not directly dependent on tree diameter rather it depends on the variability of b a and n that are the input variables of the stand level model as a safeguard we suggest that users observe the agb provided by the app and make sure it does not exceed the largest agb shown in fig 2 in general the agb will rarely exceed such values for tree level this limitation is more significant since the model is calibrated with individual tree information so users should examine if the diameters of the simulated trees that appear in tb c s tree level outputs exceed the largest diameter shown in table 1 and be aware that the agb estimates of these trees are more likely to be unreliable limitations to the uncertainty analysis the uncertainties assessed in this study play the role of providing more robust reliable cis for agb and agc stand level estimates of agb bear uncertainties from three main sources qin et al 2020 fu et al 2017 measurement errors errors in the sampling process and model errors measurement errors are both actual measurement errors on trees and plots and data entry transcription errors we are unaware of any such errors in the data used to calibrate and test the tb c app but research as qin et al 2020 reported that these types of measurement errors are generally of small importance in estimates of agb per unit area uncertainties due to sampling process such as plot size and shape and limitations on sampling design and intensity occur when agb estimates of plots are averaged to then obtain estimates of agb at large scale fu et al 2017 therefore they do not fit into this study because it is limited to the modeling process so the model related uncertainty is one major concern of this study this primary source contemplates secondary sources as model residual and parameter uncertainty these are driven mainly by the size of the calibration dataset variability of input variables and model specification qin et al 2020 mcroberts et al 2015 we assumed that errors associated with model specification were negligible once we exhaustively tested a numerous variety of models and selected the best one the model related uncertainties were incorporated into the modeling process as follows the variability of input variables of eq 5 is ensured with the bootstrap technique note that steps i ii item a subsection 2 3 2 1 provoke variation of plot level attributes as n diameter range and shape of the diameter distribution which end up varying b a first input variable of eq 5 as a consequence also the second input variable of eq 5 n also randomly varies from 100 to 3 000 as can be seen in step ii of this same subsection the operation in step iii item b subsection 2 3 2 1 forces selection of simulated plots in the entire range of b a and n this means that eq 5 is calibrated not only with data that randomly vary in sample size but also that incorporate a large range of variation in input variables reliability of the tb c app as shown in table 2 for all studied formations more than 95 n 16 000 of observed agb s correctly fit into the predicted ci outputted by the tb c app here it is said observed agb s because the real agb in these n simulated plots is known see item a subsection 2 3 2 1 this demonstrates the reliability and robustness of the tb c app looking at comparisons to other systems some agb estimates and equations from published literature corroborate the tb c app s outputs whereas others did not three results of table 3 and 4 deserve special mention one is that barbosa and ferreira 2004 obtained agb through a tree level model whereas the tb c app basis on a stand level model even comparing tree and stand level model estimates shown in table 3 the mean agbs per unit area were very similar each other second the estimate of 63 0 mg ha 1 obtained by ribeiro et al 2011 is much higher than the one provided by the tb c app 39 0 mg ha 1 however these authors reported that their estimate was actually larger than all studies they reviewed sometimes twofold larger or more meaning that the tb c app is more similar to papers reviewed by these authors the results show that in general when there was disagreement the models in the literature gave higher estimates indicating that the tb c app gives conservative estimates third those equations that resulted in values out of the ci outputted by the tb c app see table 4 were generally based on both smaller sample sizes and more restrict spatial coverage this is understandable due to the enormous difficulty in measuring biomass in tropical forests however it highlights that the tb c app is supported by the largest tree biomass database compiled so far in brazil in addition to being developed based on bootstrap and monte carlo approaches and land type specific modeling thus this novel application is expected to give more reliable agb estimates 5 conclusion the tb c project brings new modeling approaches and data to produce novel biomass equations and an application to make use of them the project tb c has unified smaller datasets collected in the four most important forest non forest formations of brazil obeying high standards in data collection and measurement criteria see subsection 2 2 especially the condition of the agb to be destructively measured these standards were recommended by chave et al 2014 as a means of ensuring uniformity of the calibration database one of the greatest contributions of the tb c is to deliver more reliable specific equations to researchers that need to know about the agb and agc stored in brazil s forests as an additional product the project tb c delivers a database of 64 000 simulated plots informing dry agb mg ha 1 density trees ha 1 basal area m² ha 1 lorey s height m and parameters of shape of the diameter distribution these plots are bootstrapped samples originated in steps i vii item a subsection 2 3 2 1 as such we recommend the use of the tb c app as alternative to currently available generic and global equations credit authorship

24361,upgradation of sewage treatment plants has been greatly promoted in china but few studies investigate impact of this practice on synergetic relationship between environmental performance and economic performance of those systems this study aims to investigate environmental sustainability economic benefit and greenhouse gasses emission intensity of different sewage treatment schemes and then identify the best one as well as related negative factors needed to be addressed in the future a comprehensive performance index synergetic effect index sei derived from integration of improved emergy sustainability index iesi net economic benefit ratio nebr and carbon emission per unit sewage treatment ceus is proposed to address this issue firstly to investigate environmental sustainability of sewage treatment more completely this approach improved the classic emergy analysis through integrating emissions impacts into related classic emergy yield ratio and environmental loading ratio respectively and then built the comprehensive index iesi next the indicator nebr and ceus were proposed to assess economic benefit and greenhouse gasses emission intensity respectively finally the three indicators i e iesi and nebr as well as ceus are merged into the index sei to evaluate comprehensive performance of sewage treatment a sewage treatment plant located in southwest china as a research case was investigated using the presented approach from its construction stage to its operation stage it is found that after the upgradation total emergy input increases by 11 96 mainly from extra thermal electricity power consumption total emission s impact decreases by 39 92 mainly from raised removal rate of total phosphorus emergy yield rate is slightly improved and environmental load rate descends greatly and thus the sustainability level clearly rises meanwhile environmental emissions significantly affect the environmental load and then the sustainable level this upgradation improves its economic benefit because rising sewage treatment fee slightly exceeds its added treatment cost thermal electricity power consumption in operation stage is the main contributor to total carbon emission sensitivity analyses shows that changes of main input categories have not altered the research results generally the upgradation promotes the synergetic relationship between its environmental performance and economic performance by 95 65 however indirect environmental emissions from the upgradation should be emphasized this enterprise should further

are threatening the sustainable development of society therein sewage discharge is the main contributor to water pollution gao et al 2020 china s sewage discharge amount reached 72 53 billion tons in 2019 ministry of housing and urban rural development of the people s republic of china 2019 which increased by 1 4 times relative to 2005 and this highlights importance of development of sewage treatment plants vassallo et al 2009 in 2019 the number of sewage treatment plants of china had increased by 19 36 times since 2005 according to statistic data of ministry of housing and urban rural development of the people s republic of china 2019 in recent years in order to meet the increasingly stringent discharge standards upgradation of sewage treatment technologies has been continuously pushed forward in the existing wwtps wastewater treatment plant in practice engineers and technicians mainly concern whether specific water quality parameters meet the new standards after the upgradation however from a life cycle perspective upgradation of sewage treatment systems needs extra investment from the environment and human society in their construction and operation stages and this may produce secondary environmental problems due to indirect environmental emissions and transfer of water pollutants to other mediums meneses et al 2015 rashid et al 2020 such as atmospheric environment edatope etc if wwtps are upgraded only for solving local water pollution without overall awareness it may be difficult to achieve net environmental improvement wang et al 2015 therefore technical upgradation of sewage treatment systems should be thoroughly investigated so as to put forward related measures for improving its comprehensive benefits zhang et al 2015 to explore effect of the upgradation of wwtps on their environmental and economic performance and energy efficiency lots of scholars have implemented related studies from diverse angles therein guven et al 2012 compared lca life cycle assessment results of hras high rate activated sludge system and hras with food waste being added to wastewater and they thought that the latter had the smallest environmental impact liu et al 2021b did a lca of two typical sewage treatment systems and they revealed that raising sewage discharge standards can reduce eutrophication potential but increase fossil energy consumption however these studies did not consider the environmental contribution to sewage treatment systems and thus could not provide full information for decision making rashid et al 2020 investigated application of sbr sequencing batch reactor to upgradation of large scale municipal wwtps using ee economic evaluation and lca and they found that sbr technology is environmentally friendly but a trade off between environmental benefits and economic costs has to be balanced but they neglected the environmental contribution and the quality diversity of different energy sources and resources di iaconi et al 2017 compared energy intensity of the sewage treatment plant before and after the upgradation using ena energy analysis and they found that the energy efficiency was weakened after the upgradation mainly due to added recycle flow in the system however ena neglects the quality differences of various energy sources and thus cannot clearly quantify their contribution to social economic systems zaborowska et al 2021 evaluated the energy balance and cf carbon footprint of wwtps and they found that although non process heat demand has a significant impact on the energy balance and cf technological upgrades could realize energy neutrality through significant carbon emissions reduction but they did not consider the environmental contribution to those wwtps and associated economic performance innocenzi et al 2021 applied lcc life cycle cost to investigation of economic benefit of wwtps but related resources efficiency and environmental impact have not been clearly shown meanwhile they also ignored the environmental contribution di fraia et al 2019 researched energy efficiency of wwtps using ena and exa exergy analysis but they have ignored the environmental contribution to wwtps the abovementioned studies compared performance before and after upgradation of wwtps using different methods and then proposed some beneficial suggestions for policy making but they have the following shortcomings therein lca ignores the environmental contribution to human systems and the weight depending on experts scoring may cause subjectivity to some degree lcc does not consider the environmental contribution ena ignores quality changes among diverse energy sources and thus cannot accurately compare contribution of different types of energy sources exa neglects the environmental contribution to artificial system and cf only focuses on limited environmental emissions and thus could not provide policy makers with full information relatively speaking the ema emergy analysis can distinguish the differences between diverse resources energy sources and labor and service through uevs unit emergy values based on a common unit lou and ulgiati 2013 zhang et al 2015 and thus it can assess the ecological economic system more completely than other methods up to now ema has been widely used by lots of scholars to study the performance of sewage treatment systems arbault et al 2014 calculated the ecological performance of four sewage treatment plants through the emergy calculation software scal and they revealed its effectiveness in evaluating the environmental performance of this kind of artificial systems arias and brown 2009 compared the performance of treatment wetland models waste stabilization pond systems and sbrs by classic ema and yang et al 2017 assessed the environmental performance and economic value of a decentralized rapid infiltration system in qingdao using ema these works provide beneficial suggestions for the decision making but generally their results are incomplete due to neglect of the adverse effects of environmental discharge on the socio economic environment shao et al 2015 jointed ema and exa to assess the resource efficiency and renewability of constructed wetland system but the impact of environmental emissions on the economy and society has been overlooked meanwhile the integration of results of the two methods needs further exploration duan et al 2011 investigated the environmental impact and sustainability of urban wetland parks and conventional wwtps using ema and lca but the impacts of environmental emissions were not merged into relevant indicators to accurately quantify the impact of emissions on environmental performance cano londono et al 2017 compared environmental sustainability of two utilization ways of biosolids from a municipal wastewater treatment plant using emergy analysis i e use of biosolids as fertilizers for silvopasture soils vs use of biosolids for energy recovery by a fluidized bed gasification process and they provided beneficial suggestions for further improving comprehensive performance of the two alternatives in the future zhang and ma 2020 conducted an emergy analysis on the infrastructure construction and operation stage of a newly built sewage treatment system in china and emphasized the importance of emergy in the infrastructure construction stage for improving the system sustainability but they did not distinguish differences of diverse outputs that would be useful or useless harm to human society when they calculated emergy yield rate it is noted that information related to economic performance could not be intuitively reflected in ema for this purpose some scholars think that a combination of ema and economic assessment can make up for this flaw of ema for providing decision makers with more comprehensive information for example wang et al 2018b combined the methods of ema cf and economic assessment to investigate the sustainability level of china s food system during 2005 2015 and they discovered that the economic performance and sustainability level of china s food production system have been improved by expanding and optimizing planting patterns and improving agricultural practices zhang et al 2021 applied ema and economic assessment to comparison of performance changes of one cement production system before and after the implementation of waste heat power generation and their study showed that the implementation of hrpg could play a role in energy conservation and emission reduction as well as improvement of economic benefits the impact of technical upgradation on environmental and economic performance of wwtps has not been investigated simultaneously using ema and economic analysis in the existing literature so far furthermore how to integrated results from different evaluation methods is also worth deep exploration so as to provide a clear overall conclusion with policy makers to this end this paper constructs a set of novel indicator system especially an integrated index sei synergistic effect index covering environmental sustainability carbon emission intensity and economic benefit through combination of ema carbon accounting and ee to compare comprehensive performance of sewage treatment systems before and after upgradation during the life cycle this study aims to find out the potential factors adversely influencing the upgradation of sewage treatment systems and then put forward related suggestions for policy making through 1 investigating environmental performance before and after upgradation of the sewage treatment system using an improved ema therein the improved ema integrated the emissions impacts in emergy based indicators and 2 implementing a complementary ee and ceus carbon emission per unit sewage treatment assessment of sewage treatment systems before and after upgradation a sewage treatment plant in southwest china as a study case was evaluated by using the proposed approach the novelty of this work roots in 1 quantifying emissions impacts in units of emergy and then integrating those impacts into related emergy based indicators and 2 establishing an integrated index sei to compare synergetic relationship among environmental performance economic benefit and carbon emission intensity before and after upgradation of sewage treatment systems in doing so this study can discover those factors affecting comprehensive performance of sewage treatment systems upgradation schemes more completely and then better optimize upgradation schemes for enhancing sustainability of sewage treatment systems in future meanwhile the proposed approach can also provide beneficial enlightenments for investigating performance of upgradation of other environmental protection systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study case the sewage treatment system is located in the main urban area of chongqing covering an area of 4540 m2 chongqing 29 35 n 106 33 e as one of municipalities directly under the central government of china is the biggest industrial and commercial city in southwest china it has annual average air temperature with 19 6 c annual mean sunshine hours with 1129 8 h annual mean relative humidity with 75 annual mean wind speed with 1 4 m s and annual mean precipitation with 1448 7 mm the sewage treatment plant was built and put into use in the year 2006 with a design scale of 40 000 m3 d and a total investment of 5 00e07 yuan the water quality of effluent can satisfy the standard b of grade ⅰ in urban wastewater treatment plant pollutant discharge standard gb18918 2002 before upgradation table 1 and the effluent is directly discharged into the local river as shown in fig 1 the technological process of the sewage treatment system before upgradation belongs to the cast cyclic activated sludge technology and the excess sludge is disposed by sanitary landfill with the increasingly serious water pollution situation derived from fast pace of urbanization and economic growth china s government has to address this tough issue for sustainable development for example a water supply crisis in 2007 caused by the outbreak of cyanobacteria in taihu lake china occurred during the implementation of the standard b of grade ⅰ in the standard gb18918 2002 for urban sewage treatment plants in china yang 2014 in order to prevent the recurrence of such incidents it is necessary to reduce the load of nitrogen and phosphorus in effluent discharged into the water body consequently the discharge standard of sewage treatment plants is becoming increasingly stricter the newly built sewage treatment plants in chongqing have implemented the standard a of grade ⅰ since 2010 to satisfy the raising wastewater discharge standard this sewage treatment plant was upgraded to increase removal rate of water pollutants fig 2 compared to the original craft the high speed fiber filter was newly installed to ensure treated water quality meet standard a in the grade ⅰ in urban wastewater treatment plant pollutant discharge standard gb18918 2002 table 1 the effluent is also discharged 2 2 analysis boundary the analysis boundary of the sewage treatment system is shown in fig 2 here the decommissioning stage are excluded due to the data unavailability in the construction stage inputs include steel and concrete for all kinds of structures thermal electricity power and gasoline for production and transportation of raw materials and investment cost in the operation phase main inputs include thermal electricity power to drive machinery and equipment chemical reagents and gasoline to transport solid waste as well as operating costs besides sewage the outputs are composed of related air emissions water pollutants discharge and solid wastes table 2 provides a brief description of the sewage treatment system before and after its upgradation 2 3 ema emergy measured in terms of solar energy joules sej is defined as the total amount of available energy that directly or indirectly used to make a product or service odum 1988 1996 and it quantifies contribution of different types of energy sources in ecological economic systems further ema comprehensively explore the quantity and structure of energy material and money flows using several specific emergy based indicators the emergy value of a product or service can be attained by multiplying its available quantity by the corresponding uev unit emergy value based on a specific emergy baseline since five different emergy baselines have emerged in existing literature odum 1996 campbell 1998 odum 2000 brown and ulgiati 2010 brown et al 2016 here the latest emergy baseline i e 12 00e 24sej a is adopted due to its improved degree of accuracy 2 3 1 emergy flows of the case according to fig 3 the total emergy input before and after the upgradation includes raw sewage flow local renewable resources r including sunlight wind rain earth circulation energy and air purchased renewable resources fr including renewable parts of tap water and l s labor and services purchased non renewable resources fn including the non renewable part of tap water steel concrete gasoline thermal electricity power liquid chlorine flocculants and the non renewable part of l s among them 49 75 of tap water is from fr while the rest derives from fn according to research of qi et al 2018 ulgiati et al 1994 and ulgiati and brown 2002 thought that 90 of l s is derived from fn and 10 from fr its output is environmental emissions including treated water air pollutants and greenhouse gases emissions and solid wastes generally water and air pollution emissions cannot meet related environmental quality standards so they have to be further treated to satisfy corresponding environmental quality stands through es ecological services however before attaining corresponding environmental requirements these environmental emissions may cause potential losses el by endangering human health and occupying land and related quantification methods are described in the next section 2 3 2 quantifying pollution emissions impacts in units of emergy 1 quantification of required ecological services ecological services used to eliminate emissions impacts include a series of physical chemical and biological processes zhang et al 2009 but here only the dilution function of atmospheric environment and water body is considered due to the unavailability of other parameters since pollutants have exergy such as chemical or gravitational potential energy it could cause environmental mis operation to dissipate the available energy which is a form of pollution winfrey and tilley 2016 therefore after the treated water with a high pollution load is discharged into the receiving water body self purification provided by the ecosystem is required to dilute pollutants and restore them to the acceptant concentration meanwhile ecological services are also used to dilute concentration of air emissions to an acceptant level zhang et al 2014 the ecological services used to dilute air or water pollutants are computed using eqs 1 4 zhang et al 2010b firstly the air or water mass needed to dilute pollutants are calculated using eq 1 1 m i air water d w i a i r w a t e r c i where mi air water denotes the mass of air or water needed kg a d means air density 1 23 kg m3 or water density 1 00e 03 kg m3 wi air water refers to the annual discharge of the ith air or water pollutant from a sewage treatment process kg a ci represents the allowable concentration of the ith air or water pollutant according to the related standards table 3 kg m3 then the emergy of the ecological service of the dilution air water is further calculated by eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 e s i air 0 5 m i air v 2 t r air 3 e s j water m j water t r water where esi air is the emergy of kinetic energy of air for diluting the ith air pollutant sej a mi air stands for the mass of air needed to dilute the ith air pollutant kg a v denotes the local annual mean wind speed here it is 1 4 m s trair is the transformity of wind energy which equals to 1 91e 03 sej j according to ref ulgiati and brown 2002 esj water is the emergy for diluting the j th water pollutant sej a mj air stands for the mass of water used to dilute the j th water pollutant kg a trwater represents the specific emergy of surface runoff in china and it was 2 85e 07 sej kg zhang et al 2014 since a kind of ecological service could dilute different types of pollutants in a specific medium at the same time sum of maximum value of each kind of ecological service is taken as the final one as given in eq 4 4 e s max e s i a i r max e s j w a t e r 2 quantifying potential economic loss although ecological services could dilute concentration of pollutants to a safe level chen et al 2020 pollutant emissions may lead to ecological loss by biodiversity reduction and lake eutrophication or cause potential economic loss by harming human health before they reach stable levels meanwhile solid wastes will occupy land resources when the disposal method is landfill air and water pollutants damage to natural capital can be depicted by the paf potentially affected fraction or pdf potential disappeared fraction in the affected ecosystem and their adverse effect on human health can be represented by daly disability adjusted life year per unit of emissions according to work of bakshi 2002 liu et al 2011 and liu et al 2013 in this study only the economic losses derived from human health harm and land occupation were taken into account due to unavailability of other relevant basic data daly is an end point impact assessment method that includes several impact categories table 4 such as respiratory diseases climate change etc and eq 5 quantifies the loss derived from the affected population in terms of emergy 5 e l p i n m i dal y i τ h where elp represents the loss caused by pollutant emissions harm to human health sej a i stands for the ith pollutant mi denotes the mass of the ith pollutant emitted kg a daly is the impact factor in the eco indicator 99 evaluation framework a kg of emissions table 4 τ h stands for annual emergy use per capita here it is chosen as 2 50e16 sej person a shen et al 2019 in addition losses derived from solid waste disposal could be quantified based on the land occupation caused by this disposal the research of wang et al 2006 showed that 2 85e 07 kg industrial solid wastes disposal approximately needs 1 ha land and the uev of land is 1 33e 15 sej ha odum 2000 corrected to the emergy baseline of 12 0e 24 sej a economic losses due to land occupation can be calculated as follows 6 e l l m s a s u s where ell is the economic loss due to land occupation sej a ms represents the total mass of solid waste being disposed kg a as denotes the land area needed by per unit solid waste landfill ha kg us refers to unit emergy value of land sej ha the total loss is calculated using eq 7 7 el e l p e l l finally the total emissions impact can be attained according to 8 ei es el 2 3 3 the adopted indicator system 1 cupr cost per unit pollutant removal sej g it is defined as sum of local resource input r n and purchased resource input fr fn divided by the mass of the ith water pollutant eliminated which can be computed using eq 9 9 cup r i r n f r f n m i this indicator is used to evaluate the emergy cost per unit ith water pollutant eliminated a bigger indicator value reflects the higher cost per unit pollutant removed in order to optimize the treatment process in practice those pollutants with larger cupr values should be highlighted 2 ieyr improved emergy yield ratio the classical emergy yield ratio equals to the ratio of the total emergy input to the purchased emergy which means that all outputs are beneficial to human society however pollutants control process is always accompanied with some indirect and secondary pollution emissions therein mitigated emissions impacts and co products are positive outputs and aggravated emissions impacts are negative outputs zhang et al 2014 therefore to fully reflect the performance of a sewage treatment system the emergy loss caused by pollutant emissions as one of negative outputs should be subtracted in the classical emergy index in this study here the improved indicator ieyr is expressed as 10 ieyr r n f r f n el f r f n this indicator describes the competitiveness of the system de barros et al 2009 the higher indicator value means the stronger competitiveness 3 ielr improved environmental loading ratio for sewage treatment systems pollution emissions need extra ecological services to make them satisfy related legal requirements which could lead to an increased environmental load to quantify changes of environmental load before and after sewage treatment the ecological services for diluting pollutants should be integrated into the existing emergy indicator elr to attain improved environmental load rate ielr as follows 11 ielr n f n es f r r this indicator embodies the potential pressure on the environment a larger indicator value means the higher environmental load 4 iesi improved emergy sustainable index in this study after impacts of emissions being considered the classical esi emergy sustainability index should be corrected to eq 12 the larger index value refers to the relatively higher sustainable level 12 iesi ieyr ielr 2 4 ghg emissions of sewage treatment here the indicator ceus carbon emission per unit sewage treatment co2 eq t sewage is proposed to evaluate ghg greenhouse gas emissions of sewage treatment and it is equal to co2 eq co2 equivalent over the life cycle of a sewage treatment plant divided by total amount of sewage treatment as shown in eq 10 13 c e u s i c e i t s where ce represents the co2 equivalence here the greenhouse gases include co2 and ch4 total carbon emission of a sewage treatment system is calculated as follows 14 c e i q i c o 2 28 q i c h 4 where cei refers to carbon emission of the ith scenario kg co2 eq qi co2 stands for quantity of co2 emission kg qi ch4 stands for quantity of ch4 emission kg 28 is the global warming potential of ch4 based on a 100 year period ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change 2013 ts refers to total amount of sewage treatment t sewage a this indicator stands for ghg emissions intensity of sewage treatment systems the higher indicator value means the bigger ghg emissions intensity of a sewage treatment system 2 5 economic evaluation economic evaluation can provide market related information such as economic cost of products or services related economic benefit which cannot be clearly shown in ema in this study two indicators are selected including cust life cycle cost per unit of sewage treatment us m3 and nebr net economic benefit ratio among them cust is defined as sum of total life cycle cost divided by annual sewage treatment amount as shown in eq 15 15 c u s t l c c 7 97 t s where lcc stands for total life cycle cost yuan a lcc aic aoc therein aic is annual investment cost yuan a aoc denotes annual operating cost yuan a 7 97 is ratio of rmb to us in the year 2006 nebr refers to the difference between economic income and life cycle cost divided by life cycle cost as shown eq 16 nebr 0 means net economic benefit nebr 0 reflects balance between income and expenditure and nebr 0 indicates it is not economically viable chen et al 2020 16 n e b r t s p u s l c c l c c where eus represents fee per unit of sewage treatment yuan t and here it is 0 86 yuan t before the upgradation and 1 12 yuan t after the upgradation corrected according to banan housing and urban rural construction commission 2021 2 6 synergetic effect index to improve the comprehensive performance an industrial system should have a synergetic relationship between its environmental performance and economic performance which can be described using sei synergetic effect index this index is positively related to iesi and nebr while it is negatively related to ceus and it can be calculated as follows 17 s e i i i e s i i i e s i n e b r i n e b r c e u s i c e u s 18 i e s i i 1 n i e s i i n 19 n e b r i 1 n n e b r i n 20 c e u s i 1 n c e u s i n where iesii nebri and ceusi refer to indicator values of improved emergy sustainability index net economic benefit ratio and carbon emission per unit sewage treatment of the ith sewage treatment scenario i e s i n e b r a n d c e u s stand for average indicator values of improved emergy sustainability index net economic benefit ratio and carbon emission per unit sewage treatment of n sewage treatment scenarios respectively here n 2 shown in table 2 the larger index value of sei means more reasonable structure of an industrial system and then it is beneficial for its sustainable development 2 7 sources of data and processing software basic data of the sewage treatment system are mainly derived from yang 2014 and related investigation and missing data are complemented by related literature the regional meteorological data and social data are cited from chongqing statistical yearbook urban drainage statistical yearbook local government website and economic and social development report etc some basic data are estimated due to lacking raw data shown in related footnotes of emergy evaluation tables and the unit emergy values cited in this study are from published literature and public database as shown in sm 1 here microsoft excel 2019 is applied to data processing and emergy flow system diagrams are drawn by microsoft powerpoint 2019 3 results and analysis 3 1 emergy flows the detailed emergy evaluation of the sewage treatment system before and after upgradation scenarios s1 and s2 respectively has been given in sm 2 and sm 3 and the input emergy flows of the two scenarios are summarized in tables 5 and 6 in the construction stage total emergy input before and after upgradation is 2 91e 18 sej a and 3 74e 18 sej a respectively which is basically from purchased inputs about 100 00 among them the nonrenewable inputs contribute 94 93 and 94 03 before and after upgradation respectively mainly from nonrenewable part of the investment 45 53 before vs 53 72 after concrete 37 62 before vs 30 75 after and steel consumption 7 83 before vs 6 42 after and renewable resources account for 5 07 and 5 97 before and after upgradation respectively mainly from renewable part of the investment inputs comparing to scenario s1 emergy input of scenario s2 has increased by 28 52 in the construction stage due to the added high speed fiber filter leading to more resources and energy requirements in the operation stage the total emergy input reaches 2 71e 19 sej a and 3 00e 19 sej a before and after upgradation respectively therein 57 53 and 56 66 of emergy input comes from purchased nonrenewable resources for s1 and s2 respectively to which thermal electricity power is the largest contributor 32 30 before vs 31 79 after followed by l s 17 16 before vs 17 55 after and tap water 7 32 before vs 6 63 after 33 31 and 34 82 of emergy input are local renewable resources for the two scenarios to which air is the main contributor purchased renewable resources have shares of 9 15 and 8 52 in total emergy input respectively which mainly come from tap water 7 25 before vs 6 57 after and l s 1 90 before vs 1 95 after in the operation phase emergy input of scenarios s2 is also higher than scenario s1 rooting in an increase in electricity use and operating expenses for the added facility regarding the system s total emergy input the ratios of emergy input in the construction stage and operation stage to the total energy input are 9 69 and 90 31 for s1 and 11 11 and 88 89 for s2 respectively whether or not before and after upgradation total emergy ratio in the operation phase is much higher than that in the construction phase as far as local renewable resources input mainly derived from air is concerned its share has increased by 2 91 after upgradation 30 08 before vs 30 96 after for the purchased renewable resources input it is derived from the renewable part of tap water 6 54 before vs 5 84 after and l s 6 15 before vs 7 70 after which falls by 5 96 after upgradation 8 76 before vs 8 24 after as for purchased nonrenewable resources input thermal electricity power is the biggest contributor to the total input next the nonrenewable part of l s and tap water before and after upgradation however share of purchased nonrenewable resources input descends by 0 58 after upgradation 61 16 before vs 60 81 after mainly derived from the reduced share of tap water fell by 10 77 3 2 emissions impact in construction stage table 7 total emissions impact reaches 1 95e 17 sej a and 2 05e17 sej a before and after upgradation respectively to which ecological services contribute 0 42 and the rest derives from emergy losses therein value of ecological services reaches 8 15e 14 sej a and 8 55e 14 sej a before and after upgradation respectively mainly for diluting so2 emissions emergy loss mainly comes from the impact of co 75 19 before vs 75 04 after and tsp 21 33 vs 21 49 emissions on human health after upgradation ecological services and emergy losses have been enhanced by 4 91 and 5 15 respectively due to increase of environmental emissions especially so2 and co from added construction materials especially steel and electrical equipment in operation stage table 7 emissions impacts equal to 2 56e 19 sej a before upgradation most of which is from ecological services 94 96 next emergy loss 5 04 tp is the main consumer of ecological services and tsp 52 02 is the main source of emergy loss followed by co 35 43 and so2 12 71 emissions impacts are 1 53e 19 sej a after upgradation to which ecological services are the absolute contributor 90 82 and the rest is from the emergy losses 9 18 therein most of the ecological services from water body are used to dilute nh3 n the emergy loss is mainly caused by tsp 52 21 followed by co 35 14 and so2 12 71 in the operation phase ecological service falls by 43 03 and emergy loss ascends by 8 53 after upgradation generally total emissions impact is reduced by 40 23 after upgradation compared to that before upgradation because technical upgradation has raised removal rate of water pollutants and thus cut total demand for ecological services total emissions impacts are 2 58e 19 sej a and 1 55e 19 sej a before and after upgradation table 8 respectively main from ecological service 94 24 before vs 89 63 after followed by emergy losses 5 76 before vs 10 37 after before upgradation the ecological service is 2 44e 19 sej a to which tp is the largest consumer and emergy loss is 1 49e 18 sej a which is mainly caused by tsp emission 47 89 followed by co emission 40 56 after upgradation ecological services are 1 39e 19 sej a which is mainly used to dilute nh3 n discharged and emergy loss is 1 61e 18 sej a which is mainly derived from tsp 48 23 followed by co 40 20 comparatively speaking ecological service is cut by 43 03 and emergy loss climbs by 8 08 after upgradation generally emissions impact descends by 39 92 after upgradation therefore environmental performance rooting in local water pollutants discharge reduction through upgradation greatly exceeds negative environmental impacts caused by extra resources and energy consumption from upgraded structures and their operation 3 3 emergy based indicators as shown in table 9 according to cupr it is found that removal of tp has the highest cost followed by removal of nh3 n then bod5 and removal of cod and ss have the similar and smallest emergy cost before and after upgradation meanwhile emergy cost for removal of ss cod and bod5 increases by 12 14 12 10 and 2 00 respectively and emergy cost for removal of nh3 n and tp decreases by 7 43 and 0 26 respectively after upgradation in terms of ieyr the indicator value is close to 1 before and after the upgrade indicating that the system has high dependence on imported resources which leads to relatively low economic efficiency and weak market competitiveness relative to other product manufacture industries after upgradation the production efficiency is raised by 1 47 compared to that before which means that this technical upgradation slightly strengthens competition of this sewage treatment system the indicator value will increase by 5 15 and 5 07 before and after upgradation respectively when neglecting the emissions impacts which means that pollutant emissions moderately weaken its competition ability as for ielr it is found that the environmental load rate is reduced by 28 96 after upgradation which indicates that the upgradation has clearly reduced the environmental pressure when emissions impacts are neglected environmental load rate will descend by 57 10 and 40 38 respectively so pollution emissions have remarkable impact on its environmental load especially before upgradation as far as iesi is concerned the sustainability level ascends by 43 24 after upgradation mainly due to obviously reduced ecological services when ignoring emissions impact the sustainability level will rise by 145 95 and 75 47 for s1 and s2 respectively and this means that pollutant emissions have prominent effect on environmental performance of the sewage treatment system 3 4 ghg emissions of sewage treatment the carbon emission intensity of sewage treatment in each stage is shown in table 10 and detailed information are given in sm 4 in the construction stage the ceus value before and after upgrading is both 0 05 kg co2 eq t mainly from the production process of steel 55 10 before vs 54 96 after followed by thermal electricity power 23 34 before vs 23 28 after and concrete 21 54 before vs 21 48 after in the operation stage the indicator values of ceus before and after upgradation are 0 95 and 1 03 co2 eq t respectively among which thermal electricity power contributes the largest 99 06 before vs 99 14 after followed by flocculant 0 80 before vs 0 74 after as described in table 11 total indicator value of ceus before and after upgradation is 1 00 and 1 08 co2 eq t respectively which mainly comes from thermal electricity power 95 22 before vs 95 42 after followed by steel 2 79 before vs 2 70 after and concrete 1 09 before vs 1 05 after and indicator value of s2 is 8 00 bigger than s1 indicating that the upgradation has enhanced the intensity of the ghg emissions of this sewage treatment system to some degree thermal electricity power consumption in operation stage is the main contributor to total carbon emission 3 5 economic evaluation according to table 12 economic cost of s2 is 21 33 higher than s1 which is mainly attributed to the increased investment for added facility 53 23 followed by rising operation cost caused by added power consumption 46 77 and values of nebr are 0 17 and 0 26 for s1 and s2 respectively which reflects the latter has better economic benefit than the former generally this upgradation clearly improves economic benefit of this enterprise because rising sewage treatment fee slightly exceeds its increased cost 3 6 synergetic effect index as shown in table 13 the sei values are 0 69 and 1 35 before and after the upgradation respectively and this shows that the synergetic relationship among its environmental performance mitigation of ghg emissions and economic performance is improved by 95 65 after the upgradation which mainly lies in improved economic benefit followed by improved environmental performance as a result the technical upgradation is successful in terms of its comprehensive performance 4 sensitivity analyses here main uncertainty comes from emergy evaluation which could derive from unmatched unit emergy values with this case and fluctuation of main input data it can be seen from sm 2 and sm 3 that air and thermal electricity power are the main contributors to the total emergy input and are independent of each other to investigate impact of the two kinds of inputs on emergy based indicator values emergy values of air and thermal electricity power are assumed to alter between 10 and 10 10 5 5 0 and 10 based on their original values respectively while other inputs remain unchanged and changes of several indicators are illustrated in figs 4 and 5 detailed changes in indicator values are shown in sm 5 it is found that when air input changes between 10 and 10 indicator values alter between 10 66 11 15 and 10 89 11 41 for s1 and s2 respectively when thermal electricity power input alters between 10 and 10 indicator values fluctuate between 3 09 3 31 and 3 79 4 11 for s1 and s2 respectively therefore generally changes of main input categories have limited impacts on emergy based indicator values and thus the evaluation results could act as references for the following decision making 5 discussion and policy suggestions after the upgradation total emergy input increases by 11 96 mainly due to extra thermal electricity power consumption total emission s impact decreases by 39 92 mainly rooting in raised removal rate of tp emergy yield rate is slightly improved and environmental load rate descends greatly and thus the sustainability level clearly rises while environmental emissions significantly affect the environmental load and then the sustainability level which also highlights one of main characteristics of this kind of artificial system this upgradation improves economic benefit of this enterprise because added sewage treatment fee slightly exceeds its increased treatment cost comprehensively the upgradation promotes the synergetic relationship between its environmental performance and economic performance by 95 65 however following issues should be further investigated including 1 how to reduce extra indirect pollutant emissions from the upgradation and 2 how to reduce extra carbon emission from the upgradation under the background of carbon neutrality in china next these issues will be discussed in detail 5 1 discussion this study shows that generally net environmental benefit from the upgradation reaches 1 03e19 sej a table 9 and added emergy cost and economic cost is just 3 60e18 sej a and 2 90e5 us a tables 7 and 13 respectively so the ratio of output to input is 2 86 in terms of emergy and related environmental performance per unit currency is 3 55e13 sej us which is much larger than ratio of emergy to currency of china in 2014 3 33e12 sej us national environmental accounting database v2 0 2014 www emergy nead com country data therefore this technical upgradation is all feasible from the perspective of environmental and economic efficiency however it should be also noted that although the upgradation has reduced the pressure on the local water environment the increase of sewage treatment intensity has also brought additional burden to the environment in other areas due to emissions from production and transportation of extra energy sources and materials in addition the upgraded system also leads to related secondary emissions such as increased carbon emissions and solid waste disposal therein those carbon emissions mainly come from the production of thermal electricity power in operation stage and thus energy saving is the best way to reduce these indirect emissions among them the lifting pump room and the blower room have the largest electricity consumption and it should be replaced using variable frequency drive pumps sarpong et al 2020 meanwhile optimizing the aeration system through adjusting the aeration rate appropriately could also reduce energy consumption li et al 2021 next electricity mix can be improved the electricity demand of the sewage plant is completely dependent on external electricity source which is the main contributor to total greenhouse gas emission of the sewage treatment system therefore the energy structure of the power sector should be transformed into low carbon energy sources to reduce indirect greenhouse gas emissions liao et al 2020 through introducing more renewable and or clean energy sources according to local conditions such as biomass based electricity hydroelectricity etc moreover some scholars have explored related measures for mitigating carbon emissions in the field of sewage treatment pahunang et al 2021 found that biochar made by pyrolysis process of sludge is a value added product that can be used as a soil conditioner or an adsorbent in the tertiary treatment of sewage which could act as one of options for mitigating carbon emissions intensity of sewage treatment in addition buonocore et al 2018 found that part of the treated wastewater can be reused for plantation of energy crop and biomass of energy crop can be further used for power generation which would further reduce reliance on fossil energy power generation and mitigate related greenhouse gas emissions this study shows that the upgradation increases investment costs 21 33 but increase of the sewage treatment fee after upgradation is slightly larger than that before and thus final economic benefit still be enhanced accordingly and the economic benefits can be further improved through sludge composting and reclaimed water reuse according to classic economic evaluation benefits of wastewater treatment are often underestimated because non market benefits are not considered hernandez sancho et al 2015 in fact economic benefit of sewage treatment should also include related environmental performance such as the cost of avoiding water environmental degradation caused by raw wastewater discharges improved human health resulting from the prevention of diseases caused by raw wastewater discharges alizadeh et al 2020 etc of course how to scientifically transform environmental performance of technical upgradation into real economic income for related sewage treatment enterprises still need further exploration in the future finally in the process of upgrading urban sewage treatment systems the local ecological and environmental conditions should be fully considered for reducing or avoiding the potential problems sewage treatment is one of main supporting measures for protecting local water environment quality which could have conflict with the goal of energy saving and consumption reduction required in the 14th five year plan of chinese government because this industry has higher energy use and related indirect carbon emissions if the local renewable resources and the self purification capacity of the natural ecosystem can be rationally utilized the environmental load caused by construction of additional engineering facilities can be mitigated or avoided bai 2019 5 2 suggestions 1 improving energy performance wwtps are considered to be one of energy intensive facilities xu et al 2018 therein electricity consumption is the main contributor liu et al 2021a to reduce energy use intensity following measures could be considered firstly energy efficiency should be enhanced through a replacing the aeration diffuser with a fine pore diffusion system b improving the process energy efficiency of the traditional activated sludge process through applying on line monitoring to dissolved oxygen rosso and stenstrom 2008 and c reasonably arranging the plant area to optimize connection mode of pipelines for reducing unnecessary hydraulic loss these measures can directly reduce electricity consumption and indirectly cut secondary emissions secondly energy recovery can be carried out therein excess sludge can be used to generate renewable energy gherghel et al 2019 through combustion or anaerobic digestion of excess sludge which could attain the calorific value or the biogas with high calorific value çelebi et al 2021 on the other hand thermal energy in wastewater can be recovered by heat exchange of secondary effluent with water source pump hao et al 2015 which can indirectly offset the energy requirements of wastewater treatment of course if municipal authorities could work together to plan the use of this thermal energy it will be greatly beneficial hao et al 2019 these measures can improve the energy self sufficiency rate of sewage treatment plants and then reduce indirect environmental emissions lee et al 2017 therefore its indicator values of ielr could also descend however other indicator values changes still depend on special recovery methods thirdly stable renewable energy sources can be chosen at present solar photocatalysis solar disinfection and solar desalination have used for wastewater treatment pichel et al 2018 although solar energy is intermittent this power supply technology could supplement part of electricity for sewage treatment in the day when it becomes mature it is necessary to focus on research and development of economic and feasible energy storage system for application of this technology in the future pandey et al 2021 for policymakers especially in the context of china s newly proposed carbon neutrality goal developing renewable energy can inspire new strategies for raising energy efficiency and promoting carbon emission reduction yang and chen 2021 finally one promising option in the future is to integrate wastewater treatment plants and incineration plants which will take full advantage of waste heat from sludge incineration and further reduce fossil energy consumption nakatsuka et al 2020 the proposal can reduce environmental load and improve energy efficiency integration of the two kinds of plants is usually limited by distance due to additional use of pipelines or vehicles nakakubo et al 2017 meanwhile it is also necessary to fully consider whether the cost of pipeline laying is feasible and whether technology of heat recovery under low temperature conditions is reliable therefore related research should be further pushed forward in the future 2 optimizing the existing processes firstly the existing flocculation process should be improved for example commonly used coagulants flocculants including pac pam and so on can be replaced using composite flocculants like nano type flocculants which not only improves the efficiency of pollutant removal but also reduces operating costs he et al 2021 secondly upgrading the dosing system can be considered traditional manual dosing mode should be replaced using p rtc automatic dosing system to provide accurate and stable dosing which can save reagents consumption and then reduces operating cost jia et al 2019 3 promoting municipal wastewater management to the direction of circular economy firstly the investment in upgradation of sewage treatment projects should reserve space for the development of resource utilization so as to transform urban wastewater treatment systems from a costly service to a self sustaining and environmentally friendly one zhang and liu 2022 secondly methods of waste control by waste should be adopted to promote circular economy to further raise removal rates of nutrients in sewage the ceramsite prepared with excess sludge and fly ash as well as modified by alkali or lanthanum can be applied to the adsorption of nitrogen and phosphorus in the effluent water next ceramsite containing nitrogen and phosphorus can be used as plant cultivation fertilizer the technology could improve the sustainable level of sewage treatment systems shao et al 2022 to reduce indirect emissions impacts from chemical regents use steel slag from steel industry can be also used for the removal of phosphorus in municipal sewage roychand et al 2020 which can reduce the dependence on external chemicals and thus realize reuse of solid waste to solve the problem of land occupation caused by landfill of excess sludge excess sludge can be comprehensively incinerated with urban domestic waste and the generated bottom slag can be used to make building materials chen et al 2019 which not only saves land resources but also makes profits by selling building materials in addition use of biosolids from sewage treatment plants for energy recovery by a fluidized bed gasification process is a potential way for improving energy mix and other performance indicators of wastewater treatment systems cano londono et al 2017 however the stages of energy transformation turbine and gas cleaning should be optimized to further raise energy efficiency of this technology cano et al 2022 finally treated water reuse should be further promoted to this end the tertiary treatment could be considered so that effluent can be reused for non drinking and industrial purposes awad et al 2019 and this measure can improve environmental performance through reducing residual water pollutants discharged into the water body and the benefits of water conservation are equivalent to the energy savings of producing the same amount of tap water awad et al 2019 zhang et al 2010a however all these measures need to be carefully evaluated from pros and cons so as to overcome their potential negative impacts 6 conclusions and research prospect 6 1 conclusions this study established a set of approach and related indicators to assess holistic performance of sewage treatment systems from environmental and economic aspects and then compared comprehensive performance before and after upgradation of a sewage treatment system using the presented methods and indicators after the upgradation total emergy input increases by 11 96 mainly due to extra thermal electricity power consumption total emissions impact decreases by 39 92 mainly rooting in raised removal rate of tp in the effluent emergy yield rate is slightly improved and environmental load rate descends greatly and thus the sustainability level clearly rises meanwhile environmental emissions significantly affect the environmental load and then the sustainable level this upgradation also improves economic benefit of this enterprise because rising sewage treatment fee slightly exceeds its increased treatment cost comprehensively the upgradation promotes the synergetic relationship between its environmental performance and economic performance by 95 65 based on related findings this study puts forward targeted suggestions for promoting comprehensive performance of sewage treatment systems in the future the presented approach and related indicators can also act as one of decision making tools for optimizing upgradation schemes of other environmental protection facilities 6 2 research prospect on one hand to promote sustainability of this sewage treatment system following issues need further exploration in the future including impacts of different treated water disposal ways on performance of this system discharge or reclaimed water reuse effects of different sludge disposal ways landfilling composting energy recovery using incineration etc and so on on the other hand as far as ecological services provided the local environment are concerned they include physical chemical and biological processes here only the dilution function of atmospheric environment and water body is considered due to the unavailability of other parameters to calculate ecological services derived from chemical and biological processes related on spot monitoring is needed to attain specific parameters on hydrology microorganism meteorological conditions etc credit authorship contribution statement lingchi liu conceptualization methodology

24361,upgradation of sewage treatment plants has been greatly promoted in china but few studies investigate impact of this practice on synergetic relationship between environmental performance and economic performance of those systems this study aims to investigate environmental sustainability economic benefit and greenhouse gasses emission intensity of different sewage treatment schemes and then identify the best one as well as related negative factors needed to be addressed in the future a comprehensive performance index synergetic effect index sei derived from integration of improved emergy sustainability index iesi net economic benefit ratio nebr and carbon emission per unit sewage treatment ceus is proposed to address this issue firstly to investigate environmental sustainability of sewage treatment more completely this approach improved the classic emergy analysis through integrating emissions impacts into related classic emergy yield ratio and environmental loading ratio respectively and then built the comprehensive index iesi next the indicator nebr and ceus were proposed to assess economic benefit and greenhouse gasses emission intensity respectively finally the three indicators i e iesi and nebr as well as ceus are merged into the index sei to evaluate comprehensive performance of sewage treatment a sewage treatment plant located in southwest china as a research case was investigated using the presented approach from its construction stage to its operation stage it is found that after the upgradation total emergy input increases by 11 96 mainly from extra thermal electricity power consumption total emission s impact decreases by 39 92 mainly from raised removal rate of total phosphorus emergy yield rate is slightly improved and environmental load rate descends greatly and thus the sustainability level clearly rises meanwhile environmental emissions significantly affect the environmental load and then the sustainable level this upgradation improves its economic benefit because rising sewage treatment fee slightly exceeds its added treatment cost thermal electricity power consumption in operation stage is the main contributor to total carbon emission sensitivity analyses shows that changes of main input categories have not altered the research results generally the upgradation promotes the synergetic relationship between its environmental performance and economic performance by 95 65 however indirect environmental emissions from the upgradation should be emphasized this enterprise should further improve energy performance optimize the existing processes and promote its circular economy in the future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage treatment upgradation emergy china emissions impact synergetic effect data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water pollution in china derived from fast development of urbanization and industrialization are threatening the sustainable development of society therein sewage discharge is the main contributor to water pollution gao et al 2020 china s sewage discharge amount reached 72 53 billion tons in 2019 ministry of housing and urban rural development of the people s republic of china 2019 which increased by 1 4 times relative to 2005 and this highlights importance of development of sewage treatment plants vassallo et al 2009 in 2019 the number of sewage treatment plants of china had increased by 19 36 times since 2005 according to statistic data of ministry of housing and urban rural development of the people s republic of china 2019 in recent years in order to meet the increasingly stringent discharge standards upgradation of sewage treatment technologies has been continuously pushed forward in the existing wwtps wastewater treatment plant in practice engineers and technicians mainly concern whether specific water quality parameters meet the new standards after the upgradation however from a life cycle perspective upgradation of sewage treatment systems needs extra investment from the environment and human society in their construction and operation stages and this may produce secondary environmental problems due to indirect environmental emissions and transfer of water pollutants to other mediums meneses et al 2015 rashid et al 2020 such as atmospheric environment edatope etc if wwtps are upgraded only for solving local water pollution without overall awareness it may be difficult to achieve net environmental improvement wang et al 2015 therefore technical upgradation of sewage treatment systems should be thoroughly investigated so as to put forward related measures for improving its comprehensive benefits zhang et al 2015 to explore effect of the upgradation of wwtps on their environmental and economic performance and energy efficiency lots of scholars have implemented related studies from diverse angles therein guven et al 2012 compared lca life cycle assessment results of hras high rate activated sludge system and hras with food waste being added to wastewater and they thought that the latter had the smallest environmental impact liu et al 2021b did a lca of two typical sewage treatment systems and they revealed that raising sewage discharge standards can reduce eutrophication potential but increase fossil energy consumption however these studies did not consider the environmental contribution to sewage treatment systems and thus could not provide full information for decision making rashid et al 2020 investigated application of sbr sequencing batch reactor to upgradation of large scale municipal wwtps using ee economic evaluation and lca and they found that sbr technology is environmentally friendly but a trade off between environmental benefits and economic costs has to be balanced but they neglected the environmental contribution and the quality diversity of different energy sources and resources di iaconi et al 2017 compared energy intensity of the sewage treatment plant before and after the upgradation using ena energy analysis and they found that the energy efficiency was weakened after the upgradation mainly due to added recycle flow in the system however ena neglects the quality differences of various energy sources and thus cannot clearly quantify their contribution to social economic systems zaborowska et al 2021 evaluated the energy balance and cf carbon footprint of wwtps and they found that although non process heat demand has a significant impact on the energy balance and cf technological upgrades could realize energy neutrality through significant carbon emissions reduction but they did not consider the environmental contribution to those wwtps and associated economic performance innocenzi et al 2021 applied lcc life cycle cost to investigation of economic benefit of wwtps but related resources efficiency and environmental impact have not been clearly shown meanwhile they also ignored the environmental contribution di fraia et al 2019 researched energy efficiency of wwtps using ena and exa exergy analysis but they have ignored the environmental contribution to wwtps the abovementioned studies compared performance before and after upgradation of wwtps using different methods and then proposed some beneficial suggestions for policy making but they have the following shortcomings therein lca ignores the environmental contribution to human systems and the weight depending on experts scoring may cause subjectivity to some degree lcc does not consider the environmental contribution ena ignores quality changes among diverse energy sources and thus cannot accurately compare contribution of different types of energy sources exa neglects the environmental contribution to artificial system and cf only focuses on limited environmental emissions and thus could not provide policy makers with full information relatively speaking the ema emergy analysis can distinguish the differences between diverse resources energy sources and labor and service through uevs unit emergy values based on a common unit lou and ulgiati 2013 zhang et al 2015 and thus it can assess the ecological economic system more completely than other methods up to now ema has been widely used by lots of scholars to study the performance of sewage treatment systems arbault et al 2014 calculated the ecological performance of four sewage treatment plants through the emergy calculation software scal and they revealed its effectiveness in evaluating the environmental performance of this kind of artificial systems arias and brown 2009 compared the performance of treatment wetland models waste stabilization pond systems and sbrs by classic ema and yang et al 2017 assessed the environmental performance and economic value of a decentralized rapid infiltration system in qingdao using ema these works provide beneficial suggestions for the decision making but generally their results are incomplete due to neglect of the adverse effects of environmental discharge on the socio economic environment shao et al 2015 jointed ema and exa to assess the resource efficiency and renewability of constructed wetland system but the impact of environmental emissions on the economy and society has been overlooked meanwhile the integration of results of the two methods needs further exploration duan et al 2011 investigated the environmental impact and sustainability of urban wetland parks and conventional wwtps using ema and lca but the impacts of environmental emissions were not merged into relevant indicators to accurately quantify the impact of emissions on environmental performance cano londono et al 2017 compared environmental sustainability of two utilization ways of biosolids from a municipal wastewater treatment plant using emergy analysis i e use of biosolids as fertilizers for silvopasture soils vs use of biosolids for energy recovery by a fluidized bed gasification process and they provided beneficial suggestions for further improving comprehensive performance of the two alternatives in the future zhang and ma 2020 conducted an emergy analysis on the infrastructure construction and operation stage of a newly built sewage treatment system in china and emphasized the importance of emergy in the infrastructure construction stage for improving the system sustainability but they did not distinguish differences of diverse outputs that would be useful or useless harm to human society when they calculated emergy yield rate it is noted that information related to economic performance could not be intuitively reflected in ema for this purpose some scholars think that a combination of ema and economic assessment can make up for this flaw of ema for providing decision makers with more comprehensive information for example wang et al 2018b combined the methods of ema cf and economic assessment to investigate the sustainability level of china s food system during 2005 2015 and they discovered that the economic performance and sustainability level of china s food production system have been improved by expanding and optimizing planting patterns and improving agricultural practices zhang et al 2021 applied ema and economic assessment to comparison of performance changes of one cement production system before and after the implementation of waste heat power generation and their study showed that the implementation of hrpg could play a role in energy conservation and emission reduction as well as improvement of economic benefits the impact of technical upgradation on environmental and economic performance of wwtps has not been investigated simultaneously using ema and economic analysis in the existing literature so far furthermore how to integrated results from different evaluation methods is also worth deep exploration so as to provide a clear overall conclusion with policy makers to this end this paper constructs a set of novel indicator system especially an integrated index sei synergistic effect index covering environmental sustainability carbon emission intensity and economic benefit through combination of ema carbon accounting and ee to compare comprehensive performance of sewage treatment systems before and after upgradation during the life cycle this study aims to find out the potential factors adversely influencing the upgradation of sewage treatment systems and then put forward related suggestions for policy making through 1 investigating environmental performance before and after upgradation of the sewage treatment system using an improved ema therein the improved ema integrated the emissions impacts in emergy based indicators and 2 implementing a complementary ee and ceus carbon emission per unit sewage treatment assessment of sewage treatment systems before and after upgradation a sewage treatment plant in southwest china as a study case was evaluated by using the proposed approach the novelty of this work roots in 1 quantifying emissions impacts in units of emergy and then integrating those impacts into related emergy based indicators and 2 establishing an integrated index sei to compare synergetic relationship among environmental performance economic benefit and carbon emission intensity before and after upgradation of sewage treatment systems in doing so this study can discover those factors affecting comprehensive performance of sewage treatment systems upgradation schemes more completely and then better optimize upgradation schemes for enhancing sustainability of sewage treatment systems in future meanwhile the proposed approach can also provide beneficial enlightenments for investigating performance of upgradation of other environmental protection systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study case the sewage treatment system is located in the main urban area of chongqing covering an area of 4540 m2 chongqing 29 35 n 106 33 e as one of municipalities directly under the central government of china is the biggest industrial and commercial city in southwest china it has annual average air temperature with 19 6 c annual mean sunshine hours with 1129 8 h annual mean relative humidity with 75 annual mean wind speed with 1 4 m s and annual mean precipitation with 1448 7 mm the sewage treatment plant was built and put into use in the year 2006 with a design scale of 40 000 m3 d and a total investment of 5 00e07 yuan the water quality of effluent can satisfy the standard b of grade ⅰ in urban wastewater treatment plant pollutant discharge standard gb18918 2002 before upgradation table 1 and the effluent is directly discharged into the local river as shown in fig 1 the technological process of the sewage treatment system before upgradation belongs to the cast cyclic activated sludge technology and the excess sludge is disposed by sanitary landfill with the increasingly serious water pollution situation derived from fast pace of urbanization and economic growth china s government has to address this tough issue for sustainable development for example a water supply crisis in 2007 caused by the outbreak of cyanobacteria in taihu lake china occurred during the implementation of the standard b of grade ⅰ in the standard gb18918 2002 for urban sewage treatment plants in china yang 2014 in order to prevent the recurrence of such incidents it is necessary to reduce the load of nitrogen and phosphorus in effluent discharged into the water body consequently the discharge standard of sewage treatment plants is becoming increasingly stricter the newly built sewage treatment plants in chongqing have implemented the standard a of grade ⅰ since 2010 to satisfy the raising wastewater discharge standard this sewage treatment plant was upgraded to increase removal rate of water pollutants fig 2 compared to the original craft the high speed fiber filter was newly installed to ensure treated water quality meet standard a in the grade ⅰ in urban wastewater treatment plant pollutant discharge standard gb18918 2002 table 1 the effluent is also discharged 2 2 analysis boundary the analysis boundary of the sewage treatment system is shown in fig 2 here the decommissioning stage are excluded due to the data unavailability in the construction stage inputs include steel and concrete for all kinds of structures thermal electricity power and gasoline for production and transportation of raw materials and investment cost in the operation phase main inputs include thermal electricity power to drive machinery and equipment chemical reagents and gasoline to transport solid waste as well as operating costs besides sewage the outputs are composed of related air emissions water pollutants discharge and solid wastes table 2 provides a brief description of the sewage treatment system before and after its upgradation 2 3 ema emergy measured in terms of solar energy joules sej is defined as the total amount of available energy that directly or indirectly used to make a product or service odum 1988 1996 and it quantifies contribution of different types of energy sources in ecological economic systems further ema comprehensively explore the quantity and structure of energy material and money flows using several specific emergy based indicators the emergy value of a product or service can be attained by multiplying its available quantity by the corresponding uev unit emergy value based on a specific emergy baseline since five different emergy baselines have emerged in existing literature odum 1996 campbell 1998 odum 2000 brown and ulgiati 2010 brown et al 2016 here the latest emergy baseline i e 12 00e 24sej a is adopted due to its improved degree of accuracy 2 3 1 emergy flows of the case according to fig 3 the total emergy input before and after the upgradation includes raw sewage flow local renewable resources r including sunlight wind rain earth circulation energy and air purchased renewable resources fr including renewable parts of tap water and l s labor and services purchased non renewable resources fn including the non renewable part of tap water steel concrete gasoline thermal electricity power liquid chlorine flocculants and the non renewable part of l s among them 49 75 of tap water is from fr while the rest derives from fn according to research of qi et al 2018 ulgiati et al 1994 and ulgiati and brown 2002 thought that 90 of l s is derived from fn and 10 from fr its output is environmental emissions including treated water air pollutants and greenhouse gases emissions and solid wastes generally water and air pollution emissions cannot meet related environmental quality standards so they have to be further treated to satisfy corresponding environmental quality stands through es ecological services however before attaining corresponding environmental requirements these environmental emissions may cause potential losses el by endangering human health and occupying land and related quantification methods are described in the next section 2 3 2 quantifying pollution emissions impacts in units of emergy 1 quantification of required ecological services ecological services used to eliminate emissions impacts include a series of physical chemical and biological processes zhang et al 2009 but here only the dilution function of atmospheric environment and water body is considered due to the unavailability of other parameters since pollutants have exergy such as chemical or gravitational potential energy it could cause environmental mis operation to dissipate the available energy which is a form of pollution winfrey and tilley 2016 therefore after the treated water with a high pollution load is discharged into the receiving water body self purification provided by the ecosystem is required to dilute pollutants and restore them to the acceptant concentration meanwhile ecological services are also used to dilute concentration of air emissions to an acceptant level zhang et al 2014 the ecological services used to dilute air or water pollutants are computed using eqs 1 4 zhang et al 2010b firstly the air or water mass needed to dilute pollutants are calculated using eq 1 1 m i air water d w i a i r w a t e r c i where mi air water denotes the mass of air or water needed kg a d means air density 1 23 kg m3 or water density 1 00e 03 kg m3 wi air water refers to the annual discharge of the ith air or water pollutant from a sewage treatment process kg a ci represents the allowable concentration of the ith air or water pollutant according to the related standards table 3 kg m3 then the emergy of the ecological service of the dilution air water is further calculated by eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 e s i air 0 5 m i air v 2 t r air 3 e s j water m j water t r water where esi air is the emergy of kinetic energy of air for diluting the ith air pollutant sej a mi air stands for the mass of air needed to dilute the ith air pollutant kg a v denotes the local annual mean wind speed here it is 1 4 m s trair is the transformity of wind energy which equals to 1 91e 03 sej j according to ref ulgiati and brown 2002 esj water is the emergy for diluting the j th water pollutant sej a mj air stands for the mass of water used to dilute the j th water pollutant kg a trwater represents the specific emergy of surface runoff in china and it was 2 85e 07 sej kg zhang et al 2014 since a kind of ecological service could dilute different types of pollutants in a specific medium at the same time sum of maximum value of each kind of ecological service is taken as the final one as given in eq 4 4 e s max e s i a i r max e s j w a t e r 2 quantifying potential economic loss although ecological services could dilute concentration of pollutants to a safe level chen et al 2020 pollutant emissions may lead to ecological loss by biodiversity reduction and lake eutrophication or cause potential economic loss by harming human health before they reach stable levels meanwhile solid wastes will occupy land resources when the disposal method is landfill air and water pollutants damage to natural capital can be depicted by the paf potentially affected fraction or pdf potential disappeared fraction in the affected ecosystem and their adverse effect on human health can be represented by daly disability adjusted life year per unit of emissions according to work of bakshi 2002 liu et al 2011 and liu et al 2013 in this study only the economic losses derived from human health harm and land occupation were taken into account due to unavailability of other relevant basic data daly is an end point impact assessment method that includes several impact categories table 4 such as respiratory diseases climate change etc and eq 5 quantifies the loss derived from the affected population in terms of emergy 5 e l p i n m i dal y i τ h where elp represents the loss caused by pollutant emissions harm to human health sej a i stands for the ith pollutant mi denotes the mass of the ith pollutant emitted kg a daly is the impact factor in the eco indicator 99 evaluation framework a kg of emissions table 4 τ h stands for annual emergy use per capita here it is chosen as 2 50e16 sej person a shen et al 2019 in addition losses derived from solid waste disposal could be quantified based on the land occupation caused by this disposal the research of wang et al 2006 showed that 2 85e 07 kg industrial solid wastes disposal approximately needs 1 ha land and the uev of land is 1 33e 15 sej ha odum 2000 corrected to the emergy baseline of 12 0e 24 sej a economic losses due to land occupation can be calculated as follows 6 e l l m s a s u s where ell is the economic loss due to land occupation sej a ms represents the total mass of solid waste being disposed kg a as denotes the land area needed by per unit solid waste landfill ha kg us refers to unit emergy value of land sej ha the total loss is calculated using eq 7 7 el e l p e l l finally the total emissions impact can be attained according to 8 ei es el 2 3 3 the adopted indicator system 1 cupr cost per unit pollutant removal sej g it is defined as sum of local resource input r n and purchased resource input fr fn divided by the mass of the ith water pollutant eliminated which can be computed using eq 9 9 cup r i r n f r f n m i this indicator is used to evaluate the emergy cost per unit ith water pollutant eliminated a bigger indicator value reflects the higher cost per unit pollutant removed in order to optimize the treatment process in practice those pollutants with larger cupr values should be highlighted 2 ieyr improved emergy yield ratio the classical emergy yield ratio equals to the ratio of the total emergy input to the purchased emergy which means that all outputs are beneficial to human society however pollutants control process is always accompanied with some indirect and secondary pollution emissions therein mitigated emissions impacts and co products are positive outputs and aggravated emissions impacts are negative outputs zhang et al 2014 therefore to fully reflect the performance of a sewage treatment system the emergy loss caused by pollutant emissions as one of negative outputs should be subtracted in the classical emergy index in this study here the improved indicator ieyr is expressed as 10 ieyr r n f r f n el f r f n this indicator describes the competitiveness of the system de barros et al 2009 the higher indicator value means the stronger competitiveness 3 ielr improved environmental loading ratio for sewage treatment systems pollution emissions need extra ecological services to make them satisfy related legal requirements which could lead to an increased environmental load to quantify changes of environmental load before and after sewage treatment the ecological services for diluting pollutants should be integrated into the existing emergy indicator elr to attain improved environmental load rate ielr as follows 11 ielr n f n es f r r this indicator embodies the potential pressure on the environment a larger indicator value means the higher environmental load 4 iesi improved emergy sustainable index in this study after impacts of emissions being considered the classical esi emergy sustainability index should be corrected to eq 12 the larger index value refers to the relatively higher sustainable level 12 iesi ieyr ielr 2 4 ghg emissions of sewage treatment here the indicator ceus carbon emission per unit sewage treatment co2 eq t sewage is proposed to evaluate ghg greenhouse gas emissions of sewage treatment and it is equal to co2 eq co2 equivalent over the life cycle of a sewage treatment plant divided by total amount of sewage treatment as shown in eq 10 13 c e u s i c e i t s where ce represents the co2 equivalence here the greenhouse gases include co2 and ch4 total carbon emission of a sewage treatment system is calculated as follows 14 c e i q i c o 2 28 q i c h 4 where cei refers to carbon emission of the ith scenario kg co2 eq qi co2 stands for quantity of co2 emission kg qi ch4 stands for quantity of ch4 emission kg 28 is the global warming potential of ch4 based on a 100 year period ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change 2013 ts refers to total amount of sewage treatment t sewage a this indicator stands for ghg emissions intensity of sewage treatment systems the higher indicator value means the bigger ghg emissions intensity of a sewage treatment system 2 5 economic evaluation economic evaluation can provide market related information such as economic cost of products or services related economic benefit which cannot be clearly shown in ema in this study two indicators are selected including cust life cycle cost per unit of sewage treatment us m3 and nebr net economic benefit ratio among them cust is defined as sum of total life cycle cost divided by annual sewage treatment amount as shown in eq 15 15 c u s t l c c 7 97 t s where lcc stands for total life cycle cost yuan a lcc aic aoc therein aic is annual investment cost yuan a aoc denotes annual operating cost yuan a 7 97 is ratio of rmb to us in the year 2006 nebr refers to the difference between economic income and life cycle cost divided by life cycle cost as shown eq 16 nebr 0 means net economic benefit nebr 0 reflects balance between income and expenditure and nebr 0 indicates it is not economically viable chen et al 2020 16 n e b r t s p u s l c c l c c where eus represents fee per unit of sewage treatment yuan t and here it is 0 86 yuan t before the upgradation and 1 12 yuan t after the upgradation corrected according to banan housing and urban rural construction commission 2021 2 6 synergetic effect index to improve the comprehensive performance an industrial system should have a synergetic relationship between its environmental performance and economic performance which can be described using sei synergetic effect index this index is positively related to iesi and nebr while it is negatively related to ceus and it can be calculated as follows 17 s e i i i e s i i i e s i n e b r i n e b r c e u s i c e u s 18 i e s i i 1 n i e s i i n 19 n e b r i 1 n n e b r i n 20 c e u s i 1 n c e u s i n where iesii nebri and ceusi refer to indicator values of improved emergy sustainability index net economic benefit ratio and carbon emission per unit sewage treatment of the ith sewage treatment scenario i e s i n e b r a n d c e u s stand for average indicator values of improved emergy sustainability index net economic benefit ratio and carbon emission per unit sewage treatment of n sewage treatment scenarios respectively here n 2 shown in table 2 the larger index value of sei means more reasonable structure of an industrial system and then it is beneficial for its sustainable development 2 7 sources of data and processing software basic data of the sewage treatment system are mainly derived from yang 2014 and related investigation and missing data are complemented by related literature the regional meteorological data and social data are cited from chongqing statistical yearbook urban drainage statistical yearbook local government website and economic and social development report etc some basic data are estimated due to lacking raw data shown in related footnotes of emergy evaluation tables and the unit emergy values cited in this study are from published literature and public database as shown in sm 1 here microsoft excel 2019 is applied to data processing and emergy flow system diagrams are drawn by microsoft powerpoint 2019 3 results and analysis 3 1 emergy flows the detailed emergy evaluation of the sewage treatment system before and after upgradation scenarios s1 and s2 respectively has been given in sm 2 and sm 3 and the input emergy flows of the two scenarios are summarized in tables 5 and 6 in the construction stage total emergy input before and after upgradation is 2 91e 18 sej a and 3 74e 18 sej a respectively which is basically from purchased inputs about 100 00 among them the nonrenewable inputs contribute 94 93 and 94 03 before and after upgradation respectively mainly from nonrenewable part of the investment 45 53 before vs 53 72 after concrete 37 62 before vs 30 75 after and steel consumption 7 83 before vs 6 42 after and renewable resources account for 5 07 and 5 97 before and after upgradation respectively mainly from renewable part of the investment inputs comparing to scenario s1 emergy input of scenario s2 has increased by 28 52 in the construction stage due to the added high speed fiber filter leading to more resources and energy requirements in the operation stage the total emergy input reaches 2 71e 19 sej a and 3 00e 19 sej a before and after upgradation respectively therein 57 53 and 56 66 of emergy input comes from purchased nonrenewable resources for s1 and s2 respectively to which thermal electricity power is the largest contributor 32 30 before vs 31 79 after followed by l s 17 16 before vs 17 55 after and tap water 7 32 before vs 6 63 after 33 31 and 34 82 of emergy input are local renewable resources for the two scenarios to which air is the main contributor purchased renewable resources have shares of 9 15 and 8 52 in total emergy input respectively which mainly come from tap water 7 25 before vs 6 57 after and l s 1 90 before vs 1 95 after in the operation phase emergy input of scenarios s2 is also higher than scenario s1 rooting in an increase in electricity use and operating expenses for the added facility regarding the system s total emergy input the ratios of emergy input in the construction stage and operation stage to the total energy input are 9 69 and 90 31 for s1 and 11 11 and 88 89 for s2 respectively whether or not before and after upgradation total emergy ratio in the operation phase is much higher than that in the construction phase as far as local renewable resources input mainly derived from air is concerned its share has increased by 2 91 after upgradation 30 08 before vs 30 96 after for the purchased renewable resources input it is derived from the renewable part of tap water 6 54 before vs 5 84 after and l s 6 15 before vs 7 70 after which falls by 5 96 after upgradation 8 76 before vs 8 24 after as for purchased nonrenewable resources input thermal electricity power is the biggest contributor to the total input next the nonrenewable part of l s and tap water before and after upgradation however share of purchased nonrenewable resources input descends by 0 58 after upgradation 61 16 before vs 60 81 after mainly derived from the reduced share of tap water fell by 10 77 3 2 emissions impact in construction stage table 7 total emissions impact reaches 1 95e 17 sej a and 2 05e17 sej a before and after upgradation respectively to which ecological services contribute 0 42 and the rest derives from emergy losses therein value of ecological services reaches 8 15e 14 sej a and 8 55e 14 sej a before and after upgradation respectively mainly for diluting so2 emissions emergy loss mainly comes from the impact of co 75 19 before vs 75 04 after and tsp 21 33 vs 21 49 emissions on human health after upgradation ecological services and emergy losses have been enhanced by 4 91 and 5 15 respectively due to increase of environmental emissions especially so2 and co from added construction materials especially steel and electrical equipment in operation stage table 7 emissions impacts equal to 2 56e 19 sej a before upgradation most of which is from ecological services 94 96 next emergy loss 5 04 tp is the main consumer of ecological services and tsp 52 02 is the main source of emergy loss followed by co 35 43 and so2 12 71 emissions impacts are 1 53e 19 sej a after upgradation to which ecological services are the absolute contributor 90 82 and the rest is from the emergy losses 9 18 therein most of the ecological services from water body are used to dilute nh3 n the emergy loss is mainly caused by tsp 52 21 followed by co 35 14 and so2 12 71 in the operation phase ecological service falls by 43 03 and emergy loss ascends by 8 53 after upgradation generally total emissions impact is reduced by 40 23 after upgradation compared to that before upgradation because technical upgradation has raised removal rate of water pollutants and thus cut total demand for ecological services total emissions impacts are 2 58e 19 sej a and 1 55e 19 sej a before and after upgradation table 8 respectively main from ecological service 94 24 before vs 89 63 after followed by emergy losses 5 76 before vs 10 37 after before upgradation the ecological service is 2 44e 19 sej a to which tp is the largest consumer and emergy loss is 1 49e 18 sej a which is mainly caused by tsp emission 47 89 followed by co emission 40 56 after upgradation ecological services are 1 39e 19 sej a which is mainly used to dilute nh3 n discharged and emergy loss is 1 61e 18 sej a which is mainly derived from tsp 48 23 followed by co 40 20 comparatively speaking ecological service is cut by 43 03 and emergy loss climbs by 8 08 after upgradation generally emissions impact descends by 39 92 after upgradation therefore environmental performance rooting in local water pollutants discharge reduction through upgradation greatly exceeds negative environmental impacts caused by extra resources and energy consumption from upgraded structures and their operation 3 3 emergy based indicators as shown in table 9 according to cupr it is found that removal of tp has the highest cost followed by removal of nh3 n then bod5 and removal of cod and ss have the similar and smallest emergy cost before and after upgradation meanwhile emergy cost for removal of ss cod and bod5 increases by 12 14 12 10 and 2 00 respectively and emergy cost for removal of nh3 n and tp decreases by 7 43 and 0 26 respectively after upgradation in terms of ieyr the indicator value is close to 1 before and after the upgrade indicating that the system has high dependence on imported resources which leads to relatively low economic efficiency and weak market competitiveness relative to other product manufacture industries after upgradation the production efficiency is raised by 1 47 compared to that before which means that this technical upgradation slightly strengthens competition of this sewage treatment system the indicator value will increase by 5 15 and 5 07 before and after upgradation respectively when neglecting the emissions impacts which means that pollutant emissions moderately weaken its competition ability as for ielr it is found that the environmental load rate is reduced by 28 96 after upgradation which indicates that the upgradation has clearly reduced the environmental pressure when emissions impacts are neglected environmental load rate will descend by 57 10 and 40 38 respectively so pollution emissions have remarkable impact on its environmental load especially before upgradation as far as iesi is concerned the sustainability level ascends by 43 24 after upgradation mainly due to obviously reduced ecological services when ignoring emissions impact the sustainability level will rise by 145 95 and 75 47 for s1 and s2 respectively and this means that pollutant emissions have prominent effect on environmental performance of the sewage treatment system 3 4 ghg emissions of sewage treatment the carbon emission intensity of sewage treatment in each stage is shown in table 10 and detailed information are given in sm 4 in the construction stage the ceus value before and after upgrading is both 0 05 kg co2 eq t mainly from the production process of steel 55 10 before vs 54 96 after followed by thermal electricity power 23 34 before vs 23 28 after and concrete 21 54 before vs 21 48 after in the operation stage the indicator values of ceus before and after upgradation are 0 95 and 1 03 co2 eq t respectively among which thermal electricity power contributes the largest 99 06 before vs 99 14 after followed by flocculant 0 80 before vs 0 74 after as described in table 11 total indicator value of ceus before and after upgradation is 1 00 and 1 08 co2 eq t respectively which mainly comes from thermal electricity power 95 22 before vs 95 42 after followed by steel 2 79 before vs 2 70 after and concrete 1 09 before vs 1 05 after and indicator value of s2 is 8 00 bigger than s1 indicating that the upgradation has enhanced the intensity of the ghg emissions of this sewage treatment system to some degree thermal electricity power consumption in operation stage is the main contributor to total carbon emission 3 5 economic evaluation according to table 12 economic cost of s2 is 21 33 higher than s1 which is mainly attributed to the increased investment for added facility 53 23 followed by rising operation cost caused by added power consumption 46 77 and values of nebr are 0 17 and 0 26 for s1 and s2 respectively which reflects the latter has better economic benefit than the former generally this upgradation clearly improves economic benefit of this enterprise because rising sewage treatment fee slightly exceeds its increased cost 3 6 synergetic effect index as shown in table 13 the sei values are 0 69 and 1 35 before and after the upgradation respectively and this shows that the synergetic relationship among its environmental performance mitigation of ghg emissions and economic performance is improved by 95 65 after the upgradation which mainly lies in improved economic benefit followed by improved environmental performance as a result the technical upgradation is successful in terms of its comprehensive performance 4 sensitivity analyses here main uncertainty comes from emergy evaluation which could derive from unmatched unit emergy values with this case and fluctuation of main input data it can be seen from sm 2 and sm 3 that air and thermal electricity power are the main contributors to the total emergy input and are independent of each other to investigate impact of the two kinds of inputs on emergy based indicator values emergy values of air and thermal electricity power are assumed to alter between 10 and 10 10 5 5 0 and 10 based on their original values respectively while other inputs remain unchanged and changes of several indicators are illustrated in figs 4 and 5 detailed changes in indicator values are shown in sm 5 it is found that when air input changes between 10 and 10 indicator values alter between 10 66 11 15 and 10 89 11 41 for s1 and s2 respectively when thermal electricity power input alters between 10 and 10 indicator values fluctuate between 3 09 3 31 and 3 79 4 11 for s1 and s2 respectively therefore generally changes of main input categories have limited impacts on emergy based indicator values and thus the evaluation results could act as references for the following decision making 5 discussion and policy suggestions after the upgradation total emergy input increases by 11 96 mainly due to extra thermal electricity power consumption total emission s impact decreases by 39 92 mainly rooting in raised removal rate of tp emergy yield rate is slightly improved and environmental load rate descends greatly and thus the sustainability level clearly rises while environmental emissions significantly affect the environmental load and then the sustainability level which also highlights one of main characteristics of this kind of artificial system this upgradation improves economic benefit of this enterprise because added sewage treatment fee slightly exceeds its increased treatment cost comprehensively the upgradation promotes the synergetic relationship between its environmental performance and economic performance by 95 65 however following issues should be further investigated including 1 how to reduce extra indirect pollutant emissions from the upgradation and 2 how to reduce extra carbon emission from the upgradation under the background of carbon neutrality in china next these issues will be discussed in detail 5 1 discussion this study shows that generally net environmental benefit from the upgradation reaches 1 03e19 sej a table 9 and added emergy cost and economic cost is just 3 60e18 sej a and 2 90e5 us a tables 7 and 13 respectively so the ratio of output to input is 2 86 in terms of emergy and related environmental performance per unit currency is 3 55e13 sej us which is much larger than ratio of emergy to currency of china in 2014 3 33e12 sej us national environmental accounting database v2 0 2014 www emergy nead com country data therefore this technical upgradation is all feasible from the perspective of environmental and economic efficiency however it should be also noted that although the upgradation has reduced the pressure on the local water environment the increase of sewage treatment intensity has also brought additional burden to the environment in other areas due to emissions from production and transportation of extra energy sources and materials in addition the upgraded system also leads to related secondary emissions such as increased carbon emissions and solid waste disposal therein those carbon emissions mainly come from the production of thermal electricity power in operation stage and thus energy saving is the best way to reduce these indirect emissions among them the lifting pump room and the blower room have the largest electricity consumption and it should be replaced using variable frequency drive pumps sarpong et al 2020 meanwhile optimizing the aeration system through adjusting the aeration rate appropriately could also reduce energy consumption li et al 2021 next electricity mix can be improved the electricity demand of the sewage plant is completely dependent on external electricity source which is the main contributor to total greenhouse gas emission of the sewage treatment system therefore the energy structure of the power sector should be transformed into low carbon energy sources to reduce indirect greenhouse gas emissions liao et al 2020 through introducing more renewable and or clean energy sources according to local conditions such as biomass based electricity hydroelectricity etc moreover some scholars have explored related measures for mitigating carbon emissions in the field of sewage treatment pahunang et al 2021 found that biochar made by pyrolysis process of sludge is a value added product that can be used as a soil conditioner or an adsorbent in the tertiary treatment of sewage which could act as one of options for mitigating carbon emissions intensity of sewage treatment in addition buonocore et al 2018 found that part of the treated wastewater can be reused for plantation of energy crop and biomass of energy crop can be further used for power generation which would further reduce reliance on fossil energy power generation and mitigate related greenhouse gas emissions this study shows that the upgradation increases investment costs 21 33 but increase of the sewage treatment fee after upgradation is slightly larger than that before and thus final economic benefit still be enhanced accordingly and the economic benefits can be further improved through sludge composting and reclaimed water reuse according to classic economic evaluation benefits of wastewater treatment are often underestimated because non market benefits are not considered hernandez sancho et al 2015 in fact economic benefit of sewage treatment should also include related environmental performance such as the cost of avoiding water environmental degradation caused by raw wastewater discharges improved human health resulting from the prevention of diseases caused by raw wastewater discharges alizadeh et al 2020 etc of course how to scientifically transform environmental performance of technical upgradation into real economic income for related sewage treatment enterprises still need further exploration in the future finally in the process of upgrading urban sewage treatment systems the local ecological and environmental conditions should be fully considered for reducing or avoiding the potential problems sewage treatment is one of main supporting measures for protecting local water environment quality which could have conflict with the goal of energy saving and consumption reduction required in the 14th five year plan of chinese government because this industry has higher energy use and related indirect carbon emissions if the local renewable resources and the self purification capacity of the natural ecosystem can be rationally utilized the environmental load caused by construction of additional engineering facilities can be mitigated or avoided bai 2019 5 2 suggestions 1 improving energy performance wwtps are considered to be one of energy intensive facilities xu et al 2018 therein electricity consumption is the main contributor liu et al 2021a to reduce energy use intensity following measures could be considered firstly energy efficiency should be enhanced through a replacing the aeration diffuser with a fine pore diffusion system b improving the process energy efficiency of the traditional activated sludge process through applying on line monitoring to dissolved oxygen rosso and stenstrom 2008 and c reasonably arranging the plant area to optimize connection mode of pipelines for reducing unnecessary hydraulic loss these measures can directly reduce electricity consumption and indirectly cut secondary emissions secondly energy recovery can be carried out therein excess sludge can be used to generate renewable energy gherghel et al 2019 through combustion or anaerobic digestion of excess sludge which could attain the calorific value or the biogas with high calorific value çelebi et al 2021 on the other hand thermal energy in wastewater can be recovered by heat exchange of secondary effluent with water source pump hao et al 2015 which can indirectly offset the energy requirements of wastewater treatment of course if municipal authorities could work together to plan the use of this thermal energy it will be greatly beneficial hao et al 2019 these measures can improve the energy self sufficiency rate of sewage treatment plants and then reduce indirect environmental emissions lee et al 2017 therefore its indicator values of ielr could also descend however other indicator values changes still depend on special recovery methods thirdly stable renewable energy sources can be chosen at present solar photocatalysis solar disinfection and solar desalination have used for wastewater treatment pichel et al 2018 although solar energy is intermittent this power supply technology could supplement part of electricity for sewage treatment in the day when it becomes mature it is necessary to focus on research and development of economic and feasible energy storage system for application of this technology in the future pandey et al 2021 for policymakers especially in the context of china s newly proposed carbon neutrality goal developing renewable energy can inspire new strategies for raising energy efficiency and promoting carbon emission reduction yang and chen 2021 finally one promising option in the future is to integrate wastewater treatment plants and incineration plants which will take full advantage of waste heat from sludge incineration and further reduce fossil energy consumption nakatsuka et al 2020 the proposal can reduce environmental load and improve energy efficiency integration of the two kinds of plants is usually limited by distance due to additional use of pipelines or vehicles nakakubo et al 2017 meanwhile it is also necessary to fully consider whether the cost of pipeline laying is feasible and whether technology of heat recovery under low temperature conditions is reliable therefore related research should be further pushed forward in the future 2 optimizing the existing processes firstly the existing flocculation process should be improved for example commonly used coagulants flocculants including pac pam and so on can be replaced using composite flocculants like nano type flocculants which not only improves the efficiency of pollutant removal but also reduces operating costs he et al 2021 secondly upgrading the dosing system can be considered traditional manual dosing mode should be replaced using p rtc automatic dosing system to provide accurate and stable dosing which can save reagents consumption and then reduces operating cost jia et al 2019 3 promoting municipal wastewater management to the direction of circular economy firstly the investment in upgradation of sewage treatment projects should reserve space for the development of resource utilization so as to transform urban wastewater treatment systems from a costly service to a self sustaining and environmentally friendly one zhang and liu 2022 secondly methods of waste control by waste should be adopted to promote circular economy to further raise removal rates of nutrients in sewage the ceramsite prepared with excess sludge and fly ash as well as modified by alkali or lanthanum can be applied to the adsorption of nitrogen and phosphorus in the effluent water next ceramsite containing nitrogen and phosphorus can be used as plant cultivation fertilizer the technology could improve the sustainable level of sewage treatment systems shao et al 2022 to reduce indirect emissions impacts from chemical regents use steel slag from steel industry can be also used for the removal of phosphorus in municipal sewage roychand et al 2020 which can reduce the dependence on external chemicals and thus realize reuse of solid waste to solve the problem of land occupation caused by landfill of excess sludge excess sludge can be comprehensively incinerated with urban domestic waste and the generated bottom slag can be used to make building materials chen et al 2019 which not only saves land resources but also makes profits by selling building materials in addition use of biosolids from sewage treatment plants for energy recovery by a fluidized bed gasification process is a potential way for improving energy mix and other performance indicators of wastewater treatment systems cano londono et al 2017 however the stages of energy transformation turbine and gas cleaning should be optimized to further raise energy efficiency of this technology cano et al 2022 finally treated water reuse should be further promoted to this end the tertiary treatment could be considered so that effluent can be reused for non drinking and industrial purposes awad et al 2019 and this measure can improve environmental performance through reducing residual water pollutants discharged into the water body and the benefits of water conservation are equivalent to the energy savings of producing the same amount of tap water awad et al 2019 zhang et al 2010a however all these measures need to be carefully evaluated from pros and cons so as to overcome their potential negative impacts 6 conclusions and research prospect 6 1 conclusions this study established a set of approach and related indicators to assess holistic performance of sewage treatment systems from environmental and economic aspects and then compared comprehensive performance before and after upgradation of a sewage treatment system using the presented methods and indicators after the upgradation total emergy input increases by 11 96 mainly due to extra thermal electricity power consumption total emissions impact decreases by 39 92 mainly rooting in raised removal rate of tp in the effluent emergy yield rate is slightly improved and environmental load rate descends greatly and thus the sustainability level clearly rises meanwhile environmental emissions significantly affect the environmental load and then the sustainable level this upgradation also improves economic benefit of this enterprise because rising sewage treatment fee slightly exceeds its increased treatment cost comprehensively the upgradation promotes the synergetic relationship between its environmental performance and economic performance by 95 65 based on related findings this study puts forward targeted suggestions for promoting comprehensive performance of sewage treatment systems in the future the presented approach and related indicators can also act as one of decision making tools for optimizing upgradation schemes of other environmental protection facilities 6 2 research prospect on one hand to promote sustainability of this sewage treatment system following issues need further exploration in the future including impacts of different treated water disposal ways on performance of this system discharge or reclaimed water reuse effects of different sludge disposal ways landfilling composting energy recovery using incineration etc and so on on the other hand as far as ecological services provided the local environment are concerned they include physical chemical and biological processes here only the dilution function of atmospheric environment and water body is considered due to the unavailability of other parameters to calculate ecological services derived from chemical and biological processes related

24362,mosquito borne diseases mbd are a major global health concern to aid mbd management efforts the distribution of mosquito species is frequently investigated through species distribution models sdms however the quality these sdms for management use has not been examined we evaluated 127 publications of mosquito sdms published between 1998 and 2020 and assessed each against a set of recently developed best practice standards pertaining to quality of the response variable predictor variables model building and model evaluation aspects mosquito sdms were predominantly trained with presence background response variables 77 of studies bioclimatic predictor variables 39 63 maximum entropy algorithm 54 and evaluated by area under the receiver operating curve 36 or confusion matrix metrics 34 aedes were the best studied genus 70 studies pan african 20 and global 16 distribution studies dominated all published studies had one or more unacceptable standards within considered aspects but no aspect observed unacceptable standards in all publications the highest proportion of unacceptable standards were observed within predictor variables 60 followed by model building 53 model evaluation 34 and response variable 17 response variable and model building demonstrated 8 and 0 2 increases in quality over time but predictor variables and model evaluation exhibited 6 and 2 decreases in quality respectively quality of mosquito sdms has not changed since introduction of best practice standards quality of mosquito sdms can be improved by ensuring known species temperature and precipitation thresholds are represented within the response variable resolution of predictor variables must be justified from ecological knowledge or statistically approximated sdms of mosquitoes

health epidemiology or mbd given the interest and application of sdms to mosquitoes an assessment of constraints and suggested best practices is warranted the general application and limitations of sdms concerning epidemiology have been reviewed johnson et al 2019 escobar 2020 response data represented by vector occurrence is preferred over disease occurrence to minimize spatial uncertainty johnson et al 2019 however lattices often represent vector or disease responses lattice responses detail a landscape that has been divided into equal i e utm grid or unequal sized subunits i e geopolitical region saveliev et al 2007 interpreting ecological characteristics within a lattice may bias results by failing to sufficiently represent the species environment response moudrý et al 2019 cheng et al 2021 a species natural dispersal range provides an approximate scale of the species environment responses jackson and fahrig 2015 verdonschot and besse lotoskaya 2014 reviewed mosquito flight literature they found that 91 mosquito species demonstrated average flight ranges of less than 2 km except for three culiseta species and culex annulirostris which could fly 4 5 and 6 2 km respectively verdonschot and besse lotoskaya 2014 predictor resolution must match the size of each corresponding lattice cell to limit spatial uncertainty vergara et al 2016 yet accounting for the lattices risks additional statistical bias to the model openshaw 1981 unless it reflects ecologically important ecological zones or the interested level of effect e g garcía carrasco et al 2021 for example johnson et al 2017 applied contiguous united states county latticed responses and environmental averages to predict county level suitability of a aegypti and a albopictus distributions though counties in the united states are vastly more extensive than the natural dispersal range of mosquitoes the occurrences were appropriately considered within the objective and sdm methodology further use of lattice scales allowed johnson et al 2017 to assess the dispersal capacity of a aegypti and a albopictus populations as opposed to individuals in contrast miller et al 2012 estimated the distribution of japanese encephalitis in asia given administrative district culex tritaeniorhynchus occurrences with 1 km2 resolution predictors their selected resolution more closely reflected the expected species environment response but the resulting sdms did not account for the spatial accuracy of each occurrence consequently the interpreted species environmental response was calibrated from inaccurate values limiting model reliability the results and the application although mosquito response variables have been investigated consideration of other sdm aspects of predictor variables model building and model evaluation are limited these aspects have not been examined or reviewed for mosquito sdms instead methodology decisions rely on more general sdm reviews e g elith et al 2006 recently araújo et al 2019 and sofaer et al 2019 proposed assessment frameworks of sdms applicability and utility respectively both focused on sdm aspects of response variable predictor variables model building and model evaluation procedures to guide higher quality sdms and corresponding applications however araújo et al 2019 provided a more in depth assessment framework which evaluated sdms concerning their objective and use s explanation prediction or projection the standards by araújo et al 2019 reflect 15 issues across the four sdm aspects per use each issue and use was scored regarding quality gold silver bronze or deficient araújo et al 2019 applied these standards to assess 400 sdm publications between 1995 and 2015 and reported that most aspects of sdms had improved over time arthropods including mosquitoes accounted for approximately 5 of studied cases araújo et al 2019 assessing published mosquito sdms against these standards allows for an examination of their adherence to these quality standards it is important to note that an sdm s validity is evaluated for its designed purpose and is not universally valid or invalid araújo et al 2019 here we investigate mosquito sdm quality based on the four sdm aspects identified by araújo et al 2019 from our literature review we sought to i determine the uses of sdms applied to mosquitoes ii assess areas of mbd concern iii assess mosquito sdms against the four aspects outlined by araújo et al s 2019 standards iv assess mosquito sdm quality over time and v propose recommendations for best practice we do not intend to reiterate caveats and guidelines standards across sdm literature but focus on those specific to mosquito applications we compare our results to araújo et al 2019 to identify which issues are particularly problematic to mosquito sdms 2 methods 2 1 literature review we searched the literature to identify sdm publications applied to mosquito species published between 1995 and 2020 specifically we queried web of science apps webofknowledge com scopus www elsevier com solutions scopus pubmed www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed and scientific electronic library online www scielo org with the search terms species distribut or habitat distribut or climat envelope or bioclimat or habitat suitab or niche or resource selection or sdm or enm or bem or bcm or hsm or rsf and model and vector or disease last accessed may 16 2021 this search returned 4 441 unique publications we refined the initial publications to focus on only those that applied or investigated sdms of mosquitoes and omitted mechanistic models or application of mbd rather than species occurrence resulting in 127 retained publications 2 2 assessment of sdm standards we reviewed the selected publications according to the best practice standards for models in biodiversity assessments araújo et al 2019 we provide a summary of the standards below though full details are found in araújo et al 2019 the standards consist of four quality levels gold silver bronze and deficient gold represents aspirational methods that usually require ideal data and next generation modeling approaches which are seldom available and remain under development respectively silver corresponds to cutting edge techniques typically involving imperfect but best available data bronze standards represent the minimum acceptable practices for sdms finally deficient standards indicate unacceptable practices to drive policy and practice araújo et al 2019 sdms may be applied to investigate a wide range of ecological situations aguirre gutiérrez et al 2013 sillero et al 2021 we reviewed and evaluated sdms to determine their use and objectives for example prediction of disease prevalence to aid public health initiatives dicko et al 2014 determining areas suitable for species conservation regos et al 2021 or analyzing invasive species niche conservation medley 2010 therefore we assessed sdm quality for the general uses of explanation prediction and projection for consistency and simplicity standards scoring reflected three to five issues per sdm aspect response variable predictor variables model building and model evaluation table 1 response variable quality was strongly related to human effort specifically sampling effort the sampling effort reflected the depth of survey design to encompass all locations and environmental conditions within the taxon range identification of taxon and quantification of spatial accuracy of resulting occurrence records for the study objective araújo et al 2019 inaccuracies or bias within any part of the sampling effort can potentially limit sdm ability anderson 2012 though primary field surveys provide more reliable and accurate occurrence records many rely on records from heterogeneous sources such as occurrence repositories i e global biodiversity information facility www gbif org response variable quality also considered the depth that studies cleaned heterogeneous data to remove records within justified unreasonable locations conditions positional accuracy and taxonomic identification araújo et al 2019 we characterized the spatial accuracy of responses as assumed or known to represent a precise location i e latitude and longitude from field survey latticed points or a combination thereof the quality of predictor variables corresponded to the depth that the predictors were identified acquired prepared and selected related to study objectives and species biology we assessed the evidence or justification for predictor selection and preparation concerning biological response and spatial and temporal resolution of the response variable araújo et al 2019 ideally predictors represent conditions that the response variable is dependent at a relevant spatial and temporal resolution with any uncertainty i e measurement error quantifiable in the final sdm further sdms are applied to determine which predictor limit a species distribution often referred to as variable importance bardie and leung 2017 if sdms identified variables of importance also referred to as high contributing or demonstrated a significant effect we recorded the corresponding variables identified as important per species as variable importance estimates vary by algorithm and assessment method smith and santos 2020 harisena et al 2021 whether a variable was considered important or not was based on the original authors interpretation given the various predictors applied we grouped similar and less common predictors when considering overall importance for example temperature may be represented by minimum maximum mean or median air or land surface temperature per month s if less than three publications applied a specific predictor it was considered an other predictor i e other temperature model building quality represents the degree of sdm techniques that addressed issues of model complexity bias noise collinearity and uncertainty with respect to the study s objective araújo et al 2019 proper model building consisted of evaluating sequences of all choices including algorithm hyper parameters and the number of predictors to prevent overfitting and adjust for characteristics of response data comparison of all sequences allows for quantification and mapping uncertainty among model building choices failure to properly account for bias noise or collinearity can cause erroneous results dormann et al 2013 bailey et al 2014 model evaluation was related to the quality of the methodology used to assess the realism accuracy and generality of model outputs per model use for an objective araújo et al 2019 sdms are expected to approximate ecological reality and should be evaluated against data representative of the response variable s spatial temporal and environmental distributions model evaluation assessment included considering the depth to which authors assessed theoretical and statistical assumptions of sdms the selection of evaluation data and the meaningful evaluation metrics used ideally sdms were evaluated against multiple lines of evidence with no assumptions violated araújo et al 2019 unreliable or inflated results are possible if sdms violate assumptions or are evaluated against biased data guisan and zimmermann 2000 hijmans 2012 reproducibility remains an issue across science baker 2006 the lack of transparent methodology within sdm publications may have inhibited quality assessments to address this we evaluated the reproducibility of mosquito sdms according to feng et al 2021 to complement the quality assessment feng et al 2019 outlined a checklist of the minimum information essential for sdm reproducibility this checklist reflects the framework of araújo et al 2019 with nine four seven and 12 necessary information related to the response variable predictor variables model building and model evaluation respectively feng et al 2019 sdms were assigned a binary score if the reproducible element was provided or not full details on the checklist are available in feng et al 2019 2 3 analysis we assessed the geographic areas investigated per mosquito genus to determine regions of mbd concern to do this we considered the country or countries in which each publication applied an sdm we presented genera at the continent level excluding global applications total publications per country were mapped in arcgis 10 8 1 environmental systems research institute esri 2018 we evaluated sdm quality scores concerning 50 and 90 quantile scores per issue the 50 and 90 quantiles represent the 50 and 90 levels on an ascending list of quality respectively we quantified overall performance per aspect table 1 by the area inside the line measure a metric that reaches 100 if all standard issues reach gold for all studies at or above the given quantile araújo et al 2019 area inside the line was determined for each quantile line per aspect within a polar coordinate system such that area increased with higher quality scores fig 3 we fitted an ordinal regression with a bayesian approach to determine the change in mosquito sdm quality over time rstanarm package in r v4 1 1 goodrich et al 2020 r core team 2021 we calibrated the ordinal regression with a warm up of 1000 iterations followed by four chains with 5000 iterations sampled with an assumed prior distribution between 1000 and 1000 regression models were fitted against an interaction of year and aspect additionally a similar model fitted with an interaction of year and issue was determined table 1 we interpreted the estimates obtained by this analysis as the change in the quality over time we determined the presence of temporal trends since the establishment of araújo et al s 2019 standards by comparing quality up to and including 2019 before 114 publications to 2020 onwards after 13 publications we evaluated the independence of scores before and after the release of standards by fisher s exact test of independence on the expected proportion of each score per issue published before or after sdm standards table 2 expected proportions reflect the average count of each score across all 15 issues per period 3 results 3 1 literature review a total of 116 species from aedes anopheles culex ochlerotatus culiseta haemagogus and psorophora genera were investigated using sdms species of most interest included a aegypti a albopictus culex pipiens anopheles gambie and anopheles aradiensis were investigated by 44 36 19 15 and 14 publications respectively supplementary material 1 table s1 prediction and explanation were the most common uses of sdms 40 of cases followed by prediction only 27 fig 1 a seventy four percent of studies used presence background as the response variable while a further 4 17 and 6 utilized presence only presence absence or species abundance data respectively assumed precise locations provided the response variable for 61 of cases while latticed or a combination of occurrence types were used by 15 and 17 respectively fig 1b the response variable was represented by primary field collections for 39 of publications while 61 relied on information from the literature occurrence repositories or multiple sources bioclimatic variables supplementary material 1 table s2 were the most applied predictors 39 63 followed by elevation 59 and urban land cover 35 fig 1c slope elevation and agricultural land were the most important predictors in 53 or more of sdms though findings varied by mosquito species and genus supplementary material 2 most sdms 56 were fit with predictors at a 1 km2 or finer resolution followed by 35 with scales between 10 and 1000 km2 supplementary material 1 fig s1 the selected studies examined mosquito distributions with 23 sdm fig 1d maximum entropy maxent was most popular with 68 publications while generalized linear models genetic algorithm for rule set production and generalized boosting methods were next and applied by 18 15 and 11 studies respectively under ten publications applied the remaining 19 algorithms with 12 algorithms used by a single publication each fig 1d model complexity was addressed within 40 of studies particularly when maxent 50 of cases or ensemble 55 were considered previous studies evaluated sdms using various metrics though 10 of publications did not provide any evaluation fig 1e area under the receiver operating curve and subsampling of training data were applied by 60 and 73 to evaluate sdms subsampled data relied on confusion matrix metrics i e sensitivity specificity for 34 of all studies random hold out methods i e random split cross validation independent re substitution and geographically structured data were reported by 79 8 2 and 1 of studies respectively fig 1e 3 2 regions of sdm application mosquito sdm literature focused on african 20 collectively global 16 the contiguous united states 12 italy 8 and china 7 forecasts within africa kenya 12 and tanzania 10 were the most covered countries fig 2 a the genera investigated varied by continent aedes spp were studied extensively in the americas europe and globally while anopheles spp models were confined mainly to african and asian studies oceania had equal representation of aedes and anopheles spp investigations fig 2a sdms investigating aedes spp have increased rapidly in recent years while those addressing anopheles and culex spp remained relatively constant over time supplementary material 1 fig s2 3 3 assessment of sdm standards all 127 publications observed at least one deficient standard i e unacceptable practice within a single aspect but no aspect consistently implemented deficient practices in all publications accordingly sdms predominantly demonstrated deficient 38 of assessments or bronze 47 practices only 12 and 3 of sdms applied silver and gold practices respectively response variable model building and predictor variables observed higher proportions of silver or gold practices table 1 specifically 26 of sdms applied gold standard spatial accuracy of the response variable while sampling taxonomic identification and geographic extent of the response variable considerations were 22 13 and 44 silver quality respectively within model building examination of model complexity demonstrated silver quality by 21 of sdms and treatment of bias and noise by 21 the selection of predictor variables improved to silver and gold for 12 and 2 of all sdms respectively issues related to model evaluation observed silver or gold quality in less than 8 of sdms overall performance as defined by the area inside the curve see methods revealed that response variables demonstrated the highest quality with 16 and 52 of possible scores achieved by 50 and 90 quantiles respectively fig 3 both predictor selection and model building were poor overall for 50 quantiles with only 4 area inside the curve yet at the 90 quantile predictor selection and model building increased to 19 and 29 respectively model evaluation remained relatively similar between 50 and 90 quantiles with overall scores of 8 and 12 respectively fig 3 when examining temporal quality change via ordinal regression we observed predominantly yearly quality deterioration fig 4 notably procedures of predictor variables indicated a 6 yearly decrease in quality and 2 within model evaluation nevertheless model evaluation indicated higher uncertainty within the 95 confidence interval in contrast response variables procedures indicated an 8 yearly quality improvement model building showed a low tendency for improvement 0 2 with high uncertainty general trends of sdm aspects were inconsistent across issues except within predictor variables fig 4 temporal trends of predictor variables issues were consistently deteriorative but suggested improvement within the 95 confidence interval the remaining sdm aspects indicated a near 50 split between yearly improvement and deterioration among issues response variable sampling and consideration of environmental and geographic extents improved yearly but taxa identification and spatial accuracy decreased model building procedures related to collinearly model and parameter uncertainty enhanced over time however addressing model complexity bias and noise deteriorated lastly evaluation of model assumptions indicated a yearly increase in quality but evaluation of model outputs and performance decreased fig 4 all issues revealed wide intervals overlapping zero indicating high uncertainty yet the quality of mosquito sdms was independent of the publication of the standards p 0 88 table 2 3 4 reproducibility mosquito sdms consistently reported the algorithm and source of the response variable 98 of studies each modeling domain 97 source of predictor variables 96 resolution of predictor variables 91 and temporal range of predictor variables applied for projection 85 fig 5 elements with the least consistent reporting included download date or version of predictor variables used for projection 3 methods to account for spatial autocorrelation 10 sampling bias 15 spatial environmental outliers 17 in response variables the threshold of evaluation index 23 and spatial resolution of predictor variables used for projection 23 overall no paper provided all or no reproducible methods sdms of mosquitoes tended only to report 15 of 33 reproducible elements 45 13 mean standard deviation supplementary material 1 fig s7 reporting of reproducibility was particularly limited within elements of the response variable and model evaluation 39 and 35 respectively predictor variables and model building indicated higher reproducibility with 66 and 60 of elements reported on average respectively 4 discussion given the global importance of mbds it is essential to develop quality sdms to aid mosquito and disease management most sdms surveyed here demonstrated unacceptable or minimally acceptable practices with aspirational or current best practices applied by 12 of studies compared to araujo et al s 2019 assessment of sdms covering all taxa we found that mosquito sdms applied lower quality response variable predictor variables and model evaluation but better model building considerations supplementary material 1 table s4 we focus on detailing how mosquito sdms can enhance their quality in the sdm aspects of decreased quality above and highlight how mosquito sdms achieved higher levels of model building quality relative to araújo et al 2019 4 1 response variable mosquito sdms indicated a lower quality of environmental extent consideration among the top 90 of sdms compared to araújo et al 2019 we observed that 84 of mosquito sdms were applied to specific regions potentially limiting the environmental extent and causing excess generalization studies failed to provide evidence of species environmental tolerance within these areas instead studies calibrated sdms with the best available mosquito occurrences for the study region e g dickens et al 2018 a select few sdms addressed environmental extent by removing records in unreasonable environmental conditions e g gomes et al 2016 or provided a single line of evidence indicating occurrences occur across all major environments within study area e g fossog et al 2015 future studies should design sampling efforts to include all regions within the species environmental tolerances however this is not necessarily feasible owing to accessibility i e private property and large geographic extents required alternatively gogol prokurat 2011 demonstrated that expanding the environmental extent by considering more predictors to train sdms of rare plant species improved habitat suitability predictions and field applications calibrating sdms to a greater environmental extent improves model fit thuiller et al 2004 additional predictor variables should include a variety of environmental and biotic predictors relevant to the species geographic extent and objective broennimann and guisan 2008 early and fox 2014 failure to properly account for environmental extent inhibits sdm applicability for the intended use inhibited sdm applicability may cause truncation of response curves and misidentification of important predictors when explaining a distribution as well as biasing predictions projections leading to unfounded conclusions and management implications particularly when projecting into new geographic or temporal ranges synes and osborne 2011 harisena et al 2021 many mosquito species are considered invasive and demonstrate rapid evolution i e a albopictus egizi et al 2015 accordingly considering the native or invaded distribution alone may not represent the entire niche medley 2010 specifically temperature is a fundamental driver of mbd and mosquito life cycle followed by precipitation or water availability depending on species wegbreit and reisen 2000 shragai et al 2017 mordecai et al 2019 franklinos et al 2019 therefore as a minimum temperature thresholds must be satisfied within the environmental extent and followed by precipitation when spatially and temporally explicit records are unavailable to demonstrate total environmental tolerance as described by physiological studies of a single predictor the corresponding predictor should not be applied in model building and the effects discussed thuiller et al 2004 those wishing to investigate mosquito distributions are encouraged to consider multiple lines of evidence to infer environmental extent such as historical and current distributions for example metcalf et al 2014 combined responses from spatial temporal fossil data ancient dna and palaeoclimatological reconstructions for the american bison bison bison to determine the entire environmental extent mosquito response variables are available from literature and museum records as early as 1947 to account for the historical environmental extents of some species peach and matthews 2020 alternatively sdms considered over large geographic areas or more predictor variables may capture the environmental extent without including additional records nevertheless future studies must provide evidence of environmental tolerance from global historical ranges or physiological studies kearney et al 2009 varela et al 2009 barbet massin et al 2010 4 2 predictor variables overall performance of predictor variables applied to mosquitoes indicated the most significant deficiency compared to all taxa assessments araújo et al 2019 though the selection of predictor variables and uncertainty quality were consistent with that identified by araújo et al 2019 resolution demonstrated lower quality within both quantiles predictors spatial and temporal resolution must reflect that of the response variable to determine accurate species environment relationships thuiller et al 2004 barbet massin et al 2010 the spatial resolution was theoretically justified given response variable sampling design e g tran et al 2013 or by a known or estimated spatial error in the response variable e g johnson et al 2017 though more often predictor resolution depended on the resolutions available for selected predictors for example we observed a considerable reliance on pre calculated bioclimatic variables at 1 km2 resolution without justification supplementary material 1 fig s1 if possible future applications should estimate an appropriate spatial resolution relative to the ecological biogeographical knowledge and study objective the resolution at which a species interacts with any potential predictor is mainly unknown and limited by the spatial accuracy of the response variable hirzel et al 2001 de knegt et al 2010 previous authors have suggested estimating the resolution through dispersal home or perceptual range body size or reproduction period tyre et al 2001 mech and zollner 2002 jackson and fahrig 2015 on the other hand one can statistically approximate the appropriate resolution with sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis involves determining the resolution which observes a high correlation with the response variable therefore approximating the resolution at which a species responses to the predictor e g lechner et al 2012 additionally species interact with the environment at different levels such that relationships identified at one resolution are not necessarily observable at others lechner et al 2012 therefore species environment relationships must be measured at the appropriate resolution per predictor which requires the consideration of multi resolution sdms levin 1992 previous work has highlighted multi resolutions enhance understanding of the species environmental relationship and provided guidelines václavík et al 2012 researchers may consider multi resolution sdms to allow species environment responses to be evaluated at an appropriate resolution if sufficient response variable accuracy exists the consideration of lattice responses further complicated predictor resolution lattices are assumed to represent the characteristics of the environment across the geographic ranges they represent saveliev et al 2007 accordingly lattices allow for powerful investigations of species distributions if in line with the modeling objective openshaw 1981 however sdms must be calibrated with predictors that reflect the size of the lattice otherwise the interpreted values misrepresent the environmental conditions moudrý et al 2019 lattices with equal sized grids are more reliable for interpretation than unequal sized grids i e administrative regions saveliev et al 2007 unequal or irregular lattices increase statistical bias where environmental correlations can vary from positive to negative depending on the aggregation scale potentially rendering the results inapplicable cheng et al 2021 applying lattice response and predictor variables to mosquitoes requires caution and should be used if in line with the objective and predictors are aggregated to lattice size one may integrate more accurate occurrence sets to limit potential statistical bias pacifici et al 2019 provided a framework for incorporating misaligned occurrences sets at varying spatial accuracy many states have widely available mosquito occurrence records within the contiguous united states but others are latticed to county centroids therefore considering all available data one can create separate sdms for each response variable set accuracy with appropriate resolution predictors and ensemble appropriately predictor resolution should support the study objective many studies sought to aid fine scale targeted species management initiatives therefore appropriately applied a 1 km2 resolution or finer resolution landau and van leeuwen 2012 attaway et al 2014 however considering coarser resolutions is appropriate to approximate the probability of occurrence across a large geographic extent kraemer et al 2015 or across a lattice to explore a specific phenomenon or explore the administrative level probability of occurrence johnson et al 2017 garcía carrasco et al 2021 projection of habitat suitability into the past or future is greatly limited by available resolution koch et al 2016 therefore a coarse resolution may be applied and interpreted accordingly here most studies focused on determining the fine scale habitat suitability or probability of vector occurrence therefore most studies required fine resolutions to satisfy the species biology and objectives though many authors did apply a 1 km2 resolution this is not true of all sdm applications supplementary material 1 fig s1 therefore future efforts require greater attention to predictor resolution with justification for predictor resolution similarly the temporal resolution must reflect the time of the response variable and objective the reliance on pre calculated bioclimatic variables limited the temporal resolution to 1970 2000 fick and hijmans 2017 though many authors considered responses and objectives outside this period e g hesami et al 2019 a mismatch between or within response objective and predictor temporal resolutions results in mis specified environmental conditions and biased results fernandez et al 2017 when the temporal resolution of the response variable is known predictor temporal resolution should reflect it exactly e g arboleda et al 2012 or with the next closest applicable temporal period of effect available e g alaniz et al 2017 future studies may consider lagged temporal predictors when there is a lag effect between the predictor and response by the impact it triggers in the ecosystem including carry on effects exhibited by different mosquito species lebl et al 2013 roux et al 2015 giraud et al 2022 though lag predictors have not been evaluated in mosquito sdms evans et al 2022 reviewed sdms of euphausiids and indicated considering lag nutrient and chlorophyll levels large scale climate events i e el niño wind and up welling improved a proportion of model accuracies future studies should calculate temporally correct predictors from raw values and test lag values when available notably worldclim provides raw historical monthly climatic data from 1960 to 2018 such that the corresponding bioclimatic variables can be calculated for the appropriate time by open source functions to better match responses and objectives fick and hijmans 2017 4 3 model building mosquito sdms demonstrated higher overall performance within model building than araújo et al 2019 though not consistently across issues the higher quality observed can be attributed to the 90 quantile in model complexity and treatment of bias and noise in the response variable possible explanations for this include more recent publications and smaller sample size allowing for improved model building considerations to be more prevalent regardless mosquito sdms provide modern examples of addressing and accounting for complexity and bias model complexity is related to the number of predictors applied and fine tuning of hyper parameters merow et al 2014 the number of predictors used was considered by assessing collinearity and removing low importance predictors through iterative selection e g johnson et al 2017 this process allows inclusion only of predictors that exhibit a robust statistical relationship with the response variable dormann et al 2013 however considering all correlated factors allows for biased or erroneous estimates i e inflated or obscured to be identified aragón et al 2010 real et al 2013 iterative removal of lowest important predictor helps to piece out biased or erroneous estimates zeng et al 2016 likewise mosquito sdms fine tuned hyperparameters characteristics for each response variable by manual or automated comparisons within specialized r packages muscarella et al 2014 cobos et al 2019 or stepwise akaike information criteria for example the rising popularity of maxent has coincided with the increased availability of software to automatically test a range of hyperparameters such as included feature classes and regularization multiplier to determine the best fit against resubstituted or random hold out of training data addressing model complexity in these ways decreases the probability that a model will overfit providing more valuable predictions and projections araújo and pearson 2005 we noted that mosquito sdms were highly dependent on heterogeneous secondary response variables from one or more repositories these repositories often represented a combination of literature records citizen science and organized surveys kraemer et al 2015 reliance on such heterogeneous sources limits the quality of the response variable and introduces potential bias syfert et al 2013 however heterogeneous sources can reduce sampling bias if sampling is diverse and widespread sardà palomera et al 2012 the appropriate method to account for bias in the response variable will depend on the bias present but is often related to sampling geographic or environmental bias inman et al 2021 accordingly mosquito sdms demonstrated a wide range of methods to treat bias and noise including mahalanobis distance e g ducheyne et al 2018 spatial thinning e g drake and beier 2014 target group sampling e g wiebe et al 2017 and bias layers e g sallam et al 2016 also though not all publications addressed bias and noise it was acknowledged and described by over half of the studied publications model complexity and treatment of bias can continue to improve by quantitative assessments from multiple lines of independent validation to indicate reliability methods araújo et al 2019 4 4 model evaluation model evaluation of mosquito sdms reflected those described for all taxa by araújo et al 2019 except mosquito sdms indicated a lower 90 quantile of model outputs mosquito sdms relied heavily on random hold out evaluations over independent and re substitution methods splitting the response variable into training and testing provides an improved assessment of an sdm s fit and predictive ability over re substitution but limited assessment compared to independent data peterson et al 2007 bahn and mcgill 2013 for example wenger and olden 2012 observed that sdms of brook trout salvelinus fontinalis and brown trout salmo trutta had excellent performance when evaluated with random hold out methods but poorly predicted independent data in new locations and climates independent data can come from an independent systematic survey in a different space or time from training data martínez meyer et al 2004 peterson et al 2007 mosquito sdms applied independent evaluation from updated field surveys from public health or targeted efforts e g tran et al 2013 ibanez justicia and cianci 2015 many workers describe the lack of independent data for evaluation when an independent evaluation is available it may be inflated owing to spatial autocorrelation and bias hijmans 2012 specifically training and testing datasets may fall within close geographic range to one another thus being non independent and inflating evaluation peterson and soberón 2012 instead mosquito sdms should focus on geographically independent datasets for an unbiased evaluation standard practices for geographic structured evaluation data within mosquito sdms included division by political boundaries e g levine et al 2004 latitude longitude or quadrants e g arboleda et al 2012 unfortunately these methods do not directly account for spatial autocorrelation or bias instead one can divide training data into one or more geographically structured datasets to account for spatial autocorrelation capinha et al 2014 estimated the global range of a aegypti and created training and testing sets by accounting for spatial autocorrelation through alpha shapes other methods to account for spatial autocorrelation include removing spatial bias by pairwise distance sampling hijmans 2012 automated spatial block cross validation valavi et al 2019 or spatial leave one out method le rest et al 2014 the appropriate approach to create geographically structured training and testing sets will depend on the study objective extent and response variable 4 5 temporal trends interest in anopheles and culex spp remained relatively constant over time while that of aedes spp increased given the rapid global spread and importance of select aedes spp paired with the introduction or resurgence of associated mbd increased interest in aedes spp distribution is not unexpected lessler et al 2016 leta et al 2018 likewise while anopheles and culex spp have a much lower degree of global spread distribution was assessed within the proximity of endemic areas gangoso et al 2020 liu et al 2020 as such interest in aedes spp is expected to increase in future years despite mosquito sdm improvements in some issues compared to all of the taxa studied by araújo et al 2019 overall temporal patterns indicated predominantly divergent behavior across issues the lack of consistent change suggests that most modern mosquito sdms have not improved on previous models despite simultaneous sdm research to improve applications over the years instead publications applied the same techniques to new occurrence records or under different conditions further since the development of sdm standards sdm quality has not changed this suggests not enough time has passed for the standards to be acknowledged and implemented within mosquito distribution forecasting the same may not be accurate for all taxonomic groups yet these findings must be interpreted with caution as we observed unequal sdm application across years with no publications in 1999 2000 and 2003 and only a single year of publications to represent after standard quality response variable and predictor variables observed more consistent increases and decreases in temporal quality change respectively these observed patterns were also detailed by araújo et al 2019 but mosquito only sdms demonstrated more robust trends generally response quality has increased owing to increased biodiversity efforts that allow for occurrence repositories with increased detail soberón and peterson 2004 mosquito reporting and surveys are increasing globally to manage mbd through both standardized active and non standardized passive surveys kampen et al 2015 kovach and smith 2018 chen et al 2020 additionally increased criticism and technology protocols exist to improve survey efforts baldacchino et al 2015 parihar et al 2020 dormont et al 2021 conversely predictors indicated increasingly haphazard selection limited to bioclimatic variables with little to no justification for selecting predictors resolution or consideration of uncertainty high resolution environmental data is increasingly available via remote sensing efforts but is rarely applied to sdms pinto ledezma and cavender bares 2021 as environmental and other predictors become more accessible more consideration of predictor variables is required for mosquito sdms authors and reviewers are encouraged to review best practices in sdms to focus on enhancing their applicability to all sdm aspects and issues finally it is essential to acknowledge that the applied standards reflect a relative consensus of expert advice and that scientific standards can be challenged and altered accordingly other standards for all sdms applications sofaer et al 2019 reporting feng et al 2019 zurell et al 2020 and guides sillero et al 2021 have emerged as more research on sdms and mosquito distributions is conducted the strengths and weaknesses of sdm methods may change araújo et al 2019 we acknowledge that accomplishing gold or silver standards may not be possible in all scenarios due to logistical challenges such as data limitations the considered assessments here were limited by missing reproducible elements across considered literature fig 5 we recommend that future studies follow reproducibility checklists feng et al 2019 zurell et al 2020 further the evaluation criteria proposed by araújo et al 2019 may be too stringent to meet modern sdm practices evaluation against different standards i e sofaer et al 2019 may provide a different interpretation as such an sdm is not universally valid or invalid but must be evaluated on whether the model is valid for its designed purposes the recommendations we outline here provide guidelines for mosquito sdm quality improvement variation and biases of standard quality interpretation between observers are natural here we assessed sdm quality by a single individual so uncertainty between assessors could not be quantified or examined future

24362,mosquito borne diseases mbd are a major global health concern to aid mbd management efforts the distribution of mosquito species is frequently investigated through species distribution models sdms however the quality these sdms for management use has not been examined we evaluated 127 publications of mosquito sdms published between 1998 and 2020 and assessed each against a set of recently developed best practice standards pertaining to quality of the response variable predictor variables model building and model evaluation aspects mosquito sdms were predominantly trained with presence background response variables 77 of studies bioclimatic predictor variables 39 63 maximum entropy algorithm 54 and evaluated by area under the receiver operating curve 36 or confusion matrix metrics 34 aedes were the best studied genus 70 studies pan african 20 and global 16 distribution studies dominated all published studies had one or more unacceptable standards within considered aspects but no aspect observed unacceptable standards in all publications the highest proportion of unacceptable standards were observed within predictor variables 60 followed by model building 53 model evaluation 34 and response variable 17 response variable and model building demonstrated 8 and 0 2 increases in quality over time but predictor variables and model evaluation exhibited 6 and 2 decreases in quality respectively quality of mosquito sdms has not changed since introduction of best practice standards quality of mosquito sdms can be improved by ensuring known species temperature and precipitation thresholds are represented within the response variable resolution of predictor variables must be justified from ecological knowledge or statistically approximated sdms of mosquitoes require improved evaluation against independent data or creation of geographically structured data we encourage future mosquito sdm applications to utilize the most recent sdm standards and recommendations to improve applicability keywords culicidae ecological niche modelling environmental extent evaluation of model output mosquito borne disease resolution species distribution modelling abbreviations mbd mosquito borne diseases sdm species distribution model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction transmission of diseases by mosquitoes is of global health importance mosquito borne diseases mbd cause over one million deaths and suffering for hundreds of millions more people annually caraballo and king 2014 mbds include dengue zika yellow fever and chikungunya vectored by aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus malaria vectored by anopheles spp and japanese encephalitis and west nile fever by culex spp calvo et al 2016 yang et al 2018 estimates suggest that half of the world s population will be at risk of mbd by 2050 kraemer et al 2019 reducing the public health burden of mbd mainly focuses on understanding and determining areas vulnerable to mosquito colonization jones et al 2021 species distribution models sdms also known as ecological niche models have been widely implemented to anticipate disease introduction and spread escobar 2020 sdms relate the presence absence or abundance of a species or disease with environmental conditions to generate hypotheses about a species potential distribution thereby improving traditional disease risk maps escobar and craft 2016 despite their popularity sdms have been criticized owing to their assumptions sensitivity to input data and methodology choices araújo and peterson 2012 sofaer et al 2019 these sensitivities relate to the response variable selected predictor variables used model building or model evaluation considerations jarnevich et al 2015 araújo et al 2019 the response variable is the primary building block of sdms defining the geographic environmental and temporal conditions in which species are presumed present or absent i e occurrence records guisan and zimmermann 2000 predictor variables considered in sdms dictate the species environment relationships considered to explain predict or project a species distribution model building details fitting a statistical relationship between the response variable and predictor variables model evaluation details the criteria for assessing sdm realism accuracy and generality for example response variables are often limited to publicly accessible areas introducing sampling bias champan et al 2019 jarnevich et al 2015 bystriakova et al 2012 calibrated sdms for five fern species with and without accounting for sampling bias sdms that did not account for sampling bias poorly estimated species occurrence with broader environmental niches bystriakova et al 2012 previous authors sought to address these concerns by providing a step by step guide sillero et al 2021 reproducibility methodology checklists feng et al 2019 zurell et al 2020 and assessment frameworks araújo et al 2019 sofaer et al 2019 for sdms recently there has been an increase in deterring limitations of specific sdm applications e g silva et al 2019 however current research has not identified sdm limitations on public health epidemiology or mbd given the interest and application of sdms to mosquitoes an assessment of constraints and suggested best practices is warranted the general application and limitations of sdms concerning epidemiology have been reviewed johnson et al 2019 escobar 2020 response data represented by vector occurrence is preferred over disease occurrence to minimize spatial uncertainty johnson et al 2019 however lattices often represent vector or disease responses lattice responses detail a landscape that has been divided into equal i e utm grid or unequal sized subunits i e geopolitical region saveliev et al 2007 interpreting ecological characteristics within a lattice may bias results by failing to sufficiently represent the species environment response moudrý et al 2019 cheng et al 2021 a species natural dispersal range provides an approximate scale of the species environment responses jackson and fahrig 2015 verdonschot and besse lotoskaya 2014 reviewed mosquito flight literature they found that 91 mosquito species demonstrated average flight ranges of less than 2 km except for three culiseta species and culex annulirostris which could fly 4 5 and 6 2 km respectively verdonschot and besse lotoskaya 2014 predictor resolution must match the size of each corresponding lattice cell to limit spatial uncertainty vergara et al 2016 yet accounting for the lattices risks additional statistical bias to the model openshaw 1981 unless it reflects ecologically important ecological zones or the interested level of effect e g garcía carrasco et al 2021 for example johnson et al 2017 applied contiguous united states county latticed responses and environmental averages to predict county level suitability of a aegypti and a albopictus distributions though counties in the united states are vastly more extensive than the natural dispersal range of mosquitoes the occurrences were appropriately considered within the objective and sdm methodology further use of lattice scales allowed johnson et al 2017 to assess the dispersal capacity of a aegypti and a albopictus populations as opposed to individuals in contrast miller et al 2012 estimated the distribution of japanese encephalitis in asia given administrative district culex tritaeniorhynchus occurrences with 1 km2 resolution predictors their selected resolution more closely reflected the expected species environment response but the resulting sdms did not account for the spatial accuracy of each occurrence consequently the interpreted species environmental response was calibrated from inaccurate values limiting model reliability the results and the application although mosquito response variables have been investigated consideration of other sdm aspects of predictor variables model building and model evaluation are limited these aspects have not been examined or reviewed for mosquito sdms instead methodology decisions rely on more general sdm reviews e g elith et al 2006 recently araújo et al 2019 and sofaer et al 2019 proposed assessment frameworks of sdms applicability and utility respectively both focused on sdm aspects of response variable predictor variables model building and model evaluation procedures to guide higher quality sdms and corresponding applications however araújo et al 2019 provided a more in depth assessment framework which evaluated sdms concerning their objective and use s explanation prediction or projection the standards by araújo et al 2019 reflect 15 issues across the four sdm aspects per use each issue and use was scored regarding quality gold silver bronze or deficient araújo et al 2019 applied these standards to assess 400 sdm publications between 1995 and 2015 and reported that most aspects of sdms had improved over time arthropods including mosquitoes accounted for approximately 5 of studied cases araújo et al 2019 assessing published mosquito sdms against these standards allows for an examination of their adherence to these quality standards it is important to note that an sdm s validity is evaluated for its designed purpose and is not universally valid or invalid araújo et al 2019 here we investigate mosquito sdm quality based on the four sdm aspects identified by araújo et al 2019 from our literature review we sought to i determine the uses of sdms applied to mosquitoes ii assess areas of mbd concern iii assess mosquito sdms against the four aspects outlined by araújo et al s 2019 standards iv assess mosquito sdm quality over time and v propose recommendations for best practice we do not intend to reiterate caveats and guidelines standards across sdm literature but focus on those specific to mosquito applications we compare our results to araújo et al 2019 to identify which issues are particularly problematic to mosquito sdms 2 methods 2 1 literature review we searched the literature to identify sdm publications applied to mosquito species published between 1995 and 2020 specifically we queried web of science apps webofknowledge com scopus www elsevier com solutions scopus pubmed www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed and scientific electronic library online www scielo org with the search terms species distribut or habitat distribut or climat envelope or bioclimat or habitat suitab or niche or resource selection or sdm or enm or bem or bcm or hsm or rsf and model and vector or disease last accessed may 16 2021 this search returned 4 441 unique publications we refined the initial publications to focus on only those that applied or investigated sdms of mosquitoes and omitted mechanistic models or application of mbd rather than species occurrence resulting in 127 retained publications 2 2 assessment of sdm standards we reviewed the selected publications according to the best practice standards for models in biodiversity assessments araújo et al 2019 we provide a summary of the standards below though full details are found in araújo et al 2019 the standards consist of four quality levels gold silver bronze and deficient gold represents aspirational methods that usually require ideal data and next generation modeling approaches which are seldom available and remain under development respectively silver corresponds to cutting edge techniques typically involving imperfect but best available data bronze standards represent the minimum acceptable practices for sdms finally deficient standards indicate unacceptable practices to drive policy and practice araújo et al 2019 sdms may be applied to investigate a wide range of ecological situations aguirre gutiérrez et al 2013 sillero et al 2021 we reviewed and evaluated sdms to determine their use and objectives for example prediction of disease prevalence to aid public health initiatives dicko et al 2014 determining areas suitable for species conservation regos et al 2021 or analyzing invasive species niche conservation medley 2010 therefore we assessed sdm quality for the general uses of explanation prediction and projection for consistency and simplicity standards scoring reflected three to five issues per sdm aspect response variable predictor variables model building and model evaluation table 1 response variable quality was strongly related to human effort specifically sampling effort the sampling effort reflected the depth of survey design to encompass all locations and environmental conditions within the taxon range identification of taxon and quantification of spatial accuracy of resulting occurrence records for the study objective araújo et al 2019 inaccuracies or bias within any part of the sampling effort can potentially limit sdm ability anderson 2012 though primary field surveys provide more reliable and accurate occurrence records many rely on records from heterogeneous sources such as occurrence repositories i e global biodiversity information facility www gbif org response variable quality also considered the depth that studies cleaned heterogeneous data to remove records within justified unreasonable locations conditions positional accuracy and taxonomic identification araújo et al 2019 we characterized the spatial accuracy of responses as assumed or known to represent a precise location i e latitude and longitude from field survey latticed points or a combination thereof the quality of predictor variables corresponded to the depth that the predictors were identified acquired prepared and selected related to study objectives and species biology we assessed the evidence or justification for predictor selection and preparation concerning biological response and spatial and temporal resolution of the response variable araújo et al 2019 ideally predictors represent conditions that the response variable is dependent at a relevant spatial and temporal resolution with any uncertainty i e measurement error quantifiable in the final sdm further sdms are applied to determine which predictor limit a species distribution often referred to as variable importance bardie and leung 2017 if sdms identified variables of importance also referred to as high contributing or demonstrated a significant effect we recorded the corresponding variables identified as important per species as variable importance estimates vary by algorithm and assessment method smith and santos 2020 harisena et al 2021 whether a variable was considered important or not was based on the original authors interpretation given the various predictors applied we grouped similar and less common predictors when considering overall importance for example temperature may be represented by minimum maximum mean or median air or land surface temperature per month s if less than three publications applied a specific predictor it was considered an other predictor i e other temperature model building quality represents the degree of sdm techniques that addressed issues of model complexity bias noise collinearity and uncertainty with respect to the study s objective araújo et al 2019 proper model building consisted of evaluating sequences of all choices including algorithm hyper parameters and the number of predictors to prevent overfitting and adjust for characteristics of response data comparison of all sequences allows for quantification and mapping uncertainty among model building choices failure to properly account for bias noise or collinearity can cause erroneous results dormann et al 2013 bailey et al 2014 model evaluation was related to the quality of the methodology used to assess the realism accuracy and generality of model outputs per model use for an objective araújo et al 2019 sdms are expected to approximate ecological reality and should be evaluated against data representative of the response variable s spatial temporal and environmental distributions model evaluation assessment included considering the depth to which authors assessed theoretical and statistical assumptions of sdms the selection of evaluation data and the meaningful evaluation metrics used ideally sdms were evaluated against multiple lines of evidence with no assumptions violated araújo et al 2019 unreliable or inflated results are possible if sdms violate assumptions or are evaluated against biased data guisan and zimmermann 2000 hijmans 2012 reproducibility remains an issue across science baker 2006 the lack of transparent methodology within sdm publications may have inhibited quality assessments to address this we evaluated the reproducibility of mosquito sdms according to feng et al 2021 to complement the quality assessment feng et al 2019 outlined a checklist of the minimum information essential for sdm reproducibility this checklist reflects the framework of araújo et al 2019 with nine four seven and 12 necessary information related to the response variable predictor variables model building and model evaluation respectively feng et al 2019 sdms were assigned a binary score if the reproducible element was provided or not full details on the checklist are available in feng et al 2019 2 3 analysis we assessed the geographic areas investigated per mosquito genus to determine regions of mbd concern to do this we considered the country or countries in which each publication applied an sdm we presented genera at the continent level excluding global applications total publications per country were mapped in arcgis 10 8 1 environmental systems research institute esri 2018 we evaluated sdm quality scores concerning 50 and 90 quantile scores per issue the 50 and 90 quantiles represent the 50 and 90 levels on an ascending list of quality respectively we quantified overall performance per aspect table 1 by the area inside the line measure a metric that reaches 100 if all standard issues reach gold for all studies at or above the given quantile araújo et al 2019 area inside the line was determined for each quantile line per aspect within a polar coordinate system such that area increased with higher quality scores fig 3 we fitted an ordinal regression with a bayesian approach to determine the change in mosquito sdm quality over time rstanarm package in r v4 1 1 goodrich et al 2020 r core team 2021 we calibrated the ordinal regression with a warm up of 1000 iterations followed by four chains with 5000 iterations sampled with an assumed prior distribution between 1000 and 1000 regression models were fitted against an interaction of year and aspect additionally a similar model fitted with an interaction of year and issue was determined table 1 we interpreted the estimates obtained by this analysis as the change in the quality over time we determined the presence of temporal trends since the establishment of araújo et al s 2019 standards by comparing quality up to and including 2019 before 114 publications to 2020 onwards after 13 publications we evaluated the independence of scores before and after the release of standards by fisher s exact test of independence on the expected proportion of each score per issue published before or after sdm standards table 2 expected proportions reflect the average count of each score across all 15 issues per period 3 results 3 1 literature review a total of 116 species from aedes anopheles culex ochlerotatus culiseta haemagogus and psorophora genera were investigated using sdms species of most interest included a aegypti a albopictus culex pipiens anopheles gambie and anopheles aradiensis were investigated by 44 36 19 15 and 14 publications respectively supplementary material 1 table s1 prediction and explanation were the most common uses of sdms 40 of cases followed by prediction only 27 fig 1 a seventy four percent of studies used presence background as the response variable while a further 4 17 and 6 utilized presence only presence absence or species abundance data respectively assumed precise locations provided the response variable for 61 of cases while latticed or a combination of occurrence types were used by 15 and 17 respectively fig 1b the response variable was represented by primary field collections for 39 of publications while 61 relied on information from the literature occurrence repositories or multiple sources bioclimatic variables supplementary material 1 table s2 were the most applied predictors 39 63 followed by elevation 59 and urban land cover 35 fig 1c slope elevation and agricultural land were the most important predictors in 53 or more of sdms though findings varied by mosquito species and genus supplementary material 2 most sdms 56 were fit with predictors at a 1 km2 or finer resolution followed by 35 with scales between 10 and 1000 km2 supplementary material 1 fig s1 the selected studies examined mosquito distributions with 23 sdm fig 1d maximum entropy maxent was most popular with 68 publications while generalized linear models genetic algorithm for rule set production and generalized boosting methods were next and applied by 18 15 and 11 studies respectively under ten publications applied the remaining 19 algorithms with 12 algorithms used by a single publication each fig 1d model complexity was addressed within 40 of studies particularly when maxent 50 of cases or ensemble 55 were considered previous studies evaluated sdms using various metrics though 10 of publications did not provide any evaluation fig 1e area under the receiver operating curve and subsampling of training data were applied by 60 and 73 to evaluate sdms subsampled data relied on confusion matrix metrics i e sensitivity specificity for 34 of all studies random hold out methods i e random split cross validation independent re substitution and geographically structured data were reported by 79 8 2 and 1 of studies respectively fig 1e 3 2 regions of sdm application mosquito sdm literature focused on african 20 collectively global 16 the contiguous united states 12 italy 8 and china 7 forecasts within africa kenya 12 and tanzania 10 were the most covered countries fig 2 a the genera investigated varied by continent aedes spp were studied extensively in the americas europe and globally while anopheles spp models were confined mainly to african and asian studies oceania had equal representation of aedes and anopheles spp investigations fig 2a sdms investigating aedes spp have increased rapidly in recent years while those addressing anopheles and culex spp remained relatively constant over time supplementary material 1 fig s2 3 3 assessment of sdm standards all 127 publications observed at least one deficient standard i e unacceptable practice within a single aspect but no aspect consistently implemented deficient practices in all publications accordingly sdms predominantly demonstrated deficient 38 of assessments or bronze 47 practices only 12 and 3 of sdms applied silver and gold practices respectively response variable model building and predictor variables observed higher proportions of silver or gold practices table 1 specifically 26 of sdms applied gold standard spatial accuracy of the response variable while sampling taxonomic identification and geographic extent of the response variable considerations were 22 13 and 44 silver quality respectively within model building examination of model complexity demonstrated silver quality by 21 of sdms and treatment of bias and noise by 21 the selection of predictor variables improved to silver and gold for 12 and 2 of all sdms respectively issues related to model evaluation observed silver or gold quality in less than 8 of sdms overall performance as defined by the area inside the curve see methods revealed that response variables demonstrated the highest quality with 16 and 52 of possible scores achieved by 50 and 90 quantiles respectively fig 3 both predictor selection and model building were poor overall for 50 quantiles with only 4 area inside the curve yet at the 90 quantile predictor selection and model building increased to 19 and 29 respectively model evaluation remained relatively similar between 50 and 90 quantiles with overall scores of 8 and 12 respectively fig 3 when examining temporal quality change via ordinal regression we observed predominantly yearly quality deterioration fig 4 notably procedures of predictor variables indicated a 6 yearly decrease in quality and 2 within model evaluation nevertheless model evaluation indicated higher uncertainty within the 95 confidence interval in contrast response variables procedures indicated an 8 yearly quality improvement model building showed a low tendency for improvement 0 2 with high uncertainty general trends of sdm aspects were inconsistent across issues except within predictor variables fig 4 temporal trends of predictor variables issues were consistently deteriorative but suggested improvement within the 95 confidence interval the remaining sdm aspects indicated a near 50 split between yearly improvement and deterioration among issues response variable sampling and consideration of environmental and geographic extents improved yearly but taxa identification and spatial accuracy decreased model building procedures related to collinearly model and parameter uncertainty enhanced over time however addressing model complexity bias and noise deteriorated lastly evaluation of model assumptions indicated a yearly increase in quality but evaluation of model outputs and performance decreased fig 4 all issues revealed wide intervals overlapping zero indicating high uncertainty yet the quality of mosquito sdms was independent of the publication of the standards p 0 88 table 2 3 4 reproducibility mosquito sdms consistently reported the algorithm and source of the response variable 98 of studies each modeling domain 97 source of predictor variables 96 resolution of predictor variables 91 and temporal range of predictor variables applied for projection 85 fig 5 elements with the least consistent reporting included download date or version of predictor variables used for projection 3 methods to account for spatial autocorrelation 10 sampling bias 15 spatial environmental outliers 17 in response variables the threshold of evaluation index 23 and spatial resolution of predictor variables used for projection 23 overall no paper provided all or no reproducible methods sdms of mosquitoes tended only to report 15 of 33 reproducible elements 45 13 mean standard deviation supplementary material 1 fig s7 reporting of reproducibility was particularly limited within elements of the response variable and model evaluation 39 and 35 respectively predictor variables and model building indicated higher reproducibility with 66 and 60 of elements reported on average respectively 4 discussion given the global importance of mbds it is essential to develop quality sdms to aid mosquito and disease management most sdms surveyed here demonstrated unacceptable or minimally acceptable practices with aspirational or current best practices applied by 12 of studies compared to araujo et al s 2019 assessment of sdms covering all taxa we found that mosquito sdms applied lower quality response variable predictor variables and model evaluation but better model building considerations supplementary material 1 table s4 we focus on detailing how mosquito sdms can enhance their quality in the sdm aspects of decreased quality above and highlight how mosquito sdms achieved higher levels of model building quality relative to araújo et al 2019 4 1 response variable mosquito sdms indicated a lower quality of environmental extent consideration among the top 90 of sdms compared to araújo et al 2019 we observed that 84 of mosquito sdms were applied to specific regions potentially limiting the environmental extent and causing excess generalization studies failed to provide evidence of species environmental tolerance within these areas instead studies calibrated sdms with the best available mosquito occurrences for the study region e g dickens et al 2018 a select few sdms addressed environmental extent by removing records in unreasonable environmental conditions e g gomes et al 2016 or provided a single line of evidence indicating occurrences occur across all major environments within study area e g fossog et al 2015 future studies should design sampling efforts to include all regions within the species environmental tolerances however this is not necessarily feasible owing to accessibility i e private property and large geographic extents required alternatively gogol prokurat 2011 demonstrated that expanding the environmental extent by considering more predictors to train sdms of rare plant species improved habitat suitability predictions and field applications calibrating sdms to a greater environmental extent improves model fit thuiller et al 2004 additional predictor variables should include a variety of environmental and biotic predictors relevant to the species geographic extent and objective broennimann and guisan 2008 early and fox 2014 failure to properly account for environmental extent inhibits sdm applicability for the intended use inhibited sdm applicability may cause truncation of response curves and misidentification of important predictors when explaining a distribution as well as biasing predictions projections leading to unfounded conclusions and management implications particularly when projecting into new geographic or temporal ranges synes and osborne 2011 harisena et al 2021 many mosquito species are considered invasive and demonstrate rapid evolution i e a albopictus egizi et al 2015 accordingly considering the native or invaded distribution alone may not represent the entire niche medley 2010 specifically temperature is a fundamental driver of mbd and mosquito life cycle followed by precipitation or water availability depending on species wegbreit and reisen 2000 shragai et al 2017 mordecai et al 2019 franklinos et al 2019 therefore as a minimum temperature thresholds must be satisfied within the environmental extent and followed by precipitation when spatially and temporally explicit records are unavailable to demonstrate total environmental tolerance as described by physiological studies of a single predictor the corresponding predictor should not be applied in model building and the effects discussed thuiller et al 2004 those wishing to investigate mosquito distributions are encouraged to consider multiple lines of evidence to infer environmental extent such as historical and current distributions for example metcalf et al 2014 combined responses from spatial temporal fossil data ancient dna and palaeoclimatological reconstructions for the american bison bison bison to determine the entire environmental extent mosquito response variables are available from literature and museum records as early as 1947 to account for the historical environmental extents of some species peach and matthews 2020 alternatively sdms considered over large geographic areas or more predictor variables may capture the environmental extent without including additional records nevertheless future studies must provide evidence of environmental tolerance from global historical ranges or physiological studies kearney et al 2009 varela et al 2009 barbet massin et al 2010 4 2 predictor variables overall performance of predictor variables applied to mosquitoes indicated the most significant deficiency compared to all taxa assessments araújo et al 2019 though the selection of predictor variables and uncertainty quality were consistent with that identified by araújo et al 2019 resolution demonstrated lower quality within both quantiles predictors spatial and temporal resolution must reflect that of the response variable to determine accurate species environment relationships thuiller et al 2004 barbet massin et al 2010 the spatial resolution was theoretically justified given response variable sampling design e g tran et al 2013 or by a known or estimated spatial error in the response variable e g johnson et al 2017 though more often predictor resolution depended on the resolutions available for selected predictors for example we observed a considerable reliance on pre calculated bioclimatic variables at 1 km2 resolution without justification supplementary material 1 fig s1 if possible future applications should estimate an appropriate spatial resolution relative to the ecological biogeographical knowledge and study objective the resolution at which a species interacts with any potential predictor is mainly unknown and limited by the spatial accuracy of the response variable hirzel et al 2001 de knegt et al 2010 previous authors have suggested estimating the resolution through dispersal home or perceptual range body size or reproduction period tyre et al 2001 mech and zollner 2002 jackson and fahrig 2015 on the other hand one can statistically approximate the appropriate resolution with sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis involves determining the resolution which observes a high correlation with the response variable therefore approximating the resolution at which a species responses to the predictor e g lechner et al 2012 additionally species interact with the environment at different levels such that relationships identified at one resolution are not necessarily observable at others lechner et al 2012 therefore species environment relationships must be measured at the appropriate resolution per predictor which requires the consideration of multi resolution sdms levin 1992 previous work has highlighted multi resolutions enhance understanding of the species environmental relationship and provided guidelines václavík et al 2012 researchers may consider multi resolution sdms to allow species environment responses to be evaluated at an appropriate resolution if sufficient response variable accuracy exists the consideration of lattice responses further complicated predictor resolution lattices are assumed to represent the characteristics of the environment across the geographic ranges they represent saveliev et al 2007 accordingly lattices allow for powerful investigations of species distributions if in line with the modeling objective openshaw 1981 however sdms must be calibrated with predictors that reflect the size of the lattice otherwise the interpreted values misrepresent the environmental conditions moudrý et al 2019 lattices with equal sized grids are more reliable for interpretation than unequal sized grids i e administrative regions saveliev et al 2007 unequal or irregular lattices increase statistical bias where environmental correlations can vary from positive to negative depending on the aggregation scale potentially rendering the results inapplicable cheng et al 2021 applying lattice response and predictor variables to mosquitoes requires caution and should be used if in line with the objective and predictors are aggregated to lattice size one may integrate more accurate occurrence sets to limit potential statistical bias pacifici et al 2019 provided a framework for incorporating misaligned occurrences sets at varying spatial accuracy many states have widely available mosquito occurrence records within the contiguous united states but others are latticed to county centroids therefore considering all available data one can create separate sdms for each response variable set accuracy with appropriate resolution predictors and ensemble appropriately predictor resolution should support the study objective many studies sought to aid fine scale targeted species management initiatives therefore appropriately applied a 1 km2 resolution or finer resolution landau and van leeuwen 2012 attaway et al 2014 however considering coarser resolutions is appropriate to approximate the probability of occurrence across a large geographic extent kraemer et al 2015 or across a lattice to explore a specific phenomenon or explore the administrative level probability of occurrence johnson et al 2017 garcía carrasco et al 2021 projection of habitat suitability into the past or future is greatly limited by available resolution koch et al 2016 therefore a coarse resolution may be applied and interpreted accordingly here most studies focused on determining the fine scale habitat suitability or probability of vector occurrence therefore most studies required fine resolutions to satisfy the species biology and objectives though many authors did apply a 1 km2 resolution this is not true of all sdm applications supplementary material 1 fig s1 therefore future efforts require greater attention to predictor resolution with justification for predictor resolution similarly the temporal resolution must reflect the time of the response variable and objective the reliance on pre calculated bioclimatic variables limited the temporal resolution to 1970 2000 fick and hijmans 2017 though many authors considered responses and objectives outside this period e g hesami et al 2019 a mismatch between or within response objective and predictor temporal resolutions results in mis specified environmental conditions and biased results fernandez et al 2017 when the temporal resolution of the response variable is known predictor temporal resolution should reflect it exactly e g arboleda et al 2012 or with the next closest applicable temporal period of effect available e g alaniz et al 2017 future studies may consider lagged temporal predictors when there is a lag effect between the predictor and response by the impact it triggers in the ecosystem including carry on effects exhibited by different mosquito species lebl et al 2013 roux et al 2015 giraud et al 2022 though lag predictors have not been evaluated in mosquito sdms evans et al 2022 reviewed sdms of euphausiids and indicated considering lag nutrient and chlorophyll levels large scale climate events i e el niño wind and up welling improved a proportion of model accuracies future studies should calculate temporally correct predictors from raw values and test lag values when available notably worldclim provides raw historical monthly climatic data from 1960 to 2018 such that the corresponding bioclimatic variables can be calculated for the appropriate time by open source functions to better match responses and objectives fick and hijmans 2017 4 3 model building mosquito sdms demonstrated higher overall performance within model building than araújo et al 2019 though not consistently across issues the higher quality observed can be attributed to the 90 quantile in model complexity and treatment of bias and noise in the response variable possible explanations for this include more recent publications and smaller sample size allowing for improved model building considerations to be more prevalent regardless mosquito sdms provide modern examples of addressing and accounting for complexity and bias model complexity is related to the number of predictors applied and fine tuning of hyper parameters merow et al 2014 the number of predictors used was considered by assessing collinearity and removing low importance predictors through iterative selection e g johnson et al 2017 this process allows inclusion only of predictors that exhibit a robust statistical relationship with the response variable dormann et al 2013 however considering all correlated factors allows for biased or erroneous estimates i e inflated or obscured to be identified aragón et al 2010 real et al 2013 iterative removal of lowest important predictor helps to piece out biased or erroneous estimates zeng et al 2016 likewise mosquito sdms fine tuned hyperparameters characteristics for each response variable by manual or automated comparisons within specialized r packages muscarella et al 2014 cobos et al 2019 or stepwise akaike information criteria for example the rising popularity of maxent has coincided with the increased availability of software to automatically test a range of hyperparameters such as included feature classes and regularization multiplier to determine the best fit against resubstituted or random hold out of training data addressing model complexity in these ways decreases the probability that a model will overfit providing more valuable predictions and projections araújo and pearson 2005 we noted that mosquito sdms were highly dependent on heterogeneous secondary response variables from one or more repositories these repositories often represented a combination of literature records citizen science and organized surveys kraemer et al 2015 reliance on such heterogeneous sources limits the quality of the response variable and introduces potential bias syfert et al 2013 however heterogeneous sources can reduce sampling bias if sampling is diverse and widespread sardà palomera et al 2012 the appropriate method to account for bias in the response variable will depend on the bias present but is often related to sampling geographic or environmental bias inman et al 2021 accordingly mosquito sdms demonstrated a wide range of methods to treat bias and noise including mahalanobis distance e g ducheyne et al 2018 spatial thinning e g drake and beier 2014 target group sampling e g wiebe et al 2017 and bias layers e g sallam et al 2016 also though not all publications addressed bias and noise it was acknowledged and described by over half of the studied publications model complexity and treatment of bias can continue to improve by quantitative assessments from multiple lines of independent validation to indicate reliability methods araújo et al 2019 4 4 model evaluation model evaluation of mosquito sdms reflected those described for all taxa by araújo et al 2019 except mosquito sdms indicated a lower 90 quantile of model outputs mosquito sdms relied heavily on random hold out evaluations over independent and re substitution methods splitting the response variable into training and testing provides an improved assessment of an sdm s fit and predictive ability over re substitution but limited assessment compared to independent data peterson et al 2007 bahn and mcgill 2013 for example wenger and olden 2012 observed that sdms of brook trout salvelinus fontinalis and brown trout salmo trutta had excellent performance when evaluated with random hold out methods but poorly predicted independent data in new locations and climates independent data can come from an independent systematic survey in a different space or time from training data martínez meyer et al 2004 peterson et al 2007 mosquito sdms applied independent evaluation from updated field surveys from public health or targeted efforts e g tran et al 2013 ibanez justicia and cianci 2015 many workers describe the lack of independent data for evaluation when an independent evaluation is available it may be inflated owing to spatial autocorrelation and bias hijmans 2012 specifically training and testing datasets may fall within close geographic range to one another thus being non independent and inflating evaluation peterson and soberón 2012 instead mosquito sdms should focus on geographically independent datasets for an unbiased evaluation standard practices for geographic structured evaluation data within mosquito sdms included division by political boundaries e g levine et al 2004 latitude longitude or quadrants e g arboleda et al 2012 unfortunately these methods do not directly account for spatial autocorrelation or bias instead one can divide training data into one or more geographically structured datasets to account for spatial autocorrelation capinha et al 2014 estimated the global range of a aegypti and created training and testing sets by accounting for spatial autocorrelation through alpha shapes other methods to account for spatial autocorrelation include removing spatial bias by pairwise distance sampling hijmans 2012 automated spatial block cross validation valavi et al 2019 or spatial leave one out method le rest et al 2014 the appropriate approach to create geographically structured training and testing sets will depend on the study objective extent and response variable 4 5 temporal trends interest in anopheles and culex spp remained relatively constant over time while that of aedes spp increased given the rapid global spread and importance of select aedes spp paired with the introduction or resurgence of associated mbd increased interest in aedes spp distribution is not unexpected lessler et al 2016 leta et al 2018 likewise while anopheles and culex spp have a much lower degree of global spread distribution was assessed within the proximity of endemic areas gangoso et al 2020 liu et al 2020 as such interest in aedes spp is expected to increase in future years despite mosquito sdm improvements in some issues compared to all of the taxa studied by araújo et al 2019 overall temporal patterns indicated predominantly divergent behavior across issues the lack of consistent change suggests that most modern mosquito sdms have not improved on previous models despite simultaneous sdm research to improve applications over the years instead publications applied the same techniques to new occurrence records or under different conditions further since the development of sdm standards sdm quality has not changed this suggests not enough time has passed for the standards to be acknowledged and implemented within mosquito distribution forecasting the same may not be accurate for all taxonomic groups yet these findings must be interpreted with caution as we observed unequal sdm application across years with no publications in 1999 2000 and 2003 and only a single year of publications to represent after standard quality response variable and predictor variables observed more consistent increases and decreases in temporal quality change respectively these observed patterns were also detailed by araújo et al 2019 but mosquito only sdms demonstrated more robust trends generally response quality has increased owing to increased biodiversity efforts that allow for occurrence repositories with increased detail soberón and peterson 2004 mosquito reporting and surveys are increasing globally to manage mbd through both standardized active and non standardized passive surveys kampen et al 2015 kovach and smith 2018 chen et al 2020 additionally increased criticism and technology protocols exist to improve survey efforts baldacchino et al 2015 parihar et al 2020 dormont et al 2021 conversely predictors indicated increasingly haphazard selection limited to bioclimatic variables with little to no justification for selecting predictors resolution or consideration of uncertainty high resolution environmental data is increasingly available via remote sensing efforts but is rarely applied to sdms pinto ledezma and cavender bares 2021 as environmental and other predictors become more accessible more consideration of predictor variables is required for mosquito sdms authors and reviewers are encouraged to review best practices in sdms to focus on enhancing their applicability to all sdm aspects and issues finally it is essential to acknowledge that the applied standards reflect a relative consensus of expert advice and that scientific standards can be challenged and altered accordingly other standards for all sdms applications sofaer et al 2019 reporting feng et al 2019 zurell et al 2020 and guides sillero et al 2021 have emerged as more research on sdms and mosquito distributions is conducted the strengths and weaknesses of sdm methods may change araújo et al 2019 we acknowledge that accomplishing gold or silver standards may not be possible in all scenarios due to logistical challenges such as data limitations the considered assessments here were limited by missing reproducible elements across considered literature fig 5 we recommend that future studies follow reproducibility checklists feng et al 2019 zurell et al 2020 further the evaluation criteria proposed by araújo et al 2019 may be too stringent to meet modern sdm practices evaluation against different standards i e sofaer et al 2019 may provide a different interpretation as such an sdm is not universally valid or invalid but must be evaluated on whether the model is valid for its designed purposes the recommendations we outline here provide guidelines for mosquito sdm quality improvement variation and biases of standard quality interpretation between observers are natural here we assessed sdm quality by a single individual so uncertainty between assessors could not be quantified or examined future standard assessments should apply multiple assessors when possible 5 author contributions jrb and hjm conceived the study jrb collected analyzed the data and drafted the manuscript hjm edited revised

24363,being plastic in face of environmental changes that negatively affect communities can increase the average fitness within populations and alter the resilience of the ecological system understanding this effect is important for making predictions about future landscapes we used simulation studies to assess the effects of dispersal behaviour plasticity on community resilience in the context of disturbance habitat loss and fragmentation caused by humans we also evaluated how resilience is affected by the cost of plasticity trophic level and specialisation and by the extent and clustering of the disturbance through an agent based model with 10 model species and 3 trophic levels we found that community resilience is best explained by plasticity plasticity cost disturbance extent and disturbance clustering with increased community resilience when the individuals have plasticity this effect increases with disturbance extent the resilience increases as the degree of plasticity increases herbivores and generalists were more resilient than carnivores and specialists we conclude that all explanatory variables used in this study are relevant to resilience in a world suffering rapid changes caused by humans keywords behavioural ecology resilience perturbation habitat loss phenotypic plasticity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction disturbance is generally understood as any relatively discrete event in time that disrupts ecosystem community or population structure thus changing resources substrate availability or the physical environment white and pickett 1985 disturbances of anthropogenic origin such as climate change pollution and invasive species are the main threats to ecosystems berger tal et al 2016 sih et al 2011 with habitat loss directly reducing species distribution worldwide and leading to several recorded extinctions sih et al 2000 in addition to its direct effects habitat destruction may also affect biodiversity by subdividing the continuous habitat into smaller pieces a process called fragmentation andrén 1994 while it is hard to disentangle the effects of these two processes fragmentation severely modifies the landscape decreases connectivity and increases edge effects thus further disrupting the dynamics of the local community pace et al 1999 ripple et al 2016 extensive theoretical and empirical research supports the existence of a tipping point where small changes in environmental conditions will lead to major changes in system characteristics a biodiversity extinction threshold banks leite et al 2014 leite et al 2018 morante filho et al 2015 suding et al 2004 population extinctions may occur abruptly below this threshold as a consequence of direct effects of habitat loss and fragmentation or shortly after due to indirect effects haddad et al 2015 the size of this extinction effect is also related to the system s resistance and resilience while in a more resistant ecosystem fewer species are directly extinguished and the remaining populations are less impacted a more resilient ecosystem can absorb disturbance and reorganize itself while undergoing changes to still retain essentially the same function structure identity and feedbacks donohue et al 2016 egli et al 2018 walker et al 2004 the ability of animals to rapidly modify their behaviour in face of environmental changes may increase their chances of survival fox et al 2019 wong and candolin 2015 and ultimately influence the resistance and resilience of a system wong and candolin 2015 this ability is known as behavioural plasticity understood as the variability in behaviour resulting from the exposure of an individual to different stimuli japyassú and malange 2014 as individuals with low behavioural plasticity maintain a largely similar behaviour pattern independent of the environmental context their average fitness is reduced in face of environmental variability ghalambor et al 2010 tuomainen and candolin 2011 on the other hand individuals with more plastic behaviours have greater variation in response rapidly adjusting to changes in environmental conditions and having higher average fitness compared to individuals with low plasticity wong and candolin 2015 therefore even though behavioural plasticity may come at a higher energetic one could still expect that animals with high behavioural plasticity will have greater survival probability under anthropogenic ecological disturbances dewitt et al 1998 ghalambor et al 2015 wong and candolin 2015 for example dispersal plasticity can be important in the face of habitat loss and fragmentation despite the associated energy cost moving faster or farther in the face of disturbance increases individual s chances of survival consequently affecting the population dynamics beever et al 2017 it is known that behavioural plasticity increases fitness gains for individuals but it is unclear whether and how these gains affect the community and ecosystem levels although it has been previously suggested that individual plasticity should positively influence the system s resistance to and recovery from the effects of a disturbance blumstein 2015 miner et al 2005 wong and candolin 2015 only a very few quantitative empirical studies of this problem have appeared so far neither do we have simulations of the effects of individual plasticity on the community s resistance or resilience to particular anthropogenic disturbances such as habitat loss to overcome potential difficulties that preclude empirical studies researchers sih et al 2015 recommend creating models with robust analyses this approach would allow one to understand more precisely the effects of individual behavioural plasticity on the resilience of biological systems that have suffered disturbances caused by humans in this study we used netlogo with an agent based model approach railsback and grimm 2019 to investigate the effects of dispersal plasticity on community resilience in the context of disturbances caused by humans particularly we tested if higher behavioural plasticity would result in higher ecosystem resilience leading to an after disturbance condition more similar to the pre disturbance condition additionally we evaluated if and how other factors such as the cost of plasticity the extent and clustering of the disturbance the trophic level or the level of specialisation on particular resources would affect ecosystem resilience 2 material and methods 2 1 model 2 1 1 general characterisation we used an agent based model abm railsback and grimm 2019 created with netlogo software wilensky 1999 by expanding the sheep and wolf model wolf sheep predation already implemented by wilensky 1997 the model world was shaped like a torus to avoid world boundary issues although our model is generic i e we did not model any specific species we are focusing on a group of individuals with determined characteristics producers primary consumers and secondary consumers fig 1 the discrete temporal scale of the model is 1000 time steps temporal coverage equivalent to 1000 years we consider 1000 years sufficient ecological time to evaluate short term ecological effects the temporal resolution is 1 time step simulation passes 1 time step at a time automatically and only ends when pre established stopping steps are reached the world s spatial scale was initially 100 100 spatial units 100 units on both x and y axes with each cell being a 1 1 spatial unit thus forming a square with 10 000 contiguous spatial units or cells regular size to test whether the results found were correlated with world size we also ran the model for smaller 50 50 2500 spatial units and larger 200 200 40 000 spatial units world sizes totalising three world sizes tested all spatial units are located on the xy plane and can have two states filled with a living plant or empty due to disturbance or feeding by consumers plants killed by feeding can regenerate after a plant dies a countdown starts and the plant regenerates after 5 time steps the regenerating plant may be of the same species that previously occupied that cell or of a different species the species is determined probabilistically by the most abundant species in its neighbourhood each plant has 8 neighbors around it there are 3 trophic levels namely producers primary consumers and secondary consumers with 4 model species of producers plants 3 model species of primary consumers herbivores and 3 model species of secondary consumers carnivores this is the maximum number of model species that our model supports above this number some species of the community of both smaller and regular world sizes become extinct thus in the preliminary simulations presented below we knew that for the test world the simulations allowed a community spanning at most 10 species respecting this maximum community size we tested the different proportions between producers primary and secondary consumers we finally used for the remaining simulations the only proportion that stabilised in all 3 world sizes that is 4 plants 3 primary consumers and 3 secondary consumers primary and secondary consumers have some state variables 1 identity each individual has its own identity 2 location the individual s position on the xy plane 3 species separated by colour phenotype 4 lifetime it refers to maximum age of individuals all individuals have the same 100 years of lifetime dying after this age the closer to the maximum age the older an individual is 5 energy amount of energy that each individual has in the system this value derives from a parameter fixed in the system called value of gain from food the energy stock is consumed whenever the individual moves resulting in a decrease of the energy value by 1 and increases whenever it eats the individual dies if its energy reaches 0 6 trophic level used to implement general characteristics of each trophic level 7 reproduction reproduction is asexual the decision to reproduce is determined by chance according to a pre determined reproductive rate reproduction occurs when the individual has energy greater than 10 at each time step a value is drawn from 100 possible values if the value drawn is smaller than the individual s pre established reproductive rate the individual reproduces higher rate implies a greater chance of reproduction the individual s energy is decreased by 10 at reproduction and its newborn has its energy level set at 5 age 0 and its first step is random any place within an angle of 360 although for the sake of simplicity reproduction is asexual we tried to simulate some background mechanisms of a sexual reproduction having energy to reproduce an inherent difficulty for the individual to reproduce in addition to the energy lost by reproducing and 8 plasticity and plasticity cost more information in section 2 1 2 at the beginning of the simulation the model species of plants were randomly distributed each one with the same number of individuals each cell in the world was filled only with one plant that is each spatial unit could only be occupied by a single plant model species thus the smaller world had 2500 the regular world 10 000 and the larger world 40 000 plants consumers have age 0 and energy value distributed at random in the beginning drawing a value below the established gain energy value multiplied by two each individual s movement direction is randomised at each time step the individuals moved in a space of one cell per time step displacement varies with the extent of the agent s local environmental disruption and with the individual s plasticity level more information in section 2 1 2 in a pristine spatial unit the animal moves randomly in short steps but if the spatial unit is damaged the individual must take a larger step in an attempt to reach a better site the more plastic the individual the farther it can go with each step consumers can perceive when they are in a disturbed space and if there is food available the overall individual costs depend on both plasticity costs and displacement costs proportional to displacement size more information in section 2 1 2 there were 150 individuals per consumer model species at the beginning of each world totalling 900 individuals 450 individuals of 3 primary model consumer species and 450 individuals of 3 secondary consumer model species the reproduction rate of primary consumers was higher than that of the secondary consumers with the former having smaller energetic gain increase in unit of energy per consumption event than the latter alexander 1991 bonenfant et al 2009 brose et al 2008 buskirk and yurewicz 1998 murray 2014 scarnívorodkin 1962 tucker and rogers 2014 model species differed from one another by the degree of specialisation on resources each model species feeds on a different number of model species from the trophic level below it clavel et al 2011 in the case of plants the model species were functionally identical without different model species specific characteristics and tended to be spatially grouped by model species feeding was the only type of interaction between model species of different trophic levels generalist model species were less efficient at digestion as an implementation of an energetic cost for eating several model species overington et al 2011 we had two ways of classifying the community in order to verify patterns and obtain an ecological understanding trophic level and specialization called community classification scheme each plant model species is eaten by 2 species of primary consumers supplementary material primary consumers have different degrees of specialisation specialists feed on one plant species intermediaries feed on three plant species and generalists feed on four plant species intermediaries feed on three instead two because this allows the existence of eight plant herbivore interactions causing plants to be eaten equally secondary consumers specialists feed on one primary consumer species intermediaries feed on two primary consumer species and generalists feed on three primary consumer species adding up the total number of model species eaten by specialist species was two one eaten by the herbivore specialist and the other by the carnivore following this same logic the intermediates ate a total of five model species and generalists ate seven model species our system had intra and interspecific competition for food and inanition controlled population growth as the animals eat there is a decrease in the available food which leads to an increase in mortality and a decrease in the reproduction of consumers due to the lower amount of energy available species are resource dependant 2 1 2 plasticity individuals varied in their capacity to adjust dispersion activational plasticity to habitat loss and fragmentation levels stamps 2016 individuals moved according to a correlated random walk steps of random size and with a mean turning angle of zero movement direction in the correlated random walk is drawn from a value within 100 50 on the right and 50 on the left the direction would be the location to which the individual would move individuals expressed their plasticity by fleeing from a place with little food availability in its surroundings this occurred whenever the energy stock available in a disturbed habitat was small small food availability because the plants prey had been either eaten or removed by disturbance individuals only increased dispersal capacity i e expressed plasticity in extreme situations because movement increases result in higher displacement costs dewitt et al 1998 there were three levels of plasticity low medium and high table 1 individuals in each level differ in their maximum displacement capacity maximum step size all consumer species in a given simulation had the same mean plasticity level i e we had a community of consumers with either low medium or high plasticity individual plasticity values were drawn from a normal distribution with mean equal to the degree of plasticity for that simulation and a standard deviation of 0 2 yadav et al 2016 the maximum movement capacity of individuals was either 2 low plasticity 5 medium plasticity or 8 cells high plasticity movement across the x y plane can be horizontal vertical or diagonal plasticity cost refers to cognitive costs the cost to permanently perceive and evaluate environmental disturbance levels each individual spends at minimum 1 energy unit for its maintenance each year but this value is increased by 0 2 in simulations where individuals have low plasticity cost or 0 8 in simulations where individuals have high plasticity cost displacement cost movement step size divided by 10 represented how much more energy the individual would spend simply by moving around more plastic individuals eventually move more than less plastic ones plasticity isn t correlated with cognitive plasticity cost we performed simulations with distinct plasticity cost values so as to test the effect of plasticity costs on the resilience of the system supplementary material 2 1 3 disturbance the permanent disturbance in the system occurred once per simulation the disturbance i e habitat loss and fragmentation represented the destruction caused by the conversion of habitat into non habitat e g by the installation of farms or other human land uses onto pristine areas this destruction had different degrees of extent a small disturbance left 70 of the original vegetation above the extinction threshold and a large disturbance left 25 of the vegetation below the extinction threshold banks leite et al 2014 leite et al 2018 morante filho et al 2015 habitat loss had different shapes representing different land uses and was either diffuse that is scattered in small patches along the landscape low spatial autocorrelation hurst index 0 3 or clustered high spatial autocorrelation hurst index 0 7 the disturbances were generated in the software gradientland cambui et al 2015 and subsequently exported to netlogo 2 1 4 resilience a resilient system should absorb perturbation and reorganise itself essentially maintaining its original characteristics walker et al 2004 our system is an ecological community and we followed the standard practice of using the shannon diversity index peet 1974 both before and after disturbance this calculation uses the number of species and the relative abundance of each species ratio of individuals of a species to the total number of individuals in the community to represent how diverse the ecological community is the higher the h the greater the diversity of the community the shannon index is calculated as follows h i 1 s p i l n p i h shannon diversity index sum symbol s number of species pi proportion of individuals number of individuals of a focal species divided by the total number of individuals in the community ln natural logarithm shannon values were obtained one time step before the end of both the pre and the post disturbance phases of the simulation when the simulation ended the pre and post disturbance shannon values calculated during the simulation were automatically exported to a csv file thus we used the difference between post and pre disturbance shannon indexes to evaluate system resilience values closer to 0 imply higher resilience the difference was calculated in r using the shannon values generated for each simulation r development core team 2019 result was multiplied by 1 and we call this measure the shannon difference we calculated shannon indexes using the relative abundance of each species in the community except in the trophic level and food specialisation analyses in which the shannon index was based on the relative species abundance within each trophic or food specialisation level the pre disturbance shannon index values were calculated after a sufficient period of time for communities to stabilise in the simulation we defined pre disturbance stability as constancy in population dynamics without decreases in the number of species in the post disturbance situation the criterium was also the constancy in population dynamics after species loss or constancy in population keeping old species as there could be species loss until a new stable state was reached after pilot simulations we determined that 500 steps are sufficient for community stabilisation the rationale for determining this 500 steps post disturbance criteria for stabilisation was that for low plasticity individuals when the patches are empty most individuals starved leading to the extinction of some species some species managed to survive due to reduced competition also because of fewer predation events and the system stabilised in a state with fewer species with new population cycles populations fluctuate but the same species remain without qualitative changes no new species extinctions occur only changes in species abundances in simulations with high plasticity individuals are able to find food reduced extinction probability in addition to being able to reproduce the species that survive usually the same species that were present at the beginning of the simulation will have a new population cycle probably with smaller abundances due to fewer resources being available in any case we observed that 500 steps after the disturbance regardless of the degree of plasticity of the simulation species extinctions due to the direct or indirect effect of the disturbance had already taken place and no further extinction occurred if the plasticity favors the species more species will survive escaping from disturbance and having time to reproduce not being extinct in this case little plastic model species could not escape the disturbance so they will die and become extinct 2 1 5 simulations we performed preliminary simulations to detect which combinations of individual and biological parameters gave rise to stable ecosystems for this we ran simulations combining the levels of gain from food for carnivores and herbivores reproduction of carnivore and herbivore and plant regrowth time obtaining 244 possible biological combinations in addition to these parameters we had three parameters with fixed values maximum age of animals herbivore initial number and carnivore initial number we established these fixed values with the stabilisation criteria above searching for combinations in which none of the initial model species were extinct after 500 time steps we ran 100 replicates for each parameter combination and in step 500 we stopped the simulation and measured model species richness in totality we had 24 400 simulations per world size the stable parameter combinations were used to run the definitive model and to address this study s questions in the definitive model each simulation started at time step 0 at step 500 the pre disturbance shannon index value was calculated at step 501 the disturbance occurred and at step 999 the post disturbance shannon index value was calculated at step 1000 the simulation ended we calculated the shannon difference for each simulation we ran 1000 simulations per combination of predictor variable for regular world size and 100 simulations in the smaller and larger worlds thus we had 24 000 simulations in the regular world and 2400 for either the smaller or the larger worlds we only ran 100 simulations for smaller and larger worlds because we verified in the regular world that there was no change in the results between 100 and 1000 simulations per parameter combination 2 1 6 model validation to validate the model we verified if population cycles were stable in all without decreases in the number of species after 500 years have passed finally we compared emergent patterns of the model to available published results so as to further validate model outputs 2 2 analysis we used a model selection approach to verify which predictor variables plasticity plasticity cost disturbance form and disturbance extent affected the variation in resilience estimated as the difference between pre and post disturbance shannon values for each world size we used the akaike information criterion aic to select the best models and define which variables with and without interaction with other variables were relevant for each world size table 2 burnham and anderson 1998 to assess the differences between trophic levels and degrees of specialization we first calculated the shannon difference considering only the species belonging to a given trophic level e g herbivores and then for species with a given degree of specialization e g generalists thus for each simulation we had two shannon differences for the trophic levels herbivores and carnivores and three for the degrees of specializations specialists intermediaries and generalists we then used student s t test to check whether there were differences in resilience between the trophic levels and a one way anova followed by tukey s test to compare amongst the degrees of specialization we performed all analyses in the stats package in the r environment 3 results in preliminary simulations we observed that under some parameter combinations the system stabilised in all 100 replicates but we did not find any single parameter combination that would stabilise simultaneously all the combinations of the explanatory variables table 1 we therefore chose one combination for each level of plasticity cost low and high cost thus resulting in two parameter combinations per world supplementary material our definitive model results in a stable populational cycle amongst all species we had in total 9 possible models and we found the same best model for all worlds containing the following explanatory variables plasticity plasticity cost disturbance extent and disturbance clustering table 2 the difference from the smallest aic value to second smallest was approximately 18 there were differences in community resilience amongst the levels of individual plasticity disturbance extent plasticity costs disturbance clustering trophic level and degree of specialization in all worlds p 0 001 table 3 since all p values were small we used graphics and tukey s test table 4 to interpret differences and patterns quantitatively and visually amongst factor levels detailed tukey s test results can be found in the supplementary material supplementary material as world size increases there is a tendency for resilience to increase and for the dispersion of resilience to decrease fig 2 community

ecological change human land use patterns and a generalised feature of animal behaviour plasticity have on a fundamental ecosystem property i e resilience we found that system resilience is best predicted by a model including both plasticity and its cost and disturbance extent and degree of clustering in most variable combinations there is higher community resilience when individuals have high and or costly plasticity and when the environment has highly clustered disturbances of low extent fig 2 herbivores and generalists are more resilient than carnivores and specialists fig 3 there is an increase in resilience as the world size increases these differences between small and large worlds may be relevant for conservation purposes for example the world size may represent the size of an isolated forest fragment for a community of forest specialists that are unable to use the matrix if a part of this forest fragment is destroyed by land clearing or a disturbance such as fire the community in the smaller fragment is likely to be less resilient than that of the larger fragments even if the disturbance definitely destroys most of the places where food can be found as the world gets larger there are enough cells remaining so as to maintain the community in this way species are less affected by the indirect effect of the disturbance since there is more food available to feed and survive the smaller dispersion of resilience values in larger world sizes could be explained in a somewhat similar vein since with a larger remaining community which means also a larger sample size the effects of random fluctuations would be reduced turning the overall path to recovery of stability more predictable across repeated simulations we found that systems that suffered minor disturbances were more resilient independently of world size a result expected from the literature donohue et al 2016 this result is repeated across world sizes indicating a consistent pattern of smaller disturbances leading to smaller changes in the environment leading to smaller impacts on the model species facilitating the system s recovery and thus making it more resilient our results expand to the broad system level the prevailing expectations based on a narrower focus on the interactions between two species ghalambor et al 2010 2015 wong and candolin 2015 i e the expectation that behavioural plasticity yields more resilience to the system fig 2 in the context of human induced rapid environmental change hirec specifically as the degree of plasticity increases the community resilience increases and more so in contexts of high disturbance extent fig 2 fox et al 2019 recommend assessing plasticity in timescales relevant in the hirec context and our results show that more plastic species are able to respond to hirec on a relevant time scale besides these ecological outcomes of behavioural plasticity the focus still seems to be on the narrow effects at the experimentally tractable scale of species interactions rather than on the more ample broad effects of individual plasticity on ecosystems hoover et al 2012 habitat loss and fragmentation reduce species richness and population viability haddad et al 2015 sih et al 2000 here we show that behavioural plasticity can reduce biodiversity loss at the community level buying more time for a system to survive and allowing the rearrangement of ecosystem interactions so as to maintain the system in viable states depending on the size of the overall positive impacts of behavioural plasticity across the whole community biodiversity extinction threshold tipping points could possibly oscillate to levels bellow the actual established percentage of remaining vegetation banks leite et al 2014 leite et al 2018 morante filho et al 2015 these expectations could be evaluated with small greenhouse experiments or by monitoring an array of anthropogenic disturbances while also monitoring behavioural plasticity levels notwithstanding our unexpected finding that systems with higher plasticity costs are more resilient in smaller worlds we also found that higher costs require more strict parameter configurations to generate stable ecosystems thus it remains possible that across all possible parameter configurations high cost plasticity would in the end still be less advantageous if we take into consideration not only the viable systems but also the systems that did not stabilise alternatively and more interestingly it is also possible that at the more complex level of ecosystem functioning the population level expectation that high plasticity costs are detrimental could be reversed by emergent system level gains obtained either by synergistic interactions corning and szathmáry 2015 or by ecosystem level autocatalytic processes cazzolla gatti et al 2018 in these later cases the predictions derived from population level experiments would not smoothly generalise to the ecosystem level and one would require the simulation of ever more real life systems associated to natural experiments in real ecosystems to evaluate the level of complexity under which population predictions depart from ecosystem rules our results also indicated that clustered farms or a single farm increase system resilience in the smaller and larger world this is an unsettled debate haddad et al 2015 kostylev et al 2005 mcgill 2010 olff and ritchie 2002 wintle et al 2019 but in clustered farms especially when they are smaller there is higher quality of fragments less fragmentation per se more connectivity and smaller edge effects also when perturbations are diffuse there is no pristine area remaining as disturbances are distributed everywhere herbivores are more resilient than carnivores probably because they feed on plants and thus have fewer foraging difficulties consequently the diversity of herbivores is maintained this explains the dispersion of resilience values between herbivores and carnivores species survive with similar abundance and quantity amongst simulations carnivores probably have higher and more varied competition in the different simulations changing the value of diversity when affected by the disturbance there may also be a chance effect a random species may be affected more than another by the disturbance we found that a community of specialised species is less resilient to perturbations than a community of generalists a result that could be understood if one takes into consideration that any extinction would have a higher impact on specialists devictor et al 2008 in a community of specialists this could have cascading effects thus propagating instability throughout the whole system we measure resilience comparing shannon diversity after and before the disturbance yi jackson 2021 discuss ways to measure ecosystem resilience in response to disturbance one of these is exactly to measure the state variable over time before and after the disturbance although they suggest variables such as the leaf area index and the enhanced vegetation index our work investigated a different level of organisation so we kept their overall recommendation of measuring a state variable over time while using a variable shannon index which is a well established community state variable and which indirectly represents several state variables such as richness abundance and relative abundance janautre et al 2013 in this way the shannon index and its derivation into a resilience index follows a valid logic established in the literature still we are aware that the concept of resilience is much discussed elmqvist 2003 grimm 1997 gunderson 2000 holling 1973 pimm 1984 hirota et al 2011 suding et al 2004 walker et al 2004 and that the choice of concept can lead to different ways of measuring resilience our computational simulations following an agent based model very common in behavioural research served to answer a complex ecological problem that would be difficult to model with mathematical or other modelling approaches railsback and grimm 2019 as in morrice s et al 2020 research with salmon migration our work did not include top down effects such as anti predator behaviour in addition to this limitation our model has elements implemented in a simplistic way e g reproduction we suggest testing our model with anti predator behaviour in a future iteration of the model notwithstanding these limitations and simplifications our study can be an informative tool to understand relationship amongst plasticity and resilience and an avenue for scaling up system complexity 5 conclusion there is more resilience in a larger sized worlds b systems composed of individuals with higher plasticity c systems with smaller disturbances d small sized systems composed of individuals with higher plasticity costs e systems with clustered disturbances with well defined borders f herbivore species and g generalist species as the mean plasticity of individuals increases there is an increase in the resilience of the system especially under large disturbances in which plasticity drastically improves resilience more plastic species are likely to be able to respond better on the short term this indicates that behavioural plasticity can reduce richness loss giving more time for the system to reorganise so as to maintain its stability our findings make an important contribution to unravel the link between behavioural plasticity and system resilience thus improving predictions and generalisations about the dynamics of disturbed landscapes declaration of

24363,being plastic in face of environmental changes that negatively affect communities can increase the average fitness within populations and alter the resilience of the ecological system understanding this effect is important for making predictions about future landscapes we used simulation studies to assess the effects of dispersal behaviour plasticity on community resilience in the context of disturbance habitat loss and fragmentation caused by humans we also evaluated how resilience is affected by the cost of plasticity trophic level and specialisation and by the extent and clustering of the disturbance through an agent based model with 10 model species and 3 trophic levels we found that community resilience is best explained by plasticity plasticity cost disturbance extent and disturbance clustering with increased community resilience when the individuals have plasticity this effect increases with disturbance extent the resilience increases as the degree of plasticity increases herbivores and generalists were more resilient than carnivores and specialists we conclude that all explanatory variables used in this study are relevant to resilience in a world

disturbance is generally understood as any relatively discrete event in time that disrupts ecosystem community or population structure thus changing resources substrate availability or the physical environment white and pickett 1985 disturbances of anthropogenic origin such as climate change pollution and invasive species are the main threats to ecosystems berger tal et al 2016 sih et al 2011 with habitat loss directly reducing species distribution worldwide and leading to several recorded extinctions sih et al 2000 in addition to its direct effects habitat destruction may also affect biodiversity by subdividing the continuous habitat into smaller pieces a process called fragmentation andrén 1994 while it is hard to disentangle the effects of these two processes fragmentation severely modifies the landscape decreases connectivity and increases edge effects thus further disrupting the dynamics of the local community pace et al 1999 ripple et al 2016 extensive theoretical and empirical research supports the existence of a tipping point where small changes in environmental conditions will lead to major changes in system characteristics a biodiversity extinction threshold banks leite et al 2014 leite et al 2018 morante filho et al 2015 suding et al 2004 population extinctions may occur abruptly below this threshold as a consequence of direct effects of habitat loss and fragmentation or shortly after due to indirect effects haddad et al 2015 the size of this extinction effect is also related to the system s resistance and resilience while in a more resistant ecosystem fewer species are directly extinguished and the remaining populations are less impacted a more resilient ecosystem can absorb disturbance and reorganize itself while undergoing changes to still retain essentially the same function structure identity and feedbacks donohue et al 2016 egli et al 2018 walker et al 2004 the ability of animals to rapidly modify their behaviour in face of environmental changes may increase their chances of survival fox et al 2019 wong and candolin 2015 and ultimately influence the resistance and resilience of a system wong and candolin 2015 this ability is known as behavioural plasticity understood as the variability in behaviour resulting from the exposure of an individual to different stimuli japyassú and malange 2014 as individuals with low behavioural plasticity maintain a largely similar behaviour pattern independent of the environmental context their average fitness is reduced in face of environmental variability ghalambor et al 2010 tuomainen and candolin 2011 on the other hand individuals with more plastic behaviours have greater variation in response rapidly adjusting to changes in environmental conditions and having higher average fitness compared to individuals with low plasticity wong and candolin 2015 therefore even though behavioural plasticity may come at a higher energetic one could still expect that animals with high behavioural plasticity will have greater survival probability under anthropogenic ecological disturbances dewitt et al 1998 ghalambor et al 2015 wong and candolin 2015 for example dispersal plasticity can be important in the face of habitat loss and fragmentation despite the associated energy cost moving faster or farther in the face of disturbance increases individual s chances of survival consequently affecting the population dynamics beever et al 2017 it is known that behavioural plasticity increases fitness gains for individuals but it is unclear whether and how these gains affect the community and ecosystem levels although it has been previously suggested that individual plasticity should positively influence the system s resistance to and recovery from the effects of a disturbance blumstein 2015 miner et al 2005 wong and candolin 2015 only a very few quantitative empirical studies of this problem have appeared so far neither do we have simulations of the effects of individual plasticity on the community s resistance or resilience to particular anthropogenic disturbances such as habitat loss to overcome potential difficulties that preclude empirical studies researchers sih et al 2015 recommend creating models with robust analyses this approach would allow one to understand more precisely the effects of individual behavioural plasticity on the resilience of biological systems that have suffered disturbances caused by humans in this study we used netlogo with an agent based model approach railsback and grimm 2019 to investigate the effects of dispersal plasticity on community resilience in the context of disturbances caused by humans particularly we tested if higher behavioural plasticity would result in higher ecosystem resilience leading to an after disturbance condition more similar to the pre disturbance condition additionally we evaluated if and how other factors such as the cost of plasticity the extent and clustering of the disturbance the trophic level or the level of specialisation on particular resources would affect ecosystem resilience 2 material and methods 2 1 model 2 1 1 general characterisation we used an agent based model abm railsback and grimm 2019 created with netlogo software wilensky 1999 by expanding the sheep and wolf model wolf sheep predation already implemented by wilensky 1997 the model world was shaped like a torus to avoid world boundary issues although our model is generic i e we did not model any specific species we are focusing on a group of individuals with determined characteristics producers primary consumers and secondary consumers fig 1 the discrete temporal scale of the model is 1000 time steps temporal coverage equivalent to 1000 years we consider 1000 years sufficient ecological time to evaluate short term ecological effects the temporal resolution is 1 time step simulation passes 1 time step at a time automatically and only ends when pre established stopping steps are reached the world s spatial scale was initially 100 100 spatial units 100 units on both x and y axes with each cell being a 1 1 spatial unit thus forming a square with 10 000 contiguous spatial units or cells regular size to test whether the results found were correlated with world size we also ran the model for smaller 50 50 2500 spatial units and larger 200 200 40 000 spatial units world sizes totalising three world sizes tested all spatial units are located on the xy plane and can have two states filled with a living plant or empty due to disturbance or feeding by consumers plants killed by feeding can regenerate after a plant dies a countdown starts and the plant regenerates after 5 time steps the regenerating plant may be of the same species that previously occupied that cell or of a different species the species is determined probabilistically by the most abundant species in its neighbourhood each plant has 8 neighbors around it there are 3 trophic levels namely producers primary consumers and secondary consumers with 4 model species of producers plants 3 model species of primary consumers herbivores and 3 model species of secondary consumers carnivores this is the maximum number of model species that our model supports above this number some species of the community of both smaller and regular world sizes become extinct thus in the preliminary simulations presented below we knew that for the test world the simulations allowed a community spanning at most 10 species respecting this maximum community size we tested the different proportions between producers primary and secondary consumers we finally used for the remaining simulations the only proportion that stabilised in all 3 world sizes that is 4 plants 3 primary consumers and 3 secondary consumers primary and secondary consumers have some state variables 1 identity each individual has its own identity 2 location the individual s position on the xy plane 3 species separated by colour phenotype 4 lifetime it refers to maximum age of individuals all individuals have the same 100 years of lifetime dying after this age the closer to the maximum age the older an individual is 5 energy amount of energy that each individual has in the system this value derives from a parameter fixed in the system called value of gain from food the energy stock is consumed whenever the individual moves resulting in a decrease of the energy value by 1 and increases whenever it eats the individual dies if its energy reaches 0 6 trophic level used to implement general characteristics of each trophic level 7 reproduction reproduction is asexual the decision to reproduce is determined by chance according to a pre determined reproductive rate reproduction occurs when the individual has energy greater than 10 at each time step a value is drawn from 100 possible values if the value drawn is smaller than the individual s pre established reproductive rate the individual reproduces higher rate implies a greater chance of reproduction the individual s energy is decreased by 10 at reproduction and its newborn has its energy level set at 5 age 0 and its first step is random any place within an angle of 360 although for the sake of simplicity reproduction is asexual we tried to simulate some background mechanisms of a sexual reproduction having energy to reproduce an inherent difficulty for the individual to reproduce in addition to the energy lost by reproducing and 8 plasticity and plasticity cost more information in section 2 1 2 at the beginning of the simulation the model species of plants were randomly distributed each one with the same number of individuals each cell in the world was filled only with one plant that is each spatial unit could only be occupied by a single plant model species thus the smaller world had 2500 the regular world 10 000 and the larger world 40 000 plants consumers have age 0 and energy value distributed at random in the beginning drawing a value below the established gain energy value multiplied by two each individual s movement direction is randomised at each time step the individuals moved in a space of one cell per time step displacement varies with the extent of the agent s local environmental disruption and with the individual s plasticity level more information in section 2 1 2 in a pristine spatial unit the animal moves randomly in short steps but if the spatial unit is damaged the individual must take a larger step in an attempt to reach a better site the more plastic the individual the farther it can go with each step consumers can perceive when they are in a disturbed space and if there is food available the overall individual costs depend on both plasticity costs and displacement costs proportional to displacement size more information in section 2 1 2 there were 150 individuals per consumer model species at the beginning of each world totalling 900 individuals 450 individuals of 3 primary model consumer species and 450 individuals of 3 secondary consumer model species the reproduction rate of primary consumers was higher than that of the secondary consumers with the former having smaller energetic gain increase in unit of energy per consumption event than the latter alexander 1991 bonenfant et al 2009 brose et al 2008 buskirk and yurewicz 1998 murray 2014 scarnívorodkin 1962 tucker and rogers 2014 model species differed from one another by the degree of specialisation on resources each model species feeds on a different number of model species from the trophic level below it clavel et al 2011 in the case of plants the model species were functionally identical without different model species specific characteristics and tended to be spatially grouped by model species feeding was the only type of interaction between model species of different trophic levels generalist model species were less efficient at digestion as an implementation of an energetic cost for eating several model species overington et al 2011 we had two ways of classifying the community in order to verify patterns and obtain an ecological understanding trophic level and specialization called community classification scheme each plant model species is eaten by 2 species of primary consumers supplementary material primary consumers have different degrees of specialisation specialists feed on one plant species intermediaries feed on three plant species and generalists feed on four plant species intermediaries feed on three instead two because this allows the existence of eight plant herbivore interactions causing plants to be eaten equally secondary consumers specialists feed on one primary consumer species intermediaries feed on two primary consumer species and generalists feed on three primary consumer species adding up the total number of model species eaten by specialist species was two one eaten by the herbivore specialist and the other by the carnivore following this same logic the intermediates ate a total of five model species and generalists ate seven model species our system had intra and interspecific competition for food and inanition controlled population growth as the animals eat there is a decrease in the available food which leads to an increase in mortality and a decrease in the reproduction of consumers due to the lower amount of energy available species are resource dependant 2 1 2 plasticity individuals varied in their capacity to adjust dispersion activational plasticity to habitat loss and fragmentation levels stamps 2016 individuals moved according to a correlated random walk steps of random size and with a mean turning angle of zero movement direction in the correlated random walk is drawn from a value within 100 50 on the right and 50 on the left the direction would be the location to which the individual would move individuals expressed their plasticity by fleeing from a place with little food availability in its surroundings this occurred whenever the energy stock available in a disturbed habitat was small small food availability because the plants prey had been either eaten or removed by disturbance individuals only increased dispersal capacity i e expressed plasticity in extreme situations because movement increases result in higher displacement costs dewitt et al 1998 there were three levels of plasticity low medium and high table 1 individuals in each level differ in their maximum displacement capacity maximum step size all consumer species in a given simulation had the same mean plasticity level i e we had a community of consumers with either low medium or high plasticity individual plasticity values were drawn from a normal distribution with mean equal to the degree of plasticity for that simulation and a standard deviation of 0 2 yadav et al 2016 the maximum movement capacity of individuals was either 2 low plasticity 5 medium plasticity or 8 cells high plasticity movement across the x y plane can be horizontal vertical or diagonal plasticity cost refers to cognitive costs the cost to permanently perceive and evaluate environmental disturbance levels each individual spends at minimum 1 energy unit for its maintenance each year but this value is increased by 0 2 in simulations where individuals have low plasticity cost or 0 8 in simulations where individuals have high plasticity cost displacement cost movement step size divided by 10 represented how much more energy the individual would spend simply by moving around more plastic individuals eventually move more than less plastic ones plasticity isn t correlated with cognitive plasticity cost we performed simulations with distinct plasticity cost values so as to test the effect of plasticity costs on the resilience of the system supplementary material 2 1 3 disturbance the permanent disturbance in the system occurred once per simulation the disturbance i e habitat loss and fragmentation represented the destruction caused by the conversion of habitat into non habitat e g by the installation of farms or other human land uses onto pristine areas this destruction had different degrees of extent a small disturbance left 70 of the original vegetation above the extinction threshold and a large disturbance left 25 of the vegetation below the extinction threshold banks leite et al 2014 leite et al 2018 morante filho et al 2015 habitat loss had different shapes representing different land uses and was either diffuse that is scattered in small patches along the landscape low spatial autocorrelation hurst index 0 3 or clustered high spatial autocorrelation hurst index 0 7 the disturbances were generated in the software gradientland cambui et al 2015 and subsequently exported to netlogo 2 1 4 resilience a resilient system should absorb perturbation and reorganise itself essentially maintaining its original characteristics walker et al 2004 our system is an ecological community and we followed the standard practice of using the shannon diversity index peet 1974 both before and after disturbance this calculation uses the number of species and the relative abundance of each species ratio of individuals of a species to the total number of individuals in the community to represent how diverse the ecological community is the higher the h the greater the diversity of the community the shannon index is calculated as follows h i 1 s p i l n p i h shannon diversity index sum symbol s number of species pi proportion of individuals number of individuals of a focal species divided by the total number of individuals in the community ln natural logarithm shannon values were obtained one time step before the end of both the pre and the post disturbance phases of the simulation when the simulation ended the pre and post disturbance shannon values calculated during the simulation were automatically exported to a csv file thus we used the difference between post and pre disturbance shannon indexes to evaluate system resilience values closer to 0 imply higher resilience the difference was calculated in r using the shannon values generated for each simulation r development core team 2019 result was multiplied by 1 and we call this measure the shannon difference we calculated shannon indexes using the relative abundance of each species in the community except in the trophic level and food specialisation analyses in which the shannon index was based on the relative species abundance within each trophic or food specialisation level the pre disturbance shannon index values were calculated after a sufficient period of time for communities to stabilise in the simulation we defined pre disturbance stability as constancy in population dynamics without decreases in the number of species in the post disturbance situation the criterium was also the constancy in population dynamics after species loss or constancy in population keeping old species as there could be species loss until a new stable state was reached after pilot simulations we determined that 500 steps are sufficient for community stabilisation the rationale for determining this 500 steps post disturbance criteria for stabilisation was that for low plasticity individuals when the patches are empty most individuals starved leading to the extinction of some species some species managed to survive due to reduced competition also because of fewer predation events and the system stabilised in a state with fewer species with new population cycles populations fluctuate but the same species remain without qualitative changes no new species extinctions occur only changes in species abundances in simulations with high plasticity individuals are able to find food reduced extinction probability in addition to being able to reproduce the species that survive usually the same species that were present at the beginning of the simulation will have a new population cycle probably with smaller abundances due to fewer resources being available in any case we observed that 500 steps after the disturbance regardless of the degree of plasticity of the simulation species extinctions due to the direct or indirect effect of the disturbance had already taken place and no further extinction occurred if the plasticity favors the species more species will survive escaping from disturbance and having time to reproduce not being extinct in this case little plastic model species could not escape the disturbance so they will die and become extinct 2 1 5 simulations we performed preliminary simulations to detect which combinations of individual and biological parameters gave rise to stable ecosystems for this we ran simulations combining the levels of gain from food for carnivores and herbivores reproduction of carnivore and herbivore and plant regrowth time obtaining 244 possible biological combinations in addition to these parameters we had three parameters with fixed values maximum age of animals herbivore initial number and carnivore initial number we established these fixed values with the stabilisation criteria above searching for combinations in which none of the initial model species were extinct after 500 time steps we ran 100 replicates for each parameter combination and in step 500 we stopped the simulation and measured model species richness in totality we had 24 400 simulations per world size the stable parameter combinations were used to run the definitive model and to address this study s questions in the definitive model each simulation started at time step 0 at step 500 the pre disturbance shannon index value was calculated at step 501 the disturbance occurred and at step 999 the post disturbance shannon index value was calculated at step 1000 the simulation ended we calculated the shannon difference for each simulation we ran 1000 simulations per combination of predictor variable for regular world size and 100 simulations in the smaller and larger worlds thus we had 24 000 simulations in the regular world and 2400 for either the smaller or the larger worlds we only ran 100 simulations for smaller and larger worlds because we verified in the regular world that there was no change in the results between 100 and 1000 simulations per parameter combination 2 1 6 model validation to validate the model we verified if population cycles were stable in all without decreases in the number of species after 500 years have passed finally we compared emergent patterns of the model to available published results so as to further validate model outputs 2 2 analysis we used a model selection approach to verify which predictor variables plasticity plasticity cost disturbance form and disturbance extent affected the variation in resilience estimated as the difference between pre and post disturbance shannon values for each world size we used the akaike information criterion aic to select the best models and define which variables with and without interaction with other variables were relevant for each world size table 2 burnham and anderson 1998 to assess the differences between trophic levels and degrees of specialization we first calculated the shannon difference considering only the species belonging to a given trophic level e g herbivores and then for species with a given degree of specialization e g generalists thus for each simulation we had two shannon differences for the trophic levels herbivores and carnivores and three for the degrees of specializations specialists intermediaries and generalists we then used student s t test to check whether there were differences in resilience between the trophic levels and a one way anova followed by tukey s test to compare amongst the degrees of specialization we performed all analyses in the stats package in the r environment 3 results in preliminary simulations we observed that under some parameter combinations the system stabilised in all 100 replicates but we did not find any single parameter combination that would stabilise simultaneously all the combinations of the explanatory variables table 1 we therefore chose one combination for each level of plasticity cost low and high cost thus resulting in two parameter combinations per world supplementary material our definitive model results in a stable populational cycle amongst all species we had in total 9 possible models and we found the same best model for all worlds containing the following explanatory variables plasticity plasticity cost disturbance extent and disturbance clustering table 2 the difference from the smallest aic value to second smallest was approximately 18 there were differences in community resilience amongst the levels of individual plasticity disturbance extent plasticity costs disturbance clustering trophic level and degree of specialization in all worlds p 0 001 table 3 since all p values were small we used graphics and tukey s test table 4 to interpret differences and patterns quantitatively and visually amongst factor levels detailed tukey s test results can be found in the supplementary material supplementary material as world size increases there is a tendency for resilience to increase and for the dispersion of resilience to decrease fig 2 community

ecological change human land use patterns and a generalised feature of animal behaviour plasticity have on a fundamental ecosystem property i e resilience we found that system resilience is best predicted by a model including both plasticity and its cost and disturbance extent and degree of clustering in most variable combinations there is higher community resilience when individuals have high and or costly plasticity and when the environment has highly clustered disturbances of low extent fig 2 herbivores and generalists are more resilient than carnivores and specialists fig 3 there is an increase in resilience as the world size increases these differences between small and large worlds may be relevant for conservation purposes for example the world size may represent the size of an isolated forest fragment for a community of forest specialists that are unable to use the matrix if a part of this forest fragment is destroyed by land clearing or a disturbance such as fire the community in the smaller fragment is likely to be less resilient than that of the larger fragments even if the disturbance definitely destroys most of the places where food can be found as the world gets larger there are enough cells remaining so as to maintain the community in this way species are less affected by the indirect effect of the disturbance since there is more food available to feed and survive the smaller dispersion of resilience values in larger world sizes could be explained in a somewhat similar vein since with a larger remaining community which means also a larger sample size the effects of random fluctuations would be reduced turning the overall path to recovery of stability more predictable across repeated simulations we found that systems that suffered minor disturbances were more resilient independently of world size a result expected from the literature donohue et al 2016 this result is repeated across world sizes indicating a consistent pattern of smaller disturbances leading to smaller changes in the environment leading to smaller impacts on the model species facilitating the system s recovery and thus making it more resilient our results expand to the broad system level the prevailing expectations based on a narrower focus on the interactions between two species ghalambor et al 2010 2015 wong and candolin 2015 i e the expectation that behavioural plasticity yields more resilience to the system fig 2 in the context of human induced rapid environmental change hirec specifically as the degree of plasticity increases the community resilience increases and more so in contexts of high disturbance extent fig 2 fox et al 2019 recommend assessing plasticity in timescales relevant in the hirec context and our results show that more plastic species are able to respond to hirec on a relevant time scale besides these ecological outcomes of behavioural plasticity the focus still seems to be on the narrow effects at the experimentally tractable scale of species interactions rather than on the more ample broad effects of individual plasticity on ecosystems hoover et al 2012 habitat loss and fragmentation reduce species richness and population viability haddad et al 2015 sih et al 2000 here we show that behavioural plasticity can reduce biodiversity loss at the community level buying more time for a system to survive and allowing the rearrangement of ecosystem interactions so as to maintain the system in viable states depending on the size of the overall positive impacts of behavioural plasticity across the whole community biodiversity extinction threshold tipping points could possibly oscillate to levels bellow the actual established percentage of remaining vegetation banks leite et al 2014 leite et al 2018 morante filho et al 2015 these expectations could be evaluated with small greenhouse experiments or by monitoring an array of anthropogenic disturbances while also monitoring behavioural plasticity levels notwithstanding our unexpected finding that systems with higher plasticity costs are more resilient in smaller worlds we also found that higher costs require more strict parameter configurations to generate stable ecosystems thus it remains possible that across all possible parameter configurations high cost plasticity would in the end still be less advantageous if we take into consideration not only the viable systems but also the systems that did not stabilise alternatively and more interestingly it is also possible that at the more complex level of ecosystem functioning the population level expectation that high plasticity costs are detrimental could be reversed by emergent system level gains obtained either by synergistic interactions corning and szathmáry 2015 or by ecosystem level autocatalytic processes cazzolla gatti et al 2018 in these later cases the predictions derived from population level experiments would not smoothly generalise to the ecosystem level and one would require the simulation of ever more real life systems associated to natural experiments in real ecosystems to evaluate the level of complexity under which population predictions depart from ecosystem rules our results also indicated that clustered farms or a single farm increase system resilience in the smaller and larger world this is an unsettled debate haddad et al 2015 kostylev et al 2005 mcgill 2010 olff and ritchie 2002 wintle et al 2019 but in clustered farms especially when they are smaller there is higher quality of fragments less fragmentation per se more connectivity and smaller edge effects also when perturbations are diffuse there is no pristine area remaining as disturbances are distributed everywhere herbivores are more resilient than carnivores probably because they feed on plants and thus have fewer foraging difficulties consequently the diversity of herbivores is maintained this explains the dispersion of resilience values between herbivores and carnivores species survive with similar abundance and quantity amongst simulations carnivores probably have higher and more varied competition in the different simulations changing the value of diversity when affected by the disturbance there may also be a chance effect a random species may be affected more than another by the disturbance we found that a community of specialised species is less resilient to perturbations than a community of generalists a result that could be understood if one takes into consideration that any extinction would have a higher impact on specialists devictor et al 2008 in a community of specialists this could have cascading effects thus propagating instability throughout the whole system we measure resilience comparing shannon diversity after and before the disturbance yi jackson 2021 discuss ways to measure ecosystem resilience in response to disturbance one of these is exactly to measure the state variable over time before and after the disturbance although they suggest variables such as the leaf area index and the enhanced vegetation index our work investigated a different level of organisation so we kept their overall recommendation of measuring a state variable over time while using a variable shannon index which is a well established community state variable and which indirectly represents several state variables such as richness abundance and relative abundance janautre et al 2013 in this way the shannon index and its derivation into a resilience index follows a valid logic established in the literature still we are aware that the concept of resilience is much discussed elmqvist 2003 grimm 1997 gunderson 2000 holling 1973 pimm 1984 hirota et al 2011 suding et al 2004 walker et al 2004 and that the choice of concept can lead to different ways of measuring resilience our computational simulations following an agent based model very common in behavioural research served to answer a complex ecological problem that would be difficult to model with mathematical or other modelling approaches railsback and grimm 2019 as in morrice s et al 2020 research with salmon migration our work did not include top down effects such as anti predator behaviour in addition to this limitation our model has elements implemented in a simplistic way e g reproduction we suggest testing our model with anti predator behaviour in a future iteration of the model notwithstanding these limitations and simplifications our study can be an informative tool to understand relationship amongst plasticity and resilience and an avenue for scaling up system complexity 5 conclusion there is more resilience in a larger sized worlds b systems composed of individuals with higher plasticity c systems with smaller disturbances d small sized systems composed of individuals with higher plasticity costs e systems with clustered disturbances with well defined borders f herbivore species and g generalist species as the mean plasticity of individuals increases there is an increase in the resilience of the system especially under large disturbances in which plasticity drastically improves resilience more plastic species are likely to be able to respond better on the short term this indicates that behavioural plasticity can reduce richness loss giving more time for the system to reorganise so as to maintain its stability our findings make an important contribution to unravel the link between behavioural plasticity and system resilience thus improving predictions and generalisations about the dynamics of disturbed landscapes declaration of

24364,the present study provides a scientific investigation of a detailed review of the published works in the domain of eutrophication based ecological modelling till the year 2020 a total of 399 articles were extracted for final analyses which were subjected to a three step hierarchical procedure bibliographic examination scientometric investigation and qualitative assessment the bibliographic test filtered 320 samples based on which the article samples were subjected to several scientometric analyses such as identifying the most influential and productive journals researchers articles and countries keyword analysis revealed the most frequently used keywords in the research domain and amongst scholars around the world the scientometric studies were followed by a qualitative assessment wherein the current trends in research were discussed this was followed by identifying the critical gaps in research to provide future direction thus this research offers a more comprehensive and holistic approach towards the critical review of the published literature thereby providing essential insights to the researchers regarding the existing practices of developing eutrophication based ecological models and the future prospects lying ahead keywords eutrophication ecological modelling sustainability eutrophication model scientometrics data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the rise in the global population has led to numerous anthropogenic interventions to aquatic ecosystems some of the significant sources elevating the levels of aquatic contaminations include domestic wastewater runoff the domestic wastewater comprises blackwater excreta urine and faecal sludge and greywater kitchen and bathroom wastewater the quality of the domestic wastewater relies on several factors such as the quality of water supplied sanitation facilities water use practices levels of treatments provided prior to discharge into the mainstream water bodies and social norms tjandraatmadja and diaper 2006 when these domestic waters interact with different components of the natural aquatic ecosystems it leads to a large scale deterioration of the water bodies through degradation of water quality damage to biodiversity or modification in climatic settings this also undergoes a change in social impact steering to loss of livelihood and abandonment of traditions and culture urban drainage and stormwater flows the surface water runoff and stormwater flowing through the open drainage systems of the towns and cities brings about equal if not more detrimental effects to the water bodies their outlets lead to as the domestic water if not properly managed industrial wastewater industrial wastewater can be classified as diffused industrial discharges from mining and agro based industries and end of pipe point discharges the former is highly polluting and thus becomes difficult to contain and treat rule et al 2006 in contrast the latter can be managed controlled and treated in the circumstances with sufficient political will regulatory power and resources economic and human capacity to ensure compliance however when these discharges reach the water bodies untreated they inflict considerable environmental damage especially to sensitive ecosystems they also often come into direct and indirect contact with humans and animals resulting in consequential damage to health agricultural wastewater agriculture has long been recognized as an essential non point or source of diffused water pollution agricultural wastewater aggravates worsens siltation problems and increases flood risk jeong and adamowski 2016 this wastewater is also rich in nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus applied to the farmland to increase crop production when they reach the aquatic bodies these nutrients assist in the swift growth of floras and result in eutrophication together with nutrients agricultural wastewater contains microbes originating from livestock or excreta used as fertilizers the aquatic bodies also get contaminated from agricultural wastewater because of pesticides herbicides and other agrochemicals used during farming these pollutants eventually enter the food chain and possess a significant influence at different trophic levels all the major pollutants discussed above relate to the alteration in the aquatic ecology for primarily two reasons a excessive heavy metal concentrations and b excessive nutrients when water bodies receive surplus nutrients especially nitrates and phosphates these nutrients stimulate excessive plant growth eutrophication including harmful algal blooms leading to oxygen depletion decreased biodiversity changes in species composition and dominance and degradation of water quality although there are natural causes much of the eutrophication today results from inadequately treated wastewater and agricultural runoffs the deterioration in water quality due to eutrophication is estimated to have already caused around one third reduction in biodiversity in rivers lakes and wetlands globally maltby and barker 2009 population pressure urbanization and industrialization contribute a considerable amount of waste which alter the physio chemical quality of water that eventually upset the biotic components of the aquatic system it is important to note that though pollution has been a significant factor in degrading the quality of aquatic ecosystems the lack of management and global awareness regarding the protection and conservation of water bodies worldwide cannot be neglected hence there lies an inherent sense of responsibility to restore the aquatic ecosystems to their natural state numerous techniques treatment options are available for varying conditions such as climatic factors socio economic factors and so on however before ascertaining a treatment alternative to curb eutrophication levels understanding the dynamics of any independent aquatic ecosystem is of prime importance this necessitates a reliable model which can provide information regarding the physical processes and dynamic occurrences in the eutrophic water bodies models can be termed as an abstract representation of reality bala et al 2017 it presents a part of the reality that and describes the dynamic conduct of a system the level of complexity can widely vary during the modelling process it can be a simple physical representation such as a map or a highly complicated series of mathematical expressions such as a detailed description of the nitrogen cycle in the ecosystem broadly the modelling process involves a series of steps taken to transform the theoretical concepts of conceptual diagrams into a quantitative paradigm mathematical models are primarily of two types abstract models and physical models brailsford and hilton 2001 the physical models are either static or dynamic depending on the time varying characteristics of the system i e if the model undergoes transient or steady state changes with respect to time it is called as a dynamic model on the other hand static models do not undergo substantial changes in their properties with time mathematical models are usually solved using numerical methods however complex systems possess significant challenge in obtaining the numerical solutions to the real world problems in such a case obtaining solutions through step by step procedures is feasible this process is called as simulation fortmann roe 2014 computer simulations have paved way for attaining solutions to the real world complex problems in a much faster and efficient manner than what was earlier possible these simulations can be discrete or dynamic in case of a discrete event simulation each parameter has its own characteristics and the objects in the system are distinct individuals the characteristics of the individual entities determine what happens to that individual in the system from probability distributions however in case of system dynamic simulations the model views all the entities as a single system and the state changes are considered as continuous numerical integration techniques are primarily employed to solve the differential equations framed in system dynamic simulations in other words the discrete simulations are probabilistic whereas system dynamic simulations are deterministic brailsford and hilton 2001 ecological modelling refers to the formation of dynamic and complex relationships of the organisms found in the ecosystem and the surrounding it attempts to unravel the effects of certain relationships in the ecosystem that are not so apparent at first glance in other words it helps the modeller to identify the concealed implications breckling et al 2011 this provides the modeller new insights into the ecosystem that were unobtainable with direct observation their evaluation and interpretation an ecological model usually contains five components jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 forcing functions forcing functions can be described as the inputs to the model that may change its behaviour upon feeding to the model these are also called controlled functions due to their susceptibility to human interference and hence plausible human control for example the forcing function for a eutrophication model is the discharge of nutrients into the ecosystem state variables state variables refer to those components of the model whose behaviour are being modelled it is best understood with an example of a eutrophication model here the state variables are the concentrations of various nutrients and phytoplankton as the forcing functions of the model change the concentration of nutrients and the phytoplankton population also change mathematical equations mathematical equations describe various biological chemical and physical processes that link the forcing functions to the state variables many equations are suitable for particular functions available in the literature jackson et al 2000 some mathematical can also be derived from the first principles i e physical laws parameters parameters are the coefficients of the mathematical equations used in the model these may be considered constant or a function of time and space the application of parameters is the weakest link in the model jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 they are estimated by using the data from the literature or by an iterative method in such a way that the calculated value is close enough to the observed value even when the parameter s value is provided in the literature they are usually delivered within a range hence there is a need to adjust the value of the same parameter for different models this process of adjusting the parameter value is called calibration calibration can be done systematically or by trial and error method usually the least square method and the maximum likelihood estimation are used to determine the degree of fitness of the estimated parameter value maximum likelihood estimations are suitable for nonlinear parameters jackson et al 2000 universal constants universal constants such as ideal gas constant and atomic weights are also sometimes used in the model a generalized flowchart portraying the ecological modelling process was given by jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 fig 1 the first step involved in the modelling process is the determination of the purpose of the model this consists of the description of the problem and the system for which the model is being developed this step is followed by creating the adjacency matrix which describes the interdependence of the various state variables to be used in the model subsequently the conceptual diagram is designed a conceptual diagram is a compact visual statement of the research problem jackson et al 2000 it describes the relationship between the various state variables of the model using boxes and arrows ideally the dataset needed for the development of the model is determined after developing the conceptual diagram however in practice most models are developed after collecting data to compromise the model scope and the available data sometimes additional information is collected at later stages of the modelling process to strengthen the model once the data collection and conceptual diagram development are concluded the modeller proceeds towards the mathematical formulation of the processes involved in the model subsequently the model is programmed into a computer and the internal logic of the model is verified following this the sensitivity analysis calibration and validation of the models are carried out sensitivity analysis of the model refers to determining which parameters forcing functions or sub models are sensitive and to what degree to the state variables jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 validation refers to the test of the model s behaviour when exposed to an independent set of data the history of ecological modelling dates back to the 1920s when the streeter phelps model was developed and since then ecological modelling has come a long way in its journey during the 1960s and 1970s the confluence of improved computing technologies scientific approaches application needs and available funding boosted its growth tremendously fath et al 2011 the eutrophication models were mainly developed during the 1970s as water quality became a critical environmental issue different models with different levels of complexity were developed which were further improved upon application in various case studies fath et al 2011 since the 1980s enough eutrophication models have been developed to model any lake with an available set of data jørgensen 2010 however the quest for an improved ecological model is far from over and many new eutrophication models have been developed over the course of time bibliographic research provides a comprehensive understanding of the past and existing approaches to a particular research domain this paves the way for a better understanding of the limitations and thereby identifies critical research gaps which will pave the way for better scientific innovations therefore a more systematic review of the published literature is essential rather than the traditional approach which may be highly subjective this can be achieved through the mapping of scholarly articles through a broad research domain the scientometric analyses of the bibliographies provide excellent visualizations of the results through interactive plots and graphical analytical tools emphasizing essential patterns trends and notions of global scientific change chen 2017 the novelty in the present study lies in a applying the science mapping technique in the domain of eutrophication based ecological modelling that will minimalize the subjectivity and prejudgment in reviewing of published works in the domain b analyses of the prevailing conventional areas related to eutrophication based ecological modelling c a qualitative examination explicitly pointing out the boundaries and gaps in the present literature thus making it more comprehensive and finally d proposal of a research structure which will pave the way for future research works on developing eutrophic models the rest of this article has been designed as follows section 2 demonstrates an all inclusive assessment method integrating science mapping and a qualitative argument section 3 describes the results and preliminary outcomes of the science mapping approach section 4 covers discussions on the current research themes gaps and developments in the domain of eutrophication based modelling techniques and finally section 5 provides critical concluding remarks to this review based investigation 2 methodology the bibliographic research in the current study is divided into three stages as depicted in fig 2 stage 1 comprises the literature search through relevant keywords screening and analyses of the articles within the scope this is followed by a scientometric analysis and finally the qualitative assessment 2 1 bibliographic search the bibliographic search for the systematic review process involved using the prisma preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analysis framework this technique uses four distinct levels of analysis i e a identification b screening c eligibility and d inclusion criteria the detailed framework of the methodology has been represented in fig 2 the first step employed identifying critical keywords in the research domain and entering the keywords in a reliable search engine to extract records in the present study scopus is considered the search engine for its broader spectrum of use by different academicians and researchers around the globe also scopus is deemed to contain a more comprehensive range of journals and more recently published works than other search engines such as web of science google scholar pubmed etc the keywords entered are as follows title abs key ecological model or title abs key ecological modelling and title abs key eutrophication an aggregate of 399 published documents was initially extracted from the search which was then considered for the second step of the analysis i e the screening process all articles were then screened using different inclusion exclusion criteria firstly only the journal articles are considered for the bibliographic analysis whilst the conference papers or book chapters have been excluded this is because articles are believed to provide more substantial information regarding a particular domain than other publications secondly the articles to be published in 2021 were excluded as the year 2021 has just begun thirdly the articles published in the english language have been considered for the study after the screening process the eligibility criteria were verified using quality assessment the duplicity of the articles identification of the articles out of scope and irrelevant articles were taken care of finally the use of boolean operators such as and or or for the search of articles was included by using a single word or a combination of words a total of 320 articles were finally chosen for the bibliographic analysis in the domain of eutrophication based ecological modelling 2 2 scientometric analyses the scientometric analysis becomes the second stage of the review process wherein a data mining tool named vosviewer was employed to visualize different bibliometric networks the nodal densities and distances determine the relative closeness between any parameter of analysis the tool also possesses several unique aspects of data mining the details of which may be obtained from hosseini et al 2018 the present study employs vosviewer to satisfy three objectives a loading the downloaded literature samples b computation analyses and visualization of the effects of different journals scholars and countries actively involved in the domain of eutrophic ecological modelling and finally c understanding the distribution of keywords used in the published works of literature and their correlations in the research domain 2 3 qualitative assessment post quantitative analyses the qualitative discussion considers the detailed examinations of the existing research approaches to developing eutrophic models this is followed by identifying the research gaps and thereby proposing directions to future research perspectives in the domain of ecological modelling 3 results of the scientometric analyses 3 1 an overview of the literature sample the 320 published articles have spread across a broad time scale ranging from 1976 to 2020 fig 3 however it was observed that 90 of the articles have been published at the onset of the 21st century i e from the year 2000 288 320 papers have been published furthermore the trend of research in the current domain has steadily increased as the years progressed the year 2019 having the highest number of published articles this is indicative of the relevance of the research in the domain of eutrophic based models with this trend it is expected that more articles will come into circulation owing to the development of more sophisticated computational methodologies also the growing problem of eutrophication in surface water bodies and a wide range of research scope has triggered researchers across the globe to carry out research in this domain insert fig 3 3 2 science mapping of journal sources all 320 articles published were sourced from 116 journals however only 21 journals had at least three articles and 30 citations the networking of the journal sources meeting the threshold criteria was acquired through mapping in vosviewer the nodal and font sizes represented the number of published works from a specific journal fig 4 each node is divided into different clusters and is inter connected through connecting lines indicating the relative closeness amongst the journals with respect to mutual citations this is because citations are believed to be the most imperative way of judging the significance of research van eck and waltman 2014 the results showed that ecological modelling displayed the highest productivity providing the maximum number of published works in the eutrophic based ecological modelling research domain a more detailed analysis of the journal sources has been reported in table 1 only four journals have more than ten published works namely ecological modelling hydrobiologia journal of marine systems and science of the total environment these journals were also found to have a large number of citations thus indicating their high productivity and significance in the research domain the total number of articles citations and normalized citations were sourced from the records average citations and average normalized citations measured as the ratio of the total number of citations and normalized citations to the total number of articles from a particular journal respectively were measured these values provided information regarding the most influential journals amongst the lot this is because the average normalized citations offer a more comprehensive idea regarding the relative research significance than the number of articles published on this criterion it was observed that ecology letters global change biology and marine pollution bulletin held significant impacts in the research domain having average normalized citation scores of more than 1 50 however these journals do not have a considerable number of published articles under them 3 3 analysis of co occurrence of keywords keywords form a significant part of research as they provide an idea regarding the topics covered in any domain a network of keywords thus provides a holistic notion about the relative closeness and their associated inter relationships as per the recommendations by oraee et al 2017 and hosseini et al 2018 author keywords and fractional counting approach were employed in vosviewer a minimum number of 5 occurrences was set as the critical limit which provided a total of 31 out of 1061 registered keywords these 31 keywords were further subjected to screening wherein the repetitive keywords were filtered out finally a total of 27 keywords were subjected to analysis the results of which are shown in table 2 and fig 5 fig 5a shows the network of all 27 keywords used for the analysis it was seen that these keywords were classified into seven different clusters depending upon their inter relative closeness keywords in cluster 1 represented by the red colour suggest that studies primarily focused on coastal eutrophic models taking climate change into account water quality parameters especially nutrients were considered for modelling the water frame directives since most of the studies carried out fell under the seawater or oceanic eutrophication levels it also considers the hypoxic condition which is a state where the human body suffers from inadequate oxygen levels in the body keywords falling under cluster 2 denoted by green suggest that the studies focused on lakes and wetlands considering their hydrological simulations the prime focus was to restore the water bodies to their natural states through watershed management techniques keywords forming cluster 3 denoted by blue colour are suggestive of the studies limiting to eutrophication of macrophytes thereby indicating a regime shift similarly keywords in cluster 4 denoted by the yellow colour suggest eutrophication studies limiting to algal blooms in various water bodies due to the nutrient discharges likewise the keywords in cluster 5 denoted by purple colour indicate studies on lakes polluted explicitly by nitrogen and phosphorus keywords in cluster 6 characterized by sky blue colour show studies on ecological modelling as a function of exergy i e chemical and mechanical processes occurring within an aquatic ecosystem with respect to phytoplankton finally keywords categorized under cluster 7 indicative of the orange colour show studies on ecological models on the north sea concerning diatoms furthermore the network also suggests that not only intra cluster but inter cluster keywords also possess strong linkages for example as shown in fig 5b water quality had a strong association with keywords such as eutrophication ecological model nutrients lake ecosystem model macrophytes etc a detailed analysis of the keywords predominately used in the research domain has been listed in table 2 it was observed that words like climate change water framework directive simulation and exergy are being used lately which shows a gradual shift in the process of framing models i e shift from the development of traditional models to more complex and sophisticated models approximating real life conditions through computer simulations 3 4 co authorship analysis mutual collaboration amongst researchers worldwide leads to better scientific approaches to any problem and keeps the researchers away from isolation hosseini et al 2018 hence keeping this in mind the present study considered reviewing the co authorship details in the domain of eutrophication based ecological modelling authors having published at least three documents and having a minimum of 30 citations were considered for the analysis this resulted in 42 out of a total of 1211 authors the details of which are provided in fig 6 and table 3 from fig 6 it is evident that all the researchers are highly collaborative which is indicated by the strong density of the connectors also the authors are classified into five distinct clusters based on their relative closeness in research areas cluster 1 had the maximum number of authors listed under it followed by cluster 2 and so on furthermore from table 3 it was found that arhonditsis g b university of toronto jørgensen s e dfh institute a denmark lancelot c université libre de bruxelles brussels belgium billen g university pierre et marie curie garnier j umr cnrs 7619 sisyphe gypens n université libre de bruxelles brussels belgium lacroix g royal belgian institute for natural sciences rbins and scavia d university of michigan were amongst the most productive researchers having more than five research articles published under their name all these authors also had a considerable number of citations which depicts the magnitude of their research however when it comes to the average normalized citations billen g university pierre et marie curie garnier j umr cnrs 7619 sisyphe and reckhow k h duke university hold the maximum impact with the normalized citation scores of more than 2 00 3 5 articles citations citations in any research article increase its reliability and impact on a research domain it is thus essential to identify highly influential journals in the research domain to identify the appropriate methodologies and techniques employed during the research therefore a minimum of 50 citations for each research article was set in vosviewer which resulted in 66 articles out of a total of 320 meeting this criterion mapping of these 66 articles was carried out as shown in fig 7 it is clearly evident that articles borsuk et al 2004 guttal and jayaprakash 2008 jöhnk et al 2008 seitzinger et al 2010 siegel et al 2002 tyrrell 1999 were the most influential having the maximum number of citations also all the articles were observed to have considerable mutual citations which is evident from the connecting lines further detailed analysis concerning the normalized citation scores is presented in table 4 clearly showing consistent results with the mapping outputs based on the results extracted from scopus with relation to the normalized citation scores it was observed that seitzinger et al 2010 tyrrell 1999 and jöhnk et al 2008 possess the strongest influence owing to their very high normalized citations more than 5 00 it was also seen that newer articles displayed significantly higher normalized citations than the older counterparts thus suggesting the effectiveness and the impact of the more recent articles in the research domain this is attributed to adapting the latest computational methodologies and sophisticated programming languages over the traditional methods 3 6 countries active in the research domain of ecological modelling a minimum of 3 articles and 30 citations from each country were considered to analyse the countries actively participating in ecological modelling the results were subjected to mapping in vosviewer shown in fig 8 it was observed that the most actively participating countries are primarily those countries that are highly developed for example the united states denmark china netherlands france germany and the united kingdom whereas the developing or less developed countries have insignificant contributions it was also observed that all countries involved have excellent mutual collaborations which is evident from the density of the connecting lines furthermore these countries have been categorized into six clusters depending on their research fig 8b g cluster 2 primarily comprises the countries having the highest productivity in the current research domain a more detailed representation of the extracted data on the active countries in the research domain is represented in table 5 it was found that although the united states contribution in the research on eutrophication based ecological modelling is the most significant the average normalized citation score of the united kingdom is the highest depicting a considerable impact of the investigations carried out in the country the uk is followed by switzerland bulgaria netherlands united states south korea and germany having scores of more than 1 20 it is also important to note that only four asian countries china japan india and south korea make up the list out of the 32 countries analysed while the majority of the contributions have been from the european and american countries this indicates the massive gap in the research on ecological modelling in asian countries compared to others 4 qualitative assessment the scientometric analyses were followed by a qualitative discussion on the existing research conducted across the world in the domain of eutrophication based ecological modelling this helped identify critical research gaps eventually developing a research framework for possible future directives 4 1 current research topics within eutrophication based ecological modelling a modelling software usually aids the development of an ecological model but the level of dependence on the modelling software depends on the comfort of the modeller jackson et al 2000 there is a broad spectrum of modelling software available to the modeller on one end of the spectrum there are general programming languages such as c basic fortran pascal etc which give the user complete freedom over the model construction and total responsibility of handling all the tedious details at the other end of the spectrum user friendly modelling software with attractive graphical interfaces such as stella simulink modelmaker etc give users freedom from handling the underlying implementation details but having limitations over model construction between these two extremities lies several programming packages such as matlab and spreadsheets which provide different functions to ease the user from handling programming details while at the same time allowing some control to the modeller different ecological models can be broadly categorized into two groups white box and black box models jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 the white box model is one in which the causality of the input output relation is known on the other hand a black box model has no explanation for why a particular model behaves in a specific manner for a given input in practice most models can be described as grey models as they are a combination of both white and black box models jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 further made another classification of the ecological models based on their application given in the following list biogeochemical and bioenergetics dynamic models the biogeochemical and bioenergetics dynamic models are primarily white box models which apply mass and energy conservation principles to develop the differential equation these models are easy to understand interpret and develop but a relatively good database is required and becomes challenging to calibrate when many parameters are involved in the model eutrophication models are a type of biogeochemical model steady state biogeochemical models the steady state biogeochemical models are used when the database for model construction is small still these models fail to give any information about the ecosystem s behaviour with change in time population dynamic models the population dynamic models are one of the most popular ecological models which can predict the development of a population with time incorporating the age structure and impact factors however there is a requirement for a relatively good and homogenous database structurally dynamic models the structurally dynamic models allow modellers to incorporate dynamic parameters considering the adaptation factor of different species and shift in the species composition however there is a need for goal function or artificial intelligence for this model to work correctly making this model time consuming fuzzy models as the name suggests the fuzzy models are applicable to the fuzzy dataset and semi quantitative information linguistic formulation these models are not suitable for complex model formulation artificial neural networks artificial neural networks can be described as black box models which requires a sizeable heterogeneous dataset from different ecosystems or a homogenous dataset from a specific ecosystem to represent the relationship between the model s state variables and forcing functions spatial models the spatial models are those models that show the spatial distribution of different processes forcing functions and state variables gis can be used to describe those models individual based models the individual based models consider the uniqueness of the different individuals within a species which though disregarded in biogeochemical models may be vital for the survival of that species these models can be very complex ecotoxicological models ecotoxicological models are basically biogeochemical or population dynamic models that are being applied to ecotoxicology these models earn a particular place in classification due to limited knowledge of ecotoxicological parameters and the use of safety factors stochastic models stochastic models incorporate randomness either in forcing functions or model parameters a stochastic model can be any of the previously described models with randomness factored in it hybrid models hybrid models are a combination of any two previously described models such models bring the dual advantage of coupling the benefits and minimizing the disadvantages of the parent models one example of the hybrid model is the outcome of combining a biogeochemical dynamic model and an ann model in the following part of this section some of the developments in ecological modelling especially in eutrophication modelling since the 1980s are discussed scavia 1980 developed an ecological model consisting of epilimnion hypolimnion and sediments of lake ontario that simulates various state variables such as phytoplankton zooplankton different forms of nitrogen phosphorus silicon carbon dissolved oxygen particulate sediment and pore water dynamics this ecological model illustrated the significance of detritus and herbivorous zooplankton in lake ontario and thereby served as an analytical tool for the large ecosystem of lake ontario matsuoka et al 1986 developed a mathematical model to predict the fate of nutrients amongst four levels with fourteen state variables in each segment for japan s largest shallow lake kasumigaura which was suffering from the problem of artificial eutrophication caused by urbanization agricultural growth and fishing culture these state variables included phytoplankton zooplankton fish crustacean external nutrients and fresh sediments one of the highlights of this eutrophication model is that while calibrating the model most of the parameter values were based on the in situ measurements and batch culture experiments using strains from the lake this model was applied as a predictive device to get the nature of water quality in the future dejak et al 1987 integrated a two dimensional diffusion model with a two dimensional advection model for the lagoon of venice to develop a three dimensional model capable of simulating the dispersion of eight state variables phytoplankton zooplankton ammonia nitrites and nitrates degradable organic compounds and temperature the three dimensional eutrophication model can estimate the eddy diffusion constant that incorporates the dispersion action of the tide lake taihu is amongst the five largest freshwater lakes in china that have been severely affected by eutrophication since the 1980s different models have been developed to study this lake such as hydrodynamic models mass transportation and cycling models and ecological models the first ecological model was developed by dou et al 1995 to link the hydrodynamic aspects of the lake to chemical and biological processes occurring in the lake the entire lake was divided into thirty sub zones and various sub models were developed for each sub zone in 1999 hu created another model for eutrophication in lake taihu it was one of the earliest versions of what is currently known as the ecotaihu model hu 2016 this three dimensional model was developed by combining another three dimensional hydrodynamic model hu et al 1998b weiping et al 1998 a model describing the impacts of water hyacinth on the water quality of lake taihu hu et al 1998c and a model based on a physio biological engineering experiment for water purification using trapa natans var bispinosa hu et al 1998a this model was further developed by incorporating the carbon cycle that allowed the depiction of ph in the lake and revealed that the lake acted either as a sink or as a source at different times weiping et al 2011 zhang et al 2008 in 2010 another improvement was incorporated into the ecotaihu model by redefining the sub model for fish this improved model revealed that by introducing the fish into the lake the production of the released fish could increase and change the population structure in the lake this model also revealed that by releasing certain fish species the nature of the lake could also be altered for example if the ctenopharygodon idellus was released it could temporarily curb the fast growing macrophyte population on the other hand if the grass carp were cast into the lake it bolstered the phytoplankton and algae population zhang et al 2013 further improved the ecotaihu model by incorporating an additional layer of algae to explain the movement and disappearance of the mat like algal bloom on water s surface under weak and robust winds respectively karul et al 2000 developed a three layered levenberg marquardt feed forward learning algorithm to develop eutrophication models for three water bodies of turkey keban dam mogan and eymir lakes to develop neural networks the eutrophication phenomenon was converted into an input output problem and data for the input layer was collected through an extensive six year field monitoring program the input parameters for the keban dam were phosphate nitrate alkalinity suspended solids ph and water temperature electrical conductivity dissolved oxygen and secchi depth for the mogan and eymir lakes the input parameters considered by the authors were total phosphorus nitrate and ammonia the temperature in water electrical conductivity ph turbidity secchi depth and suspended solids suspended solids turbidity and secchi depths were considered in the neural network to simulate the role of light in the euphotic zones chlorophyll a was selected as the primary target output for the network additionally three typical indicators of eutrophication cyanophyceae species aphanizomenon sp microcystis sp and oscillatoria sp were used as target outputs the results from the so developed eutrophication models revealed a relatively good correlation between calculated and measured values for keban dam and a high correlation between the same for the much smaller and more homogenous mogan and eymir lakes drago et al 2001 used a three dimensional model trophy3d to analyse the advection and diffusion of suspended solids and conservative pollutants in the ambient water and their effect on trophic behaviour the trophy3d model used a finite difference method for spatial integration and a runge kutta iv or euler method for temporal integration of the differential equations used in the model the model was also able to predict the biochemical interactions between detritus phytoplankton nutrients zooplankton and dissolved oxygen rukhovets et al 2003 developed a new three dimensional mathematical model for lake ladoga the largest freshwater european lake in northwestern russia to simulate phytoplankton growth the authors selected fourteen state variables in this model including different phytoplankton complexes zooplankton dissolved organic matter detritus dissolved mineral phosphorus and dissolved oxygen it is based on the ideas of phytoplankton succession in the lake given by petrova in the 1980s rukhovets et al 2003 prior to this model menshutkin and vorobjeva 1989 successfully created a one box model for eight different groups of phytoplankton communities in the volkhov bay this model incorporated the lake s temperature conditions and the nutrient supply but it failed to consider that the zooplankton and fish eat phytoplankton moreover the modellers assumed that the instantaneous mixing of the nutrients in the lake the new three dimensional model improved the works done by menshutkin et al 1998 with a more detailed description of the phytoplankton community zhang et al 2003 also developed a structurally dynamic eutrophication model for lake mogan ankara turkey which described the competition between phytoplankton and submerged plants in the lake in this model energy was used as a goal function to develop plankton species dynamic adaptation and seasonality malmaeus and håkanson 2004 developed an extensive dynamic model to predict the phosphorus concentration and the consequences of eutrophication on the lake ecosystem the model is called lake eutrophication effect dose sensitivity model leeds it was developed with easily accessible lake variables the leeds model was novel in many ways it incorporated two levels for colloidal phosphorus a seasonal factor for lake outflow higher settling velocity for re suspended material a new algorithm to model the mixing between deep water and surface water and phosphorus diffusion from sediment accumulation areas trolle et al 2008 used the one dimensional lake ecosystem model dyresm caed to know the effect of total phosphorus loading reduction on the ecosystem dynamics of moderately deep lake ravn denmark the model was calibrated with the observed data for oxygen and temperature for a period of seven years and then validated for another period of five years when put to use the dyresm caed predicted that a significant reduction in total phosphorus is needed to meet the phytoplankton biomass concentration as per the european union water framework directive wfd for cultural eutrophication assessment mukherjee et al 2008 developed a model representing the carbon dynamics in a simulated pond in ranchi india the model mainly included processes such as respiration decomposition and photosynthesis that play an essential role in the nutrient dynamics of the system in eutrophication models it is usually challenging to model the carbon cycle in detail still this model successfully shows nutrients dependence on an accurate and detailed description of the carbon cycle taguchi and nakata 2009 developed a numerical model that highlighted the role of macrophyte colonies in the shore zone in water purification the model was applied to lake suwa lake kasumi lake biwa and some small lakes attached to lake biwa the model included interactions between the compartments of pelagic and benthic regions meteorological and hydrodynamic conditions were considered amongst the forcing functions the model outcomes were reported to agree with the observed values obtained from the water quality monitoring campaign he et al 2011 developed a numerical model based on the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc for beijing gaunting reservoir three state variables for phytoplankton species cyanobacteria green algae and diatom were considered for the model and vertical temperature profiles chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations in the water column were used during model calibration the developed model was used as an investigative tool which revealed that the peak chlorophyll a could be reduced by reducing external loadings of nutrients with constructed wetlands biomanipulation or diverting water from the cetian reservoir however one of the significant shortcomings of this model is that it was calibrated with only one year of data therefore it was capable of reflecting only the short term effects of applying management scenarios xu et al 2013 developed a structurally dynamic model based on the software pamolare ii for the baiyangdian lake in north china pamolare planning and management of lakes and reservoirs is a modelling software developed by the international environmental technology centre of unep ietc unep and international lake environment committee ilec which offers four eutrophication models with different complexity levels the first model is the vollenweider plot with one state variable of phosphorus or nitrogen loading in g m2 year the second model contains four state variables the state variables are nitrogen and phosphorus in water and sediments several correlations were also provided to calculate other state variables the third model is more complicated than the previous two models providing a two layer model with 21 state variables the fourth model is an improvement of the third model with the application of a structurally dynamic approach pamolare ii is the next version of the pamolare software which provides structurally dynamic models focusing on shallow lakes for eutrophication lake management the baiyangdian lake model was developed by xu et al 2013 to predict the ecological health condition of the lake under different scenarios of submerged plant removal from the lake the ecological health conditions were indicated by phytoplankton biomass the ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass eco exergy and structural eco exergy the conceptual diagram of the baiyangdian lake model included 12 state variables correlated by 45 processes zouiten et al 2013 developed a mathematical eutrophication model called environmental hydraulics institute eutrophication model envhydrem especially for coastal regions which considered 19 state variables including phytoplankton different forms of carbon nitrogen phosphorus and silica carbonaceous organic matter zooplankton bacterioplankton detritus iron and manganese the envhydrem described all the possible interactions between the defined state variables by considering all the biological and chemical processes involved in the ecosystem it was further applied in the victoria lagoon in northern spain to gauge its efficiency magnea et al 2013 developed a simplified mathematical model to describe the phosphorus phytoplankton zooplankton and fish dynamics in the alpine lake ecosystems the model was developed to study the scenario when brook trout salvelinus frontinalis were introduced artificially in the lake ecosystems the model so developed was used to explore twelve alpine lakes in gran paradisonational park italy xu et al 2014 developed a simple yet effective eutrophication model using parameters based on both literature survey and experimental investigation which incorporated bioaccumulation and algal growth for eutrophication in xikeng reservoir shenzhen city china the authors combined the cumulative effects of meteorological water quality and biological factors on eutrophication to develop an incremental eutrophication risk evaluation model this model highlights that a large set of parameters and experiments to simulate the eutrophication process is not a prerequisite for its functioning prokopkin et al 2014 also developed an investigative mathematical model to confirm the presence of a phytoflagellate population in the stratified lake shira khakasia in russia by considering the microbial dynamics and phytoflagellate relationship with the trophic levels of the lake the outcome of such a model was that it confirmed the abundant presence of cryptographic algae in the water column above the chemocline in the summer season this 1 dimensional model is a perfect example of how modelling can be used to corroborate the presence of certain species in the ecosystem which otherwise has indirect evidence of existence li kun et al 2017 developed a two dimensional eutrophication model for an urban lake in the tianjin region to describe the spatiotemporal variation of water quality and establish relationships between phytoplankton zooplankton and nutrients navier stokes equations and finite volume method were used to define the hydraulic model and the bayesian approach was employed for model calibration and parameter posterior distribution acquisition the model simulated five state variables that included phosphate nitrate ammonia chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen the calculations from the two dimensional model revealed higher values for the state variables in the regions closer to the lake periphery than at the centre indicating the significant role of nutrient loading of rainfall runoff on algal growth and water quality thus the 2 dimensional model provided crucial information that can result in an effective management strategy to counter severe eutrophication in the urban lakes mccullough et al 2018 developed a relatively simple dynamic mass balanced model incorporating five state variables of different forms of organic carbon and dissolved oxygen to investigate the dominance of allochthonous organic carbon in the organic carbon dynamics of a lake in the long run the model so developed was validated in five different lakes in the u s a and canada mccullough et al 2018 also used the model to predict the seasonal variation in the organic carbon budgets das et al 2018 developed a mathematical model to simulate the phytoplankton distribution and nutrient cycle along the river jagaddal an easterly branch of the saptamukhi east gulley of the saptamukhi river in sundarbans estuarine system india the author designed their model based on the compartmental ecosystem model developed by fasham et al 1990 their model considered phytoplankton and nitrate in the water column as two state variables the differential equations for these state variables were based on haney and jackson 1996 the authors further carried out sensitivity analysis of their model based on a variance based sensitivity analysis method through sensitivity analysis they were able to understand the crucial parameter of the model and in turn predict the underlying ecological process involved for such an influence the model equations were integrated using the fourth order runge kutta algorithm which the c programming language implemented the sensitivity analysis was carried out in matlab without a single strand of doubt it has been established that wetlands are irreplaceable elements of nature necessary to maintain the much needed ecological stability in the world thereby rightfully earning the title of ecological hotspot the biodiversity in the wetlands is astounding and never ceases to baffle humankind with its expanse to compound its usefulness wetlands also act as filters storage reservoirs and sediment tanks to provide purer water to surface water and groundwater sources however all wetlands worldwide are currently under significant threat due to pollution from various sources requiring an immediate call for their protection however all such efforts for protection can lead to futile outcomes if the nature of the wetlands and the role of different biotic and abiotic components present therein are not adequately understood this solicits the application of ecological models that can be crudely described as representing a particular individual idea or condition there are different types of models suited for different ecological conditions and since the 1920s rapid progress has been made in the field of ecological modelling various researchers have applied ecological models with varying degrees of complexity depending on the nature of the problem available datasets for calibration and validation and skillset of the researchers a study of different ecological models developed across the world has provided exciting insights into the process of ecological modelling along with the extent to which ecological models can be utilized effectively many researchers have used ecological models as investigative tools to understand the behaviour of different state variables in the ecosystem in some cases they have successfully unearthed hidden interactions in the ecosystem that were otherwise just speculations amongst the observers the ecological models have also proved to be excellent predictive tools assisting in answering different what if situations relating to the wetlands thereby augmenting the decision making process to take more effective and powerful steps in wetland management 4 2 current research gaps in the domain and a way forward while many works have been done on ecological modelling the quest for better ecological models is far from over most ecological models have site specific limitations and hence a completely robust generalized ecological model is yet to be developed however creating such a model will be an arduous task until such a model is developed ecological modellers have to compromise with site specific models and continue to develop models for different wetlands separately the need to create an ecological model becomes far more urgent if it is currently endangered it has been observed that most ecological models developed have revolved around the more developed nations while the lesser developed or developing nations are still in the dormant stage in this research domain this may be attributed to technological advancements in computational facilities that these countries lack nevertheless the lack of studies does not mean that the problem of eutrophic water bodies is of no concern in these countries instead there exist significant shreds of evidence of vanishing water bodies as well as ecologies in these countries therefore a collaborative research approach is a way forward if proper governing measures need to be undertaken to conserve natural systems and restore them to their near original state the models developed by modellers are seldom assessed for their performance and reliability only a handful of modellers have successfully proposed measures of evaluating the correctness of the model which will solve real life problems for example the use of artificial neural networks regression analyses and machine learning approaches however the most effective tool that needs attention to all modellers is sensitivity techniques wherein the sensitivity indices of all parameters can be computed this in turn will aid in addressing the reliability and correctness of the models finally with the advancements in the programming world and sophisticated languages and software development it becomes essential that the modellers adapt to the changes and keep updated also mutual collaboration amongst scholars worldwide will help initiate novel ideas and scientific techniques based on their perception which can be integrated into a single framework 5 conclusion the scientometric analyses of the literature sample considered in the current study have been divided into two distinct approaches quantitative and qualitative analysis the quantitative analysis provided information regarding the various computations carried out during the review process the qualitative analysis discussed the current research trends across the globe it thereby helped identify the critical gaps which further aided in providing future research directions in the prospect of eutrophication based ecological modelling several essential observations were made during the review process which are highlighted as follows the number of published works are seen to have an increasing trend especially at the dawn of the 21st century thereby confirming the ever growing demand and necessities of reliable and effective models the most productive and influential journals in the research domain include ecological modelling science of the total environment ecological indicators ecology letters global change biology and marine pollution bulletin the co occurrence analysis of author keywords resulted in seven independent clusters based on their relative closeness further investigation also resulted in keywords having strong inter cluster bonds as well the co author analyses provided information related to the most influential and productive authors in the domain of eutrophication based ecological models arhonditsis g b was found to be the most effective while reckhow k h was the most influential articles receiving the highest number of citations and normalized citation scores were discussed for their impacts in the research domain finally the countries active in the research were identified it was observed that the research was primarily concentrated to mainly developed nations such as the united states china and european nations whereas developing and lesser developed countries are still in their preliminary stages of developing reliable and efficient models post scientometric analyses the primary focus was to identify the main research gaps by studying the existing literature works that will pave the way for plausible future directions it was found that there is a need for mutual collaboration amongst researchers worldwide to formulate and develop models that genuinely represent real life problems this will provide opportunities for researchers in developing nations to become active in this domain of research additionally testing the models reliability and correctness must be checked thoroughly by adapting mathematical tools such as sensitivity analyses regression analyses and machine learning approaches finally the quest to develop better models is far from over as all models developed enjoy certain limitations regarding various assumptions considered during the conceptualization stage and suffer from being limited to a specific site hence there will always remain scope for improvement in developing better and robust models the work reported in the present study is limited to the sample literature extracted from a reliable source also certain filters were applied to the dataset before the reviewing process such as only journal publications were considered english as a medium of communication there may be ambiguities with the current review process considering that other search engines might provide slightly different results with the keywords used for the bibliographic review however in a broader prospect the current review process would give a fair idea to all the researchers current or aspiring in the domain regarding the present research scenario which would thus prove beneficial in providing necessary directions in eutrophication based ecological modelling funding sources this research did not receive any specific

24364,the present study provides a scientific investigation of a detailed review of the published works in the domain of eutrophication based ecological modelling till the year 2020 a total of 399 articles were extracted for final analyses which were subjected to a three step hierarchical procedure bibliographic examination scientometric investigation and qualitative assessment the bibliographic test filtered 320 samples based on which the article samples were subjected to several scientometric analyses such as identifying the most influential and productive journals researchers articles and countries keyword analysis revealed the most frequently used keywords in the research domain and amongst scholars around the world the scientometric studies were followed by a qualitative assessment wherein the current trends in research were discussed this was followed by identifying the critical gaps in research to provide future direction thus this research offers a more comprehensive and holistic approach towards the critical review of the published literature thereby providing essential insights to the researchers regarding the existing practices of developing eutrophication based ecological models and the future prospects lying ahead keywords eutrophication ecological modelling sustainability eutrophication model scientometrics data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the rise in the global population has led to numerous anthropogenic interventions to aquatic ecosystems some of the significant sources elevating the levels of aquatic contaminations include domestic wastewater runoff the domestic wastewater comprises blackwater excreta urine and faecal sludge and greywater kitchen and bathroom wastewater the quality of the domestic wastewater relies on several factors such as the quality of water supplied sanitation facilities water use practices levels of treatments provided prior to discharge into the mainstream water bodies and social norms tjandraatmadja and diaper 2006 when these domestic waters interact with different components of the natural aquatic ecosystems it leads to a large scale deterioration of the water bodies through degradation of water quality damage to biodiversity or modification in climatic settings this also undergoes a change in social impact steering to loss of livelihood and abandonment of traditions and culture urban drainage and stormwater flows the surface water runoff and stormwater flowing through the open drainage systems of the towns and cities brings about equal if not more detrimental effects to the water bodies their outlets lead to as the domestic water if not properly managed industrial wastewater industrial wastewater can be classified as diffused industrial discharges from mining and agro based industries and end of pipe point discharges the former is highly polluting and thus becomes difficult to contain and treat rule et al 2006 in contrast the latter can be managed controlled and treated in the circumstances with sufficient political will regulatory power and resources economic and human capacity to ensure compliance however when these discharges reach the water bodies untreated they inflict considerable environmental damage especially to sensitive ecosystems they also often come into direct and indirect contact with humans and animals resulting in consequential damage to health agricultural wastewater agriculture has long been recognized as an essential non point or source of diffused water pollution agricultural wastewater aggravates worsens siltation problems and increases flood risk jeong and adamowski 2016 this wastewater is also rich in nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus applied to the farmland to increase crop production when they reach the aquatic bodies these nutrients assist in the swift growth of floras and result in eutrophication together with nutrients agricultural wastewater contains microbes originating from livestock or excreta used as fertilizers the aquatic bodies also get contaminated from agricultural wastewater because of pesticides herbicides and other agrochemicals used during farming these pollutants eventually enter the food chain and possess a significant influence at different trophic levels all the major pollutants discussed above relate to the alteration in the aquatic ecology for primarily two reasons a excessive heavy metal concentrations and b excessive nutrients when water bodies receive surplus nutrients especially nitrates and phosphates these nutrients stimulate excessive plant growth eutrophication including harmful algal blooms leading to oxygen depletion decreased biodiversity changes in species composition and dominance and degradation of water quality although there are natural causes much of the eutrophication today results from inadequately treated wastewater and agricultural runoffs the deterioration in water quality due to eutrophication is estimated to have already caused around one third reduction in biodiversity in rivers lakes and wetlands globally maltby and barker 2009 population pressure urbanization and industrialization contribute a considerable amount of waste which alter the physio chemical quality of water that eventually upset the biotic components of the aquatic system it is important to note that though pollution has been a significant factor in degrading the quality of aquatic ecosystems the lack of management and global awareness regarding the protection and conservation of water bodies worldwide cannot be neglected hence there lies an inherent sense of responsibility to restore the aquatic ecosystems to their natural state numerous techniques treatment options are available for varying conditions such as climatic factors socio economic factors and so on however before ascertaining a treatment alternative to curb eutrophication levels understanding the dynamics of any independent aquatic ecosystem is of prime importance this necessitates a reliable model which can provide information regarding the physical processes and dynamic occurrences in the eutrophic water bodies models can be termed as an abstract representation of reality bala et al 2017 it presents a part of the reality that and describes the dynamic conduct of a system the level of complexity can widely vary during the modelling process it can be a simple physical representation such as a map or a highly complicated series of mathematical expressions such as a detailed description of the nitrogen cycle in the ecosystem broadly the modelling process involves a series of steps taken to transform the theoretical concepts of conceptual diagrams into a quantitative paradigm mathematical models are primarily of two types abstract models and physical models brailsford and hilton 2001 the physical models are either static or dynamic depending on the time varying characteristics of the system i e if the model undergoes transient or steady state changes with respect to time it is called as a dynamic model on the other hand static models do not undergo substantial changes in their properties with time mathematical models are usually solved using numerical methods however complex systems possess significant challenge in obtaining the numerical solutions to the real world problems in such a case obtaining solutions through step by step procedures is feasible this process is called as simulation fortmann roe 2014 computer simulations have paved way for attaining solutions to the real world complex problems in a much faster and efficient manner than what was earlier possible these simulations can be discrete or dynamic in case of a discrete event simulation each parameter has its own characteristics and the objects in the system are distinct individuals the characteristics of the individual entities determine what happens to that individual in the system from probability distributions however in case of system dynamic simulations the model views all the entities as a single system and the state changes are considered as continuous numerical integration techniques are primarily employed to solve the differential equations framed in system dynamic simulations in other words the discrete simulations are probabilistic whereas system dynamic simulations are deterministic brailsford and hilton 2001 ecological modelling refers to the formation of dynamic and complex relationships of the organisms found in the ecosystem and the surrounding it attempts to unravel the effects of certain relationships in the ecosystem that are not so apparent at first glance in other words it helps the modeller to identify the concealed implications breckling et al 2011 this provides the modeller new insights into the ecosystem that were unobtainable with direct observation their evaluation and interpretation an ecological model usually contains five components jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 forcing functions forcing functions can be described as the inputs to the model that may change its behaviour upon feeding to the model these are also called controlled functions due to their susceptibility to human interference and hence plausible human control for example the forcing function for a eutrophication model is the discharge of nutrients into the ecosystem state variables state variables refer to those components of the model whose behaviour are being modelled it is best understood with an example of a eutrophication model here the state variables are the concentrations of various nutrients and phytoplankton as the forcing functions of the model change the concentration of nutrients and the phytoplankton population also change mathematical equations mathematical equations describe various biological chemical and physical processes that link the forcing functions to the state variables many equations are suitable for particular functions available in the literature jackson et al 2000 some mathematical can also be derived from the first principles i e physical laws parameters parameters are the coefficients of the mathematical equations used in the model these may be considered constant or a function of time and space the application of parameters is the weakest link in the model jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 they are estimated by using the data from the literature or by an iterative method in such a way that the calculated value is close enough to the observed value even when the parameter s value is provided in the literature they are usually delivered within a range hence there is a need to adjust the value of the same parameter for different models this process of adjusting the parameter value is called calibration calibration can be done systematically or by trial and error method usually the least square method and the maximum likelihood estimation are used to determine the degree of fitness of the estimated parameter value maximum likelihood estimations are suitable for nonlinear parameters jackson et al 2000 universal constants universal constants such as ideal gas constant and atomic weights are also sometimes used in the model a generalized flowchart portraying the ecological modelling process was given by jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 fig 1 the first step involved in the modelling process is the determination of the purpose of the model this consists of the description of the problem and the system for which the model is being developed this step is followed by creating the adjacency matrix which describes the interdependence of the various state variables to be used in the model subsequently the conceptual diagram is designed a conceptual diagram is a compact visual statement of the research problem jackson et al 2000 it describes the relationship between the various state variables of the model using boxes and arrows ideally the dataset needed for the development of the model is determined after developing the conceptual diagram however in practice most models are developed after collecting data to compromise the model scope and the available data sometimes additional information is collected at later stages of the modelling process to strengthen the model once the data collection and conceptual diagram development are concluded the modeller proceeds towards the mathematical formulation of the processes involved in the model subsequently the model is programmed into a computer and the internal logic of the model is verified following this the sensitivity analysis calibration and validation of the models are carried out sensitivity analysis of the model refers to determining which parameters forcing functions or sub models are sensitive and to what degree to the state variables jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 validation refers to the test of the model s behaviour when exposed to an independent set of data the history of ecological modelling dates back to the 1920s when the streeter phelps model was developed and since then ecological modelling has come a long way in its journey during the 1960s and 1970s the confluence of improved computing technologies scientific approaches application needs and available funding boosted its growth tremendously fath et al 2011 the eutrophication models were mainly developed during the 1970s as water quality became a critical environmental issue different models with different levels of complexity were developed which were further improved upon application in various case studies fath et al 2011 since the 1980s enough eutrophication models have been developed to model any lake with an available set of data jørgensen 2010 however the quest for an improved ecological model is far from over and many new eutrophication models have been developed over the course of time bibliographic research provides a comprehensive understanding of the past and existing approaches to a particular research domain this paves the way for a better understanding of the limitations and thereby identifies critical research gaps which will pave the way for better scientific innovations therefore a more systematic review of the published literature is essential rather than the traditional approach which may be highly subjective this can be achieved through the mapping of scholarly articles through a broad research domain the scientometric analyses of the bibliographies provide excellent visualizations of the results through interactive plots and graphical analytical tools emphasizing essential patterns trends and notions of global scientific change chen 2017 the novelty in the present study lies in a applying the science mapping technique in the domain of eutrophication based ecological modelling that will minimalize the subjectivity and prejudgment in reviewing of published works in the domain b analyses of the prevailing conventional areas related to eutrophication based ecological modelling c a qualitative examination explicitly pointing out the boundaries and gaps in the present literature thus making it more comprehensive and finally d proposal of a research structure which will pave the way for future research works on developing eutrophic models the rest of this article has been designed as follows section 2 demonstrates an all inclusive assessment method integrating science mapping and a qualitative argument section 3 describes the results and preliminary outcomes of the science mapping approach section 4 covers discussions on the current research themes gaps and developments in the domain of eutrophication based modelling techniques and finally section 5 provides critical concluding remarks to this review based investigation 2 methodology the bibliographic research in the current study is divided into three stages as depicted in fig 2 stage 1 comprises the literature search through relevant keywords screening and analyses of the articles within the scope this is followed by a scientometric analysis and finally the qualitative assessment 2 1 bibliographic search the bibliographic search for the systematic review process involved using the prisma preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analysis framework this technique uses four distinct levels of analysis i e a identification b screening c eligibility and d inclusion criteria the detailed framework of the methodology has been represented in fig 2 the first step employed identifying critical keywords in the research domain and entering the keywords in a reliable search engine to extract records in the present study scopus is considered the search engine for its broader spectrum of use by different academicians and researchers around the globe also scopus is deemed to contain a more comprehensive range of journals and more recently published works than other search engines such as web of science google scholar pubmed etc the keywords entered are as follows title abs key ecological model or title abs key ecological modelling and title abs key eutrophication an aggregate of 399 published documents was initially extracted from the search which was then considered for the second step of the analysis i e the screening process all articles were then screened using different inclusion exclusion criteria firstly only the journal articles are considered for the bibliographic analysis whilst the conference papers or book chapters have been excluded this is because articles are believed to provide more substantial information regarding a particular domain than other publications secondly the articles to be published in 2021 were excluded as the year 2021 has just begun thirdly the articles published in the english language have been considered for the study after the screening process the eligibility criteria were verified using quality assessment the duplicity of the articles identification of the articles out of scope and irrelevant articles were taken care of finally the use of boolean operators such as and or or for the search of articles was included by using a single word or a combination of words a total of 320 articles were finally chosen for the bibliographic analysis in the domain of eutrophication based ecological modelling 2 2 scientometric analyses the scientometric analysis becomes the second stage of the review process wherein a data mining tool named vosviewer was employed to visualize different bibliometric networks the nodal densities and distances determine the relative closeness between any parameter of analysis the tool also possesses several unique aspects of data mining the details of which may be obtained from hosseini et al 2018 the present study employs vosviewer to satisfy three objectives a loading the downloaded literature samples b computation analyses and visualization of the effects of different journals scholars and countries actively involved in the domain of eutrophic ecological modelling and finally c understanding the distribution of keywords used in the published works of literature and their correlations in the research domain 2 3 qualitative assessment post quantitative analyses the qualitative discussion considers the detailed examinations of the existing research approaches to developing eutrophic models this is followed by identifying the research gaps and thereby proposing directions to future research perspectives in the domain of ecological modelling 3 results of the scientometric analyses 3 1 an overview of the literature sample the 320 published articles have spread across a broad time scale ranging from 1976 to 2020 fig 3 however it was observed that 90 of the articles have been published at the onset of the 21st century i e from the year 2000 288 320 papers have been published furthermore the trend of research in the current domain has steadily increased as the years progressed the year 2019 having the highest number of published articles this is indicative of the relevance of the research in the domain of eutrophic based models with this trend it is expected that more articles will come into circulation owing to the development of more sophisticated computational methodologies also the growing problem of eutrophication in surface water bodies and a wide range of research scope has triggered researchers across the globe to carry out research in this domain insert fig 3 3 2 science mapping of journal sources all 320 articles published were sourced from 116 journals however only 21 journals had at least three articles and 30 citations the networking of the journal sources meeting the threshold criteria was acquired through mapping in vosviewer the nodal and font sizes represented the number of published works from a specific journal fig 4 each node is divided into different clusters and is inter connected through connecting lines indicating the relative closeness amongst the journals with respect to mutual citations this is because citations are believed to be the most imperative way of judging the significance of research van eck and waltman 2014 the results showed that ecological modelling displayed the highest productivity providing the maximum number of published works in the eutrophic based ecological modelling research domain a more detailed analysis of the journal sources has been reported in table 1 only four journals have more than ten published works namely ecological modelling hydrobiologia journal of marine systems and science of the total environment these journals were also found to have a large number of citations thus indicating their high productivity and significance in the research domain the total number of articles citations and normalized citations were sourced from the records average citations and average normalized citations measured as the ratio of the total number of citations and normalized citations to the total number of articles from a particular journal respectively were measured these values provided information regarding the most influential journals amongst the lot this is because the average normalized citations offer a more comprehensive idea regarding the relative research significance than the number of articles published on this criterion it was observed that ecology letters global change biology and marine pollution bulletin held significant impacts in the research domain having average normalized citation scores of more than 1 50 however these journals do not have a considerable number of published articles under them 3 3 analysis of co occurrence of keywords keywords form a significant part of research as they provide an idea regarding the topics covered in any domain a network of keywords thus provides a holistic notion about the relative closeness and their associated inter relationships as per the recommendations by oraee et al 2017 and hosseini et al 2018 author keywords and fractional counting approach were employed in vosviewer a minimum number of 5 occurrences was set as the critical limit which provided a total of 31 out of 1061 registered keywords these 31 keywords were further subjected to screening wherein the repetitive keywords were filtered out finally a total of 27 keywords were subjected to analysis the results of which are shown in table 2 and fig 5 fig 5a shows the network of all 27 keywords used for the analysis it was seen that these keywords were classified into seven different clusters depending upon their inter relative closeness keywords in cluster 1 represented by the red colour suggest that studies primarily focused on coastal eutrophic models taking climate change into account water quality parameters especially nutrients were considered for modelling the water frame directives since most of the studies carried out fell under the seawater or oceanic eutrophication levels it also considers the hypoxic condition which is a state where the human body suffers from inadequate oxygen levels in the body keywords falling under cluster 2 denoted by green suggest that the studies focused on lakes and wetlands considering their hydrological simulations the prime focus was to restore the water bodies to their natural states through watershed management techniques keywords forming cluster 3 denoted by blue colour are suggestive of the studies limiting to eutrophication of macrophytes thereby indicating a regime shift similarly keywords in cluster 4 denoted by the yellow colour suggest eutrophication studies limiting to algal blooms in various water bodies due to the nutrient discharges likewise the keywords in cluster 5 denoted by purple colour indicate studies on lakes polluted explicitly by nitrogen and phosphorus keywords in cluster 6 characterized by sky blue colour show studies on ecological modelling as a function of exergy i e chemical and mechanical processes occurring within an aquatic ecosystem with respect to phytoplankton finally keywords categorized under cluster 7 indicative of the orange colour show studies on ecological models on the north sea concerning diatoms furthermore the network also suggests that not only intra cluster but inter cluster keywords also possess strong linkages for example as shown in fig 5b water quality had a strong association with keywords such as eutrophication ecological model nutrients lake ecosystem model macrophytes etc a detailed analysis of the keywords predominately used in the research domain has been listed in table 2 it was observed that words like climate change water framework directive simulation and exergy are being used lately which shows a gradual shift in the process of framing models i e shift from the development of traditional models to more complex and sophisticated models approximating real life conditions through computer simulations 3 4 co authorship analysis mutual collaboration amongst researchers worldwide leads to better scientific approaches to any problem and keeps the researchers away from isolation hosseini et al 2018 hence keeping this in mind the present study considered reviewing the co authorship details in the domain of eutrophication based ecological modelling authors having published at least three documents and having a minimum of 30 citations were considered for the analysis this resulted in 42 out of a total of 1211 authors the details of which are provided in fig 6 and table 3 from fig 6 it is evident that all the researchers are highly collaborative which is indicated by the strong density of the connectors also the authors are classified into five distinct clusters based on their relative closeness in research areas cluster 1 had the maximum number of authors listed under it followed by cluster 2 and so on furthermore from table 3 it was found that arhonditsis g b university of toronto jørgensen s e dfh institute a denmark lancelot c université libre de bruxelles brussels belgium billen g university pierre et marie curie garnier j umr cnrs 7619 sisyphe gypens n université libre de bruxelles brussels belgium lacroix g royal belgian institute for natural sciences rbins and scavia d university of michigan were amongst the most productive researchers having more than five research articles published under their name all these authors also had a considerable number of citations which depicts the magnitude of their research however when it comes to the average normalized citations billen g university pierre et marie curie garnier j umr cnrs 7619 sisyphe and reckhow k h duke university hold the maximum impact with the normalized citation scores of more than 2 00 3 5 articles citations citations in any research article increase its reliability and impact on a research domain it is thus essential to identify highly influential journals in the research domain to identify the appropriate methodologies and techniques employed during the research therefore a minimum of 50 citations for each research article was set in vosviewer which resulted in 66 articles out of a total of 320 meeting this criterion mapping of these 66 articles was carried out as shown in fig 7 it is clearly evident that articles borsuk et al 2004 guttal and jayaprakash 2008 jöhnk et al 2008 seitzinger et al 2010 siegel et al 2002 tyrrell 1999 were the most influential having the maximum number of citations also all the articles were observed to have considerable mutual citations which is evident from the connecting lines further detailed analysis concerning the normalized citation scores is presented in table 4 clearly showing consistent results with the mapping outputs based on the results extracted from scopus with relation to the normalized citation scores it was observed that seitzinger et al 2010 tyrrell 1999 and jöhnk et al 2008 possess the strongest influence owing to their very high normalized citations more than 5 00 it was also seen that newer articles displayed significantly higher normalized citations than the older counterparts thus suggesting the effectiveness and the impact of the more recent articles in the research domain this is attributed to adapting the latest computational methodologies and sophisticated programming languages over the traditional methods 3 6 countries active in the research domain of ecological modelling a minimum of 3 articles and 30 citations from each country were considered to analyse the countries actively participating in ecological modelling the results were subjected to mapping in vosviewer shown in fig 8 it was observed that the most actively participating countries are primarily those countries that are highly developed for example the united states denmark china netherlands france germany and the united kingdom whereas the developing or less developed countries have insignificant contributions it was also observed that all countries involved have excellent mutual collaborations which is evident from the density of the connecting lines furthermore these countries have been categorized into six clusters depending on their research fig 8b g cluster 2 primarily comprises the countries having the highest productivity in the current research domain a more detailed representation of the extracted data on the active countries in the research domain is represented in table 5 it was found that although the united states contribution in the research on eutrophication based ecological modelling is the most significant the average normalized citation score of the united kingdom is the highest depicting a considerable impact of the investigations carried out in the country the uk is followed by switzerland bulgaria netherlands united states south korea and germany having scores of more than 1 20 it is also important to note that only four asian countries china japan india and south korea make up the list out of the 32 countries analysed while the majority of the contributions have been from the european and american countries this indicates the massive gap in the research on ecological modelling in asian countries compared to others 4 qualitative assessment the scientometric analyses were followed by a qualitative discussion on the existing research conducted across the world in the domain of eutrophication based ecological modelling this helped identify critical research gaps eventually developing a research framework for possible future directives 4 1 current research topics within eutrophication based ecological modelling a modelling software usually aids the development of an ecological model but the level of dependence on the modelling software depends on the comfort of the modeller jackson et al 2000 there is a broad spectrum of modelling software available to the modeller on one end of the spectrum there are general programming languages such as c basic fortran pascal etc which give the user complete freedom over the model construction and total responsibility of handling all the tedious details at the other end of the spectrum user friendly modelling software with attractive graphical interfaces such as stella simulink modelmaker etc give users freedom from handling the underlying implementation details but having limitations over model construction between these two extremities lies several programming packages such as matlab and spreadsheets which provide different functions to ease the user from handling programming details while at the same time allowing some control to the modeller different ecological models can be broadly categorized into two groups white box and black box models jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 the white box model is one in which the causality of the input output relation is known on the other hand a black box model has no explanation for why a particular model behaves in a specific manner for a given input in practice most models can be described as grey models as they are a combination of both white and black box models jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 further made another classification of the ecological models based on their application given in the following list biogeochemical and bioenergetics dynamic models the biogeochemical and bioenergetics dynamic models are primarily white box models which apply mass and energy conservation principles to develop the differential equation these models are easy to understand interpret and develop but a relatively good database is required and becomes challenging to calibrate when many parameters are involved in the model eutrophication models are a type of biogeochemical model steady state biogeochemical models the steady state biogeochemical models are used when the database for model construction is small still these models fail to give any information about the ecosystem s behaviour with change in time population dynamic models the population dynamic models are one of the most popular ecological models which can predict the development of a population with time incorporating the age structure and impact factors however there is a requirement for a relatively good and homogenous database structurally dynamic models the structurally dynamic models allow modellers to incorporate dynamic parameters considering the adaptation factor of different species and shift in the species composition however there is a need for goal function or artificial intelligence for this model to work correctly making this model time consuming fuzzy models as the name suggests the fuzzy models are applicable to the fuzzy dataset and semi quantitative information linguistic formulation these models are not suitable for complex model formulation artificial neural networks artificial neural networks can be described as black box models which requires a sizeable heterogeneous dataset from different ecosystems or a homogenous dataset from a specific ecosystem to represent the relationship between the model s state variables and forcing functions spatial models the spatial models are those models that show the spatial distribution of different processes forcing functions and state variables gis can be used to describe those models individual based models the individual based models consider the uniqueness of the different individuals within a species which though disregarded in biogeochemical models may be vital for the survival of that species these models can be very complex ecotoxicological models ecotoxicological models are basically biogeochemical or population dynamic models that are being applied to ecotoxicology these models earn a particular place in classification due to limited knowledge of ecotoxicological parameters and the use of safety factors stochastic models stochastic models incorporate randomness either in forcing functions or model parameters a stochastic model can be any of the previously described models with randomness factored in it hybrid models hybrid models are a combination of any two previously described models such models bring the dual advantage of coupling the benefits and minimizing the disadvantages of the parent models one example of the hybrid model is the outcome of combining a biogeochemical dynamic model and an ann model in the following part of this section some of the developments in ecological modelling especially in eutrophication modelling since the 1980s are discussed scavia 1980 developed an ecological model consisting of epilimnion hypolimnion and sediments of lake ontario that simulates various state variables such as phytoplankton zooplankton different forms of nitrogen phosphorus silicon carbon dissolved oxygen particulate sediment and pore water dynamics this ecological model illustrated the significance of detritus and herbivorous zooplankton in lake ontario and thereby served as an analytical tool for the large ecosystem of lake ontario matsuoka et al 1986 developed a mathematical model to predict the fate of nutrients amongst four levels with fourteen state variables in each segment for japan s largest shallow lake kasumigaura which was suffering from the problem of artificial eutrophication caused by urbanization agricultural growth and fishing culture these state variables included phytoplankton zooplankton fish crustacean external nutrients and fresh sediments one of the highlights of this eutrophication model is that while calibrating the model most of the parameter values were based on the in situ measurements and batch culture experiments using strains from the lake this model was applied as a predictive device to get the nature of water quality in the future dejak et al 1987 integrated a two dimensional diffusion model with a two dimensional advection model for the lagoon of venice to develop a three dimensional model capable of simulating the dispersion of eight state variables phytoplankton zooplankton ammonia nitrites and nitrates degradable organic compounds and temperature the three dimensional eutrophication model can estimate the eddy diffusion constant that incorporates the dispersion action of the tide lake taihu is amongst the five largest freshwater lakes in china that have been severely affected by eutrophication since the 1980s different models have been developed to study this lake such as hydrodynamic models mass transportation and cycling models and ecological models the first ecological model was developed by dou et al 1995 to link the hydrodynamic aspects of the lake to chemical and biological processes occurring in the lake the entire lake was divided into thirty sub zones and various sub models were developed for each sub zone in 1999 hu created another model for eutrophication in lake taihu it was one of the earliest versions of what is currently known as the ecotaihu model hu 2016 this three dimensional model was developed by combining another three dimensional hydrodynamic model hu et al 1998b weiping et al 1998 a model describing the impacts of water hyacinth on the water quality of lake taihu hu et al 1998c and a model based on a physio biological engineering experiment for water purification using trapa natans var bispinosa hu et al 1998a this model was further developed by incorporating the carbon cycle that allowed the depiction of ph in the lake and revealed that the lake acted either as a sink or as a source at different times weiping et al 2011 zhang et al 2008 in 2010 another improvement was incorporated into the ecotaihu model by redefining the sub model for fish this improved model revealed that by introducing the fish into the lake the production of the released fish could increase and change the population structure in the lake this model also revealed that by releasing certain fish species the nature of the lake could also be altered for example if the ctenopharygodon idellus was released it could temporarily curb the fast growing macrophyte population on the other hand if the grass carp were cast into the lake it bolstered the phytoplankton and algae population zhang et al 2013 further improved the ecotaihu model by incorporating an additional layer of algae to explain the movement and disappearance of the mat like algal bloom on water s surface under weak and robust winds respectively karul et al 2000 developed a three layered levenberg marquardt feed forward learning algorithm to develop eutrophication models for three water bodies of turkey keban dam mogan and eymir lakes to develop neural networks the eutrophication phenomenon was converted into an input output problem and data for the input layer was collected through an extensive six year field monitoring program the input parameters for the keban dam were phosphate nitrate alkalinity suspended solids ph and water temperature electrical conductivity dissolved oxygen and secchi depth for the mogan and eymir lakes the input parameters considered by the authors were total phosphorus nitrate and ammonia the temperature in water electrical conductivity ph turbidity secchi depth and suspended solids suspended solids turbidity and secchi depths were considered in the neural network to simulate the role of light in the euphotic zones chlorophyll a was selected as the primary target output for the network additionally three typical indicators of eutrophication cyanophyceae species aphanizomenon sp microcystis sp and oscillatoria sp were used as target outputs the results from the so developed eutrophication models revealed a relatively good correlation between calculated and measured values for keban dam and a high correlation between the same for the much smaller and more homogenous mogan and eymir lakes drago et al 2001 used a three dimensional model trophy3d to analyse the advection and diffusion of suspended solids and conservative pollutants in the ambient water and their effect on trophic behaviour the trophy3d model used a finite difference method for spatial integration and a runge kutta iv or euler method for temporal integration of the differential equations used in the model the model was also able to predict the biochemical interactions between detritus phytoplankton nutrients zooplankton and dissolved oxygen rukhovets et al 2003 developed a new three dimensional mathematical model for lake ladoga the largest freshwater european lake in northwestern russia to simulate phytoplankton growth the authors selected fourteen state variables in this model including different phytoplankton complexes zooplankton dissolved organic matter detritus dissolved mineral phosphorus and dissolved oxygen it is based on the ideas of phytoplankton succession in the lake given by petrova in the 1980s rukhovets et al 2003 prior to this model menshutkin and vorobjeva 1989 successfully created a one box model for eight different groups of phytoplankton communities in the volkhov bay this model incorporated the lake s temperature conditions and the nutrient supply but it failed to consider that the zooplankton and fish eat phytoplankton moreover the modellers assumed that the instantaneous mixing of the nutrients in the lake the new three dimensional model improved the works done by menshutkin et al 1998 with a more detailed description of the phytoplankton community zhang et al 2003 also developed a structurally dynamic eutrophication model for lake mogan ankara turkey which described the competition between phytoplankton and submerged plants in the lake in this model energy was used as a goal function to develop plankton species dynamic adaptation and seasonality malmaeus and håkanson 2004 developed an extensive dynamic model to predict the phosphorus concentration and the consequences of eutrophication on the lake ecosystem the model is called lake eutrophication effect dose sensitivity model leeds it was developed with easily accessible lake variables the leeds model was novel in many ways it incorporated two levels for colloidal phosphorus a seasonal factor for lake outflow higher settling velocity for re suspended material a new algorithm to model the mixing between deep water and surface water and phosphorus diffusion from sediment accumulation areas trolle et al 2008 used the one dimensional lake ecosystem model dyresm caed to know the effect of total phosphorus loading reduction on the ecosystem dynamics of moderately deep lake ravn denmark the model was calibrated with the observed data for oxygen and temperature for a period of seven years and then validated for another period of five years when put to use the dyresm caed predicted that a significant reduction in total phosphorus is needed to meet the phytoplankton biomass concentration as per the european union water framework directive wfd for cultural eutrophication assessment mukherjee et al 2008 developed a model representing the carbon dynamics in a simulated pond in ranchi india the model mainly included processes such as respiration decomposition and photosynthesis that play an essential role in the nutrient dynamics of the system in eutrophication models it is usually challenging to model the carbon cycle in detail still this model successfully shows nutrients dependence on an accurate and detailed description of the carbon cycle taguchi and nakata 2009 developed a numerical model that highlighted the role of macrophyte colonies in the shore zone in water purification the model was applied to lake suwa lake kasumi lake biwa and some small lakes attached to lake biwa the model included interactions between the compartments of pelagic and benthic regions meteorological and hydrodynamic conditions were considered amongst the forcing functions the model outcomes were reported to agree with the observed values obtained from the water quality monitoring campaign he et al 2011 developed a numerical model based on the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc for beijing gaunting reservoir three state variables for phytoplankton species cyanobacteria green algae and diatom were considered for the model and vertical temperature profiles chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations in the water column were used during model calibration the developed model was used as an investigative tool which revealed that the peak chlorophyll a could be reduced by reducing external loadings of nutrients with constructed wetlands biomanipulation or diverting water from the cetian reservoir however one of the significant shortcomings of this model is that it was calibrated with only one year of data therefore it was capable of reflecting only the short term effects of applying management scenarios xu et al 2013 developed a structurally dynamic model based on the software pamolare ii for the baiyangdian lake in north china pamolare planning and management of lakes and reservoirs is a modelling software developed by the international environmental technology centre of unep ietc unep and international lake environment committee ilec which offers four eutrophication models with different complexity levels the first model is the vollenweider plot with one state variable of phosphorus or nitrogen loading in g m2 year the second model contains four state variables the state variables are nitrogen and phosphorus in water and sediments several correlations were also provided to calculate other state variables the third model is more complicated than the previous two models providing a two layer model with 21 state variables the fourth model is an improvement of the third model with the application of a structurally dynamic approach pamolare ii is the next version of the pamolare software which provides structurally dynamic models focusing on shallow lakes for eutrophication lake management the baiyangdian lake model was developed by xu et al 2013 to predict the ecological health condition of the lake under different scenarios of submerged plant removal from the lake the ecological health conditions were indicated by phytoplankton biomass the ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass eco exergy and structural eco exergy the conceptual diagram of the baiyangdian lake model included 12 state variables correlated by 45 processes zouiten et al 2013 developed a mathematical eutrophication model called environmental hydraulics institute eutrophication model envhydrem especially for coastal regions which considered 19 state variables including phytoplankton different forms of carbon nitrogen phosphorus and silica carbonaceous organic matter zooplankton bacterioplankton detritus iron and manganese the envhydrem described all the possible interactions between the defined state variables by considering all the biological and chemical processes involved in the ecosystem it was further applied in the victoria lagoon in northern spain to gauge its efficiency magnea et al 2013 developed a simplified mathematical model to describe the phosphorus phytoplankton zooplankton and fish dynamics in the alpine lake ecosystems the model was developed to study the scenario when brook trout salvelinus frontinalis were introduced artificially in the lake ecosystems the model so developed was used to explore twelve alpine lakes in gran paradisonational park italy xu et al 2014 developed a simple yet effective eutrophication model using parameters based on both literature survey and experimental investigation which incorporated bioaccumulation and algal growth for eutrophication in xikeng reservoir shenzhen city china the authors combined the cumulative effects of meteorological water quality and biological factors on eutrophication to develop an incremental eutrophication risk evaluation model this model highlights that a large set of parameters and experiments to simulate the eutrophication process is not a prerequisite for its functioning prokopkin et al 2014 also developed an investigative mathematical model to confirm the presence of a phytoflagellate population in the stratified lake shira khakasia in russia by considering the microbial dynamics and phytoflagellate relationship with the trophic levels of the lake the outcome of such a model was that it confirmed the abundant presence of cryptographic algae in the water column above the chemocline in the summer season this 1 dimensional model is a perfect example of how modelling can be used to corroborate the presence of certain species in the ecosystem which otherwise has indirect evidence of existence li kun et al 2017 developed a two dimensional eutrophication model for an urban lake in the tianjin region to describe the spatiotemporal variation of water quality and establish relationships between phytoplankton zooplankton and nutrients navier stokes equations and finite volume method were used to define the hydraulic model and the bayesian approach was employed for model calibration and parameter posterior distribution acquisition the model simulated five state variables that included phosphate nitrate ammonia chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen the calculations from the two dimensional model revealed higher values for the state variables in the regions closer to the lake periphery than at the centre indicating the significant role of nutrient loading of rainfall runoff on algal growth and water quality thus the 2 dimensional model provided crucial information that can result in an effective management strategy to counter severe eutrophication in the urban lakes mccullough et al 2018 developed a relatively simple dynamic mass balanced model incorporating five state variables of different forms of organic carbon and dissolved oxygen to investigate the dominance of allochthonous organic carbon in the organic carbon dynamics of a lake in the long run the model so developed was validated in five different lakes in the u s a and canada mccullough et al 2018 also used the model to predict the seasonal variation in the organic carbon budgets das et al 2018 developed a mathematical model to simulate the phytoplankton distribution and nutrient cycle along the river jagaddal an easterly branch of the saptamukhi east gulley of the saptamukhi river in sundarbans estuarine system india the author designed their model based on the compartmental ecosystem model developed by fasham et al 1990 their model considered phytoplankton and nitrate in the water column as two state variables the differential equations for these state variables were based on haney and jackson 1996 the authors further carried out sensitivity analysis of their model based on a variance based sensitivity analysis method through sensitivity analysis they were able to understand the crucial parameter of the model and in turn predict the underlying ecological process involved for such an influence the model equations were integrated using the fourth order runge kutta algorithm which the c programming language implemented the sensitivity analysis was carried out in matlab without a single strand of doubt it has been established that wetlands are irreplaceable elements of nature necessary to maintain the much needed ecological stability in the world thereby rightfully earning the title of ecological hotspot the biodiversity in the wetlands is astounding and never ceases to baffle humankind with its expanse to compound its usefulness wetlands also act as filters storage reservoirs and sediment tanks to provide purer water to surface water and groundwater sources however all wetlands worldwide are currently under significant threat due to pollution from various sources requiring an immediate call for their protection however all such efforts for protection can lead to futile outcomes if the nature of the wetlands and the role of different biotic and abiotic components present therein are not adequately understood this solicits the application of ecological models that can be crudely described as representing a particular individual idea or condition there are different types of models suited for different ecological conditions and since the 1920s rapid progress has been made in the field of ecological modelling various researchers have applied ecological models with varying degrees of complexity depending on the nature of the problem available datasets for calibration and validation and skillset of the researchers a study of different ecological models developed across the world has provided exciting insights into the process of ecological modelling along with the extent to which ecological models can be utilized effectively many researchers have used ecological models as investigative tools to understand the behaviour of different state variables in the ecosystem in some cases they have successfully unearthed hidden interactions in the ecosystem that were otherwise just speculations amongst the observers the ecological models have also proved to be excellent predictive tools assisting in answering different what if situations relating to the wetlands thereby augmenting the decision making process to take more effective and powerful steps in wetland management 4 2 current research gaps in the domain and a way forward while many works have been done on ecological modelling the quest for better ecological models is far from over most ecological models have site specific limitations and hence a completely robust generalized ecological model is yet to be developed however creating such a model will be an arduous task until such a model is developed ecological modellers have to compromise with site specific models and continue to develop models for different wetlands separately the need to create an ecological model becomes far more urgent if it is currently endangered it has been observed that most ecological models developed have revolved around the more developed nations while the lesser developed or developing nations are still in the dormant stage in this research domain this may be attributed to technological advancements in computational facilities that these countries lack nevertheless the lack of studies does not mean that the problem of eutrophic water bodies is of no concern in these countries instead there exist significant shreds of evidence of vanishing water bodies as well as ecologies in these countries therefore a collaborative research approach is a way forward if proper governing measures need to be undertaken to conserve natural systems and restore them to their near original state the models developed by modellers are seldom assessed for their performance and reliability only a handful of modellers have successfully proposed measures of evaluating the correctness of the model which will solve real life problems for example the use of artificial neural networks regression analyses and machine learning approaches however the most effective tool that needs attention to all modellers is sensitivity techniques wherein the sensitivity indices of all parameters can be computed this in turn will aid in addressing the reliability and correctness of the models finally with the advancements in the programming world and sophisticated languages and software development it becomes essential that the modellers adapt to the changes and keep updated also mutual collaboration amongst scholars worldwide will help initiate novel ideas and scientific techniques based on their perception which can be integrated into a single framework 5 conclusion the scientometric analyses of the literature sample considered in the current study have been divided into two distinct approaches quantitative and qualitative analysis the quantitative analysis provided information regarding the various computations carried out during the review process the qualitative analysis discussed the current research trends across the globe it thereby helped identify the critical gaps which further aided in providing future research directions in the prospect of eutrophication based ecological modelling several essential observations were made during the review process which are highlighted as follows the number of published works are seen to have an increasing trend especially at the dawn of the 21st century thereby confirming the ever growing demand and necessities of reliable and effective models the most productive and influential journals in the research domain include ecological modelling science of the total environment ecological indicators ecology letters global change biology and marine pollution bulletin the co occurrence analysis of author keywords resulted in seven independent clusters based on their relative closeness further investigation also resulted in keywords having strong inter cluster bonds as well the co author analyses provided information related to the most influential and productive authors in the domain of eutrophication based ecological models arhonditsis g b was found to be the most effective while reckhow k h was the most influential articles receiving the highest number of citations and normalized citation scores were discussed for their impacts in the research domain finally the countries active in the research were identified it was observed that the research was primarily concentrated to mainly developed nations such as the united states china and european nations whereas developing and lesser developed countries are still in their preliminary stages of developing reliable and efficient models post scientometric analyses the primary focus was to identify the main research gaps by studying the existing literature works that will pave the way for plausible future directions it was found that there is a need for mutual collaboration amongst researchers worldwide to formulate and develop models that genuinely represent real life problems this will provide opportunities for researchers in developing nations to become active in this domain of research additionally testing the models reliability and correctness must be checked thoroughly by adapting mathematical tools such as sensitivity analyses regression analyses and machine learning approaches finally the quest to develop better models is far from over as all models developed enjoy certain limitations regarding various assumptions considered during the conceptualization stage and suffer from being limited to a specific site hence there will always remain scope for improvement in developing better and robust models the work reported in the present study is limited to the sample literature extracted from a reliable source also certain filters were applied to the dataset before the reviewing process such as only journal publications were considered english as a medium of communication there may be ambiguities with the current review process considering that other search engines might provide slightly different results with the keywords used for the bibliographic review however in a broader prospect the current review process would give a fair idea to all the researchers current or aspiring in the domain regarding the present research scenario which would thus prove beneficial in providing necessary directions in eutrophication based ecological modelling funding sources this research did not receive any specific
