22955,marine forest artificial reefs mfars have been used in relatively shallow seawaters to provide light intensity and firm stable substrates for seaweeds their design should be oriented to enlarge surface areas with relatively small reef sizes and to spread spores with a productive reef placement regarding such productive placement it is necessary to investigate how seaweed spores spread out from a point consequently the water flows around mfars are important in predicting the spreading pattern and obviously estimating the corresponding wake region is essential in this study we present the wake volumes of seven mfars and associated flow characteristics such as efficiency and unit propagation indices and finally recommended better placement models optimizing the interaction between ars and the corresponding wake volumes from the demonstrations it was found that the indices were sensitive to facilitated ar modules adapted ar size and mixed use of different ar modules additionally it was demonstrated that the intervals between neighboring ars should be the major wake length of each flatly distributed placement model it was shown that the analysis procedure demonstrated and the efficiency and unit propagation indices proposed here are useful for the efficient design and management of mfars keywords marine forest artificial reefs efficiency index unit propagation index flatly distributed placement model 1 introduction the european artificial reef research network earrn defines an artificial reef as a submersed structure placed on the substratum seabed deliberately to mimic some characteristics of a natural reef jensen 1998 artificial reefs ars can be classified for multiple purposes such as increasing marine biomass enhancing environmental habitats protecting seashores and creating recreational spaces the use of artificial reefs has increased according to progression from the initial prototypes to the current ones and the materials and structural types have also diversified these materials include stones timber bamboo rubber plastics concrete steel composites and wastes baine 2001 thanks to the diversity in ar materials the structural types have become complex with various topologies covering for example steel plates and frames thus it is not easy to pinpoint representative characteristics to facilitate artificial reefs for biomass production efficiency can be defined by increased surface areas for colonization firm and stable substrates for attachment habitat diversity refuge from predators reduced energy demands created feeding areas and biomass for a food chain ambrose and swarbrick 1989 bohnsack 1989 bohnsack et al 1994 frazer and lindberg 1994 charbonnel et al 2002 falcão et al 2007 kim et al 2008 however it is not easy to quantify such efficiency mainly because of unknown ecological behaviors of marine species with regard to artificial reefs accordingly the so called attraction and production debate has continued grossman et al 1997 pickering and whitmarsh 1997 perkol finkel et al 2006 and some recommendations to resolve the debate have been proposed such as no take zones protected man made reefs and marine protected areas pitcher and seaman 2000 claudet and pelletier 2004 beal et al 2006 bortone 2011 it will take some time to conclude this debate because long term monitoring is necessary to assess the proposals considering one of the ecological interactions it is necessary to increase the wake region especially behind an artificial reef because the wake region provides an energy saving sheltering and feeding stopover and or a spawning space for marine creatures sawaragi 1995 sheng 2000 oh et al 2011 yoon et al 2016 a wake region can be generated by vortexes or turbulence around ars and accordingly defined by a space having recirculating flows which are characterized by their opposite direction to the main stream obviously it is important to investigate the wake size and velocity and use them in ar design and management it is not easy to identify the wake region of a given artificial reef experimental or numerical work should be useful for providing an indication of the optimal size and velocity some studies have shown velocity profiles around ars but those results do not show the overall features of the wake region al bourae et al 2013 liu and su 2013 liu et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 a representative characteristic the so called wake length wl was investigated by nakamura 1985 sawaragi 1995 sheng 2000 oh et al 2011 and kim et al 2014b however a specific wl does not fully represent the characteristic of the wake region because there are an infinite number of wls depending on the reference plane selected in reality some ars have distinct wls however most ars have multiple wls due primarily to their complex geometries similar observations can be made for wake areas was because a wa is also dependent on the selected wake plane kim et al 2014a proposed the so called wake volume using an element based finite volume method they obtained wake volume by adding up the finite volumes occupied by recirculating flows in a sense their method provides a significant measure for the estimation of wake region however they only considered a box type ar and presented the wake volume and its variations in terms of the magnitude and inclination with respect to a main stream direction thus it is desirable to apply the wake volume concept to various ars and characterize them by their wake volumes additionally it is necessary to consider not only a single ar module but also an ar set consisting of multiple ar modules yoon et al 2016 marine forest artificial reefs mfars have been used in relatively shallow seawaters to provide light intensity and firm stable substrates for seaweeds thus their design should be oriented toward not only enlarging surface areas with a relatively short and small reef size but also arranging ar modules for spreading spores in a productive way regarding the second issue it is necessary to investigate how seaweed spores spread out from a point to other points thus the water flows around mfars are important in predicting the spreading pattern and obviously estimating the corresponding wake region is essential however the relationship of mfars with their wake regions has not been reported before in this study we considered four mfars which have been approved by the central artificial reef committee in south korea present their wake volumes and associated flow characteristics and finally propose their unit propagation and efficiency indices to characterize their wake volumes optimizing the interaction between single and multiple ars ar sets and the corresponding wake volumes for this purpose the following processes were implemented first the four mfars were modeled using an element based finite volume method to obtain the wake volumes then the wake volume concept was used to obtain representative characteristics of the wake regions and accordingly these volumes were characterized through a so called efficiency index finally various flatly distributed placement models fdpms were applied to various single and mixed ar sets each consisting of nine mfar modules and their wake regions were estimated by proposing unit propagation and efficiency indices the following assumptions were followed in this study first water depth and relative submerge water depth are not considered in other words we only considered water flow current for the flow analyses second surface roughness and porous ratio of an ar were not considered we only considered the major topologies of the target ars such as height width length and void third multiple flow directions e g two flow directions induced by tidal changes and oscillating current induced by wave were not considered a relevant work was carried out by kim et al 2016a and woo et al 2018 in terms of wake volume diagram which is characterized by parameters such as wake volume fluctuations averaged wake volume fundamental symmetric angle secure angle and principal directions however they only focused on variation in flow direction and its effect on wake volume not the aftermath of wave induced mechanism 2 materials and methods to propose efficiency and unit propagation indices in this section we explain the materials and methods in terms of the modeling of mfars flow domain and boundary conditions analysis method and hypotheses numerical reliability wake region and placement models 2 1 modeling four mfars were considered because of their frequent use in korean coastal waters and distinct topologies as shown in table 1 there are four groups divisible into two classes of mfars in terms of volume and surface area the four reefs representing these groups are all included in the inventory of general artificial reefs which has been approved by the central artificial reef committee in south korea since 1971 accordingly these ars have been installed in korean coastal waters to enhance marine forests for example r02 has been the second most frequently used ar following the cube type ar yoon et al 2016 and accounting for 4 51 of the total area and 9 56 of the total facility volume from 1971 to 2014 ministry of oceans and fisheries 2015 it should be noted here that the cube type ar has been used to create fish habitats the representative dimensions of the four ar models are shown in table 2 2 2 flow domain and boundary conditions fig 1 shows the flow domain or space used in the flow analysis their dimensions were basically 20 20 20 m3 and minor changes were made according to the ar sizes to facilitate the water flows in and out in the domain the front surface was assigned to an inlet with a design velocity of 2 m s korean practice and the rear surface was assigned to an outlet with zero pressure gradient making the flows totally flow out through the outlet the bottom surface was assumed to be a smooth wall with no slip and the other surfaces left right and top were constructed to be symmetric it should be noted here that the flow velocity of 0 1 m s corresponds to reynold s number re of 1 0 106 which indicates fully developed turbulent flow in the domain this illustrates no significant effect of the inlet velocity on the flow field of an ar kim et al 2014a wang et al 2018 2 3 analysis method and hypotheses in the flow analysis the water in the domain was assumed to be incompressible viscous newtonian and steady flow the governing differential equation is the rans reynolds averaged navier stokes with the k epsilon turbulence model to increase the numerical precision the maximum element size was limited to 20 or 50 mm depending on the element location the water temperature density and dynamic viscosity were 25 c 997 kg m3 and 8 899 10 4 kg m 1 s 1 respectively the flow analysis was carried out by the element based finite volume method ebfvm facilitated by ansys cfx ansys 2009 this facilitation has been widely used as a computational fluid dynamics tool for flow analyses in automobiles subsea pipes and artificial reefs woo et al 2014 kim et al 2014a 2014b 2016b 2017 wang et al 2018 because it manipulates powerful mesh generation and wake volume adaption in the ebfvm the elements are used as auxiliary entities from which the control volumes are constructed cell vertex formulation and the control volumes consist of a secondary computational grid where the local conservation of the physical flux balances is effectively enforced profito et al 2015 the fluxes at one specific integration point can be calculated using data from the element in which the integration point is placed then the unknowns are approximated at the nodes and finally a control volume is built around every node kim et al 2016b the method discretizes the analysis domain into sub regions and the governing equation is converted into algebraic equations and then applied iteratively to find a solution versteeg and malalasekera 1995 in general the ebfvm has less grid dependence than the finite volume method fvm in this study the element is accounted for by a finite wake volume if the water flow at each node has the recirculating flow velocity component opposite to main flow direction the scheme is constructed in such a manner that a single failure in the criterion does not account for a finite wake volume consequently the total wake volume of an ar module or set is obtained by adding the finite wake volumes or elements that satisfy the criterion 2 4 numerical reliability woo and na 2014 verified the ebfvm by obtaining the drag coefficients of seven fundamental shapes e g disk cuboid ring c section hemisphere as shown in fig 2 the horizontal axis indicates the c d values obtained from fox et al 2004 and the vertical axis indicates the c d values obtained from woo and na 2014 as shown the variations in the drag coefficients are within 10 for the seven shapes this study used the same approach as woo and na 2014 to establish numerical reliability it should be noted here that the friction drag does not significantly contribute to the total drag for the blunt shapes and the reynolds number exceeds 1000 accordingly the pressure drag is independent of reynolds number fox et al 2004 2 5 wake region the wake region is an enclosed space immediately downstream of an ar in which recirculating flows exist as shown in fig 3 as shown the wl or wa has been used to represent the quantitative measure of a wake region sawaragi 1995 and to characterize the size and the flow velocity profile at a certain plane liu and su 2013 liu et al 2013 however these two measures are not enough to capture the whole feature of a wake region for the following reasons first the two measures are dependent on how a reference plane was selected thus a specific wl or wa does not represent all the features of the wake region second current sophisticated artificial reef design makes having multiple distinctive separated wake sub regions desirable and accordingly multiple wls and was are required to characterize the region third the recirculating flows in an ar cannot be accounted for by a wl or wa this underestimation becomes clearer when a relatively large ar is considered thus it is not easy to quantitatively estimate a wake region by measuring the wl and wa to overcome this kim et al 2014a proposed a wake volume concept based on the element based finite volume method in their method the wake volume can be estimated by adding all of the sub volumes having recirculating water flows accordingly it is possible to show the wake region as one figure an enhancement of visibility and representation to obtain the wake volumes of the four mfar modules finite volumes having recirculating flow velocities in the opposite direction to the flow direction were added as demonstrated in fig 4 as shown the wake volume includes the finite volumes in and around the ar a wake region can be considered a physical characteristic around and within an ar because the region provides an energy saving space this characteristic helps marine species stay in the region as a shelter feeding ground temporary stopover place and possibly spawning ground sawaragi 1995 sheng 2000 oh et al 2011 especially for marine forest ars the wake region makes seaweed spores settle down on the substrates or ar surfaces thus as explained in fig 3 along with dissolved oxygen and light intensity the wake region can be considered as a contributor to the net primary production ψ for the quantification of a wake region it is necessary to estimate the size of the wake region 2 6 placement models generally multiple ars are used to improve marine forest habitats as an ar set to establish an ar set it is necessary to construct a placement model considering the placement patterns a model can be classified into an intensively stacking placement model ispm or fdpm the ispm is a typical model consisting of multiple small ar modules stacked in a way to attract mainly fish as shown in fig 5 a the fdpm is for larger ar modules to attract fish or smaller ar modules to settle marine forests by distributing each module on a flat plane with certain intervals as shown in fig 5b that is for mfars the placement model should be flatly distributed otherwise the intensive stacking loses the substrates by overlapping the ar surfaces which is not an appropriate placement selection fig 6 shows the plan view of an fdpm characterized by the longitudinal h 1 and transverse h 2 intervals these intervals should be determined carefully for a wider wake region which provides a better chance for seaweed spores to settle down on the substrates or ar surfaces one strategy is connecting points ars through wake regions and accordingly making seaweed spores spread within the set another strategy is increasing a whole wake region by selecting target ars and adjusting the intervals moreover it is worth considering different mfars in a set which means the mixed use of different ars within one placement model in the placement models followed the longitudinal and transverse intervals were fixed to their major wake lengths to connect the wake regions along with the longitudinal and transverse directions this assumption is made because both directions can be changeable due to consistent variation in water flows the following efficiency and unit propagation indices were all proposed to characterize or quantify a placement model in terms of wake volume 2 7 efficiency index to estimate the efficiency of a wake volume it is necessary to introduce an efficiency index ϕ e of wake volume which was proposed by kim et al 2016b and defined by eq 1 here v w m is the wake volume of an ar module and v m is the real volume of the ar module this index stands for the wake volume per ar volume which represents the size of wake volume per the associated fabrication cost similarly this study proposed the efficiency index of an ar set as defined in eq 2 here v w s is the wake volume of an ar set and v m i and n m i are the real volume and number of an artificial module respectively 1 ϕ e v w m v m 2 ϕ e v w s i 1 k n m i v m i 2 8 unit propagation index the next concern is how to render the intervals between ars in an fdpm this concern is mainly connected with the wake region of an ar set which is constructed by an fdpm for the wake region estimation of an ar set it is necessary to introduce an index for measuring its efficiency this can be done by proposing a so called propagation index ϕ p which is defined in eq 3 here the numerator v w s is the wake volume of an ar set and the denominator v w m is the wake volume of a single ar module which is used for constructing the set 3 ϕ p v w s v w m the denominator v w m can be defined in eq 4 when different mfars are used in an ar set that is when a mixed fdpm is used for example when five r02s and four r72s are used together to construct an ar set then eq 4 can be described in eq 5 here v w m 1 is the wake volume of the r02 module and v w m 2 is the wake volume of the r72 module 4 v w m i 1 k n m i v w m i i 1 k n m i 5 v w m 5 v w m 1 4 v w m 2 5 4 this propagation index can be realized by adding the number n m of ar modules used in constructing the ar set as shown in eq 6 this is a so called unit propagation index which defines the ratio of the ar set wake volume with respect to the total wake volume of the ar modules thus it indicates how the ar set propagates the wake volume of the single ar module obviously a unit propagation index larger than or equal to the unit value indicates a good efficiency of the target placement model in terms of wake volume for a general expression including a mixed fdpm the denominator n m v w m in eq 6 can be defined as eq 7 6 ϕ u p v w s n m v w m ϕ p n m 7 n m v w m i 1 k n m i v w m i 3 results and discussions to demonstrate the proposed indices above four mfars r02 r54 r64 and r72 a variation r02 1 and a newly introduced ar r71 were considered to construct seven placement models including single and mixed type mfar sets then their wake volumes were characterized in terms of the efficiency and unit propagation indices in the following sections 3 1 wake volumes of ar modules and their efficiency indices fig 7 shows the wake volumes of four mfars characterized by their magnitudes v w m 2 90 m3 r02 1 71 m3 r54 3 87 m3 r64 and 11 18 m3 r72 r72 has the largest wake volume followed by r64 r02 and r54 considering the ar volumes the efficiency indices were calculated by eq 1 and are shown in fig 7 in terms of the efficiency index r72 has the highest index 5 15 followed by r02 3 09 r64 0 84 and r54 0 22 it should be noted that the highest index 5 15 of r72 is caused mainly by it having the largest wake volume 11 18 m3 however r02 has a relatively high efficiency index 3 09 because of its small ar volume 0 94 m3 rather than the wake volume 2 90 m3 3 2 wake volumes of placement models and their indices table 3 shows the fdpm of four single type mfar sets r02 r54 r64 and r72 their longitudinal and transverse intervals were fixed to their major wls 3 6 1 3 3 0 and 6 7 m to connect the wake regions along with the longitudinal and transverse directions fig 8 shows the wake regions of the models which represent the wake volumes of 23 16 r02 12 7 r54 33 7 r64 and 53 3 m3 r72 respectively considering the wake volumes v w m of the four modules these wake volumes v w s of the sets are equivalent to the propagation indices ϕ p of 7 99 r02 7 43 r54 8 71 r64 and 4 77 r72 respectively see eq 3 moreover the corresponding unit propagation indices ϕ u p are 0 89 r02 0 83 r54 0 97 r64 and 0 53 r72 respectively from the results r64 has the largest unit propagation index slightly smaller than 1 00 followed by r02 0 89 and r72 has the smallest index of 0 53 thus the placement model of r72 has relatively low placement efficiency in terms of wake volume to increase the wake region of an fdpm constructed with nine tube type ars the research center for ocean industrial development 2015 claimed that the longitudinal interval should be twice the ar length whereas the transverse interval should be zero or as small as possible however the recommendation is not possible primarily due to its unrealistic uncertain guideline on transverse interval and consequently its installation cost thus for a marine forest ar it is desirable to keep longitudinal and transverse intervals to a major wl or have only slight variation these variations are also demonstrated in the following sections fig 9 shows the efficiency and unit propagation indices of the mfars obtained using eqs 2 and 6 respectively as shown r02 has the largest efficiency index 2 74 followed by r72 2 73 r64 0 82 and r54 0 18 this indicates that r02 has the most efficient wake volume in terms of material used and r54 has the least efficient wake volume with respect to the material used thus r02 has the largest wake volume per material used however r64 has the largest unit propagation index 0 97 which indicates that the fdpm with h 1 h 2 3 0 m provided a relatively larger wake volume 33 7 m3 among the four placement models by only focusing on wake volume it was shown that r64 has relatively better performance in the placement models while r02 has relatively better ar topology 3 3 size effect on wake volume and indices kim et al 2014b investigated the height effects of six ars on their wake lengths and found strong linear correlations r 2 0 9 between this result can be useful but as mentioned earlier wake length of an ar is not good enough to represent the whole feature e g wake volume efficiency index and unit propagation index of wake region besides kim et al 2014b only considered single ar modules to clarify their height effects on wake lengths thus to investigate wake volume and the associated indices of an ar set with respect to an ar module size r02 has been magnified from the original dimensions l 2 00 b 2 00 h 1 30 m into l 2 07 b 2 07 h 2 16 m and renamed r02 1 accordingly r02 1 has an increased surface area of 52 15 m2 and volume of 6 37 m3 table 4 shows the wake volumes and the associated indices of the ar sets constructed with nine r02s and r02 1s respectively as shown the efficiency index decreased slightly 8 03 from 2 74 to 2 52 due to the increased total ar volume 9 6 37 57 33 m3 whereas the unit propagation index increased significantly 51 68 from 0 89 to 1 35 based on the modified wl 4 8 m and accordingly the placement model h 1 h 2 4 8 m from this result it was shown that the size of r02 is sensitive to the wake volume of the constructed set and its associated indices however it is hard to pinpoint a definite positive or negative correlation between the module size and the wake region feature of the set 3 4 placement model effects on wake volume and indices along with ar size effect it is worth investigating the effects of placement models on wake volume and associated indices thus the longitudinal and transverse intervals were adjusted to 0 5 wl 1 5 wl and 2 0 wl respectively here 1 0 wl indicates the wl considered in the previous analyses and the others indicate its variations as shown in fig 10 it was found that r02 1 had the largest wake volume in the case of 1 5 wl and the others had the largest wake volumes when considering 1 0 wl r64 1 5 wl r71 and 0 5 wl r72 here r71 is a newly considered mfar because it has a unique shape and a relatively small height 1 25 m table 5 overall the fluctuations were not significant with respect to longitudinal and transverse intervals accordingly it is better to identify the worst cases i e 0 5 wl r02 1 r64 r71 and 2 0 wl r72 thus to summarize an ar interval of 1 0 wl or 1 5 wl in the fdpms is better moreover it is better to use 1 0 wl because mfars should be connected through their wake regions in at least one direction for spreading seaweed spores fig 11 shows the streamlines in the placement models with 1 0 wl intervals as shown the wake regions were connected in the longitudinal direction 3 5 mixed placement models two different mixed placement models were considered fig 12 to investigate their effects on efficiency and unit propagation indices in other words those mixed models were selected to show that the efficiency and unit propagation indices could be improved if an appropriate combination is used accordingly to demonstrate combinations showing an indistinct or distinct improvement in the indices five r02s and four r72s were used for the first mixed model and five r64s and four r72s were used for the second their wake volumes are shown in fig 13 and their indices are summarized in table 6 as shown the wake volumes of these sets were 37 37 r02 r72 and 62 7 m3 r64 r72 the efficiency indices were 2 79 and 1 99 and the unit propagation indices were 0 63 and 0 98 respectively these indices are plotted in fig 14 with the previous results fig 9 from the figure it can be seen that the r64 r72 mixed placement model gave better indices 1 99 ϕ e and 0 98 ϕ u p than one ϕ e 0 82 of the single type r64 set and one ϕ u p 0 53 of the single type r72 set whereas the r02 r72 model did not show a distinct improvement in the indices thus it was found that a mixed placement model has a chance to improve the indices if an appropriate combination is used 3 6 procedure to construct a promising flatly distributed mfar placement model based on the results above fig 15 suggests a procedure for constructing a promising flatly distributed ar placement model focusing on wake volume and the associated indices the procedure starts with a target coastal water and seaweed pinpointing the goal of mfars and ends by determining an mfar module characterized by its volume v m i facility volume number of the modules n m i and placement model longitudinal and transverse intervals h 1 and h 2 the criteria for a promising flatly distributed placement model are ϕ e 2 0 and ϕ u p 0 8 indicating that efficiency and unit propagation indices should be at least 2 0 and 0 8 respectively these thresholds were determined according to the observation made in this study the efficiency index does exceed 2 0 for some cases but the unit propagation index does not exceed 1 0 for most cases here ϕ e 2 0 indicates that the wake volume of an ar set is double the total volume of all the ar modules and ϕ u p 1 0 indicates that the wake volume of an ar set is the same as the sum of the wake volumes of all the facilitated ar modules it should be noted here that the unit propagation index might exceed 1 0 if we break the rule that h 1 h 2 as discussed earlier if the transverse interval becomes zero or smaller than the longitudinal interval then the corresponding wake volume can increase research center for ocean industrial development 2015 however decreasing the transverse interval is not appropriate for an fdpm for mfars because the installation cost increases in a rapid manner moreover the major water flow direction is changeable in most marine environments accordingly the constraint h 1 h 2 is worth conserving that is why the unit propagation index hardly exceeded ϕ u p 1 0 and consequently a 20 reduced threshold 0 8 is suggested here it should be emphasized that among the seven ar sets only three sets r02 r02 1 and r64 72 set meet the criteria the applicable domain satisfying the criteria is colored yellow as shown in fig 14 4 conclusions marine forest artificial reefs should be oriented to enlarge surface areas with relatively small reef sizes and to spread spores for a productive reef placement regarding such productive placement it is necessary to investigate how seaweed spores spread out from a point consequently the water flows around mfars are important for predicting the spreading pattern and obviously estimating the corresponding wake region is essential in this study we presented the wake volumes of four mfars and associated flow characteristics such as efficiency and unit propagation indices and finally recommended how to establish a placement model optimizing the interaction between ars and the corresponding wake volumes as a result the following conclusions can be drawn first the wake volumes of four single type ar sets constructed by flatly distributed placement models resulted in the following unit propagation indices 0 89 r02 0 83 r54 0 97 r64 and 0 53 r72 thus except for r72 the other sets have reasonable unit propagation indices close to unity which means their placement models are candidates for a promising placement model second it was shown that the single type ar sets constructed with r02s and r72s have relatively good efficiency indices with respect to fabrication cost because of larger efficiency indices of 2 74 r02 and 2 73 r72 versus those of 0 18 r54 and 0 82 r64 combining the indices the single type r02 set has a better index combination than the others thus a single r02 set is a promising candidate third considering an additional single type r02 1 set a variation of the r02 set it was shown that the increased ar size improved wake volume and accordingly the unit propagation index without significant loss of the efficiency index thus size control is a way to improve the unit propagation index and the single r02 1 set becomes another promising candidate fourth adjusting the longitudinal and transverse intervals it was found that the intervals should be 1 0 wl because variations 0 5 wl 1 5 wl and 2 0 wl in the intervals did not result in significant improvements in wake volume a benefit of a 1 0 wl interval is that it can connect the neighboring mfars in the longitudinal direction main stream direction or transverse direction due to variation in main stream direction with the corresponding wake region so the spreading seaweed spores can propagate from one point to other points the 1 0 wl interval can be treated as a constraint for a promising placement model fifth considering the two mixed type ar sets r02 r72 and r64 r72 it was found that the use of a mixed placement model i e r64 r72 can complement the efficiency index of the single type r64 set and the unit propagation index of the single type r72 set that is the combination supplements each shortcoming and improvements were seen in the larger unit propagation index 0 97 and efficiency index 2 73 of the r64 and r72 sets respectively thus it is better to select an ar module for constructing a single type set with a good unit propagation index ϕ u p 0 8 and an ar module facilitating a single type set with a good efficiency index ϕ e 2 0 when constructing a mixed type placement model finally for an fdpm of an mfar set the following parameters should be considered in the design stage to increase the wake volume efficiency a facilitated ar module adapted ar size 1 0 wl interval and mixed use of different ar modules a procedure is shown here for constructing a promising flatly distributed mfar placement model furthermore an analysis tool is described to demonstrate the numerical scheme and result as well as the wake volume for facilitating efficiency and unit propagation indices for efficient mfar design and enhancement acknowledgements this

considering one of the ecological interactions it is necessary to increase the wake region especially behind an artificial reef because the wake region provides an energy saving sheltering and feeding stopover and or a spawning space for marine creatures sawaragi 1995 sheng 2000 oh et al 2011 yoon et al 2016 a wake region can be generated by vortexes or turbulence around ars and accordingly defined by a space having recirculating flows which are characterized by their opposite direction to the main stream obviously it is important to investigate the wake size and velocity and use them in ar design and management it is not easy to identify the wake region of a given artificial reef experimental or numerical work should be useful for providing an indication of the optimal size and velocity some studies have shown velocity profiles around ars but those results do not show the overall features of the wake region al bourae et al 2013 liu and su 2013 liu et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 a representative characteristic the so called wake length wl was investigated by nakamura 1985 sawaragi 1995 sheng 2000 oh et al 2011 and kim et al 2014b however a specific wl does not fully represent the characteristic of the wake region because there are an infinite number of wls depending on the reference plane selected in reality some ars have distinct wls however most ars have multiple wls due primarily to their complex geometries similar observations can be made for wake areas was because a wa is also dependent on the selected wake plane kim et al 2014a proposed the so called wake volume using an element based finite volume method they obtained wake volume by adding up the finite volumes occupied by recirculating flows in a sense their method provides a significant measure for the estimation of wake region however they only considered a box type ar and presented the wake volume and its variations in terms of the magnitude and inclination with respect to a main stream direction thus it is desirable to apply the wake volume concept to various ars and characterize them by their wake volumes additionally it is necessary to consider not only a single ar module but also an ar set consisting of multiple ar modules yoon et al 2016 marine forest artificial reefs mfars have been used in relatively shallow seawaters to provide light intensity and firm stable substrates for seaweeds thus their design should be oriented toward not only enlarging surface areas with a relatively short and small reef size but also arranging ar modules for spreading spores in a productive way regarding the second issue it is necessary to investigate how seaweed spores spread out from a point to other points thus the water flows around mfars are important in predicting the spreading pattern and obviously estimating the corresponding wake region is essential however the relationship of mfars with their wake regions has not been reported before in this study we considered four mfars which have been approved by the central artificial reef committee in south korea present their wake volumes and associated flow characteristics and finally propose their unit propagation and efficiency indices to characterize their wake volumes optimizing the interaction between single and multiple ars ar sets and the corresponding wake volumes for this purpose the following processes were implemented first the four mfars were modeled using an element based finite volume method to obtain the wake volumes then the wake volume concept was used to obtain representative characteristics of the wake regions and accordingly these volumes were characterized through a so called efficiency index finally various flatly distributed placement models fdpms were applied to various single and mixed ar sets each consisting of nine mfar modules and their wake regions were estimated by proposing unit propagation and efficiency indices the following assumptions were followed in this study first water depth and relative submerge water depth are not considered in other words we only considered water flow current for the flow analyses second surface roughness and porous ratio of an ar were not considered we only considered the major topologies of the target ars such as height width length and void third multiple flow directions e g two flow directions induced by tidal changes and oscillating current induced by wave were not considered a relevant work was carried out by kim et al 2016a and woo et al 2018 in terms of wake volume diagram which is characterized by parameters such as wake volume fluctuations averaged wake volume fundamental symmetric angle secure angle and principal directions however they only focused on variation in flow direction and its effect on wake volume not the aftermath of wave induced mechanism 2 materials and methods to propose efficiency and unit propagation indices in this section we explain the materials and methods in terms of the modeling of mfars flow domain and boundary conditions analysis method and hypotheses numerical reliability wake region and placement models 2 1 modeling four mfars were considered because of their frequent use in korean coastal waters and distinct topologies as shown in table 1 there are four groups divisible into two classes of mfars in terms of volume and surface area the four reefs representing these groups are all included in the inventory of general artificial reefs which has been approved by the central artificial reef committee in south korea since 1971 accordingly these ars have been installed in korean coastal waters to enhance marine forests for example r02 has been the second most frequently used ar following the cube type ar yoon et al 2016 and accounting for 4 51 of the total area and 9 56 of the total facility volume from 1971 to 2014 ministry of oceans and fisheries 2015 it should be noted here that the cube type ar has been used to create fish habitats the representative dimensions of the four ar models are shown in table 2 2 2 flow domain and boundary conditions fig 1 shows the flow domain or space used in the flow analysis their dimensions were basically 20 20 20 m3 and minor changes were made according to the ar sizes to facilitate the water flows in and out in the domain the front surface was assigned to an inlet with a design velocity of 2 m s korean practice and the rear surface was assigned to an outlet with zero pressure gradient making the flows totally flow out through the outlet the bottom surface was assumed to be a smooth wall with no slip and the other surfaces left right and top were constructed to be symmetric it should be noted here that the flow velocity of 0 1 m s corresponds to reynold s number re of 1 0 106 which indicates fully developed turbulent flow in the domain this illustrates no significant effect of the inlet velocity on the flow field of an ar kim et al 2014a wang et al 2018 2 3 analysis method and hypotheses in the flow analysis the water in the domain was assumed to be incompressible viscous newtonian and steady flow the governing differential equation is the rans reynolds averaged navier stokes with the k epsilon turbulence model to increase the numerical precision the maximum element size was limited to 20 or 50 mm depending on the element location the water temperature density and dynamic viscosity were 25 c 997 kg m3 and 8 899 10 4 kg m 1 s 1 respectively the flow analysis was carried out by the element based finite volume method ebfvm facilitated by ansys cfx ansys 2009 this facilitation has been widely used as a computational fluid dynamics tool for flow analyses in automobiles subsea pipes and artificial reefs woo et al 2014 kim et al 2014a 2014b 2016b 2017 wang et al 2018 because it manipulates powerful mesh generation and wake volume adaption in the ebfvm the elements are used as auxiliary entities from which the control volumes are constructed cell vertex formulation and the control volumes consist of a secondary computational grid where the local conservation of the physical flux balances is effectively enforced profito et al 2015 the fluxes at one specific integration point can be calculated using data from the element in which the integration point is placed then the unknowns are approximated at the nodes and finally a control volume is built around every node kim et al 2016b the method discretizes the analysis domain into sub regions and the governing equation is converted into algebraic equations and then applied iteratively to find a solution versteeg and malalasekera 1995 in general the ebfvm has less grid dependence than the finite volume method fvm in this study the element is accounted for by a finite wake volume if the water flow at each node has the recirculating flow velocity component opposite to main flow direction the scheme is constructed in such a manner that a single failure in the criterion does not account for a finite wake volume consequently the total wake volume of an ar module or set is obtained by adding the finite wake volumes or elements that satisfy the criterion 2 4 numerical reliability woo and na 2014 verified the ebfvm by obtaining the drag coefficients of seven fundamental shapes e g disk cuboid ring c section hemisphere as shown in fig 2 the horizontal axis indicates the c d values obtained from fox et al 2004 and the vertical axis indicates the c d values obtained from woo and na 2014 as shown the variations in the drag coefficients are within 10 for the seven shapes this study used the same approach as woo and na 2014 to establish numerical reliability it should be noted here that the friction drag does not significantly contribute to the total drag for the blunt shapes and the reynolds number exceeds 1000 accordingly the pressure drag is independent of reynolds number fox et al 2004 2 5 wake region the wake region is an enclosed space immediately downstream of an ar in which recirculating flows exist as shown in fig 3 as shown the wl or wa has been used to represent the quantitative measure of a wake region sawaragi 1995 and to characterize the size and the flow velocity profile at a certain plane liu and su 2013 liu et al 2013 however these two measures are not enough to capture the whole feature of a wake region for the following reasons first the two measures are dependent on how a reference plane was selected thus a specific wl or wa does not represent all the features of the wake region second current sophisticated artificial reef design makes having multiple distinctive separated wake sub regions desirable and accordingly multiple wls and was are required to characterize the region third the recirculating flows in an ar cannot be accounted for by a wl or wa this underestimation becomes clearer when a relatively large ar is considered thus it is not easy to quantitatively estimate a wake region by measuring the wl and wa to overcome this kim et al 2014a proposed a wake volume concept based on the element based finite volume method in their method the wake volume can be estimated by adding all of the sub volumes having recirculating water flows accordingly it is possible to show the wake region as one figure an enhancement of visibility and representation to obtain the wake volumes of the four mfar modules finite volumes having recirculating flow velocities in the opposite direction to the flow direction were added as demonstrated in fig 4 as shown the wake volume includes the finite volumes in and around the ar a wake region can be considered a physical characteristic around and within an ar because the region provides an energy saving space this characteristic helps marine species stay in the region as a shelter feeding ground temporary stopover place and possibly spawning ground sawaragi 1995 sheng 2000 oh et al 2011 especially for marine forest ars the wake region makes seaweed spores settle down on the substrates or ar surfaces thus as explained in fig 3 along with dissolved oxygen and light intensity the wake region can be considered as a contributor to the net primary production ψ for the quantification of a wake region it is necessary to estimate the size of the wake region 2 6 placement models generally multiple ars are used to improve marine forest habitats as an ar set to establish an ar set it is necessary to construct a placement model considering the placement patterns a model can be classified into an intensively stacking placement model ispm or fdpm the ispm is a typical model consisting of multiple small ar modules stacked in a way to attract mainly fish as shown in fig 5 a the fdpm is for larger ar modules to attract fish or smaller ar modules to settle marine forests by distributing each module on a flat plane with certain intervals as shown in fig 5b that is for mfars the placement model should be flatly distributed otherwise the intensive stacking loses the substrates by overlapping the ar surfaces which is not an appropriate placement selection fig 6 shows the plan view of an fdpm characterized by the longitudinal h 1 and transverse h 2 intervals these intervals should be determined carefully for a wider wake region which provides a better chance for seaweed spores to settle down on the substrates or ar surfaces one strategy is connecting points ars through wake regions and accordingly making seaweed spores spread within the set another strategy is increasing a whole wake region by selecting target ars and adjusting the intervals moreover it is worth considering different mfars in a set which means the mixed use of different ars within one placement model in the placement models followed the longitudinal and transverse intervals were fixed to their major wake lengths to connect the wake regions along with the longitudinal and transverse directions this assumption is made because both directions can be changeable due to consistent variation in water flows the following efficiency and unit propagation indices were all proposed to characterize or quantify a placement model in terms of wake volume 2 7 efficiency index to estimate the efficiency of a wake volume it is necessary to introduce an efficiency index ϕ e of wake volume which was proposed by kim et al 2016b and defined by eq 1 here v w m is the wake volume of an ar module and v m is the real volume of the ar module this index stands for the wake volume per ar volume which represents the size of wake volume per the associated fabrication cost similarly this study proposed the efficiency index of an ar set as defined in eq 2 here v w s is the wake volume of an ar set and v m i and n m i are the real volume and number of an artificial module respectively 1 ϕ e v w m v m 2 ϕ e v w s i 1 k n m i v m i 2 8 unit propagation index the next concern is how to render the intervals between ars in an fdpm this concern is mainly connected with the wake region of an ar set which is constructed by an fdpm for the wake region estimation of an ar set it is necessary to introduce an index for measuring its efficiency this can be done by proposing a so called propagation index ϕ p which is defined in eq 3 here the numerator v w s is the wake volume of an ar set and the denominator v w m is the wake volume of a single ar module which is used for constructing the set 3 ϕ p v w s v w m the denominator v w m can be defined in eq 4 when different mfars are used in an ar set that is when a mixed fdpm is used for example when five r02s and four r72s are used together to construct an ar set then eq 4 can be described in eq 5 here v w m 1 is the wake volume of the r02 module and v w m 2 is the wake volume of the r72 module 4 v w m i 1 k n m i v w m i i 1 k n m i 5 v w m 5 v w m 1 4 v w m 2 5 4 this propagation index can be realized by adding the number n m of ar modules used in constructing the ar set as shown in eq 6 this is a so called unit propagation index which defines the ratio of the ar set wake volume with respect to the total wake volume of the ar modules thus it indicates how the ar set propagates the wake volume of the single ar module obviously a unit propagation index larger than or equal to the unit value indicates a good efficiency of the target placement model in terms of wake volume for a general expression including a mixed fdpm the denominator n m v w m in eq 6 can be defined as eq 7 6 ϕ u p v w s n m v w m ϕ p n m 7 n m v w m i 1 k n m i v w m i 3 results and discussions to demonstrate the proposed indices above four mfars r02 r54 r64 and r72 a variation r02 1 and a newly introduced ar r71 were considered to construct seven placement models including single and mixed type mfar sets then their wake volumes were characterized in terms of the efficiency and unit propagation indices in the following sections 3 1 wake volumes of ar modules and their efficiency indices fig 7 shows the wake volumes of four mfars characterized by their magnitudes v w m 2 90 m3 r02 1 71 m3 r54 3 87 m3 r64 and 11 18 m3 r72 r72 has the largest wake volume followed by r64 r02 and r54 considering the ar volumes the efficiency indices were calculated by eq 1 and are shown in fig 7 in terms of the efficiency index r72 has the highest index 5 15 followed by r02 3 09 r64 0 84 and r54 0 22 it should be noted that the highest index 5 15 of r72 is caused mainly by it having the largest wake volume 11 18 m3 however r02 has a relatively high efficiency index 3 09 because of its small ar volume 0 94 m3 rather than the wake volume 2 90 m3 3 2 wake volumes of placement models and their indices table 3 shows the fdpm of four single type mfar sets r02 r54 r64 and r72 their longitudinal and transverse intervals were fixed to their major wls 3 6 1 3 3 0 and 6 7 m to connect the wake regions along with the longitudinal and transverse directions fig 8 shows the wake regions of the models which represent the wake volumes of 23 16 r02 12 7 r54 33 7 r64 and 53 3 m3 r72 respectively considering the wake volumes v w m of the four modules these wake volumes v w s of the sets are equivalent to the propagation indices ϕ p of 7 99 r02 7 43 r54 8 71 r64 and 4 77 r72 respectively see eq 3 moreover the corresponding unit propagation indices ϕ u p are 0 89 r02 0 83 r54 0 97 r64 and 0 53 r72 respectively from the results r64 has the largest unit propagation index slightly smaller than 1 00 followed by r02 0 89 and r72 has the smallest index of 0 53 thus the placement model of r72 has relatively low placement efficiency in terms of wake volume to increase the wake region of an fdpm constructed with nine tube type ars the research center for ocean industrial development 2015 claimed that the longitudinal interval should be twice the ar length whereas the transverse interval should be zero or as small as possible however the recommendation is not possible primarily due to its unrealistic uncertain guideline on transverse interval and consequently its installation cost thus for a marine forest ar it is desirable to keep longitudinal and transverse intervals to a major wl or have only slight variation these variations are also demonstrated in the following sections fig 9 shows the efficiency and unit propagation indices of the mfars obtained using eqs 2 and 6 respectively as shown r02 has the largest efficiency index 2 74 followed by r72 2 73 r64 0 82 and r54 0 18 this indicates that r02 has the most efficient wake volume in terms of material used and r54 has the least efficient wake volume with respect to the material used thus r02 has the largest wake volume per material used however r64 has the largest unit propagation index 0 97 which indicates that the fdpm with h 1 h 2 3 0 m provided a relatively larger wake volume 33 7 m3 among the four placement models by only focusing on wake volume it was shown that r64 has relatively better performance in the placement models while r02 has relatively better ar topology 3 3 size effect on wake volume and indices kim et al 2014b investigated the height effects of six ars on their wake lengths and found strong linear correlations r 2 0 9 between this result can be useful but as mentioned earlier wake length of an ar is not good enough to represent the whole feature e g wake volume efficiency index and unit propagation index of wake region besides kim et al 2014b only considered single ar modules to clarify their height effects on wake lengths thus to investigate wake volume and the associated indices of an ar set with respect to an ar module size r02 has been magnified from the original dimensions l 2 00 b 2 00 h 1 30 m into l 2 07 b 2 07 h 2 16 m and renamed r02 1 accordingly r02 1 has an increased surface area of 52 15 m2 and volume of 6 37 m3 table 4 shows the wake volumes and the associated indices of the ar sets constructed with nine r02s and r02 1s respectively as shown the efficiency index decreased slightly 8 03 from 2 74 to 2 52 due to the increased total ar volume 9 6 37 57 33 m3 whereas the unit propagation index increased significantly 51 68 from 0 89 to 1 35 based on the modified wl 4 8 m and accordingly the placement model h 1 h 2 4 8 m from this result it was shown that the size of r02 is sensitive to the wake volume of the constructed set and its associated indices however it is hard to pinpoint a definite positive or negative correlation between the module size and the wake region feature of the set 3 4 placement model effects on wake volume and indices along with ar size effect it is worth investigating the effects of placement models on wake volume and associated indices thus the longitudinal and transverse intervals were adjusted to 0 5 wl 1 5 wl and 2 0 wl respectively here 1 0 wl indicates the wl considered in the previous analyses and the others indicate its variations as shown in fig 10 it was found that r02 1 had the largest wake volume in the case of 1 5 wl and the others had the largest wake volumes when considering 1 0 wl r64 1 5 wl r71 and 0 5 wl r72 here r71 is a newly considered mfar because it has a unique shape and a relatively small height 1 25 m table 5 overall the fluctuations were not significant with respect to longitudinal and transverse intervals accordingly it is better to identify the worst cases i e 0 5 wl r02 1 r64 r71 and 2 0 wl r72 thus to summarize an ar interval of 1 0 wl or 1 5 wl in the fdpms is better moreover it is better to use 1 0 wl because mfars should be connected through their wake regions in at least one direction for spreading seaweed spores fig 11 shows the streamlines in the placement models with 1 0 wl intervals as shown the wake regions were connected in the longitudinal direction 3 5 mixed placement models two different mixed placement models were considered fig 12 to investigate their effects on efficiency and unit propagation indices in other words those mixed models were selected to show that the efficiency and unit propagation indices could be improved if an appropriate combination is used accordingly to demonstrate combinations showing an indistinct or distinct improvement in the indices five r02s and four r72s were used for the first mixed model and five r64s and four r72s were used for the second their wake volumes are shown in fig 13 and their indices are summarized in table 6 as shown the wake volumes of these sets were 37 37 r02 r72 and 62 7 m3 r64 r72 the efficiency indices were 2 79 and 1 99 and the unit propagation indices were 0 63 and 0 98 respectively these indices are plotted in fig 14 with the previous results fig 9 from the figure it can be seen that the r64 r72 mixed placement model gave better indices 1 99 ϕ e and 0 98 ϕ u p than one ϕ e 0 82 of the single type r64 set and one ϕ u p 0 53 of the single type r72 set whereas the r02 r72 model did not show a distinct improvement in the indices thus it was found that a mixed placement model has a chance to improve the indices if an appropriate combination is used 3 6 procedure to construct a promising flatly distributed mfar placement model based on the results above fig 15 suggests a procedure for constructing a promising flatly distributed ar placement model focusing on wake volume and the associated indices the procedure starts with a target coastal water and seaweed pinpointing the goal of mfars and ends by determining an mfar module characterized by its volume v m i facility volume number of the modules n m i and placement model longitudinal and transverse intervals h 1 and h 2 the criteria for a promising flatly distributed placement model are ϕ e 2 0 and ϕ u p 0 8 indicating that efficiency and unit propagation indices should be at least 2 0 and 0 8 respectively these thresholds were determined according to the observation made in this study the efficiency index does exceed 2 0 for some cases but the unit propagation index does not exceed 1 0 for most cases here ϕ e 2 0 indicates that the wake volume of an ar set is double the total volume of all the ar modules and ϕ u p 1 0 indicates that the wake volume of an ar set is the same as the sum of the wake volumes of all the facilitated ar modules it should be noted here that the unit propagation index might exceed 1 0 if we break the rule that h 1 h 2 as discussed earlier if the transverse interval becomes zero or smaller than the longitudinal interval then the corresponding wake volume can increase research center for ocean industrial development 2015 however decreasing the transverse interval is not appropriate for an fdpm for mfars because the installation cost increases in a rapid manner moreover the major water flow direction is changeable in most marine environments accordingly the constraint h 1 h 2 is worth conserving that is why the unit propagation index hardly exceeded ϕ u p 1 0 and consequently a 20 reduced threshold 0 8 is suggested here it should be emphasized that among the seven ar sets only three sets r02 r02 1 and r64 72 set meet the criteria the applicable domain satisfying the criteria is colored yellow as shown in fig 14 4 conclusions marine forest artificial reefs should be oriented to enlarge surface areas with relatively small reef sizes and to spread spores for a productive reef placement regarding such productive placement it is necessary to investigate how seaweed spores spread out from a point consequently the water flows around mfars are important for predicting the spreading pattern and obviously estimating the corresponding wake region is essential in this study we presented the wake volumes of four mfars and associated flow characteristics such as efficiency and unit propagation indices and finally recommended how to establish a placement model optimizing the interaction between ars and the corresponding wake volumes as a result the following conclusions can be drawn first the wake volumes of four single type ar sets constructed by flatly distributed placement models resulted in the following unit propagation indices 0 89 r02 0 83 r54 0 97 r64 and 0 53 r72 thus except for r72 the other sets have reasonable unit propagation indices close to unity which means their placement models are candidates for a promising placement model second it was shown that the single type ar sets constructed with r02s and r72s have relatively good efficiency indices with respect to fabrication cost because of larger efficiency indices of 2 74 r02 and 2 73 r72 versus those of 0 18 r54 and 0 82 r64 combining the indices the single type r02 set has a better index combination than the others thus a single r02 set is a promising candidate third considering an additional single type r02 1 set a variation of the r02 set it was shown that the increased ar size improved wake volume and accordingly the unit propagation index without significant loss of the efficiency index thus size control is a way to improve the unit propagation index and the single r02 1 set becomes another promising candidate fourth adjusting the longitudinal and transverse intervals it was found that the intervals should be 1 0 wl because variations 0 5 wl 1 5 wl and 2 0 wl in the intervals did not result in significant improvements in wake volume a benefit of a 1 0 wl interval is that it can connect the neighboring mfars in the longitudinal direction main stream direction or transverse direction due to variation in main stream direction with the corresponding wake region so the spreading seaweed spores can propagate from one point to other points the 1 0 wl interval can be treated as a constraint for a promising placement model fifth considering the two mixed type ar sets r02 r72 and r64 r72 it was found that the use of a mixed placement model i e r64 r72 can complement the efficiency index of the single type r64 set and the unit propagation index of the single type r72 set that is the combination supplements each shortcoming and improvements were seen in the larger unit propagation index 0 97 and efficiency index 2 73 of the r64 and r72 sets respectively thus it is better to select an ar module for constructing a single type set with a good unit propagation index ϕ u p 0 8 and an ar module facilitating a single type set with a good efficiency index ϕ e 2 0 when constructing a mixed type placement model finally for an fdpm of an mfar set the following parameters should be considered in the design stage to increase the wake volume efficiency a facilitated ar module adapted ar size 1 0 wl interval and mixed use of different ar modules a procedure is shown here for constructing a promising flatly distributed mfar placement model furthermore an analysis tool is described to demonstrate the numerical scheme and result as well as the wake volume for facilitating efficiency and unit propagation indices for efficient mfar design and enhancement acknowledgements this

introduction for the last few decades computer technology has been exponentially evolving in an unrestrained manner bringing massive central processing unit cpu power for acceptable price to the regular high end users computational fluid dynamics cfd is greatly dependent on cpu power since the basis in solving a fluid flow of any kind is found in a non linear navier stokes ns equations with extensions such as two phase free surface flow these require high computational effort to acquire a satisfactory solution according to larsson et al 2013 on the gothenburg 2010 workshop approximately 80 of the participants used fv discretisation while the rest relied on fd discretisation although the fv methods are only second order accurate see jasak 1996 simplicity of the method in developing complex geometries and straightforward implementation of complex mathematical models is deemed invaluable since in most engineering applications second order accuracy is found sufficient in order to validate the fv based cfd a set of benchmark cases is experimentally tested and data is made publicly available e g kim et al 2001 van et al 1998 olivieri et al 2001 which together with workshop gatherings in gothenburg larsson et al 2013 or tokyo hino 2005 larsson et al tokyo 2015 et al 2015 ensure an improvement of numerical tools wide range of publications is available on the topic of the analysis of the korea research institute for ships and ocean engineering kriso container ship case experimental data for kriso container ship kcs is openly available at chalmers university of technology and gothenburg 2010 for a different number of cases ranging from simple towing tank tests in calm water or head seas to wake and flow field study kim et al 2001 and self propulsion hino 2005 starke et al 2006 used a fd type solver parnassos for reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and obtained accurate results when comparing computed and experimental wave elevation interesting observation is made comparing viscous and non linear potential flow solver on a stern wave system where a clear overestimation of wave height in potential flow can be seen due to neglecting the diffusion term in the ns equations also in the study it is obvious that two equation turbulence model produces much better results for the wake field analysis then a simpler one equation model ozdemir et al 2016 employed a commercial code star ccm and obtained satisfactory results for resistance and wave elevation using k ε turbulence model jones and launder 1972 however results for the wake field are fairly diffused most probably due to the first order discretisation that was used for advection enger et al 2010 carried out a detail investigation with star ccm using different turbulence models where the best results were obtained for k ε model with a y value ranging from 40 to 60 geometrical properties of the boundary layer were set with three parameters overall thickness 20 mm expansion rate 1 5 and number of layers 6 through the given parameters the resulting first layer height is 0 9 mm test was made by lowering the number of layers to four but keeping the overall thickness and expansion rate the same discrepancy in results was evident on the coarsest mesh increasing the error by 1 6 in guo et al yu guo et al 2016 an experiment on kcs hull is made by measuring the wake field using particle image velocimetry piv and comparing the results with kim et al 2001 where a pitot tube stereoscopic camera and other equipment is used sufficient agreement was found between the data obtained results are then compared with the computed result from star ccm using the k ω shear stress transport sst model menter 1994 where good agreement was found between the wake fields but no quantitative data comparison was given beside the visual inspection a somewhat different approach is seen in banks et al 2010 using an ansys cfx rans flow solver on a structured grid results were compared for the k ω sst model and the baseline model similar results are produced by both models for resistance and wave elevation further on for a self propulsion simulation using body force model it is concluded that in order to achieve accurate computation of propulsion forces a greater level of detail is needed in the propeller inflow region wave elevation is correctly captured in almost every study and depends mostly on mesh grid density in the vertical direction near the free surface also advised in ittc ittc 2011a regarding self propulsion cases modeling the propeller behind the hull in sliding mesh technique yang et al 2010 or using dynamic overset grids caricca et al carrica et al 2015 shen et al 2015 are obviously one of the first choices however problem is in dealing with different time scales of the flow around the hull and the propeller in order to simulate physically correct interaction between the propeller and the hull simulation time step must be adjusted to the propeller rotation which drastically increases computational time max time step size in such cases corresponds to the 2 3 degrees of rotation of the propeller if for model scale propeller rotation equals to 7 8 rps global and local time scale can differ from o 10 to o 10 3 depending on the solver at the same time another problem lies in creating a good quality mesh topology in such cases another approach is to model the flow around the hull and the propeller inflow as two separate problems where a different solver can be used for each part of the simulation as for the coupling procedure badoe et al 2014 coupled blade element theory and the momentum theory bemt with rans calculations in openfoam coupling procedure is made by converting local thrust and torque into momentum sources which are added into the equations until convergence is reached effective wake field is defined by total wake field and then subtracting the propeller induced velocities calculated from the bemt code on the other hand hally 2015 proposed a boundary element method bem and rans coupling also implemented in openfoam in order to account for the blade blockage a mass source term is added in the pressure and the momentum equation where the effect of blade blockage is estimated at about 1 on the resulting thrust force another example of rans bem coupling is presented in rijpkema et al 2013 computed nominal wake in rans calculations without the propeller in action is used as an input for bem computation pressure loading distribution on propeller is then interpolated as a body force field in rans simulation and scaled to provide equal thrust if necessary total wake field is computed with rans and the propeller induced velocities are subtracted to obtain the effective wake field the process is repeated until there is no change in thrust and effective wake velocities in the coupling this approach is very similar to one used in krasilnikov krasilnikov where a panel method is used to solve the pressure distribution on propeller blades followed by the implementation of calculated forces in the actuator disk region in rans simulation the process is repeated until the imbalance between propeller thrust and hull resistance becomes smaller than desired tolerance the present paper will introduce a different way of modeling the actuator disk forces as a momentum jump condition for the normal and tangential component at the location of the propeller mid plane which is applied only on the adjacent mesh faces which significantly simplifies the numerical implementation and simulation setup only the mean features of the flow are considered where instead of using external algorithms badoe et al 2014 rijpkema et al 2013 krasilnikov krasilnikov the entire computation is being done inside a single cfd simulation in order to avoid the complex coupling procedure completely different approach will be considered for self propulsion case by applying the correction on the inflow velocity based on the momentum transfer in the vicinity of the actuator disk which will be described in the sec 2 3 and by using the proportional integral pi controller to achieve the desired thrust only the most important characteristics of the self propulsion condition will be evaluated in order to achieve high cpu efficiency thus ignoring the local flow features near the propeller the current study is divided into three sections the first section is dedicated to mathematical equations and numerical discretisation with a short description of meshing procedure the second section describes the kcs case setup from the gotenburg 2010 workshop for resistance case 2 2a on a coarse mesh with wave elevation and wake field case 2 1 evaluated on a more refined mesh in order to compute a more accurate result the third section is dedicated to japanese bulk carrier jbc resistance case 1 1a and self propulsion case 1 5a from the tokyo 2015 workshop with only the global aspects of the flow being evaluated on a coarse mesh kcs case is chosen for the wake field analysis due to invaluable data quality with proven high degree of accuracy however for the kcs there was no equal experimental setup for the resistance and self propulsion test without the rudder to properly evaluate the thrust deduction coefficient for the stated reason jbc is chosen for the self propulsion test leaving an opportunity to demonstrate the solver consistency and accuracy on different hull forms and froude numbers regarding resistance and wake field on the kcs case similar geometrical properties of the boundary layer mesh are used as in enger et al 2010 but the effect of the overall layer thickness on the solution is observed in all of the previously mentioned studies if wake field was investigated results were found sufficiently accurate using k ω sst model with second order discretisation schemes some authors krasilnikov krasilnikov enger et al 2010 report that most precise results can be obtained with reynolds stress model rsm but at the cost of larger computation expense and decrease of simulation stability for the current analysis k ω sst model is weighted as the best choice solver used for the study is navalfoam and it is a part of an in house code library naval hydro pack developed in the foam extend environment it is a community driven fork of openfoam software for computational continuum mechanics using fv discretisation in an arbitrary polyhedral framework see weller et al 1998 2 mathematical and numerical model this section contains the governing equations for the resistance and self propulsion flow cases detailed mathematical background is given for the two phase incompressible flow followed by the actuator disk ad model implemented šeb 2017 in the naval hydro pack interface capturing is accomplished using the volume of fluid vof method ubbink et al ubbink and issa 1999 while for the handling of the free surface discontinuities the ghost fluid method gfm huang et al 2007 desjardin et al desjardins et al 2008 lalanne lalanne et al 2015 is used to account for the turbulence in the flow k ω sst menter 1994 model with standard wall functions is used where only the calculation of the main variables is given discretisation methods and coupling procedure for pressure and velocity are briefly mentioned for the rigid body motion and flow motion coupling the reader is referred to gatin el al gatin et al 2017 for details 2 1 governing equations mathematical model is based on the following assumptions which are justified for large scale flows in naval hydrodynamics surface tension is considered negligible and tangential stress balance is taken into account assuming continuous effective viscosity and velocity gradient however the dynamic pressure jump due to the density jump and continuity of the velocity field kinematic boundary condition is obtained without simplifications since both fluids are considered incompressible with constant density and continuous velocity field the continuity equation reads 1 u 0 the momentum equation or the navier stokes equation for the incompressible two phase flow with the previously defined assumptions taken into account is defined as 2 u t uu ν e u 1 ρ x p g x ω a ω w γ w a where ω w and ω a stand for water phase and air phase respectively γ w a denotes the free surface x is the position vector p is the pressure gradient g is gravitational acceleration and ν e is the effective kinematic viscosity using the decomposition of the pressure term on dynamic and static component rusche 2002 3 p p d ρ gx where p d is the dynamic pressure yields a different formulation of the combined two phase flow in the gravitational field 4 u t uu ν e u 1 ρ x p d terms from left to right are transient convection diffusion and dynamic pressure gradient term free surface γ w a is labeled separately due to usage of gfm huang et al 2007 gfm handling of the free surface in mathematical formulation is defined in the following equations discontinuity of the density field 5 ρ ρ a ρ w x γ w a continuity of pressure 6 p 0 x γ w a pressure gradient jump condition due to kinematic boundary condition continuity of the velocity field at the free surface 7 p ρ 0 x γ w a where is a jump condition operator as used in huang et al 2007 while ρ a and ρ w are the air and water densities respectively for interface capturing vof method is used ubbink et al ubbink and issa 1999 which is based on an indicator function α that takes the value of 0 or 1 inside the air phase or water phase respectively transport equation for α reads 8 α t u α u r α 1 α 0 where the terms are from left to right unsteady convective and compressive term compressive term see rusche 2002 for details prevents excessive smearing of the interface while the implementation in the current work will be described in more detail in sec 2 2 u r stands for compressive velocity which is only used in the vicinity of the free surface due to the multiplier α 1 α effective viscosity is assumed continuous across the interface approximating the tangential stress balance 9 ν e α ν e w 1 α ν e a where ν e w and ν e a are effective kinematic viscosities for water and air respectively it is important to notice that smearing of the interface due to usage of gfm does not affect the density field 10 ρ x ρ w if α x 0 5 ρ a if α x 0 5 a brief description of the used turbulent model is needed to be able to solve the given reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations k ω sst model is fully described in menter 1994 so here only the procedure to specify the far field boundary condition for the variables of turbulent kinetic energy k and specific dissipation rate ω will be presented value of k is defined as 11 k 3 2 u i 2 where u is the free stream velocity and i is the assumed turbulence intensity used values for turbulent intensity of kcs case is 3 and 2 for jbc simulation specific dissipation rate is obtained following eça and hoekstra 2008 12 ω 10 u l p p where l p p is ship length between perpendiculars next step is to properly discretise given equations so that the numerical solution adheres to the solution of the proposed partial differential equations for full text concerning two phase incompressible flow coupled with gfm and vof see vukčević et al 2017 and vukčević 2016 2 2 numerical model discretisation schemes used in this study will be briefly mentioned in this section for details about fv discretisation of any arbitrary polyhedral control volume reader is referred to jasak 1996 temporal derivative is discretised using first order accurate euler implicit scheme since quasi steady state solution is sought convective term is discretised using the gauss theorem while for the interpolation from cell center to face center linear upwind biased interpolation is used explicit correction in order to achieve a second order accurate solution is made with the gradient extrapolation from an upwind cell all gradients are discretised using least square fit see jasak and weller 2000 with or without limiters to accomplish a second order accurate solution despite of mesh skewness diffusion term is discretised using the gauss theorem with linear interpolation using the over relaxed approach for the non orthogonal correction jasak 1996 following vukčević vukčević et al 2017 a segregated pressure velocity coupling is accomplished and interface corrected schemes are used in the vicinity of the free surface to account for the discontinuous jumps eqn 5 eqn 6 and eqn 7 to mark the interface faces compact polyhedral computational stencil is used reader can refer to vukčević vukčević et al 2017 for more details regarding interface corrected approach in α transport eqn 8 euler implicit scheme is used for temporal derivative convective term is discretised using the gauss theorem with van leer s total variation diminishing scheme van leer van leer 1977 with deferred correction ferziger and perić ferziger and peric 1996 that ensures scalar field boundedness between zero and one the compressive term is discretised using the gauss theorem yielding compressive fluxes which are dependent on the compressive velocity u r which is defined in jasak et al jasak et al as 13 u r c α n γ c f l r e f d f δ t where c α denotes a compression constant with default value of one n γ is a unit vector normal to the free surface c f l r e f is a reference compression courant friefrichs levy number d f is the distance between neighboring control volumes and δ t is the time step interpolation scheme in the compressive term is specially designed to be upwind if the interface is sharp while switching to central differences with appropriate weighting factors if the interface smearing becomes too large for full details regarding the α equation see rusche 2002 and for the implementation details see jasak et al jasak et al solving large sparse matrices produced by a fv mesh is achieved using a krylov subspace method with conjugate gradient cg method and a cholesky preconditioner for a symmetric pressure equation while for asymmetrical matrices three components of velocity indicator function and turbulence variables biconjugate gradient stabilized method bicgstab is used van der vorstbi cgstab 1992 pressure velocity and free surface capturing are coupled with a combination of simple patankar and spalding 1972 and piso algorithm where a piso pressure velocity loop is nested inside an outer simple loop updating the pressure multiple times per one momentum equation update issa 1986 due to prior experience with the solver two outer simple and two inner piso loops are deemed sufficient for a steady state solution for a complete description of the solution algorithm the reader is referred to vukčević vukčević et al 2017 to avoid wave reflection from the boundaries of the domain relaxation zones are set up following the procedure from jasak et al 2015 2 3 actuator disk actuator disk model following the goldstein optimum distribution goldstein 1929 will be explained in this section for full details on the implementation of the theory in openfoam see šeb 2017 a mathematical model for an ideal propeller infinitely thin disc is based on the modeling of only the two most important aspects of a functional propeller the torque and thrust forces regarding ship propulsion torque q and thrust t are usually given in dimensionless form with respect to the advance coefficient j which is defined as 14 j v a n d where v a is the advance speed n is the propeller rotation rate and d is the propeller diameter values of t j and q j are obtained from the open water test curve and used to determine pressure and tangential velocity jump for thrust and torque respectively since the advance speed v a in an experimental set up is equal to carriage speed for given thrust in order to properly compute the inflow velocity on the propeller plane correction of the axial velocity is needed from the actuator disk theory propeller thrust can be calculated as the mass flux at the propeller plane and the difference in flow velocities jasak et al jasak et al 15 t ρ w a d v d v 2 v 1 where a d is the actuator disk surface v d is the axial speed at the propeller plane while v 1 and v 2 are velocities in front and behind the propeller respectively note that the velocity v d following the actuator disk theory can be defined as 16 v d 0 5 v 2 v 1 if v 2 is expressed as the unknown and linked with the eqn 15 the inflow velocity v 1 v a can then be computed after rearranging the terms as 17 v a v d c f d t 2 ρ w a d v d c f d where the second term on the r h s accounts for the velocity correction due to the propeller suction on the inflow side while v d c f d is the averaged velocity in the propeller axis direction gathered from the ad faces in the computational domain non linearity of the eqn 17 for the advance speed since t is a function of j is easily solved inside of a single time step in a segregated solution algorithm for pressure velocity coupling pressure jump is calculated as jasak et al lalović 18 δ p 105 8 π t j r p r h 3 r h 4 r p f t r where r h is the hub radius r p is the propeller radius and f t r is defined as jasak et al 19 f t r r 1 r where r is the normalized disc radius defined as 20 r r r h 1 r h where r h r h r p and r r r p the tangential velocity jump that models the swirl caused by the propeller in action is calculated using following expression jasak et al 21 δ u t 105 8 π q j u x r p r h 3 r h 4 r p f q r where u x is the axial speed at the propeller plane and f q r is defined as jasak et al lalović 22 f q r r 1 r r 1 r r h note that δ u t is imposed tangentially at the propeller plane in the circumferential direction fv framework makes it suitable to easily collect the set of faces on which computed pressure and velocity jumps are imposed four parameters are needed to define the ad model location of the propeller plane direction of the propeller thrust propeller and hub radius using the given parameters ad faces are collected and imposed with a special type of boundary condition reader should be aware that such boundary faces are in fact internal faces of the mesh coinciding with the position of the propeller mid plane if there are no faces present at the exact propeller mid plane location the imposed boundary condition will be forced upon the next set of closest mesh internal faces it is obvious that the quality and the density of the mesh in the given region has a significant role in the definition of the ad however when performing self propulsion simulation mesh is expected to be thoroughly refined in the stern region so the location of the propeller mid plane is easily satisfied to an acceptable tolerance regarding the numerical implementation imposing a jump conditions on the chosen set of faces is straightforward and much more simplified compared to the volumetric source terms in the body force model which are added to the right hand side of the momentum equation in the following text the procedure of prescribing the pressure jump is described during the outer simple and inner piso loop boundary conditions are updated several times in order to ensure the conservation of quantities in the domain in the time instance of each boundary condition update pressure jump calculated in eqn 18 is added to the current value of the pressure field on the chosen ad faces due to the iterative type of solution algorithm both the pressure field and the pressure jump converge to a certain value although if it happens that the required thrust and computed thrust are not equal pressure jump is simply scaled to account for the difference same procedure is applied on the velocity in the circumferential direction also it should be noted that the ad boundary condition requires as an input a propeller open water test data to compute the thrust and torque during the simulation coupling between the body motion and the ad is fully resolved by recalculating the thrust direction axis and ad faces position after each mesh motion update 3 kcs resistance and flow field study one of the most studied and validated cases in modern naval hydrodynamics cfd is the kcs case featured in both gothenburg larsson et al 2013 and tokyo workshops hino 2005 tokyo 2015 et al 2015 a wide range of numerical results are validated against the experimental data as shown in the introduction with good overall agreement simulations around the kcs hull are divided into two sections the first section is dedicated to drag coefficient calculation by varying the boundary layer thickness in order to study the effect of the near wall layer mesh resolution on drag data and to approximate the optimal boundary layer for the further wake field analysis the goal is to find the smallest possible boundary layer thickness while preserving the accuracy of the results in order to have a good quality mesh in the propeller region where high boundary layer thickness produces skewed and non orthogonal cells thus disrupting the downstream solution the study is performed on a coarse mesh to save cpu time suitable boundary layer is then chosen and the mesh is refined for the second simulation where the entire flow field is evaluated giving special attention to detailed wake field analysis the grid uncertainty is not evaluated in this study the mesh for all cases spans 2 l p p from amidship section to the inlet 2 5 l p p to the outlet and 2 l p p to side boundaries only half of the ship is being simulated since the flow problem is symmetric the mesh height from the free surface to the top boundary is 1 l p p while the bottom boundary is set at 1 5 l p p below the free surface 3 1 steady resistance case 2 2a gothenburg 2010 for this case rudder is added to hull geometry in order to match the experimental conditions see fig 1 fluid properties are set up to correspond the towing tank chalmers university of technology and gothenburg 2010 reynolds and froude number of 1 4 10 7 and 0 26 respectively ship particulars are given in table 1 boundary layer disretisation is varied in thickness 10 mm 15 mm 20 mm and number of layers 5 or 6 where the initial boundary layer parameters are taken from enger et al 2010 consequently by changing the boundary layer mesh dimensionless distance y on the hull is being altered but it retains a suitable value for all meshes ranging from 40 to 80 generated grid consists of roughly 0 640 10 6 cells for each mesh where most of the cells are hexahedrons with a maximum non orthogonality of 70 70 skewness of 4 and only 10 cells in the z direction near the free surface besides the residuals reaching a satisfactory tolerance and the continuity of mass and volume preserved in the whole domain force acting on the hull is used a convergence criterion fig 2 shows convergence of the force acting on the hull after being converted into the dimensionless drag coefficient for a mesh with six layers and 20 mm layer thickness the drag coefficient is decomposed into viscous and pressure components with the viscous component compared to the ittc 1957 correlation line 23 c f 0 075 log r e 2 2 slight overshoot of the viscous component is considered adequate due to the hull coefficient impact on the viscous part of a few percent results for all grids are presented in table 2 experimental friction coefficient c f in the table 2 is computed from eqn 23 the solution is in reasonable agreement with experimental results while the computed error becomes significant when lowering the boundary layer thickness to a value of 10 mm most probably due to the boundary layer being too thin to properly evaluate the flow near the hull and resolve the velocity gradient evaluating the computed results a five layer mesh with a 15 mm thickness and 1 4 expansion rate is regarded as sufficient for wake field analysis in the next section 3 2 flow field study case 2 1 gothenburg 2010 based on the above the mesh for the flow field analysis is refined to approximately 2 10 6 cells also with mostly hexahedron cells and 16 cells in the vertical z direction near the free surface fig 3 also the rudder is removed from the mesh to match the experimental condition chalmers university of technology and gothenburg 2010 the jump in the drag force time signal at around 45 s is visible in fig 4 due to switching off the limiters on the gradient schemes yielding a second order accurate solution limiters are used in the beginning in order to stabilize the simulation another measure of convergence shown in fig 4 is the wetted surface area that stabilizes proving sharp and stable resolution of the interface on the hull fig 5 shows the wave elevation compared with the experiment where accurate correlation between the data is observed surprisingly even the bow crest is well captured together with a complex stern wave field caused by the immersed transom small diffusion in the results is most probably due to mesh coarsening in the given area the graph is obtained using a contour plot for α 0 5 apart from the wave field free surface elevation on the hull is reported together with three longitudinal cuts on the y plane results are also compared in fig 5 correlation with the experiment is found to be satisfactory loss of accuracy in the results after l p p 1 5 is mostly due to mesh coarsening which is also the cause of slightly inaccurate comparison on the y l p p 0 4224 cut regarding the wake field study a detailed analysis is performed following the ittc practical guidelines for rans calculation of nominal wake fields ittc 2014 data is examined in order to evaluate the flow pattern in the propeller location in fig 6 hull sections and the propeller plane are shown for a more clear visual correlation between the hull shape and the wake fraction contours wake fraction contours are presented in fig 7 where the intermediate solution with gradient limiters is also shown nonetheless it is clear that the flow is adequately captured with the gradient clipping hence it should always be weighted if the limiters should be removed since the removal can introduce a high amount of instability in the simulation in the regions of insufficient mesh resolution and in the areas of low mesh quality from the contour plot in fig 7 overestimation of the so called hook like shaped vortices is observed as well as that the vortex center is moved vertically comparing to the experiment due to a fine stern shape bilge vortices are not clearly identified because fuller stern frame lines usually generate stronger vortices as noted in van et al 2006 however according to kim et al 2001 in the experimental setup a dummy hub was used to prevent the abrupt change in the flow after stern boss to match the setup more correctly a hub was placed inside of the computational mesh and the results are shown in fig 7 vortex center is moved downwards but the intensity of the hook shape vortex remains overestimated for further analysis data is extrapolated for the experimental values near the center of the propeller plane in order to get a fully resolved plot of wake fraction contours the values near the center were out of the calibration range due to high vorticity in the experiment kim et al 2001 experimental and numerical results are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 with the propeller hub and the tip of the propeller plotted as dashed circles radius dimensions are in millimeters while transverse velocities are drawn every 15 degrees in the circumferential direction from the smallest radius of r r 0 3 to r r 1 2 according to ittc ittc 2014 where r is the propeller radius numerical values with the dummy hub were used for comparison in order to be more consistent with the experimental setup to make a more detailed investigation of the flow field each referenced radii is compared to experimental values circumferential mean wake comparison at each propeller radius is shown in fig 10 the error is clearly higher closer to the center of the propeller and the reason is due to a more complex flow near the propeller hub to further analyze the results a mean wake fraction of every reference radii is also presented in table 3 errors are below 6 for the range of r r between 0 6 and 1 2 while for the r r lower than 0 5 the error remains within 20 to achieve a more clear view of the comparison a radial wake distribution shall be plotted together with the experimental results fig 11 by integrating the circumferential wakes following the procedure from ittc ittc 2011b a nominal wake can be computed for a propeller plane from 30 to 100 of propeller diameter the comparison of nominal wake is also shown in table 3 with differences in the inflow velocities on the propeller plane below 3 the nominal wake in both cases should be somewhat larger because the flow from the hub to r r 0 3 is ignored in the experiment axial velocities along a vertical cut on the propeller plane were measured with a probe that was set up along a z coordinate just below the center of propeller values are compared in fig 12 where good agreement is observed large scale aspects of the flow are computed correctly while the small scale flow disturbances are not captured to conclude acceptable results have been computed at the propeller plane using a k ω sst model for model scale however it should be clear that the amount of turbulence present in model scale is not equivalent to full scale hence in full scale the wake field is less dependent on the turbulence model 4 jbc resistance and self propulsion in the this section ad is implemented inside of the computational mesh for jbc hull to evaluate bare hull resistance and capture the global features of the flow in self propulsion condition propeller open water test data are provided in tokyo 2015 as an input for the ad the main dimensions of the jbc hull are presented in table 4 no coupling is made with an external bem or bemt solver instead the flow is resolved inside the fv mesh using the ad model with local flow phenomena such as blade blockage etc being neglected to properly evaluate the asymmetry in the propeller flow due to the tangential velocity jump related to torque force modeling full domain is simulated mesh with 1 012 10 6 cells is used note that the mesh models the whole ship instead of half thus this resolution corresponds to approximately 0 5 10 6 cells in half of the domain the hull shape extracted from the mesh with the ad present is shown in fig 13 the mesh is generated in the manner as in the kcs case the ad is implemented inside of the fv mesh in the last step after the entire mesh is completed similar approach as in sec 3 1 is applied to approximate the optimum boundary layer thickness which resulted in a four boundary layers with expansion rate of 1 2 and a overall layer thickness of 12 mm yielding an average y value of 40 60 on the hull mesh metrics are similar as in the kcs case instead of performing two separate simulations for steady resistance and self propulsion a single simulation is performed where the ad is being turned on when the drag force for the bare hull converges thus saving cpu time convergence of the drag force is shown in fig 14 4 1 bare hull first bare hull results are evaluated where the resistance is measured with the ad turned off wave elevation comparison along the hull is shown in fig 15 where good agreement between experimental tokyo 2015 and numerical results is observed in fig 16 and fig 17 contours of axial velocities are plotted on plane x l p p 0 9625 where the bilge vortices start to form and on a plane x l p p 0 9843 just before the propeller plane with hub and propeller radius indicated by dashed lines main features of the flow are accurately captured with certain amount of diffusion present in numerical results intensity of bilge vortices is underestimated with the inflow axial velocities on plane x l p p 0 9843 obviously exhibiting similar behavior as in the experiment with certain asymmetry present in the flow nonetheless good overall agreement is obtained 4 2 self propulsion after 60 s of the simulation ad is turned on measuring the computed resistance for self propulsion condition initial rotation rate on ad is set to zero in order to avoid sudden jumps in the flow that may cause instabilities in the simulation average mean velocity on the propeller plane is calculated from the simulation while the effective wake field is established using an inflow velocity corrected approach described in sec 2 3 results from the experiment and the simulation are used to compute the experimental and numerical thrust deduction t coefficient to investigate the influence of the suction of the propeller on the hull stern pressure distribution thrust deduction is calculated as 24 t r t s p r t r t s p where r t s p and r t are the resistance force at self propulsion and towing tank condition respectively propeller rotation rate is varied depending on the following coefficient notation used as in krasilnikov 25 δ r t s p s f c t where s f c is the skin friction correction equal to 18 2 n from the experimental setup r t s p is the resistance force on the hull and t is the computed thrust on the ad pi controller is used to control the propeller rotation rate while the intention is to keep the force imbalance δ minimum as possible due to the unsteady nature of the flow behind the hull and varying resistance force in each time step δ is able to converge on a minimum value of about 1 of the resistance force with a rotation rate of 7 4rps opposed to the experimental 7 8rps mean axial velocity is integrated from 0 4r to propeller tip due to a loss of data near the hub in the experiment for the same reason only the left side of the axial velocities in the efd data is used for calculation lower rotation rate in the cfd simulation is expected due to the lower mean axial velocity on the propeller plane of 0 445 compared to the 0 452 in the experimental setup since thrust is modeled in terms of advance coefficient j eqn 14 any decrease in the inflow velocity must be accounted by the decrease in n to compute the same thrust in fig 18 contour plot at x l p p 0 9625 cut shows increased axial velocities compared with fig 16 where ad is not working results show the comparable amount of numerical smearing as in the bare hull simulation complete results for bare hull resistance and self propulsion simulation are presented in table 5 experimental c f is computed using eqn 23 resistance coefficient for both resistance and self propulsion simulation is in a good agreement with the experiment with relative error smaller than 1 for both cases propeller suction on the hull stern is properly modeled which can be seen as the small relative error of the thrust deduction coefficient of 0 56 high relative error of sinkage and trim are due to small absolute values which are below one cell height resolution in the current mesh notable error in computation of thrust and torque coefficients is present and overestimated for about 8 while the error is linked to the inflow velocities on the propeller plane being inaccurately computed as seen in fig 17 results for the entire jbc simulation are found to be satisfactory use of a pi controller and inflow velocity momentum correction proved to be reliable for simplification of the self propulsion condition with an idealized thin disc in the given setup ad activation is implemented as a run time modifiable variable allowing the user to modify activation time while the simulation is running regarding cpu efficiency a straightforward comparison can be made with the real propeller simulation time step used for the current simulation is equal to 1 10 2 s as stated in the introduction in a real propeller simulation a maximum allowable time step is constrained by the approximately 2 degrees of propeller rotation in the current case propeller rotation rate equals to 7 8rps which can be easily used to derive the maximum time step value of approximately 7 10 4 s compared to the current simulation the cpu time would be increased by more than ten times at the least also for the real propeller simulation the grid density and size would have to be significantly increased in the stern region to properly evaluate the complex propeller flow and geometry all of which additionally increase the cpu time 5 conclusion numerical approach in the fv framework of naval hydro has proved accurate for evaluation of resistance and the flow field around the ship ghost fluid method handling of interface discontinuities has produced a very high resolution of the free surface position together with the volume of fluid conservative treatment of the two phase flow preserving both mass and volume inside of the domain for both of the simulated hull geometries with different froude numbers cfd code has demonstrated consistency and reliability regarding the wake field study detailed qualitative investigation of the kcs wake field has shown good agreement with the experimental results using k ω sst model yielding a total mean inflow velocity difference of only 2 52 closer to the propeller hub complexity and turbulence of the flow increases with the relative error being under 20 for r r ratio above 0 6 correlation between the data is very accurate since the flow in the propeller region is demanding to capture even experimentally numerical results are found satisfactory resistance on both ships kcs and jbc has shown good correlation between the numerical and experimental results both resistance tests are done on the coarse mesh with the relative error on jbc case under 1 and for the kcs case around 1 2 5 depending on the mesh boundary layer self propulsion condition for jbc using an actuator disk computed with sufficient accuracy added amount of resistance to the hull due to suction from the propeller yielding a thrust deduction coefficient relative error of 0 56 such formulation can be used in early steps of the hull design process to improve propeller and hull interaction at low cpu cost for future work a more thorough investigation with multiple mesh refinements and inclusion of local flow effects should be considered for use in the later stages of the ship and propeller design

time step size suitable for naval hydrodynamics with the preservation of accuracy and cpu time efficiency computations are performed with the naval hydro pack developed in fv framework of foam extend a community driven fork of openfoam model scale kcs resistance and wave pattern is evaluated with a detailed analysis of the bare hull wake field following ittc recommendations self propulsion simulation is carried out for the jbc case comparing the global features of the flow with the experiment keywords ship hydrodynamics navalhydro foam extend wake field actuator disk self propulsion 1 introduction for the last few decades computer technology has been exponentially evolving in an unrestrained manner bringing massive central processing unit cpu power for acceptable price to the regular high end users computational fluid dynamics cfd is greatly dependent on cpu power since the basis in solving a fluid flow of any kind is found in a non linear navier stokes ns equations with extensions such as two phase free surface flow these require high computational effort to acquire a satisfactory solution according to larsson et al 2013 on the gothenburg 2010 workshop approximately 80 of the participants used fv discretisation while the rest relied on fd discretisation although the fv methods are only second order accurate see jasak 1996 simplicity of the method in developing complex geometries and straightforward implementation of complex mathematical models is deemed invaluable since in most engineering applications second order accuracy is found sufficient in order to validate the fv based cfd a set of benchmark cases is experimentally tested and data is made publicly available e g kim et al 2001 van et al 1998 olivieri et al 2001 which together with workshop gatherings in gothenburg larsson et al 2013 or tokyo hino 2005 larsson et al tokyo 2015 et al 2015 ensure an improvement of numerical tools wide range of publications is available on the topic of the analysis of the korea research institute for ships and ocean engineering kriso container ship case experimental data for kriso container ship kcs is openly available at chalmers university of technology and gothenburg 2010 for a different number of cases ranging from simple towing tank tests in calm water or head seas to wake and flow field study kim et al 2001 and self propulsion hino 2005 starke et al 2006 used a fd type solver parnassos for reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and obtained accurate results when comparing computed and experimental wave elevation interesting observation is made comparing viscous and non linear potential flow solver on a stern wave system where a clear overestimation of wave height in potential flow can be seen due to neglecting the diffusion term in the ns equations also in the study it is obvious that two equation turbulence model produces much better results for the wake field analysis then a simpler one equation model ozdemir et al 2016 employed a commercial code star ccm and obtained satisfactory results for resistance and wave elevation using k ε turbulence model jones and launder 1972 however results for the wake field are fairly diffused most probably due to the first order discretisation that was used for advection enger et al 2010 carried out a detail investigation with star ccm using different turbulence models where the best results were obtained for k ε model with a y value ranging from 40 to 60 geometrical properties of the boundary layer were set with three parameters overall thickness 20 mm expansion rate 1 5 and number of layers 6 through the given parameters the resulting first layer height is 0 9 mm test was made by lowering the number of layers to four but keeping the overall thickness and expansion rate the same discrepancy in results was evident on the coarsest mesh increasing the error by 1 6 in guo et al yu guo et al 2016 an experiment on kcs hull is made by measuring the wake field using particle image velocimetry piv and comparing the results with kim et al 2001 where a pitot tube stereoscopic camera and other equipment is used sufficient agreement was found between the data obtained results are then compared with the computed result from star ccm using the k ω shear stress transport sst model menter 1994 where good agreement was found between the wake fields but no quantitative data comparison was given beside the visual inspection a somewhat different approach is seen in banks et al 2010 using an ansys cfx rans flow solver on a structured grid results were compared for the k ω sst model and the baseline model similar results are produced by both models for resistance and wave elevation further on for a self propulsion simulation using body force model it is concluded that in order to achieve accurate computation of propulsion forces a greater level of detail is needed in the propeller inflow region wave elevation is correctly captured in almost every study and depends mostly on mesh grid density in the vertical direction near the free surface also advised in ittc ittc 2011a regarding self propulsion cases modeling the propeller behind the hull in sliding mesh technique yang et al 2010 or using dynamic overset grids caricca et al carrica et al 2015 shen et al 2015 are obviously one of the first choices however problem is in dealing with different time scales of the flow around the hull and the propeller in order to simulate physically correct interaction between the propeller and the hull simulation time step must be adjusted to the propeller rotation which drastically increases computational time max time step size in such cases corresponds to the 2 3 degrees of rotation of the propeller if for model scale propeller rotation equals to 7 8 rps global and local time scale can differ from o 10 to o 10 3 depending on the solver at the same time another problem lies in creating a good quality mesh topology in such cases another approach is to model the flow around the hull and the propeller inflow as two separate problems where a different solver can be used for each part of the simulation as for the coupling procedure badoe et al 2014 coupled blade element theory and the momentum theory bemt with rans calculations in openfoam coupling procedure is made by converting local thrust and torque into momentum sources which are added into the equations until convergence is reached effective wake field is defined by total wake field and then subtracting the propeller induced velocities calculated from the bemt code on the other hand hally 2015 proposed a boundary element method bem and rans coupling also implemented in openfoam in order to account for the blade blockage a mass source term is added in the pressure and the momentum equation where the effect of blade blockage is estimated at about 1 on the resulting thrust force another example of rans bem coupling is presented in rijpkema et al 2013 computed nominal wake in rans calculations without the propeller in action is used as an input for bem computation pressure loading distribution on propeller is then interpolated as a body force field in rans simulation and scaled to provide equal thrust if necessary total wake field is computed with rans and the propeller induced velocities are subtracted to obtain the effective wake field the process is repeated until there is no change in thrust and effective wake velocities in the coupling this approach is very similar to one used in krasilnikov krasilnikov where a panel method is used to solve the pressure distribution on propeller blades followed by the implementation of calculated forces in the actuator disk region in rans simulation the process is repeated until the imbalance between propeller thrust and hull resistance becomes smaller than desired tolerance the present paper will introduce a different way of modeling the actuator disk forces as a momentum jump condition for the normal and tangential component at the location of the propeller mid plane which is applied only on the adjacent mesh faces which significantly simplifies the numerical implementation and simulation setup only the mean features of the flow are considered where instead of using external algorithms badoe et al 2014 rijpkema et al 2013 krasilnikov krasilnikov the entire computation is being done inside a single cfd simulation in order to avoid the complex coupling procedure completely different approach will be considered for self propulsion case by applying the correction on the inflow velocity based on the momentum transfer in the vicinity of the actuator disk which will be described in the sec 2 3 and by using the proportional integral pi controller to achieve the desired thrust only the most important characteristics of the self propulsion condition will be evaluated in order to achieve high cpu efficiency thus ignoring the local flow features near the propeller the current study is divided into three sections the first section is dedicated to mathematical equations and numerical discretisation with a short description of meshing procedure the second section describes the kcs case setup from the gotenburg 2010 workshop for resistance case 2 2a on a coarse mesh with wave elevation and wake field case 2 1 evaluated on a more refined mesh in order to compute a more accurate result the third section is dedicated to japanese bulk carrier jbc resistance case 1 1a and self propulsion case 1 5a from the tokyo 2015 workshop with only the global aspects of the flow being evaluated on a coarse mesh kcs case is chosen for the wake field analysis due to invaluable data quality with proven high degree of accuracy however for the kcs there was no equal experimental setup for the resistance and self propulsion test without the rudder to properly evaluate the thrust deduction coefficient for the stated reason jbc is chosen for the self propulsion test leaving an opportunity to demonstrate the solver consistency and accuracy on different hull forms and froude numbers regarding resistance and wake field on the kcs case similar geometrical properties of the boundary layer mesh are used as in enger et al 2010 but the effect of the overall layer thickness on the solution is observed in all of the previously mentioned studies if wake field was investigated results were found sufficiently accurate using k ω sst model with second order discretisation schemes some authors krasilnikov krasilnikov enger et al 2010 report that most precise results can be obtained with reynolds stress model rsm but at the cost of larger computation expense and decrease of simulation stability for the current analysis k ω sst model is weighted as the best choice solver used for the study is navalfoam and it is a part of an in house code library naval hydro pack developed in the foam extend environment it is a community driven fork of openfoam software for computational continuum mechanics using fv discretisation in an arbitrary polyhedral framework see weller et al 1998 2 mathematical and numerical model this section contains the governing equations for the resistance and self propulsion flow cases detailed mathematical background is given for the two phase incompressible flow followed by the actuator disk ad model implemented šeb 2017 in the naval hydro pack interface capturing is accomplished using the volume of fluid vof method ubbink et al ubbink and issa 1999 while for the handling of the free surface discontinuities the ghost fluid method gfm huang et al 2007 desjardin et al desjardins et al 2008 lalanne lalanne et al 2015 is used to account for the turbulence in the flow k ω sst menter 1994 model with standard wall functions is used where only the calculation of the main variables is given discretisation methods and coupling procedure for pressure and velocity are briefly mentioned for the rigid body motion and flow motion coupling the reader is referred to gatin el al gatin et al 2017 for details 2 1 governing equations mathematical model is based on the following assumptions which are justified for large scale flows in naval hydrodynamics surface tension is considered negligible and tangential stress balance is taken into account assuming continuous effective viscosity and velocity gradient however the dynamic pressure jump due to the density jump and continuity of the velocity field kinematic boundary condition is obtained without simplifications since both fluids are considered incompressible with constant density and continuous velocity field the continuity equation reads 1 u 0 the momentum equation or the navier stokes equation for the incompressible two phase flow with the previously defined assumptions taken into account is defined as 2 u t uu ν e u 1 ρ x p g x ω a ω w γ w a where ω w and ω a stand for water phase and air phase respectively γ w a denotes the free surface x is the position vector p is the pressure gradient g is gravitational acceleration and ν e is the effective kinematic viscosity using the decomposition of the pressure term on dynamic and static component rusche 2002 3 p p d ρ gx where p d is the dynamic pressure yields a different formulation of the combined two phase flow in the gravitational field 4 u t uu ν e u 1 ρ x p d terms from left to right are transient convection diffusion and dynamic pressure gradient term free surface γ w a is labeled separately due to usage of gfm huang et al 2007 gfm handling of the free surface in mathematical formulation is defined in the following equations discontinuity of the density field 5 ρ ρ a ρ w x γ w a continuity of pressure 6 p 0 x γ w a pressure gradient jump condition due to kinematic boundary condition continuity of the velocity field at the free surface 7 p ρ 0 x γ w a where is a jump condition operator as used in huang et al 2007 while ρ a and ρ w are the air and water densities respectively for interface capturing vof method is used ubbink et al ubbink and issa 1999 which is based on an indicator function α that takes the value of 0 or 1 inside the air phase or water phase respectively transport equation for α reads 8 α t u α u r α 1 α 0 where the terms are from left to right unsteady convective and compressive term compressive term see rusche 2002 for details prevents excessive smearing of the interface while the implementation in the current work will be described in more detail in sec 2 2 u r stands for compressive velocity which is only used in the vicinity of the free surface due to the multiplier α 1 α effective viscosity is assumed continuous across the interface approximating the tangential stress balance 9 ν e α ν e w 1 α ν e a where ν e w and ν e a are effective kinematic viscosities for water and air respectively it is important to notice that smearing of the interface due to usage of gfm does not affect the density field 10 ρ x ρ w if α x 0 5 ρ a if α x 0 5 a brief description of the used turbulent model is needed to be able to solve the given reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations k ω sst model is fully described in menter 1994 so here only the procedure to specify the far field boundary condition for the variables of turbulent kinetic energy k and specific dissipation rate ω will be presented value of k is defined as 11 k 3 2 u i 2 where u is the free stream velocity and i is the assumed turbulence intensity used values for turbulent intensity of kcs case is 3 and 2 for jbc simulation specific dissipation rate is obtained following eça and hoekstra 2008 12 ω 10 u l p p where l p p is ship length between perpendiculars next step is to properly discretise given equations so that the numerical solution adheres to the solution of the proposed partial differential equations for full text concerning two phase incompressible flow coupled with gfm and vof see vukčević et al 2017 and vukčević 2016 2 2 numerical model discretisation schemes used in this study will be briefly mentioned in this section for details about fv discretisation of any arbitrary polyhedral control volume reader is referred to jasak 1996 temporal derivative is discretised using first order accurate euler implicit scheme since quasi steady state solution is sought convective term is discretised using the gauss theorem while for the interpolation from cell center to face center linear upwind biased interpolation is used explicit correction in order to achieve a second order accurate solution is made with the gradient extrapolation from an upwind cell all gradients are discretised using least square fit see jasak and weller 2000 with or without limiters to accomplish a second order accurate solution despite of mesh skewness diffusion term is discretised using the gauss theorem with linear interpolation using the over relaxed approach for the non orthogonal correction jasak 1996 following vukčević vukčević et al 2017 a segregated pressure velocity coupling is accomplished and interface corrected schemes are used in the vicinity of the free surface to account for the discontinuous jumps eqn 5 eqn 6 and eqn 7 to mark the interface faces compact polyhedral computational stencil is used reader can refer to vukčević vukčević et al 2017 for more details regarding interface corrected approach in α transport eqn 8 euler implicit scheme is used for temporal derivative convective term is discretised using the gauss theorem with van leer s total variation diminishing scheme van leer van leer 1977 with deferred correction ferziger and perić ferziger and peric 1996 that ensures scalar field boundedness between zero and one the compressive term is discretised using the gauss theorem yielding compressive fluxes which are dependent on the compressive velocity u r which is defined in jasak et al jasak et al as 13 u r c α n γ c f l r e f d f δ t where c α denotes a compression constant with default value of one n γ is a unit vector normal to the free surface c f l r e f is a reference compression courant friefrichs levy number d f is the distance between neighboring control volumes and δ t is the time step interpolation scheme in the compressive term is specially designed to be upwind if the interface is sharp while switching to central differences with appropriate weighting factors if the interface smearing becomes too large for full details regarding the α equation see rusche 2002 and for the implementation details see jasak et al jasak et al solving large sparse matrices produced by a fv mesh is achieved using a krylov subspace method with conjugate gradient cg method and a cholesky preconditioner for a symmetric pressure equation while for asymmetrical matrices three components of velocity indicator function and turbulence variables biconjugate gradient stabilized method bicgstab is used van der vorstbi cgstab 1992 pressure velocity and free surface capturing are coupled with a combination of simple patankar and spalding 1972 and piso algorithm where a piso pressure velocity loop is nested inside an outer simple loop updating the pressure multiple times per one momentum equation update issa 1986 due to prior experience with the solver two outer simple and two inner piso loops are deemed sufficient for a steady state solution for a complete description of the solution algorithm the reader is referred to vukčević vukčević et al 2017 to avoid wave reflection from the boundaries of the domain relaxation zones are set up following the procedure from jasak et al 2015 2 3 actuator disk actuator disk model following the goldstein optimum distribution goldstein 1929 will be explained in this section for full details on the implementation of the theory in openfoam see šeb 2017 a mathematical model for an ideal propeller infinitely thin disc is based on the modeling of only the two most important aspects of a functional propeller the torque and thrust forces regarding ship propulsion torque q and thrust t are usually given in dimensionless form with respect to the advance coefficient j which is defined as 14 j v a n d where v a is the advance speed n is the propeller rotation rate and d is the propeller diameter values of t j and q j are obtained from the open water test curve and used to determine pressure and tangential velocity jump for thrust and torque respectively since the advance speed v a in an experimental set up is equal to carriage speed for given thrust in order to properly compute the inflow velocity on the propeller plane correction of the axial velocity is needed from the actuator disk theory propeller thrust can be calculated as the mass flux at the propeller plane and the difference in flow velocities jasak et al jasak et al 15 t ρ w a d v d v 2 v 1 where a d is the actuator disk surface v d is the axial speed at the propeller plane while v 1 and v 2 are velocities in front and behind the propeller respectively note that the velocity v d following the actuator disk theory can be defined as 16 v d 0 5 v 2 v 1 if v 2 is expressed as the unknown and linked with the eqn 15 the inflow velocity v 1 v a can then be computed after rearranging the terms as 17 v a v d c f d t 2 ρ w a d v d c f d where the second term on the r h s accounts for the velocity correction due to the propeller suction on the inflow side while v d c f d is the averaged velocity in the propeller axis direction gathered from the ad faces in the computational domain non linearity of the eqn 17 for the advance speed since t is a function of j is easily solved inside of a single time step in a segregated solution algorithm for pressure velocity coupling pressure jump is calculated as jasak et al lalović 18 δ p 105 8 π t j r p r h 3 r h 4 r p f t r where r h is the hub radius r p is the propeller radius and f t r is defined as jasak et al 19 f t r r 1 r where r is the normalized disc radius defined as 20 r r r h 1 r h where r h r h r p and r r r p the tangential velocity jump that models the swirl caused by the propeller in action is calculated using following expression jasak et al 21 δ u t 105 8 π q j u x r p r h 3 r h 4 r p f q r where u x is the axial speed at the propeller plane and f q r is defined as jasak et al lalović 22 f q r r 1 r r 1 r r h note that δ u t is imposed tangentially at the propeller plane in the circumferential direction fv framework makes it suitable to easily collect the set of faces on which computed pressure and velocity jumps are imposed four parameters are needed to define the ad model location of the propeller plane direction of the propeller thrust propeller and hub radius using the given parameters ad faces are collected and imposed with a special type of boundary condition reader should be aware that such boundary faces are in fact internal faces of the mesh coinciding with the position of the propeller mid plane if there are no faces present at the exact propeller mid plane location the imposed boundary condition will be forced upon the next set of closest mesh internal faces it is obvious that the quality and the density of the mesh in the given region has a significant role in the definition of the ad however when performing self propulsion simulation mesh is expected to be thoroughly refined in the stern region so the location of the propeller mid plane is easily satisfied to an acceptable tolerance regarding the numerical implementation imposing a jump conditions on the chosen set of faces is straightforward and much more simplified compared to the volumetric source terms in the body force model which are added to the right hand side of the momentum equation in the following text the procedure of prescribing the pressure jump is described during the outer simple and inner piso loop boundary conditions are updated several times in order to ensure the conservation of quantities in the domain in the time instance of each boundary condition update pressure jump calculated in eqn 18 is added to the current value of the pressure field on the chosen ad faces due to the iterative type of solution algorithm both the pressure field and the pressure jump converge to a certain value although if it happens that the required thrust and computed thrust are not equal pressure jump is simply scaled to account for the difference same procedure is applied on the velocity in the circumferential direction also it should be noted that the ad boundary condition requires as an input a propeller open water test data to compute the thrust and torque during the simulation coupling between the body motion and the ad is fully resolved by recalculating the thrust direction axis and ad faces position after each mesh motion update 3 kcs resistance and flow field study one of the most studied and validated cases in modern naval hydrodynamics cfd is the kcs case featured in both gothenburg larsson et al 2013 and tokyo workshops hino 2005 tokyo 2015 et al 2015 a wide range of numerical results are validated against the experimental data as shown in the introduction with good overall agreement simulations around the kcs hull are divided into two sections the first section is dedicated to drag coefficient calculation by varying the boundary layer thickness in order to study the effect of the near wall layer mesh resolution on drag data and to approximate the optimal boundary layer for the further wake field analysis the goal is to find the smallest possible boundary layer thickness while preserving the accuracy of the results in order to have a good quality mesh in the propeller region where high boundary layer thickness produces skewed and non orthogonal cells thus disrupting the downstream solution the study is performed on a coarse mesh to save cpu time suitable boundary layer is then chosen and the mesh is refined for the second simulation where the entire flow field is evaluated giving special attention to detailed wake field analysis the grid uncertainty is not evaluated in this study the mesh for all cases spans 2 l p p from amidship section to the inlet 2 5 l p p to the outlet and 2 l p p to side boundaries only half of the ship is being simulated since the flow problem is symmetric the mesh height from the free surface to the top boundary is 1 l p p while the bottom boundary is set at 1 5 l p p below the free surface 3 1 steady resistance case 2 2a gothenburg 2010 for this case rudder is added to hull geometry in order to match the experimental conditions see fig 1 fluid properties are set up to correspond the towing tank chalmers university of technology and gothenburg 2010 reynolds and froude number of 1 4 10 7 and 0 26 respectively ship particulars are given in table 1 boundary layer disretisation is varied in thickness 10 mm 15 mm 20 mm and number of layers 5 or 6 where the initial boundary layer parameters are taken from enger et al 2010 consequently by changing the boundary layer mesh dimensionless distance y on the hull is being altered but it retains a suitable value for all meshes ranging from 40 to 80 generated grid consists of roughly 0 640 10 6 cells for each mesh where most of the cells are hexahedrons with a maximum non orthogonality of 70 70 skewness of 4 and only 10 cells in the z direction near the free surface besides the residuals reaching a satisfactory tolerance and the continuity of mass and volume preserved in the whole domain force acting on the hull is used a convergence criterion fig 2 shows convergence of the force acting on the hull after being converted into the dimensionless drag coefficient for a mesh with six layers and 20 mm layer thickness the drag coefficient is decomposed into viscous and pressure components with the viscous component compared to the ittc 1957 correlation line 23 c f 0 075 log r e 2 2 slight overshoot of the viscous component is considered adequate due to the hull coefficient impact on the viscous part of a few percent results for all grids are presented in table 2 experimental friction coefficient c f in the table 2 is computed from eqn 23 the solution is in reasonable agreement with experimental results while the computed error becomes significant when lowering the boundary layer thickness to a value of 10 mm most probably due to the boundary layer being too thin to properly evaluate the flow near the hull and resolve the velocity gradient evaluating the computed results a five layer mesh with a 15 mm thickness and 1 4 expansion rate is regarded as sufficient for wake field analysis in the next section 3 2 flow field study case 2 1 gothenburg 2010 based on the above the mesh for the flow field analysis is refined to approximately 2 10 6 cells also with mostly hexahedron cells and 16 cells in the vertical z direction near the free surface fig 3 also the rudder is removed from the mesh to match the experimental condition chalmers university of technology and gothenburg 2010 the jump in the drag force time signal at around 45 s is visible in fig 4 due to switching off the limiters on the gradient schemes yielding a second order accurate solution limiters are used in the beginning in order to stabilize the simulation another measure of convergence shown in fig 4 is the wetted surface area that stabilizes proving sharp and stable resolution of the interface on the hull fig 5 shows the wave elevation compared with the experiment where accurate correlation between the data is observed surprisingly even the bow crest is well captured together with a complex stern wave field caused by the immersed transom small diffusion in the results is most probably due to mesh coarsening in the given area the graph is obtained using a contour plot for α 0 5 apart from the wave field free surface elevation on the hull is reported together with three longitudinal cuts on the y plane results are also compared in fig 5 correlation with the experiment is found to be satisfactory loss of accuracy in the results after l p p 1 5 is mostly due to mesh coarsening which is also the cause of slightly inaccurate comparison on the y l p p 0 4224 cut regarding the wake field study a detailed analysis is performed following the ittc practical guidelines for rans calculation of nominal wake fields ittc 2014 data is examined in order to evaluate the flow pattern in the propeller location in fig 6 hull sections and the propeller plane are shown for a more clear visual correlation between the hull shape and the wake fraction contours wake fraction contours are presented in fig 7 where the intermediate solution with gradient limiters is also shown nonetheless it is clear that the flow is adequately captured with the gradient clipping hence it should always be weighted if the limiters should be removed since the removal can introduce a high amount of instability in the simulation in the regions of insufficient mesh resolution and in the areas of low mesh quality from the contour plot in fig 7 overestimation of the so called hook like shaped vortices is observed as well as that the vortex center is moved vertically comparing to the experiment due to a fine stern shape bilge vortices are not clearly identified because fuller stern frame lines usually generate stronger vortices as noted in van et al 2006 however according to kim et al 2001 in the experimental setup a dummy hub was used to prevent the abrupt change in the flow after stern boss to match the setup more correctly a hub was placed inside of the computational mesh and the results are shown in fig 7 vortex center is moved downwards but the intensity of the hook shape vortex remains overestimated for further analysis data is extrapolated for the experimental values near the center of the propeller plane in order to get a fully resolved plot of wake fraction contours the values near the center were out of the calibration range due to high vorticity in the experiment kim et al 2001 experimental and numerical results are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 with the propeller hub and the tip of the propeller plotted as dashed circles radius dimensions are in millimeters while transverse velocities are drawn every 15 degrees in the circumferential direction from the smallest radius of r r 0 3 to r r 1 2 according to ittc ittc 2014 where r is the propeller radius numerical values with the dummy hub were used for comparison in order to be more consistent with the experimental setup to make a more detailed investigation of the flow field each referenced radii is compared to experimental values circumferential mean wake comparison at each propeller radius is shown in fig 10 the error is clearly higher closer to the center of the propeller and the reason is due to a more complex flow near the propeller hub to further analyze the results a mean wake fraction of every reference radii is also presented in table 3 errors are below 6 for the range of r r between 0 6 and 1 2 while for the r r lower than 0 5 the error remains within 20 to achieve a more clear view of the comparison a radial wake distribution shall be plotted together with the experimental results fig 11 by integrating the circumferential wakes following the procedure from ittc ittc 2011b a nominal wake can be computed for a propeller plane from 30 to 100 of propeller diameter the comparison of nominal wake is also shown in table 3 with differences in the inflow velocities on the propeller plane below 3 the nominal wake in both cases should be somewhat larger because the flow from the hub to r r 0 3 is ignored in the experiment axial velocities along a vertical cut on the propeller plane were measured with a probe that was set up along a z coordinate just below the center of propeller values are compared in fig 12 where good agreement is observed large scale aspects of the flow are computed correctly while the small scale flow disturbances are not captured to conclude acceptable results have been computed at the propeller plane using a k ω sst model for model scale however it should be clear that the amount of turbulence present in model scale is not equivalent to full scale hence in full scale the wake field is less dependent on the turbulence model 4 jbc resistance and self propulsion in the this section ad is implemented inside of the computational mesh for jbc hull to evaluate bare hull resistance and capture the global features of the flow in self propulsion condition propeller open water test data are provided in tokyo 2015 as an input for the ad the main dimensions of the jbc hull are presented in table 4 no coupling is made with an external bem or bemt solver instead the flow is resolved inside the fv mesh using the ad model with local flow phenomena such as blade blockage etc being neglected to properly evaluate the asymmetry in the propeller flow due to the tangential velocity jump related to torque force modeling full domain is simulated mesh with 1 012 10 6 cells is used note that the mesh models the whole ship instead of half thus this resolution corresponds to approximately 0 5 10 6 cells in half of the domain the hull shape extracted from the mesh with the ad present is shown in fig 13 the mesh is generated in the manner as in the kcs case the ad is implemented inside of the fv mesh in the last step after the entire mesh is completed similar approach as in sec 3 1 is applied to approximate the optimum boundary layer thickness which resulted in a four boundary layers with expansion rate of 1 2 and a overall layer thickness of 12 mm yielding an average y value of 40 60 on the hull mesh metrics are similar as in the kcs case instead of performing two separate simulations for steady resistance and self propulsion a single simulation is performed where the ad is being turned on when the drag force for the bare hull converges thus saving cpu time convergence of the drag force is shown in fig 14 4 1 bare hull first bare hull results are evaluated where the resistance is measured with the ad turned off wave elevation comparison along the hull is shown in fig 15 where good agreement between experimental tokyo 2015 and numerical results is observed in fig 16 and fig 17 contours of axial velocities are plotted on plane x l p p 0 9625 where the bilge vortices start to form and on a plane x l p p 0 9843 just before the propeller plane with hub and propeller radius indicated by dashed lines main features of the flow are accurately captured with certain amount of diffusion present in numerical results intensity of bilge vortices is underestimated with the inflow axial velocities on plane x l p p 0 9843 obviously exhibiting similar behavior as in the experiment with certain asymmetry present in the flow nonetheless good overall agreement is obtained 4 2 self propulsion after 60 s of the simulation ad is turned on measuring the computed resistance for self propulsion condition initial rotation rate on ad is set to zero in order to avoid sudden jumps in the flow that may cause instabilities in the simulation average mean velocity on the propeller plane is calculated from the simulation while the effective wake field is established using an inflow velocity corrected approach described in sec 2 3 results from the experiment and the simulation are used to compute the experimental and numerical thrust deduction t coefficient to investigate the influence of the suction of the propeller on the hull stern pressure distribution thrust deduction is calculated as 24 t r t s p r t r t s p where r t s p and r t are the resistance force at self propulsion and towing tank condition respectively propeller rotation rate is varied depending on the following coefficient notation used as in krasilnikov 25 δ r t s p s f c t where s f c is the skin friction correction equal to 18 2 n from the experimental setup r t s p is the resistance force on the hull and t is the computed thrust on the ad pi controller is used to control the propeller rotation rate while the intention is to keep the force imbalance δ minimum as possible due to the unsteady nature of the flow behind the hull and varying resistance force in each time step δ is able to converge on a minimum value of about 1 of the resistance force with a rotation rate of 7 4rps opposed to the experimental 7 8rps mean axial velocity is integrated from 0 4r to propeller tip due to a loss of data near the hub in the experiment for the same reason only the left side of the axial velocities in the efd data is used for calculation lower rotation rate in the cfd simulation is expected due to the lower mean axial velocity on the propeller plane of 0 445 compared to the 0 452 in the experimental setup since thrust is modeled in terms of advance coefficient j eqn 14 any decrease in the inflow velocity must be accounted by the decrease in n to compute the same thrust in fig 18 contour plot at x l p p 0 9625 cut shows increased axial velocities compared with fig 16 where ad is not working results show the comparable amount of numerical smearing as in the bare hull simulation complete results for bare hull resistance and self propulsion simulation are presented in table 5 experimental c f is computed using eqn 23 resistance coefficient for both resistance and self propulsion simulation is in a good agreement with the experiment with relative error smaller than 1 for both cases propeller suction on the hull stern is properly modeled which can be seen as the small relative error of the thrust deduction coefficient of 0 56 high relative error of sinkage and trim are due to small absolute values which are below one cell height resolution in the current mesh notable error in computation of thrust and torque coefficients is present and overestimated for about 8 while the error is linked to the inflow velocities on the propeller plane being inaccurately computed as seen in fig 17 results for the entire jbc simulation are found to be satisfactory use of a pi controller and inflow velocity momentum correction proved to be reliable for simplification of the self propulsion condition with an idealized thin disc in the given setup ad activation is implemented as a run time modifiable variable allowing the user to modify activation time while the simulation is running regarding cpu efficiency a straightforward comparison can be made with the real propeller simulation time step used for the current simulation is equal to 1 10 2 s as stated in the introduction in a real propeller simulation a maximum allowable time step is constrained by the approximately 2 degrees of propeller rotation in the current case propeller rotation rate equals to 7 8rps which can be easily used to derive the maximum time step value of approximately 7 10 4 s compared to the current simulation the cpu time would be increased by more than ten times at the least also for the real propeller simulation the grid density and size would have to be significantly increased in the stern region to properly evaluate the complex propeller flow and geometry all of which additionally increase the cpu time 5 conclusion numerical approach in the fv framework of naval hydro has proved accurate for evaluation of resistance and the flow field around the ship ghost fluid method handling of interface discontinuities has produced a very high resolution of the free surface position together with the volume of fluid conservative treatment of the two phase flow preserving both mass and volume inside of the domain for both of the simulated hull geometries with different froude numbers cfd code has demonstrated consistency and reliability regarding the wake field study detailed qualitative investigation of the kcs wake field has shown good agreement with the experimental results using k ω sst model yielding a total mean inflow velocity difference of only 2 52 closer to the propeller hub complexity and turbulence of the flow increases with the relative error being under 20 for r r ratio above 0 6 correlation between the data is very accurate since the flow in the propeller region is demanding to capture even experimentally numerical results are found satisfactory resistance on both ships kcs and jbc has shown good correlation between the numerical and experimental results both resistance tests are done on the coarse mesh with the relative error on jbc case under 1 and for the kcs case around 1 2 5 depending on the mesh boundary layer self propulsion condition for jbc using an actuator disk computed with sufficient accuracy added amount of resistance to the hull due to suction from the propeller yielding a thrust deduction coefficient relative error of 0 56 such formulation can be used in early steps of the hull design process to improve propeller and hull interaction at low cpu cost for future work a more thorough investigation with multiple mesh refinements and inclusion of local flow effects should be considered for use in the later stages of the ship and propeller design

22957,simulations of the dynamic behavior of a sonar cable array towed by an underwater vehicle considering the influence of flow field disturbed by the underwater vehicle and its propeller are challenging tasks in present paper the strongly nonlinear towed sonar cable array is modeled by the lumped mass method where the cable array is discretized into a series of massless springs and lumped mass points the drag force on the towed sonar cable array is obtained by calculating the drag force on each lumped mass point considering the flow field of the underwater vehicle and its propeller which is computed by cfd methods the dynamic behavior of the towed sonar cable array is simulated by 4th runge kutta method applying newton s second law simulations of the three underwater vehicle motion modes including linear motions turning motions and surfacing motions are performed the results show that the numerical method proposed is reasonable and the lateral deflection of the towed sonar cable array is related to the speeds and the motion modes of the underwater vehicle keywords towed sonar cable array flow field dynamic behavior lumped mass method 1 introduction with the development of the economy the needs for ocean exploration technology and military anti underwater vehicle technology have promoted the development of towed sonar cable array technology the rapid development of towed sonar cable array technology makes it increasingly becoming an indispensable technology for modern ocean exploration and energy development towed sonar cable array has an extremely important significance in the application of the underwater vehicle which not only improves the distance of underwater vehicle passive detection but also greatly enhances the survival and combat capability of an underwater vehicle towed sonar cable array is usually installed on the tail of an underwater vehicle therefore the dynamic behavior of the towed sonar cable array will inevitably be affected by the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller which leads to the lateral deflection in the shape of the towed sonar array and even affects the safety of the underwater vehicle therefore it is of great significance to study the influence of the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller on the dynamic behavior of towed sonar cable array however there is few numerical methods used to analyze the influence of underwater vehicle flow field on dynamic behavior of towed sonar cable array for most motion simulation studies of underwater towed cable system the influence of the flow field of the tug or underwater vehicle on dynamic behavior of underwater towed cable was often ignored in simulation the focus of their researches was the influence of different motion modes of tug or underwater vehicle and different boundary conditions on dynamic behavior of underwater towed cable vu et al 2017 used the catenary equations to establish the dynamic equation of the underwater cable applying the shooting method to solve the two point boundary value problem of the cable catenary equation and established the motion model of the underwater vehicle with the effect of the cable the motion simulations of the underwater vehicle ascending turning and shaking were carried out gonzález et al 2017 presented two new simulation methods which include spring based cable model and multi body cable model for simulating the cable pay out and reel in with towed fishing gears through comparative analysis the two methods should be selected when addressing a given application because both methods have advantages and limitations zhu et al 2015 2016a b 2017 established the numerical modeling of a spar platform tethered by a mooring cable with a spherical joint based on the lumped mass method the effect of the buoyancy hydrodynamic drag force and the effect of the added mass and froude krylov force were considered in their work finally the dynamic behavior of the spar platform was simulated by numerical simulation pereira et al 2013 and gomes et al 2016 presented a new dynamic modeling of cables by approximating the continuous flexibility of the cable by several rigid links connected by fictitious elastic joints the dynamic behaviors of the cable where simulated in both air and water however based on the euler lagrange equations the size of dynamic equations of the cable can be increased significantly with the growth of the number of links as for the system consisted of the near surface underwater vehicle the cable and the underwater trailer park and kim 2015 established the motion equations of the cable applying the absolute nodal coordinate method also the dynamic model of the whole multi body system based on the multi body system dynamics method was established and the motion simulations were carried out wang and sun 2015 developed the dynamic model of cable based on the ablow s classical model and overemphasized the numerical algorithm the dynamic response of a towed cable system to ship maneuver was parametrically simulated with three dimensionless parameters ratio of total length to turning radius ratio of cable mass to vehicle mass and ratio of mass unit length to hydrodynamic force based on lumped mass method wang et al 2008 dispersed the cable into a series of massless springs and lumped mass points and established the dynamic model of the cable the dynamic response of the cable with variable length and the dynamic behavior when the cable contacted the seabed was simulated although there are numerous researches studying the dynamic behavior of underwater towed cable systems there is little research to analyze the influence of the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller on the towed sonar cable array therefore there is an urgent need to propose a numerical method to study the influence of underwater vehicle flow field on the dynamic behavior of towed sonar cable array therefore this paper presented a numerical method for analyzing the influence of flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller on the dynamic behavior of towed sonar cable array firstly based on the lumped mass method the towed sonar array was discretized into a series of massless springs and lumped mass points which solves the problem of strong nonlinearity of the towed sonar cable array after the force analysis of each lumped mass point the 3d motion model of towed sonar cable array was established by applying newton s second law for each lumped mass point in addition the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller will affect the relative velocity of the lumped mass points and its surrounding fluid and then will affect the drag forces of towed sonar cable array thus in force analysis of each lumped mass point we focused on the drag forces of each lumped mass point by adding the data of the flow field of the underwater vehicle and its propeller secondly the data of flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller was calculated through cfd method and only the flow field data in different vertical slice planes with same interval were extracted due to the large size of the data thirdly to examine the influence of motion modes of underwater vehicle on the dynamic behavior of towed sonar cable array simulations of the three motion modes of underwater vehicle including linear motion turning motion surfacing motion were performed the flow field data of lumped mass points was obtained by the interpolation method according to the relative position of lumped mass points in the flow the simulation results identified the interaction of the flow flied on the dynamic behavior of towed sonar cable array 2 motion model of towed sonar cable array the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller causes some effects on the dynamic behavior of the towed sonar cable array therefore establishing the motion model of towed sonar cable array considering the flow field disturbed by underwater vehicle and its propeller is beneficial to the analysis of the dynamic behavior and safety of towed sonar cable array however most researchers neglect this effect due to its complexity in this paper we analyze dynamic behavior of towed sonar cable array affected by the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller in present study the following assumptions are set to develop the motion model of towed sonar cable array affected by the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller 1 the towed sonar cable array is continuous extensible and flexible 2 the bending stiffness and torsional stiffness of the towed sonar cable array are neglected 3 the cross sectional area of the towed sonar cable array will not undergo significant changes due to axial deformation of the towed sonar cable array 4 the forces acting on the towed sonar cable array are the gravity buoyancy tension force and the hydrodynamic force on the towed sonar cable array due to the effect of the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller that can be calculated by the cfd method and the interpolation method 2 1 three coordinate systems according to the assumption 1 and 2 we use lumped mass method to discrete the towed sonar cable array into n massless springs and n lumped mass points which simulate the continuity elasticity and flexibly of towed sonar cable array therefore to develop the motion model of the towed sonar cable array mathematically three reference frames need to be defined it is convenient to define the following three reference frames the underwater vehicle body fixed reference frame s xyz the earth fixed reference frame e xyz and cable local reference frame c i tbn i 1 n fig 1 shows the underwater vehicle towed sonar cable array and the reference frames defined above the origin of the underwater vehicle body fixed reference frame s xyz is located at the geometric center of the underwater vehicle s hull the s x axis is along the direction from tail to the nose the transversal axis s z points to the starboard side of the underwater vehicle and the s y axis is directed from bottom to top which is also known as the normal axis in addition the earth fixed reference frame e xyz is located on the sea level the horizontal axes of e x and e z are perpendicular to the gravity and the e y axis is stretched in the positive direction of the gravity vector on the other hand the cable local reference frame c i t i b i n i is fixed at the ith lumped mass point and the c i t i axes is along the direction from ith lumped mass point to the i 1 th lumped mass point and the c i b i axes and c i n i axes are perpendicular to the c i t i axes from fig 1 we defined the position vector of underwater vehicle in the earth fixed reference frame as p s e x s y s z s t where x s y s and z s are the components of the position vector of underwater vehicle in addition to determine the attitude of the underwater vehicle in earth fixed reference frame the euler angles of underwater vehicle are defined as pitch angle θ yaw angle ψ and roll angle φ as shown in fig 1 and the euler angles of underwater vehicle can express the relationship between s xyz and e xyz the relationships between s xyz and e xyz is expressed as 1 r e s θ ψ φ cos θ cos ψ sin θ cos ψ cos φ sin ψ sin φ sin θ cos ψ sin φ sin ψ cos φ sin θ cos θ cos φ cos θ sin φ cos θ sin ψ sin θ sin ψ cos φ cos ψ sin φ sin θ sin ψ sin φ cos ψ cos φ since the towed sonar cable array is located at the top vertical fin the position vector of the link point in the underwater vehicle body fixed reference frame is defined as p l s x l y l z l t where x l y l and z l are the position components of the link point in the underwater vehicle body fixed reference frame as shown in fig 1 in addition the position of the link also can be determined as p l e x l y l z l t in the earth fixed reference frame where x l y l and z l are the position components of link point in earth fixed reference frame the relationship between p l s and p l e can be determined by the eq 1 and p s e it can be expressed as 2 p l e p s e r e s θ ψ φ p l s in addition the application of the lumped mass method to approximate the shape of the towed sonar cable array allows the whole shape of towed sonar cable array to be determined when the shape of each massless spring and the position of each lumped mass point are known the position vector of the ith lumped mass point in the earth fixed reference frame can be expressed as p i e x i y i z i t where x i y i and z i are the position components of ith lumped mass point in earth fixed reference frame the shape of ith spring can then be defined by the euler angles ξ i η i as shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the euler angles of the ith i 2 n 1 massless spring can be expressed as 3 ξ i arcsin y i y i 1 l i 4 η i arcsin z i z i 1 l i cos ξ i x i x i 1 0 π arcsin z i z i 1 l i cos ξ i x i x i 1 0 where l i is the length of the ith massless spring expressed as l i x i x i 1 2 y i y i 1 2 z i z i 1 2 as for the first massless spring the euler angles can be determined by eqs 5 and 6 5 ξ 1 arcsin y 1 y l l 1 6 η 1 arcsin z 1 z l l 1 cos ξ 1 x 1 x l 0 π arcsin z 1 z l l 1 cos ξ 1 x 1 x l 0 where l 1 is the length of the first massless spring expressed as l 1 x 1 x l 2 y 1 y l 2 z 1 z l 2 therefore the relationship between c i tbn and e xyz can be expressed as 7 r e i cos η i cos ξ i cos η i sin ξ i sin η i sin ξ i cos ξ i 0 sin η i cos ξ i sin η i sin ξ i cos η i considering eqs 1 and 7 the relationship between c i tbn and s xyz can be written as 8 r s i θ ψ φ ξ i η i r s e θ ψ φ r e i ξ i η i where the r s e θ ψ φ means the transpose matrix of r e s θ ψ φ and r s e θ ψ φ r e s θ ψ φ 1 2 2 kinematics model the kinematics model describes the velocity and angular velocity relationship between different reference frames therefore to derive the kinematics model of underwater vehicle we represent the instantaneous velocity and angular velocity of underwater vehicle with respect to the underwater vehicle body fixed reference frame by v s u v w t and w s p q r t respectively in addition the velocity and angular velocity of underwater vehicle in earth fixed reference frame can be expressed as v s e x s y s z s t and w s e θ ψ φ t respectively so the transformation relationship of the translating velocities between the earth fixed reference frame and underwater vehicle body fixed reference frame can be written as 9 v s e r e s v s similarly we can express the relation of angular velocity vector between the earth fixed reference frame and the underwater vehicle body fixed reference frame as 10 w s e t e s w s where 11 t e s 0 sin φ cos φ cos φ tan θ 0 sin φ tan θ 1 tan θ cos φ tan θ sin φ in addition because of the assumption 2 we define that the lumped mass points only have instantaneous translational velocities and the velocity vector of ith lumped mass point with respect to the cable local reference frame can be expressed as v i t i b i n i t and the velocity vector of ith lumped mass point with respect to the earth fixed reference frame can be expressed as v i e x i y i z i t thus the relation of velocity vector between the earth fixed reference frame and the cable local reference frame can be expressed as 12 v i e r e i v i hence the position x s y s z s and the euler angles θ ψ φ of the underwater vehicle with respect to the earth fixed reference frame and the position x i y i z i can be obtained by integrating the corresponding velocities and angler velocities from eqs 9 10 and 12 2 3 forces analysis the forces analysis mainly calculates the external forces on the underwater vehicle and towed sonar cable array in our study we assume that underwater vehicle has a very precise control system to perform the steady movement therefore the underwater vehicle only performs steady movements and the forces analysis of underwater vehicle is ignored in this paper we only analyze the forces of towed sonar cable array in addition the forces analysis of towed sonar cable array transforms into the forces analysis of each lumped mass point based on the lumped mass method according to the assumption 4 there are at least five components that contribute to the forces on the each lumped mass point 1 gravity force which is due to self weight of each lumped mass point 2 buoyancy force which is equal to the weight of its displaced fluid 3 tension which are due to the massless spring 4 additional mass force which is due to the accelerated movement of towed sonar cable array 5 drag forces which are due to flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller these five forces are shown in fig 3 1 gravity force and buoyancy force according to the fig 4 the gravity force and buoyancy force of the ith lumped mass point can be defined as g i and b i respectively and they can be expressed as 17 g i b i m i g ρ w σ i l i g as for the nth lumped mass point the tension will be expressed as 18 δ t n t n e σ ε n t n based on the relationship between c i tbn and e xyz the tension of the ith i 1 n 1 lumped mass point in the earth fixed reference frame can be expressed as 19 δ t i r e i t i r e i 1 t i 1 e σ cos η i cos ξ i ε i cos η i 1 cos ξ i 1 ε i 1 sin ξ i ε i sin ξ i 1 ε i 1 sin η i cos ξ i ε i sin η i 1 cos ξ i 1 ε i 1 i 1 n 1 similarly the tension of the nth lumped mass point in the earth fixed reference frame can be expressed as 20 δ t n r e n t n e σ cos η n cos ξ n ε n sin ξ n ε n sin η n cos ξ n ε n 3 additional mass force in addition the additional mass force of the ith massless spring in the ith cable local coordinate system is defined as f a i and can be expressed as 21 f a i m a i v i i 1 n where m a i is the additional mass matrix of the ith massless spring since towed sonar cable array has a large slenderness ratio the tangential additional mass force of ith massless spring is negligible compared to the normal additional mass force therefore it is reasonable to assume that the towed sonar cable array only has a normal additional mass force the additional mass matrix of the ith massless spring m a i with respect to the ith cable local coordinate system can be represented as 22 m a i ρ w σ k a 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 i 1 n where k a is the additional mass coefficient for towed sonar cable array and k a 1 for the circular section of towed sonar cable array in addition based on the relationship between c i tbn and e xyz the additional mass force of the ith massless spring in the earth fixed reference frame defined as f a i can be expressed as 23 f a i r e i f a i r e i m a i v i i 1 n according to eq 12 v i r e i 1 v e i and f a i can also be expressed as 24 f a i r e i m a i r e i 1 v e i m a i v e i i 1 n where m a i is the additional mass matrix of the ith massless spring in the earth fixed coordinate frame and can be expressed as m a i r e i m a i r e i 1 i 1 n therefore the additional mass force of the ith lumped mass point in the earth fixed coordinate frame is defined as a i and can be determined by eq 25 25 a i m a i m a i 1 2 v i e i 1 n 1 as for the nth lumped mass point the additional mass force in the earth fixed coordinate frame can be expressed as 26 a n m a n v n e 4 drag forces the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller will affect the relative velocity of the lumped mass points and its surrounding fluid and then will affect the drag forces of towed sonar cable array therefore we focused on the drag forces on each lumped mass point by adding the data of the flow field of the underwater vehicle and its propeller firstly the relative velocity of the ith lumped mass point and its surrounding fluid in the earth fixed coordinate frame is defined as v r i e and can be expressed as 27 v r i e v i e u i e i 1 n where u i e is the velocity of fluid around the ith lumped mass point which can be interpolated from the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller determined by cfd method at the position of the ith lumped mass point x i y i z i the method used by albow huang et al is applied to calculate the drag forces of the towed sonar cable array the drag forces of the ith massless spring is divided into two parts tangential drag forces and normal drag forces respectively therefore we convert v r i e into the ith cable local reference frame and the relative velocity of the ith lumped mass point and its surrounding fluid in the ith cable local reference frame is defined as v r i i t r i b r i n r i t where t r i b r i and n r i are components of v r i i in the ith cable local reference frame and v r i i can be expressed as 28 v r i i r i e v r i e r i e v i e u i e i 1 n thus as for the ith massless spring the drag forces in the ith cable local reference frame are defined as d i and can be expressed as 29 d i 1 2 ρ w π 1 ε c t l i d t r i t r i 1 2 ρ w 1 ε c n l i d b r i b r i 1 2 ρ w 1 ε c n l i d n r i n r i i 1 n where c n and c t are the normal drag coefficient and tangential drag coefficient respectively wang et al 2008 after determining the drag forces of the ith massless spring in the ith cable local reference frame we define the drag forces of the ith lumped mass point as d i 30 d i r e i d i r e i 1 d i 1 2 i 1 n 1 as for the nth lumped mass point the drag forces in the earth fixed coordinate frame d n can be determined by 31 d n r e n d n according to eqs 14 19 25 26 30 and 31 the resulting forces of the ith lumped mass point in the earth fixed coordinate frame can be expressed as 32 f i g i b i δ t i a i d i i 1 n 2 4 dynamics model the dynamics model describes the relationship between the resulting forces and the acceleration in section 1 3 we represent the resulting forces of ith lumped mass point in the earth fixed coordinate frame therefore for the ith lumped mass point the newton s second law is applied to obtain the dynamics model of the ith lumped mass point 33 m i v i e f i g i b i δ t i a i d i i 1 n where m i is the mass matrix of the ith lumped mass point and it can be expressed as m i m i i and i is the 3 3 unit matrix v i e denotes the acceleration of the ith lumped mass point in the earth fixed coordinate frame and it can be expressed as v i e x i y i z i t in order to solve eq 33 we move the additional mass force to the left of eq 33 because the additional mass force contains acceleration term and then we obtain the final differential equations of each lumped mass point as follows 34 m i m a i v i e g i b i δ t i d i i 1 n the dynamics model of towed sonar cable array can be obtained by union the differential equations of all lumped mass points in addition the 4th runge kutta method can be used to solve eq 34 3 flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller with the development of the high efficiency computers there are numerous researches using cfd method to predict the wake flow field of underwater vehicles and other underwater vehicles bhattacharyya et al 2016 de barros and dantas 2012 go et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 leong et al 2015 randeni et al 2015 et al go et al 2017 investigated the effect of a duct of naca0015 profile before a propeller on propulsion performance the propeller thrust coefficients torque coefficients the open water efficiency of different ducts were discussed by cfd method leong et al 2015 outlined the steady state interaction forces and moments acting on the auv at different fixed speeds and relative positions to the underwater vehicle based on the cfd method and randeni et al 2015 developed a numerical model to simulate motion of an auv at different lateral and longitudinal positions relative to a larger underwater vehicle using cfd method from the above researches it is obvious that the cfd method is widely used to predict the flied flow of various underwater vehicles therefore cfd method can be used for the numerical simulation of the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller in this paper 3 1 control equations and turbulence models since the underwater vehicle moves under the sea water it is convenient to assume that the underwater vehicle moves in the bounded flow field and the surrounding fluid is a continuous medium and a viscous incompressible fluid thus the flow flied of underwater vehicle and its propeller satisfies the following equation 35 u i x i 0 36 u i t u j u i x j p x i x j γ γ t u i x j u j x i where u i u j i j 1 2 3 are the velocity components of underwater vehicle and x i x j i j 1 2 3 are the position components p is the static pressure and μ is the hydrodynamic viscosity coefficient in addition γ means the kinematic viscosity coefficient and γ t c u k 2 ε is the turbulent viscosity coefficient the rans equation can be solved by adding the r n g k ε two equation turbulence model and the effect of the turbulence vortex on the calculation is fully considered in r n g k ε equations which improves the accuracy of the complex rotational flow field the turbulence kinetic energy equation k equation is 37 t ρ k x i ρ k u i x j α k μ e f f k x j g k g b ρ ε y m the turbulence energy dissipation rate

and p k is the turbulence generating term these parameters are the same as those in the standard model other constants are σ k 1 39 σ ε 1 39 c ε 1 1 42 c ε 2 1 42 c μ 0 0845 η 0 4 38 β 0 012 3 2 geometric model and meshing the underwater vehicle in this paper is modified from darpa suboff submarine due to the complexity of the geometrical structure of the underwater vehicle and its propeller this paper refers to the multi block hybrid grid method which was used by du et al 2018 to divide the flow field of a propeller to divide the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller the underwater vehicle is cut into two parts at the boundary between the cylindrical section and the tail and the hexagonal structural meshing is carried out respectively additionally the propeller blades are thinner and the tilting angle is larger it is difficult to divide the structured grid therefore the unstructured grid is used to divide the fluid flow of propeller into three parts finally the three grids are merged to form the whole flow field grid in the cfd calculation the calculation of the domain size and grid size have a significant impact on the calculation results in order to verify the reliability of the calculation the calculation domain independence and grid independence are verified in the cfd numerical calculation of the flow field of the underwater vehicle with propeller the propeller rotation model uses the multi motion reference system model provided in the fluent the inlet adopts the speed inlet boundary condition the outlet uses the pressure outlet boundary condition the interface is used for each grid interface and the non slip wall surface is selected for the blade and the underwater vehicle wall surface the rotating surface and the fixed interface are set to rotating periodic interface to transmit data and set the propeller rotation with the mrf model the discretization of the control equations uses a separate implicit algorithm and pressure dispersion is in standard format first the low order format is used for discrete and after convergence the high order format is used to accelerate convergence the number of grids is adjusted by adjusting the size of the first layer grid and the number of nodes the calculation results of calculation domain independence test and grid independence test are shown in table 1 and table 2 respectively it can be seen from table 1 that as the size of the calculation domain increases the drag coefficient of underwater vehicle gradually converges when the calculation domain size is 50 m 50 m 655m the drag coefficient has converged and it can be seen from table 2 that the drag coefficient of underwater vehicle gradually converges as the number of meshes increases when the number of mesh is 6 16 million the drag coefficient has converged and the grid is shown in fig 4 the entrance is set at 194m in front of the underwater vehicle head and the exit is set at 400m from the underwater vehicle tail and the entrance of the calculation domain is set as the square of 50 m 50 m in addition to the propeller using the unstructured grid the rest are structured grid a triangular prism boundary layer is constructed around the propeller blades to better capture the flow field information and all the determinant values of all the structured grid are above 0 5 and all the determinant values of all the unstructured grid are above 0 2 which satisfies the computational requirements so finally the calculation domain selects of 50 m 50 m 655m size and the mesh number of 6 16 million is used for all numerical simulations 3 3 numerical simulation of flow field based on the established calculation model for flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller the flow field data of the underwater vehicle and its propeller at velocities of from 4kn to 8kn with an interval of 1kn are calculated by cfd numerical simulation which is used to simulate the dynamic behavior of the towed sonar cable array fig 5 presents the fluid field of the underwater vehicle and its propeller in different vertical slice planes with same interval when the velocity of underwater vehicle is 4kn it can be seen from fig 5 that the propeller causes the rotation of flow field and leads to the emergence of speed u y in s y direction and u z speed in s y direction which will influence the dynamic behavior of towed sonar cable array in addition the speed u x in s x direction of the flow field behind the propeller is increased but the speed u x in s x direction of the other area is almost unchanged in addition the speed u y in s y direction of the left half part of the flow field becomes positive while the speed u y in s y direction of the right half part of the flow field is negative the speed u z in s z direction of the upper part of the flow field becomes positive while the speed u z in s z direction of the lower part of the flow field becomes negative 3 4 data output and interpolation method in this section we export the flow field data of underwater vehicle and its propeller we only export the flow field data of underwater vehicle and its propeller in different vertical slice planes with same interval due to the large size of the flow field data the schematic diagram of vertical slice planes used to export the flow field data is shown in fig 6 from fig 6 we set a vertical slice plane to export the flow field data of underwater vehicle and its propeller every 0 5 m from the link point therefore the flow field data can be defined as 40 data data 1 data 2 data k t where k denotes number of the vertical slice planes data j j 1 2 k is the flow field data of jth vertical slice plane and can be expressed as 41 data j x j y j z j u x j u y j u z j j 1 2 k where x j y j and z j are the position components of all grid nodes of the jth vertical slice plane in the underwater vehicle body fixed reference frame and u x i u y i and u z i are the velocity components of all grid nodes of the jth vertical slice plane in the underwater vehicle body fixed reference frame therefore if we determine the position of the ith lumped mass point in the underwater vehicle body fixed reference frame p i s as shown in fig 6 the velocity of the fluid around the ith lumped mass point in the underwater vehicle body fixed reference frame u i s can be determined by interpolation method as following 42 u i s φ data p i s where φ denotes the constructed interpolation function to calculate the u i s and according to the fig 6 the p i s can be expressed as 43 p i s p i e p s e x i x s y i y s z i z s therefore the velocity of the fluid around the ith lumped mass point in the earth fixed reference frame u i e can be expressed as 44 u i e r e s u i s r e s φ data x i x s y i y s z i z s 4 simulations and discussion in this section we analyze the dynamic behavior of the towed sonar cable array under the influence of the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller and propose a simulation method based on the motion model of the towed sonar cable array and the flow field data of underwater vehicle and its propeller 4 1 simulation method to solve the motion model of towed sonar cable array we firstly convert eq 34 into the following form 45 v i e m i m a i 1 g i b i δ t i d i p i e v i e i 1 n equation 45 are two first order differential equations and can be solved using 4th runge kutta method in addition the simulation procedure for complete system is shown in fig 7 the steps in the simulation procedure are as follows 1 initialize the parameters of towed sonar cable array and underwater vehicle including the time step and stop time of the simulation the velocity and motion mode of underwater vehicle and initial states of all lumped mass points and underwater vehicle according to table 3 and table 4 2 solve the motion model of towed sonar cable array including calculate the velocity of flow field at the positions of all lumped mass points by eq 44 calculate the forces of each lumped mass point in section 1 3 and solve eq 45 by 4th runge kutta method 3 update states of all lumped mass points 4 iterate 2 3 until the simulation termination time is reached 4 2 motion simulations based on the simulation method of the towing sonar cable array proposed in section 3 1 we simulate the dynamic behavior of towing sonar cable array when underwater vehicle moves in different motion mode and different speed 4 2 1 linear motion firstly we develop the dynamic behavior simulation of towed sonar cable array when the underwater vehicle performs linear motions fig 8 is the 3d shape of towed sonar cable array when the speed of underwater vehicle is 4kn 6kn and 8kn respectively and fig 9 is the steady shape of towed sonar cable array with different speeds of underwater vehicle from figs 8 and 9 due to the influence of the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller the shape of the towed sonar cable array produces a lateral deflection gradually and becomes steady finally in addition the degree and the direction of lateral deflection are related to the speed of the underwater vehicle when the speed of underwater vehicle is 4kn the lateral deflected distance of towed sonar cable array is about 0 15m however this lateral deflected distance becomes about 0 61m when the speed of underwater vehicle is 8kn the distance between the end and the top of the towed cable is about 6 68m when the speed of underwater vehicle is 4kn however this distance becomes 3 7m when the speed of underwater vehicle is 8kn the reason for this phenomenon is that the different underwater vehicle speeds result in different distribution of the towed sonar cable array at the fluid flow of underwater vehicle and its propeller when the speed of underwater vehicle is 4kn most of towed sonar cable array is located at the lower half part of flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller therefore the towed sonar cable array is deflected in the negative direction of s z however when the speed underwater vehicle increases to 6kn most of towed sonar cable array is located at the upper half part of flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller under the influence of the flow field the towed sonar cable array is deflected in the s z direction in addition the greater the speed of underwater vehicle the greater the speed in s z direction of flow field so the greater the degree of lateral deflection of towed sonar cable array 4 2 2 turning motion in this section we develop the dynamic behavior simulation of towed sonar cable array when the underwater vehicle performs turning motions fig 10 is the 3d shape of towed sonar cable array when the speed of underwater vehicle is 4kn 6kn and 8kn respectively and fig 11 is the 3d shape of the towed sonar cable array at different speeds in fig 10 at different yaw angles of the underwater vehicle as shown in figs 10 and 11 the shape of the towed sonar cable array changes continuously with the turning motion of the underwater vehicle when the underwater vehicle is gradually accelerated from the initial position for the turning motion the shape of the towed sonar cable array fluctuates and the end of the towed sonar cable array is slightly lowered then as the underwater vehicle gradually moves the part of the towed sonar cable array in the wake of the underwater vehicle gradually increases and the end of the towed sonar cable array gradually rises obviously when the yaw angle of the underwater vehicle is around 90 the shape of the towed sonar cable array has changed a lot because when the yaw angle of the underwater vehicle gradually increases to nearly 90 and the towed sonar cable array has not been in a steady state before this that is the influence of the wake flow field of the underwater vehicle that the cable is subjected tois gradually reduced then the shape of the towed sonar cable array fluctuates in the part of the wake flow field under the wake flow field change with the movement of the underwater vehicle the towed sonar cable array entering the wake flow field is more and more until the shape of the entire towed sonar cable array reaches a relatively dynamic state since the wake flow field of the underwater vehicle is unsteady the towed sonar cable array is unlikely to reach an absolute dynamic state so the shape of the towed sonar cable array is easily affected by the wake flow field variation of the underwater vehicle and this also explains the apparent change in the shape of the towed sonar cable array when the yaw angle of the underwater vehicle is around 180 and 270 in addition the degree of shape change of the towed sonar cable array is related to the speed of the underwater vehicle the greater the speed of the underwater vehicle the more obvious the shape change of the towed sonar cable array 4 2 3 surfacing motion in addition we investigate the dynamic behavior simulation of towed sonar cable array when the underwater vehicle performs the surfacing motion in this section fig 12 is the 3d shape of towed sonar cable array when the speed of underwater vehicle is 4kn 5kn and 6kn respectively and fig 13 is steady shape of the towed sonar cable array when underwater vehicle performs surfacing motion from figs 12 and 13 the shape of towed sonar cable array when underwater vehicle performs surfacing motion is similar to the shape of towed sonar cable array when underwater vehicle performs linear motion due to the influence of the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller the shape of the towed sonar cable array produces a lateral deflection gradually and becomes steady during the simulation in addition the degree and the direction of lateral deflection are related to the speed of the underwater vehicle as the speed of underwater vehicle increases the degree of shape deflection of the towed sonar cable array decreases firstly and then increases and the direction of shape deflection changes from the negative s z direction to the positive s z direction when the speed of underwater vehicle is 4kn the lateral deflected distance of towed sonar cable array is about 0 15m however this lateral deflected distance becomes about 0 18m when the speed of underwater vehicle is 6kn in addition the position of the end of the towed sonar cable array has increased as the speed of underwater vehicle increases the distance between the end and the top of the towed cable is about 32 77m when the speed of underwater vehicle is 4kn however this distance becomes 30 68m when the speed of underwater vehicle is 6kn the reason for this phenomenon is similar to that when underwater vehicle performs linear motion different underwater vehicle speeds result in different distribution of the towed sonar cable array at the fluid flow of underwater vehicle and its propeller when the underwater vehicle performs the surfacing motion when the speed of underwater vehicle is 4kn most of towed sonar cable array is located at the lower half part of flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller therefore the towed sonar cable array is deflected in the negative s z direction however when the speed underwater vehicle increases to 6kn most of towed sonar cable array is located at the upper half part of flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller under the influence of the flow field the towed sonar cable array is deflected in the positive s z direction 5 conclusions in order to analyze influence of underwater vehicle flow field on the dynamic behavior of towed sonar cable array located on the upper fin a numerical method is proposed in this paper firstly the lumped mass method is used to solve the nonlinearity of the towed sonar cable array by discretizing towed sonar cable array into a series of massless springs and lumped mass points considering the influence of flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller 3d motion model of towed sonar cable array is established by forces analysis of each lumped mass point and applying newton s second law to each lumped mass point secondly the flow field data of the underwater vehicle and its propeller is obtained by cfd method which is added into the dynamic behavior simulations of towed sonar cable array by interpolation method finally simulations of three underwater vehicle s motion modes including linear motion turning motion and surfacing motion are performed the simulation results show that 1 the numerical simulation method proposed in this paper to analyze the influence of flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller on the dynamic behavior of towed sonar cable array is reasonable 2 the flow field of underwater vehicle will rotate because of the propeller which will influence the dynamic behavior of towed sonar cable array 3 when underwater vehicle performs different motions the distribution of towed sonar cable array in the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller is different which results in the different deflection degree and direction of towed sonar cable array 4 when underwater vehicle performs linear motion and surfacing motion the shape of the towed sonar cable array produces a lateral deflection at the beginning and becomes steady gradually during the simulation however when underwater vehicle performs turning motions the yaw angle of underwater vehicle changes during the simulation which will result in the different distribution of towed sonar cable array therefore the shape deflection of towed sonar cable array is related to the yaw angle of underwater vehicle 5 the shape of towed sonar cable array is related to the speed of underwater vehicle the greater the speed of underwater vehicle the greater the resistance on towed sonar cable array the smaller the distance between the end and the top of towed sonar cable array and the greater the part of towed sonar cable array in the upper part of the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller therefore the direction of shape deflection of towed sonar cable array changes from the negative s z direction to the positive s z direction and the degree of shape deflection of towed sonar cable array increases gradually as the speed of underwater vehicle increases 
22957,simulations of the dynamic behavior of a sonar cable array towed by an underwater vehicle considering the influence of flow field disturbed by the underwater vehicle and its propeller are challenging tasks in present paper the strongly nonlinear towed sonar cable array is modeled by the lumped mass method where the cable array is discretized into a series of massless springs and lumped mass points the drag force on the towed sonar cable array is obtained by calculating the drag force on each lumped mass point considering the flow field of the underwater vehicle and its propeller which is computed by cfd methods the dynamic behavior of the towed sonar cable array is simulated by 4th runge kutta method applying newton s second law simulations of the three underwater vehicle motion modes including linear motions turning motions and surfacing motions are performed the results show that the numerical method proposed is reasonable and the lateral deflection of the towed sonar cable array is related to the speeds and the motion modes of the underwater vehicle keywords towed sonar cable array flow field dynamic behavior lumped mass method 1 introduction with the development of the economy the needs for ocean exploration technology and military anti underwater vehicle technology have promoted the development of towed sonar cable array technology the rapid development of towed sonar cable array technology makes it increasingly becoming an indispensable technology for modern ocean exploration and energy development towed sonar cable array has an extremely important significance in the application of the underwater vehicle which not only improves the distance of underwater vehicle passive detection but also greatly enhances the survival and combat capability of an underwater vehicle towed sonar cable array is usually installed on the tail of an underwater vehicle therefore the dynamic behavior of the towed sonar cable array will inevitably be affected by the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller which leads to the lateral deflection in the shape of the towed sonar array and even affects the safety of the underwater vehicle therefore it is of great significance to study the influence of the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller on the dynamic behavior of towed sonar cable array however there is few numerical methods used to analyze the influence of underwater vehicle flow field on dynamic behavior of towed sonar cable array for most motion simulation studies of underwater towed cable system the influence of the flow field of the tug or underwater vehicle on dynamic behavior of underwater towed cable was often ignored in simulation the focus of their researches was the influence of different motion modes of tug or underwater vehicle and different boundary conditions on dynamic behavior of underwater towed cable vu et al 2017 used the catenary equations to establish the dynamic equation of the underwater cable applying the shooting method to solve the two point boundary value problem of the cable catenary equation and established the motion model of the underwater vehicle with the effect of the cable the motion simulations of the underwater vehicle ascending turning and shaking were carried out gonzález et al 2017 presented two new simulation methods which include spring based cable model and multi body cable model for simulating the cable pay out and reel in with towed fishing gears through comparative analysis the two methods should be selected when addressing a given application because both methods have advantages and limitations zhu et al 2015 2016a b 2017 established the numerical modeling of a spar platform tethered by a mooring cable with a spherical joint based on the lumped mass method the effect of the buoyancy hydrodynamic drag force and the effect of the added mass and froude krylov force were considered in their work finally the dynamic behavior of the spar platform was simulated by numerical simulation pereira et al 2013 and gomes et al 2016 presented a new dynamic modeling of cables by approximating the continuous flexibility of the cable by several rigid links connected by fictitious elastic joints the dynamic behaviors of the cable where simulated in both air and water however based on the euler lagrange equations the size of dynamic equations of the cable can be increased significantly with the growth of the number of links as for the system consisted of the near surface underwater vehicle the cable and the underwater trailer park and kim 2015 established the motion equations of the cable applying the absolute nodal coordinate method also the dynamic model of the whole multi body system based on the multi body system dynamics method was established and the motion simulations were carried out wang and sun 2015 developed the dynamic model of cable based on the ablow s classical model and overemphasized the numerical algorithm the dynamic response of a towed cable system to ship maneuver was parametrically simulated with three dimensionless parameters ratio of total length to turning radius ratio of cable mass to vehicle mass and ratio of mass unit length to hydrodynamic force based on lumped mass method wang et al 2008 dispersed the cable into a series of massless springs and lumped mass points and established the dynamic model of the cable the dynamic response of the cable with variable length and the dynamic behavior when the cable contacted the seabed was simulated although there are numerous researches studying the dynamic behavior of underwater towed cable systems there is little research to analyze the influence of the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller on the towed sonar cable array therefore there is an urgent need to propose a numerical method to study the influence of underwater vehicle flow field on the dynamic behavior of towed sonar cable array therefore this paper presented a numerical method for analyzing the influence of flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller on the dynamic behavior of towed sonar cable array firstly based on the lumped mass method the towed sonar array was discretized into a series of massless springs and lumped mass points which solves the problem of strong nonlinearity of the towed sonar cable array after the force analysis of each lumped mass point the 3d motion model of towed sonar cable array was established by applying newton s second law for each lumped mass point in addition the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller will affect the relative velocity of the lumped mass points and its surrounding fluid and then will affect the drag forces of towed sonar cable array thus in force analysis of each lumped mass point we focused on the drag forces of each lumped mass point by adding the data of the flow field of the underwater vehicle and its propeller secondly the data of flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller was calculated through cfd method and only the flow field data in different vertical slice planes with same interval were extracted due to the large size of the data thirdly to examine the influence of motion modes of underwater vehicle on the dynamic behavior of towed sonar cable array simulations of the three motion modes of underwater vehicle including linear motion turning motion surfacing motion were performed the flow field data of lumped mass points was obtained by the interpolation method according to the relative position of lumped mass points in the flow the simulation results identified the interaction of the flow flied on the dynamic behavior of towed sonar cable array 2 motion model of towed sonar cable array the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller causes some effects on the dynamic behavior of the towed sonar cable array therefore establishing the motion model of towed sonar cable array considering the flow field disturbed by underwater vehicle and its propeller is beneficial to the analysis of the dynamic behavior and safety of towed sonar cable array however most researchers neglect this effect due to its complexity in this paper we analyze dynamic behavior of towed sonar cable array affected by the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller in present study the following assumptions are set to develop the motion model of towed sonar cable array affected by the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller 1 the towed sonar cable array is continuous extensible and flexible 2 the bending stiffness and torsional stiffness of the towed sonar cable array are neglected 3 the cross sectional area of the towed sonar cable array will not undergo significant changes due to axial deformation of the towed sonar cable array 4 the forces acting on the towed sonar cable array are the gravity buoyancy tension force and the hydrodynamic force on the towed sonar cable array due to the effect of the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller that can be calculated by the cfd method and the interpolation method 2 1 three coordinate systems according to the assumption 1 and 2 we use lumped mass method to discrete the towed sonar cable array into n massless springs and n lumped mass points which simulate the continuity elasticity and flexibly of towed sonar cable array therefore to develop the motion model of the towed sonar cable array mathematically three reference frames need to be defined it is convenient to define the following three reference frames the underwater vehicle body fixed reference frame s xyz the earth fixed reference frame e xyz and cable local reference frame c i tbn i 1 n fig 1 shows the underwater vehicle towed sonar cable array and the reference frames defined above the origin of the underwater vehicle body fixed reference frame s xyz is located at the geometric center of the underwater vehicle s hull the s x axis is along the direction from tail to the nose the transversal axis s z points to the starboard side of the underwater vehicle and the s y axis is directed from bottom to top which is also known as the normal axis in addition the earth fixed reference frame e xyz is located on the sea level the horizontal axes of e x and e z are perpendicular to the gravity and the e y axis is stretched in the positive direction of the gravity vector on the other hand the cable local reference frame c i t i b i n i is fixed at the ith lumped mass point and the c i t i axes is along the direction from ith lumped mass point to the i 1 th lumped mass point and the c i b i axes and c i n i axes are perpendicular to the c i t i axes from fig 1 we defined the position vector of underwater vehicle in the earth fixed reference frame as p s e x s y s z s t where x s y s and z s are the components of the position vector of underwater vehicle in addition to determine the attitude of the underwater vehicle in earth fixed reference frame the euler angles of underwater vehicle are defined as pitch angle θ yaw angle ψ and roll angle φ as shown in fig 1 and the euler angles of underwater vehicle can express the relationship between s xyz and e xyz the relationships between s xyz and e xyz is expressed as 1 r e s θ ψ φ cos θ cos ψ sin θ cos ψ cos φ sin ψ sin φ sin θ cos ψ sin φ sin ψ cos φ sin θ cos θ cos φ cos θ sin φ cos θ sin ψ sin θ sin ψ cos φ cos ψ sin φ sin θ sin ψ sin φ cos ψ cos φ since the towed sonar cable array is located at the top vertical fin the position vector of the link point in the underwater vehicle body fixed reference frame is defined as p l s x l y l z l t where x l y l and z l are the position components of the link point in the underwater vehicle body fixed reference frame as shown in fig 1 in addition the position of the link also can be determined as p l e x l y l z l t in the earth fixed reference frame where x l y l and z l are the position components of link point in earth fixed reference frame the relationship between p l s and p l e can be determined by the eq 1 and p s e it can be expressed as 2 p l e p s e r e s θ ψ φ p l s in addition the application of the lumped mass method to approximate the shape of the towed sonar cable array allows the whole shape of towed sonar cable array to be determined when the shape of each massless spring and the position of each lumped mass point are known the position vector of the ith lumped mass point in the earth fixed reference frame can be expressed as p i e x i y i z i t where x i y i and z i are the position components of ith lumped mass point in earth fixed reference frame the shape of ith spring can then be defined by the euler angles ξ i η i as shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the euler angles of the ith i 2 n 1 massless spring can be expressed as 3 ξ i arcsin y i y i 1 l i 4 η i arcsin z i z i 1 l i cos ξ i x i x i 1 0 π arcsin z i z i 1 l i cos ξ i x i x i 1 0 where l i is the length of the ith massless spring expressed as l i x i x i 1 2 y i y i 1 2 z i z i 1 2 as for the first massless spring the euler angles can be determined by eqs 5 and 6 5 ξ 1 arcsin y 1 y l l 1 6 η 1 arcsin z 1 z l l 1 cos ξ 1 x 1 x l 0 π arcsin z 1 z l l 1 cos ξ 1 x 1 x l 0 where l 1 is the length of the first massless spring expressed as l 1 x 1 x l 2 y 1 y l 2 z 1 z l 2 therefore the relationship between c i tbn and e xyz can be expressed as 7 r e i cos η i cos ξ i cos η i sin ξ i sin η i sin ξ i cos ξ i 0 sin η i cos ξ i sin η i sin ξ i cos η i considering eqs 1 and 7 the relationship between c i tbn and s xyz can be written as 8 r s i θ ψ φ ξ i η i r s e θ ψ φ r e i ξ i η i where the r s e θ ψ φ means the transpose matrix of r e s θ ψ φ and r s e θ ψ φ r e s θ ψ φ 1 2 2 kinematics model the kinematics model describes the velocity and angular velocity relationship between different reference frames therefore to derive the kinematics model of underwater vehicle we represent the instantaneous velocity and angular velocity of underwater vehicle with respect to the underwater vehicle body fixed reference frame by v s u v w t and w s p q r t respectively in addition the velocity and angular velocity of underwater vehicle in earth fixed reference frame can be expressed as v s e x s y s z s t and w s e θ ψ φ t respectively so the transformation relationship of the translating velocities between the earth fixed reference frame and underwater vehicle body fixed reference frame can be written as 9 v s e r e s v s similarly we can express the relation of angular velocity vector between the earth fixed reference frame and the underwater vehicle body fixed reference frame as 10 w s e t e s w s where 11 t e s 0 sin φ cos φ cos φ tan θ 0 sin φ tan θ 1 tan θ cos φ tan θ sin φ in addition because of the assumption 2 we define that the lumped mass points only have instantaneous translational velocities and the velocity vector of ith lumped mass point with respect to the cable local reference frame can be expressed as v i t i b i n i t and the velocity vector of ith lumped mass point with respect to the earth fixed reference frame can be expressed as v i e x i y i z i t thus the relation of velocity vector between the earth fixed reference frame and the cable local reference frame can be expressed as 12 v i e r e i v i hence the position x s y s z s and the euler angles θ ψ φ of the underwater vehicle with respect to the earth fixed reference frame and the position x i y i z i can be obtained by integrating the corresponding velocities and angler velocities from eqs 9 10 and 12 2 3 forces analysis the forces analysis mainly calculates the external forces on the underwater vehicle and towed sonar cable array in our study we assume that underwater vehicle has a very precise control system to perform the steady movement therefore the underwater vehicle only performs steady movements and the forces analysis of underwater vehicle is ignored in this paper we only analyze the forces of towed sonar cable array in addition the forces analysis of towed sonar cable array transforms into the forces analysis of each lumped mass point based on the lumped mass method according to the assumption 4 there are at least five components that contribute to the forces on the each lumped mass point 1 gravity force which is due to self weight of each lumped mass point 2 buoyancy force which is equal to the weight of its displaced fluid 3 tension which are due to the massless spring 4 additional mass force which is due to the accelerated movement of towed sonar cable array 5 drag forces which are due to flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller these five forces are shown in fig 3 1 gravity force and buoyancy force according to the fig 4 the gravity force and buoyancy force of the ith lumped mass point can be defined as g i and b i respectively and they can be expressed as 17 g i b i m i g ρ w σ i l i g as for the nth lumped mass point the tension will be expressed as 18 δ t n t n e σ ε n t n based on the relationship between c i tbn and e xyz the tension of the ith i 1 n 1 lumped mass point in the earth fixed reference frame can be expressed as 19 δ t i r e i t i r e i 1 t i 1 e σ cos η i cos ξ i ε i cos η i 1 cos ξ i 1 ε i 1 sin ξ i ε i sin ξ i 1 ε i 1 sin η i cos ξ i ε i sin η i 1 cos ξ i 1 ε i 1 i 1 n 1 similarly the tension of the nth lumped mass point in the earth fixed reference frame can be expressed as 20 δ t n r e n t n e σ cos η n cos ξ n ε n sin ξ n ε n sin η n cos ξ n ε n 3 additional mass force in addition the additional mass force of the ith massless spring in the ith cable local coordinate system is defined as f a i and can be expressed as 21 f a i m a i v i i 1 n where m a i is the additional mass matrix of the ith massless spring since towed sonar cable array has a large slenderness ratio the tangential additional mass force of ith massless spring is negligible compared to the normal additional mass force therefore it is reasonable to assume that the towed sonar cable array only has a normal additional mass force the additional mass matrix of the ith massless spring m a i with respect to the ith cable local coordinate system can be represented as 22 m a i ρ w σ k a 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 i 1 n where k a is the additional mass coefficient for towed sonar cable array and k a 1 for the circular section of towed sonar cable array in addition based on the relationship between c i tbn and e xyz the additional mass force of the ith massless spring in the earth fixed reference frame defined as f a i can be expressed as 23 f a i r e i f a i r e i m a i v i i 1 n according to eq 12 v i r e i 1 v e i and f a i can also be expressed as 24 f a i r e i m a i r e i 1 v e i m a i v e i i 1 n where m a i is the additional mass matrix of the ith massless spring in the earth fixed coordinate frame and can be expressed as m a i r e i m a i r e i 1 i 1 n therefore the additional mass force of the ith lumped mass point in the earth fixed coordinate frame is defined as a i and can be determined by eq 25 25 a i m a i m a i 1 2 v i e i 1 n 1 as for the nth lumped mass point the additional mass force in the earth fixed coordinate frame can be expressed as 26 a n m a n v n e 4 drag forces the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller will affect the relative velocity of the lumped mass points and its surrounding fluid and then will affect the drag forces of towed sonar cable array therefore we focused on the drag forces on each lumped mass point by adding the data of the flow field of the underwater vehicle and its propeller firstly the relative velocity of the ith lumped mass point and its surrounding fluid in the earth fixed coordinate frame is defined as v r i e and can be expressed as 27 v r i e v i e u i e i 1 n where u i e is the velocity of fluid around the ith lumped mass point which can be interpolated from the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller determined by cfd method at the position of the ith lumped mass point x i y i z i the method used by albow huang et al is applied to calculate the drag forces of the towed sonar cable array the drag forces of the ith massless spring is divided into two parts tangential drag forces and normal drag forces respectively therefore we convert v r i e into the ith cable local reference frame and the relative velocity of the ith lumped mass point and its surrounding fluid in the ith cable local reference frame is defined as v r i i t r i b r i n r i t where t r i b r i and n r i are components of v r i i in the ith cable local reference frame and v r i i can be expressed as 28 v r i i r i e v r i e r i e v i e u i e i 1 n thus as for the ith massless spring the drag forces in the ith cable local reference frame are defined as d i and can be expressed as 29 d i 1 2 ρ w π 1 ε c t l i d t r i t r i 1 2 ρ w 1 ε c n l i d b r i b r i 1 2 ρ w 1 ε c n l i d n r i n r i i 1 n where c n and c t are the normal drag coefficient and tangential drag coefficient respectively wang et al 2008 after determining the drag forces of the ith massless spring in the ith cable local reference frame we define the drag forces of the ith lumped mass point as d i 30 d i r e i d i r e i 1 d i 1 2 i 1 n 1 as for the nth lumped mass point the drag forces in the earth fixed coordinate frame d n can be determined by 31 d n r e n d n according to eqs 14 19 25 26 30 and 31 the resulting forces of the ith lumped mass point in the earth fixed coordinate frame can be expressed as 32 f i g i b i δ t i a i d i i 1 n 2 4 dynamics model the dynamics model describes the relationship between the resulting forces and the acceleration in section 1 3 we represent the resulting forces of ith lumped mass point in the earth fixed coordinate frame therefore for the ith lumped mass point the newton s second law is applied to obtain the dynamics model of the ith lumped mass point 33 m i v i e f i g i b i δ t i a i d i i 1 n where m i is the mass matrix of the ith lumped mass point and it can be expressed as m i m i i and i is the 3 3 unit matrix v i e denotes the acceleration of the ith lumped mass point in the earth fixed coordinate frame and it can be expressed as v i e x i y i z i t in order to solve eq 33 we move the additional mass force to the left of eq 33 because the additional mass force contains acceleration term and then we obtain the final differential equations of each lumped mass point as follows 34 m i m a i v i e g i b i δ t i d i i 1 n the dynamics model of towed sonar cable array can be obtained by union the differential equations of all lumped mass points in addition the 4th runge kutta method can be used to solve eq 34 3 flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller with the development of the high efficiency computers there are numerous researches using cfd method to predict the wake flow field of underwater vehicles and other underwater vehicles bhattacharyya et al 2016 de barros and dantas 2012 go et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 leong et al 2015 randeni et al 2015 et al go et al 2017 investigated the effect of a duct of naca0015 profile before a propeller on propulsion performance the propeller thrust coefficients torque coefficients the open water efficiency of different ducts were discussed by cfd method leong et al 2015 outlined the steady state interaction forces and moments acting on the auv at different fixed speeds and relative positions to the underwater vehicle based on the cfd method and randeni et al 2015 developed a numerical model to simulate motion of an auv at different lateral and longitudinal positions relative to a larger underwater vehicle using cfd method from the above researches it is obvious that the cfd method is widely used to predict the flied flow of various underwater vehicles therefore cfd method can be used for the numerical simulation of the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller in this paper 3 1 control equations and turbulence models since the underwater vehicle moves under the sea water it is convenient to assume that the underwater vehicle moves in the bounded flow field and the surrounding fluid is a continuous medium and a viscous incompressible fluid thus the flow flied of underwater vehicle and its propeller satisfies the following equation 35 u i x i 0 36 u i t u j u i x j p x i x j γ γ t u i x j u j x i where u i u j i j 1 2 3 are the velocity components of underwater vehicle and x i x j i j 1 2 3 are the position components p is the static pressure and μ is the hydrodynamic viscosity coefficient in addition γ means the kinematic viscosity coefficient and γ t c u k 2 ε is the turbulent viscosity coefficient the rans equation can be solved by adding the r n g k ε two equation turbulence model and the effect of the turbulence vortex on the calculation is fully considered in r n g k ε equations which improves the accuracy of the complex rotational flow field the turbulence kinetic energy equation k equation is 37 t ρ k x i ρ k u i x j α k μ e f f k x j g k g b ρ ε y m the turbulence energy dissipation rate

geometric model and meshing the underwater vehicle in this paper is modified from darpa suboff submarine due to the complexity of the geometrical structure of the underwater vehicle and its propeller this paper refers to the multi block hybrid grid method which was used by du et al 2018 to divide the flow field of a propeller to divide the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller the underwater vehicle is cut into two parts at the boundary between the cylindrical section and the tail and the hexagonal structural meshing is carried out respectively additionally the propeller blades are thinner and the tilting angle is larger it is difficult to divide the structured grid therefore the unstructured grid is used to divide the fluid flow of propeller into three parts finally the three grids are merged to form the whole flow field grid in the cfd calculation the calculation of the domain size and grid size have a significant impact on the calculation results in order to verify the reliability of the calculation the calculation domain independence and grid independence are verified in the cfd numerical calculation of the flow field of the underwater vehicle with propeller the propeller rotation model uses the multi motion reference system model provided in the fluent the inlet adopts the speed inlet boundary condition the outlet uses the pressure outlet boundary condition the interface is used for each grid interface and the non slip wall surface is selected for the blade and the underwater vehicle wall surface the rotating surface and the fixed interface are set to rotating periodic interface to transmit data and set the propeller rotation with the mrf model the discretization of the control equations uses a separate implicit algorithm and pressure dispersion is in standard format first the low order format is used for discrete and after convergence the high order format is used to accelerate convergence the number of grids is adjusted by adjusting the size of the first layer grid and the number of nodes the calculation results of calculation domain independence test and grid independence test are shown in table 1 and table 2 respectively it can be seen from table 1 that as the size of the calculation domain increases the drag coefficient of underwater vehicle gradually converges when the calculation domain size is 50 m 50 m 655m the drag coefficient has converged and it can be seen from table 2 that the drag coefficient of underwater vehicle gradually converges as the number of meshes increases when the number of mesh is 6 16 million the drag coefficient has converged and the grid is shown in fig 4 the entrance is set at 194m in front of the underwater vehicle head and the exit is set at 400m from the underwater vehicle tail and the entrance of the calculation domain is set as the square of 50 m 50 m in addition to the propeller using the unstructured grid the rest are structured grid a triangular prism boundary layer is constructed around the propeller blades to better capture the flow field information and all the determinant values of all the structured grid are above 0 5 and all the determinant values of all the unstructured grid are above 0 2 which satisfies the computational requirements so finally the calculation domain selects of 50 m 50 m 655m size and the mesh number of 6 16 million is used for all numerical simulations 3 3 numerical simulation of flow field based on the established calculation model for flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller the flow field data of the underwater vehicle and its propeller at velocities of from 4kn to 8kn with an interval of 1kn are calculated by cfd numerical simulation which is used to simulate the dynamic behavior of the towed sonar cable array fig 5 presents the fluid field of the underwater vehicle and its propeller in different vertical slice planes with same interval when the velocity of underwater vehicle is 4kn it can be seen from fig 5 that the propeller causes the rotation of flow field and leads to the emergence of speed u y in s y direction and u z speed in s y direction which will influence the dynamic behavior of towed sonar cable array in addition the speed u x in s x direction of the flow field behind the propeller is increased but the speed u x in s x direction of the other area is almost unchanged in addition the speed u y in s y direction of the left half part of the flow field becomes positive while the speed u y in s y direction of the right half part of the flow field is negative the speed u z in s z direction of the upper part of the flow field becomes positive while the speed u z in s z direction of the lower part of the flow field becomes negative 3 4 data output and interpolation method in this section we export the flow field data of underwater vehicle and its propeller we only export the flow field data of underwater vehicle and its propeller in different vertical slice planes with same interval due to the large size of the flow field data the schematic diagram of vertical slice planes used to export the flow field data is shown in fig 6 from fig 6 we set a vertical slice plane to export the flow field data of underwater vehicle and its propeller every 0 5 m from the link point therefore the flow field data can be defined as 40 data data 1 data 2 data k t where k denotes number of the vertical slice planes data j j 1 2 k is the flow field data of jth vertical slice plane and can be expressed as 41 data j x j y j z j u x j u y j u z j j 1 2 k where x j y j and z j are the position components of all grid nodes of the jth vertical slice plane in the underwater vehicle body fixed reference frame and u x i u y i and u z i are the velocity components of all grid nodes of the jth vertical slice plane in the underwater vehicle body fixed reference frame therefore if we determine the position of the ith lumped mass point in the underwater vehicle body fixed reference frame p i s as shown in fig 6 the velocity of the fluid around the ith lumped mass point in the underwater vehicle body fixed reference frame u i s can be determined by interpolation method as following 42 u i s φ data p i s where φ denotes the constructed interpolation function to calculate the u i s and according to the fig 6 the p i s can be expressed as 43 p i s p i e p s e x i x s y i y s z i z s therefore the velocity of the fluid around the ith lumped mass point in the earth fixed reference frame u i e can be expressed as 44 u i e r e s u i s r e s φ data x i x s y i y s z i z s 4 simulations and discussion in this section we analyze the dynamic behavior of the towed sonar cable array under the influence of the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller and propose a simulation method based on the motion model of the towed sonar cable array and the flow field data of underwater vehicle and its propeller 4 1 simulation method to solve the motion model of towed sonar cable array we firstly convert eq 34 into the following form 45 v i e m i m a i 1 g i b i δ t i d i p i e v i e i 1 n equation 45 are two first order differential equations and can be solved using 4th runge kutta method in addition the simulation procedure for complete system is shown in fig 7 the steps in the simulation procedure are as follows 1 initialize the parameters of towed sonar cable array and underwater vehicle including the time step and stop time of the simulation the velocity and motion mode of underwater vehicle and initial states of all lumped mass points and underwater vehicle according to table 3 and table 4 2 solve the motion model of towed sonar cable array including calculate the velocity of flow field at the positions of all lumped mass points by eq 44 calculate the forces of each lumped mass point in section 1 3 and solve eq 45 by 4th runge kutta method 3 update states of all lumped mass points 4 iterate 2 3 until the simulation termination time is reached 4 2 motion simulations based on the simulation method of the towing sonar cable array proposed in section 3 1 we simulate the dynamic behavior of towing sonar cable array when underwater vehicle moves in different motion mode and different speed 4 2 1 linear motion firstly we develop the dynamic behavior simulation of towed sonar cable array when the underwater vehicle performs linear motions fig 8 is the 3d shape of towed sonar cable array when the speed of underwater vehicle is 4kn 6kn and 8kn respectively and fig 9 is the steady shape of towed sonar cable array with different speeds of underwater vehicle from figs 8 and 9 due to the influence of the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller the shape of the towed sonar cable array produces a lateral deflection gradually and becomes steady finally in addition the degree and the direction of lateral deflection are related to the speed of the underwater vehicle when the speed of underwater vehicle is 4kn the lateral deflected distance of towed sonar cable array is about 0 15m however this lateral deflected distance becomes about 0 61m when the speed of underwater vehicle is 8kn the distance between the end and the top of the towed cable is about 6 68m when the speed of underwater vehicle is 4kn however this distance becomes 3 7m when the speed of underwater vehicle is 8kn the reason for this phenomenon is that the different underwater vehicle speeds result in different distribution of the towed sonar cable array at the fluid flow of underwater vehicle and its propeller when the speed of underwater vehicle is 4kn most of towed sonar cable array is located at the lower half part of flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller therefore the towed sonar cable array is deflected in the negative direction of s z however when the speed underwater vehicle increases to 6kn most of towed sonar cable array is located at the upper half part of flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller under the influence of the flow field the towed sonar cable array is deflected in the s z direction in addition the greater the speed of underwater vehicle the greater the speed in s z direction of flow field so the greater the degree of lateral deflection of towed sonar cable array 4 2 2 turning motion in this section we develop the dynamic behavior simulation of towed sonar cable array when the underwater vehicle performs turning motions fig 10 is the 3d shape of towed sonar cable array when the speed of underwater vehicle is 4kn 6kn and 8kn respectively and fig 11 is the 3d shape of the towed sonar cable array at different speeds in fig 10 at different yaw angles of the underwater vehicle as shown in figs 10 and 11 the shape of the towed sonar cable array changes continuously with the turning motion of the underwater vehicle when the underwater vehicle is gradually accelerated from the initial position for the turning motion the shape of the towed sonar cable array fluctuates and the end of the towed sonar cable array is slightly lowered then as the underwater vehicle gradually moves the part of the towed sonar cable array in the wake of the underwater vehicle gradually increases and the end of the towed sonar cable array gradually rises obviously when the yaw angle of the underwater vehicle is around 90 the shape of the towed sonar cable array has changed a lot because when the yaw angle of the underwater vehicle gradually increases to nearly 90 and the towed sonar cable array has not been in a steady state before this that is the influence of the wake flow field of the underwater vehicle that the cable is subjected tois gradually reduced then the shape of the towed sonar cable array fluctuates in the part of the wake flow field under the wake flow field change with the movement of the underwater vehicle the towed sonar cable array entering the wake flow field is more and more until the shape of the entire towed sonar cable array reaches a relatively dynamic state since the wake flow field of the underwater vehicle is unsteady the towed sonar cable array is unlikely to reach an absolute dynamic state so the shape of the towed sonar cable array is easily affected by the wake flow field variation of the underwater vehicle and this also explains the apparent change in the shape of the towed sonar cable array when the yaw angle of the underwater vehicle is around 180 and 270 in addition the degree of shape change of the towed sonar cable array is related to the speed of the underwater vehicle the greater the speed of the underwater vehicle the more obvious the shape change of the towed sonar cable array 4 2 3 surfacing motion in addition we investigate the dynamic behavior simulation of towed sonar cable array when the underwater vehicle performs the surfacing motion in this section fig 12 is the 3d shape of towed sonar cable array when the speed of underwater vehicle is 4kn 5kn and 6kn respectively and fig 13 is steady shape of the towed sonar cable array when underwater vehicle performs surfacing motion from figs 12 and 13 the shape of towed sonar cable array when underwater vehicle performs surfacing motion is similar to the shape of towed sonar cable array when underwater vehicle performs linear motion due to the influence of the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller the shape of the towed sonar cable array produces a lateral deflection gradually and becomes steady during the simulation in addition the degree and the direction of lateral deflection are related to the speed of the underwater vehicle as the speed of underwater vehicle increases the degree of shape deflection of the towed sonar cable array decreases firstly and then increases and the direction of shape deflection changes from the negative s z direction to the positive s z direction when the speed of underwater vehicle is 4kn the lateral deflected distance of towed sonar cable array is about 0 15m however this lateral deflected distance becomes about 0 18m when the speed of underwater vehicle is 6kn in addition the position of the end of the towed sonar cable array has increased as the speed of underwater vehicle increases the distance between the end and the top of the towed cable is about 32 77m when the speed of underwater vehicle is 4kn however this distance becomes 30 68m when the speed of underwater vehicle is 6kn the reason for this phenomenon is similar to that when underwater vehicle performs linear motion different underwater vehicle speeds result in different distribution of the towed sonar cable array at the fluid flow of underwater vehicle and its propeller when the underwater vehicle performs the surfacing motion when the speed of underwater vehicle is 4kn most of towed sonar cable array is located at the lower half part of flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller therefore the towed sonar cable array is deflected in the negative s z direction however when the speed underwater vehicle increases to 6kn most of towed sonar cable array is located at the upper half part of flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller under the influence of the flow field the towed sonar cable array is deflected in the positive s z direction 5 conclusions in order to analyze influence of underwater vehicle flow field on the dynamic behavior of towed sonar cable array located on the upper fin a numerical method is proposed in this paper firstly the lumped mass method is used to solve the nonlinearity of the towed sonar cable array by discretizing towed sonar cable array into a series of massless springs and lumped mass points considering the influence of flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller 3d motion model of towed sonar cable array is established by forces analysis of each lumped mass point and applying newton s second law to each lumped mass point secondly the flow field data of the underwater vehicle and its propeller is obtained by cfd method which is added into the dynamic behavior simulations of towed sonar cable array by interpolation method finally simulations of three underwater vehicle s motion modes including linear motion turning motion and surfacing motion are performed the simulation results show that 1 the numerical simulation method proposed in this paper to analyze the influence of flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller on the dynamic behavior of towed sonar cable array is reasonable 2 the flow field of underwater vehicle will rotate because of the propeller which will influence the dynamic behavior of towed sonar cable array 3 when underwater vehicle performs different motions the distribution of towed sonar cable array in the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller is different which results in the different deflection degree and direction of towed sonar cable array 4 when underwater vehicle performs linear motion and surfacing motion the shape of the towed sonar cable array produces a lateral deflection at the beginning and becomes steady gradually during the simulation however when underwater vehicle performs turning motions the yaw angle of underwater vehicle changes during the simulation which will result in the different distribution of towed sonar cable array therefore the shape deflection of towed sonar cable array is related to the yaw angle of underwater vehicle 5 the shape of towed sonar cable array is related to the speed of underwater vehicle the greater the speed of underwater vehicle the greater the resistance on towed sonar cable array the smaller the distance between the end and the top of towed sonar cable array and the greater the part of towed sonar cable array in the upper part of the flow field of underwater vehicle and its propeller therefore the direction of shape deflection of towed sonar cable array changes from the negative s z direction to the positive s z direction and the degree of shape deflection of towed sonar cable array increases gradually as the speed of underwater vehicle increases 
22958,based on a substructure experiment the pipe laying process of a deep s lay case is reproduced in the laboratory and the dynamic interaction between the pipeline and stinger rollers is investigated as a key equipment component of the s lay a stinger is used to support the pipe weight and control the bending deformation of the overbend section during the s lay process there exist a variety of strongly nonlinear mechanic behaviors such as the contact interaction between the pipeline and rollers plastic strain and large pipeline deformation owing to these nonlinear behaviors roller force as the most important design loads for the s lay are often difficult to predict accurately during the design stage by means of analytical or numerical methods in contrast model experiments are more accurate and reliable for solving this complex nonlinear mechanics problem in this study the static and dynamic substructure experiments of laying a 12 inch pipe into water at a depth of 3000 m are carried out with a length scale of 1 25 the experimental results indicate that the initial roller heights and amplitudes of the vessel motions have a significant effect on the distribution of roller forces while the stinger provides sufficient length and curvatures for the deep s lay case keywords deep s lay stinger rollers dynamic interaction roller force substructure experiment 1 introduction the s lay is a traditional method for installing subsea pipelines and fig 1 presents a schematic thereof the profile of the pipe segment from the lay vessel to the seabed forms an elongated and declining s shape the pipe configuration can be divided into two regions the overbend section supported by a truss like structure known as the stinger and the sagbend section freely suspended in water in general a pipeline installed by the s lay method undergoes reverse bending deformation at least twice when it passes through the stinger and falls down to the seabed the stinger is a key component of the s lay that prevents the overbend section from excessive deflection and local buckling with an increase in the water depth and pipe diameters the contact interaction between the stinger rollers and overbend segment becomes severe and large roller forces may act on the pipe and stinger structures moreover dynamic influences from the vessel motion can further amplify the interaction forces and pipe and stinger mechanical responses therefore the manner in which to accurately estimate the dynamic interaction between pipe and stinger rollers is a crucial problem in deep s lay design in the past several decades significant attention has been paid to s lay problems different numerical methods have been developed to solve the static configuration and control the maximum bending deformation of the pipeline dareing and neathery 1970 introduced newton s method to solve the nonlinear differential equations of a pipeline laid from a lay barge to the ocean floor palmer 1974 derived the governing equations for a pipe laid from a barge over a stinger and discussed the advantages of the finite difference method in solving the s lay pipe configuration schmidt 1977 established the governing equations for a submarine pipe by means of the potential energy function and introduced a discontinuous foundation modulus to determine the suspended pipe length in the finite element analysis konuk 1980 developed a unified 3d formulation for pipe laying problems according to the rod theory and employed the singular perturbation technique to solve the associated nonlinear equations wang et al 2010 proposed an improved numerical model for investigating the overall pipe configuration installed by s lay taking into account the ocean currents and seabed stiffness yuan et al 2012 investigated the influence of the variation in lift off point and change in the stinger radius on the overall pipe configuration internal forces and pipeline strain by using a simple numerical model o grady and harte 2013 proposed to use a detailed pipe model to study the effects from the residual curvature and pipe roll of the overbend region on the pipeline integrity ivić et al 2014 developed a new method for tensioner modeling by considering the friction contacts between the pipe and the tensioner based on this nonlinear model a sensitivity analysis of main s lay parameters is performed ivić 2015 and the optimization problem of s lay is studied by using a specialized pso method ivić et al 2017 the dynamic influences induced by the ocean waves and vessel motions constitute a further noteworthy problem in the s lay design malahy 1985 presented a nonlinear finite element method for the three dimensional dynamic analysis of the offshore pipe laying problem which utilized nonlinear beam elements and elastic bi linear support elements to simultaneously model the pipeline stinger pipe supports and seabed callegari et al 2003 developed analytical models to study the dynamic pipeline behavior in laying operations and the dynamic equilibrium equations for the pipe model were solved by means of a perturbation technique silva et al 2008 proposed two numerical models that simulated the tensioner behavior and dynamic interaction between the pipe and rollers jensen et al 2010 formulated a nonlinear dynamic partial differential equation which is capable of handling the effects of restoring forces hydrodynamic drag and seabed interaction for marine applications nielsen et al 2013 performed dynamic analysis for the large deformation problem of subsea pipe laying by the absolute nodal coordinate formulation method song et al 2013 proposed a coupling analysis model for the dynamic s lay problem which utilized a generalized elastic contact algorithm to simulate the contact interaction between the overbend pipeline and the rollers on the stinger sun et al 2015 and ai et al 2018 derived the pipeline equilibrium equation based on the lumped mass method and investigated the changes of tensioner force pipeline s effective force bending moment in heave and surge conditions xie et al 2015 analyzed the dynamic process of pipe sliding over the stinger using abaqus software and evaluated the pipe collapse pressure following installation gong et al 2014 2016 employed a comprehensive finite element model for s lay systems to analyze the dynamic laying effects including the surface wave ocean currents vessel motions and clashing contact between the pipeline and stinger rollers although it is convenient to simulate the contact interaction between the pipe and stinger rollers using finite element codes the strong nonlinearity of the contact behaviors in the pipe and roller surfaces can lead to critical convergence problems in solving contact problems moreover owing to the calculation hypothesis established in the finite element method the numerical solutions are often inaccurate and unconvincing considering these reasons it is necessary to also develop experimental methods to investigate the complex s lay contact problems brown and palmer 2007 proposed a 3d physical model technique that provided theoretical support for model scaling of the pipe laying process kulikova et al 2011 studied the effects of the wave current wind and pipe stiffness on the pipeline dynamic behavior by means of a combination model comprising the barge stinger pipe and mooring system xie et al 2013 obtained the dynamic roller forces according to a large scale model experiment and investigated the cyclic plastic deformation of the overbend segment zhang et al 2014 2015 investigated the dynamic loads acting on the stinger of lay vessel hysy201 in the off design conditions by using a middle scaled model experiment and proposed an improved reinforced design for the stinger however relatively few studies have used the experimental methods to study dynamic s lay problems at present published works only consider the dynamic effect from single vessel motion heave roll or pitch on the contact interaction between the pipe and rollers the coupling effects from the heave roll and pitch have not yet been considered in this paper an experimental method based on the substructure technique is introduced to study the dynamic interaction between the pipeline and stinger under the coupling effects of heave roll and pitch a model with a length scale of 1 25 is fabricated and model experiments are carried out in the laboratory to study the static and dynamic interaction between the pipe and rollers at a laying depth of 3000 m 2 experimental purpose during the s lay operation a lay barge with an aft stinger will move with six degrees of freedom under the effects of ocean waves these vessel motions surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw have a significant influence on the dynamic responses between the pipeline and stinger structure and must be treated as a crucial design factor for the deep s lay process in general the dynamic positioning system is used by the lay barge to eliminate the surge sway and yaw motions in comparison the heave roll and pitch motions become the dominant factors affecting the dynamic interaction between the stinger and pipeline therefore it is necessary to study the dynamic effects from the coupling motions of heave roll and pitch on the contact forces between the pipeline and roller supports and prevent damage to the pipe structure during the installation stage therefore the goals set by the model experiment are to 1 study the contact interaction between the pipe and rollers under the static and dynamic pipe laying conditions 2 test the stinger laying ability and estimate the pipe installation safety 3 substructure experiment the s lay process involving the vessel important equipment such as the stinger and tensioner and the pipeline is rather complex to be designed experimentally it is difficult and impracticable to imitate the pipe laying process by means of traditional water tank experiments because such an experiment usually models the vessel stinger and pipeline using a small scale which makes it impossible to measure the interaction forces and mechanical responses between the pipe and stinger model accurately however if a large scale model is used instead the vessel model will be too large to move in the water tank for this reason a substructure experiment may provide a feasible solution for studying the dynamic interaction between the pipeline and stinger under a medium or large scale model 3 1 principles of substructure experiment in order to accurately simulate the interaction between the pipe and stinger under gravity load and inertial vessel motions the overbend section of the pipeline and stinger is selected as a substructure of the entire s lay system and this can be modeled on a medium or large scale for an experimental study the other structures in the s lay system such as the lay vessel sagbend section and touch down zone are replaced by the equivalent kinematic conditions and external forces fig 2 presents an overall view of the substructure model experiment a hydraulic drive platform controlled by a computer program simulates the vessel motions with six degrees of freedom the propeller strut of the stinger model is welded to the top of the platform and its main hinge is constrained in the same manner as that of the prototype the overbend pipe model is laid onto the stinger rollers with the upper end fixed on the platform and its lower end is tied with a heavy slider at the lift off position according to the catenary theory or finite element calculations the pipe configuration under certain s lay conditions can be predicted in advance so the total weight of the sagbend section and pipeline departure angle are calculated prior to the experiment then a slider with the same weight as the sagbend model and with the same slope as the lift off position is used in the experiment to represent the internal force from the sagbend section in this study a deep s lay design that lays a 12 in pipe into water with a depth of 3000 m is investigated according to the substructure experiment both static and dynamic conditions are tested in the laboratory 1 static s lay experiment in the static experiment the effects of vessel motions and dynamic fluid forces are not considered the pipe model of the overbend section is slowly placed onto the stinger model static roller forces of different roller supports are measured when the pipe and stinger model reaches equilibrium under the gravity and buoyancy forces 2 dynamic s lay experiment the dynamic experiment considers the coupling motions of the lay barge the water tank experiment provides the coupling motions of the lay barge at different wave directions 150 165 and 180 through the motion scale transformation the platform transmits the inertia motions of the lay vessel to the static equilibrium system of the pipe and stinger model the dynamic roller forces are measured at a frequency of 50 hz 3 2 model similarity in the dynamic experiment if the mechanical response is within the elastic region the similarity relationship of the quantities in the following equation can be determined by dimensional analysis 1 f σ l e ρ t u v a g ω 0 where σ l e ρ t u v a g and ω are the dynamic stress length elastic modulus density time displacement velocity acceleration gravity acceleration and circular frequency respectively selecting the length density and elastic modulus as the basic quantities according to buckingham s π theory buckingham 1914 the other physical quantities can be expressed as 2 f σ e t l ρ e u l v e ρ a e ρ l g e ρ l ω l e ρ 0 in order to maintain the similarity the prototype and model should have the same dimensionless parameters as eq 2 defining λ as the similarity ratio of any physical quantity of the model to that of the prototype the following similarity relationship can be derived 3 λ σ λ e λ t λ l λ ρ λ e λ u λ l λ v λ e λ ρ λ a λ g λ e λ ρ λ l λ ω 1 λ l λ e λ ρ where λ l λ ρ λ e λ σ λ t λ u λ v λ a λ g and λ ω are the similarity ratios of the length density elastic modulus stress time displacement velocity acceleration gravity acceleration and circular frequency respectively however it is rather difficult to meet all of the aforementioned similarity relationships simultaneously this is because the prototype and model experiment use the same gravity acceleration which requires the model to satisfy the following similarity ratios 4 λ a λ g 1 λ e λ ρ λ l assuming that the model uses the same mechanical properties as the prototype the density of the model should be 1 λ l times that of the prototype which causes significant difficulties in finding suitable materials for the model a feasible means of resolving this conflict is by adding extra mass to the model in order to satisfy the density similarity ratio the value of the additional mass can be calculated according to the following equation 5 m a m p λ e λ l 2 m m where m a m p and m m are the extra mass prototype mass and model mass respectively in this study the model is fabricated using a length scale of 1 25 and the parameters of the model are listed in table 1 3 3 pipe model in the s lay the pipeline consists of two parts the sagbend section and the overbend section in the experimental model the sagbend section is replaced by the equivalent boundary conditions and the overbend section is simulated by the pipe model with a length scale of 1 25 the material and cross section properties of the pipe model are listed in table 2 for the sagbend pipeline the model is a long and freely suspended string departing from the stinger roller supports if we truncate the sagbend section at the inflection point affected by the gravity a significant reaction force will occur at the truncated position which tends to pull the overbend section downwards to the seabed as illustrated in fig 3 in order to simulate this reaction force caused by the sagbend section the following assumptions are made for the dynamic model experiment 1 the change in the lift off position induced by the dynamic process is quite small thus the total length and weight of the sagbend pipeline are almost unchanging 2 compared to the reaction force caused by the submerged weight the dynamic fluid forces have small influences on the contact interaction between the pipe and stinger under these assumptions a clump weight on the ramp is a reasonable substitute for the truncated reaction force caused by the sagbend section as illustrated in fig 4 it should be noted that the mass of the clump weight must follow the mass similarity ratio and the slope angle of the ramp should be consistent with the pipe angle at the truncated position the mass of the clump weight and the ramp slope used in this model experiment are listed in table 3 for the overbend section a model with a smaller scale is used to simulate the contact interaction between the pipe and stinger rollers considering the dynamic effects from the vessel the dynamic similarity of the pipe model should be consistent with that of the prototype during the dynamic laying process the main deflection of the overbend pipeline is the bending deformation caused by the gravity and enforced displacement constraints owing to the roller supports therefore the similarity of the mass and bending stiffness should be maintained for the pipe model and prototype in order to obtain an appropriate dynamic response as the pipe model is constructed using the same material as the prototype in this experiment the similarities of the mass and bending stiffness can be expressed by eqs 6 and 7 respectively thus maintaining the geometric similarity of the pipe model and prototype also satisfies the dynamic similarity 6 λ m λ ρ λ v λ l 3 7 λ k λ e λ i λ l 4 3 4 stinger model as illustrated in fig 2 a length scale of 1 25 is adopted to manufacture the stinger model so that the prototype dynamic behaviors can be studied in the laboratory in the practice of s lay several roller boxes and rollers are installed on the stinger to support the submerged pipe weight therefore the designs of the support length roller space and roller height will have certain influences on the roller forces zhang et al 2015 moreover the mass structural stiffness and basic modal frequency of the stinger model should obey the dynamic similarity rules from the perspective of the dynamic experiment furthermore several crucial components of the stinger model such as the a frame the pup piece and main hinge in fig 5 should have the same structural form as the prototype in order to maintain the same force transmission table 4 gives the performance parameters of the pressure sensor used in the experiment pressure sensors are installed at the bottom of the rollers to measure the roller support forces and the sequence numbers of the roller supports are indicated in fig 6 3 5 vessel motions in general a lay barge exhibits six degrees of freedom at sea namely surge sway yaw roll pitch and heave in a deep or ultra deep s lay dynamic positioning systems are usually employed to eliminate the surge sway and yaw motions thus only the heave roll and pitch need to be considered in the dynamic experiment as illustrated in fig 7 an electric platform which can simultaneously simulate vessel motions in different directions is suitable for the experimental requirements the motion performance of this platform is listed in table 5 the heave roll and pitch motions are measured by water tank experiments at harbin engineering university a hull model with a length scale of 1 50 is used in the water tank experiment to simulate the motions of a lay barge in six degrees of freedom the sea state conditions for the s lay design are considered as the significant wave height of 2 5 m the peak wave period of 9s and the wave direction of 150 165 180 the wave direction is defined according to fig 8 figs 9 11 illustrate the time history curves of the vessel motions measured by water tank experiments 4 experimental results 4 1 static experiment during the static experiment it is found that the different roller heights used are prone to affecting the distribution of the static roller forces on the overbend section in order to prevent the overbend section from receiving excessive support forces from the rollers it is preferable to adjust the roller height by forming it into a circular arc with a similar design radius to that of the stinger this will evenly distribute the pipe weight onto the rollers of the stinger and avoid excessive roller forces excessive reaction forces from the rollers may cause the plastic deformation of the pipe section after the pipeline departs from the stinger there still exists some residual ovality and plastic strain in the pipe section which will lower the critical buckling pressure of the pipe section and induce local buckling failure of the pipeline in deep water xie et al 2015 as altering one roller height may change the contact forces from nearby rollers it is often difficult to determine suitable roller heights for all of the rollers in the laboratory we use a curved die with the designed stinger curvature to calculate the preliminary distribution of the roller heights thereafter the pipe model was slowly placed onto the stinger model and the static roller forces were determined using a computer program fig 12 illustrates the static roller forces obtained after adjusting the roller heights the results of the static experiment are compared to the numerical results from offpipe it is observed that the static roller forces of most rollers from both the model experiment and numerical simulation match quite strongly which indicates that the roller height used in the experiment is reasonable however when comparing the experiment to the numerical simulation significant differences are observed in the roller forces of the first roller and the rollers near the stinger tip 4 2 dynamic experiment the dynamic interaction forces between the pipeline and the rollers on the stinger are measured by the pressure sensors when the heave pitch and roll motions of the lay vessel are synchronously considered within a typical period including the initial and increasing processes of the vessel motions the dynamic roller forces measured from different wave conditions are compared in figs 13 15 after being restored to the prototype scale it is observed that the dynamic roller forces fluctuate with the variety of vessel motions in different wave directions for the final roller on the stinger the static and dynamic roller forces remain at zero constantly which indicates that the pipeline departs from the stinger before it contacts the final roller in both the static and dynamic s lay cases as a result the length design of the stinger is sufficient for the deep s lay conditions if the static roller force is denoted as s f i i 1 2 12 and the dynamic roller force is denoted as d f i t i 1 2 12 the dynamic factors of the roller force can be expressed as δ i t d f i t s f i i 1 2 12 δ i t df i t sf 1 the maximum value of is the maximum amplification factor and the minimum value of is the minimum reduction factor of the i th roller during a dynamic experiment table 6 lists the maximum amplification and minimum reduction factors of the roller forces during the dynamic model experiments in general the dynamic roller forces from rollers 5 and 7 vary within a relatively small range of 0 8 1 3 compared to the other rollers the dynamic roller forces from rollers 11 and 12 exhibit the largest range variation where the maximum amplification factor is over 1 7 and the minimum reduction factor is almost zero this result indicates that the two rollers at the stinger tip are quite dangerous in the dynamic s lay process and should be considered in detail in the design stage however in terms of the dynamic effects caused by different wave directions the dynamic factors induced by the wave direction of 165 are significantly larger than those induced by the wave directions of 150 and 180 5 discussion in the experiment the reason for the large difference in roller forces from roller 1 is the lack of several roller supports on the lay barge deck in the static experiment the pipe model hinged at the platform is nearly horizontal while the stinger model is hinged at the platform end when the pipeline is placed on the stinger it deflects directly from the horizontal to the slope of the first stinger section in fact several roller supports should be present on the deck which can gradually bend the horizontal pipe before it contacts the stinger the lack of deck supports in the experiment results in abnormal deflection of the pipeline at the first contact position with the stinger which in turn generates a larger roller force at roller 1 of the stinger model this phenomenon can also be observed in the numerical simulation if the roller supports on the barge deck are not considered in the model from the vessel motions in figs 9 11 and the dynamic roller force results in figs 13 15 it is demonstrated that the amplitudes of the dynamic roller forces mainly depend on the amplitudes of the vessel motions during the initial stage approximately 0 20 s small amplitudes of heave pitch and roll motions are used to activate the platform correspondingly the dynamic roller forces within this time range fluctuate in quite a small range with the increase in vessel motions the dynamic roller forces increase in a similar mode to the vessel motions moreover the dynamic experiment results prove that the heave motion is the dominant factor affecting the dynamic interaction between the pipeline and stinger this is evidenced in the time history curve of heave motion the mean values of the heave motions from different wave directions exhibit significant differences a similar feature is also observed in the mean values of the dynamic roller forces this is because the roller forces are dependent on the distribution of the pipe weight and stinger vertical stiffness while both factors are easily affected by the barge vertical movements as a result different heave motions lead to clear differences in the roller forces in terms of the three wave directions it appears that the stinger structure is more sensitive to that of 165 as the dynamic roller forces of most rollers vary within a much larger range than those measured from the wave directions of 150 and 180 6 conclusion based on the substructure experiment method an s lay model experiment with a length scale of 1 25 was carried out in the laboratory the static and dynamic s lay processes of laying a 12 in pipe into water at a depth of 3000 m were successfully simulated by model experiments and the key interaction forces between the pipe and stinger rollers were measured when wave directions of 150 165 and 180 as well as the coupling vessel motions of the heave pitch and roll were simultaneously considered according to the experimental results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the dynamic roller forces are compatible with the variations of the vessel motions in general when the amplitudes of the vessel motions increase or decrease the roller forces between the pipe and rollers are simultaneously amplified or reduced 2 the comparison of the roller forces measured from the three dynamic experiments indicates that the heave has a more significant influence on the dynamic roller force than the pitch and roll 3 considering the coupling effects from the heave pitch and roll motions the comparison of the dynamic roller forces in different wave directions demonstrates that the designed stinger is more sensitive to the wave direction of 165 however these experiment results and conclusions are based on several simplifications and assumptions the sagbend part is assumed to be changeless during the dynamic pipe laying process moreover the loads from ocean waves and currents are not considered in the experiment and the effects from fluid forces on the interaction between the pipe and rollers are ignored furthermore the dynamic response of the pipe and stinger model at each moment will affect the lay barge motions in turn which is also ignored in the experiment therefore the substructure experiment method of s lay can be further improved with regard to these experimental simplifications and assumptions in the future study acknowledgments the authors are grateful for the financial supports under grants from national basic research

22958,based on a substructure experiment the pipe laying process of a deep s lay case is reproduced in the laboratory and the dynamic interaction between the pipeline and stinger rollers is investigated as a key equipment component of the s lay a stinger is used to support the pipe weight and control the bending deformation of the overbend section during the s lay process there exist a variety of strongly nonlinear mechanic behaviors such as the contact interaction between the pipeline and rollers plastic strain and large pipeline deformation owing to these nonlinear behaviors roller force as the most important design loads for the s lay are often difficult to predict accurately during the design stage by means of analytical or numerical methods in contrast model experiments are more accurate and reliable for solving this complex nonlinear mechanics problem in this study the static and dynamic substructure experiments of laying a 12 inch pipe into water at a depth of 3000 m are carried out with a length scale of 1 25 the experimental results indicate that the initial roller heights and amplitudes of the vessel motions have a significant effect on the distribution of roller forces while the stinger provides sufficient length and curvatures for the deep s lay case keywords deep s lay stinger rollers dynamic interaction roller force substructure experiment 1 introduction the s lay is a traditional method for installing subsea pipelines and fig 1 presents a schematic thereof the profile of the pipe segment from the lay vessel to the seabed forms an elongated and declining s shape the pipe configuration can be divided into two regions the overbend section supported by a truss like structure known as the stinger and the sagbend section freely suspended in water in general a pipeline installed by the s lay method undergoes reverse bending deformation at least twice when it passes through the stinger and falls down to the seabed the stinger is a key component of the s lay that prevents the overbend section from excessive deflection and local buckling with an increase in the water depth and pipe diameters the contact interaction between the stinger rollers and overbend segment becomes severe and large roller forces may act on the pipe and stinger structures moreover dynamic influences from the vessel motion can further amplify the interaction forces and pipe and stinger mechanical responses therefore the manner in which to accurately estimate the dynamic interaction between pipe and stinger rollers is a crucial problem in deep s lay design in the past several decades significant attention has been paid to s lay problems different numerical methods have been developed to solve the static configuration and control the maximum bending deformation of the pipeline dareing and neathery 1970 introduced newton s method to solve the nonlinear differential equations of a pipeline laid from a lay barge to the ocean floor palmer 1974 derived the governing equations for a pipe laid from a barge over a stinger and discussed the advantages of the finite difference method in solving the s lay pipe configuration schmidt 1977 established the governing equations for a submarine pipe by means of the potential energy function and introduced a discontinuous foundation modulus to determine the suspended pipe length in the finite element analysis konuk 1980 developed a unified 3d formulation for pipe laying problems according to the rod theory and employed the singular perturbation technique to solve the associated nonlinear equations wang et al 2010 proposed an improved numerical model for investigating the overall pipe configuration installed by s lay taking into account the ocean currents and seabed stiffness yuan et al 2012 investigated the influence of the variation in lift off point and change in the stinger radius on the overall pipe configuration internal forces and pipeline strain by using a simple numerical model o grady and harte 2013 proposed to use a detailed pipe model to study the effects from the residual curvature and pipe roll of the overbend region on the pipeline integrity ivić et al 2014 developed a new method for tensioner modeling by considering the friction contacts between the pipe and the tensioner based on this nonlinear model a sensitivity analysis of main s lay parameters is performed ivić 2015 and the optimization problem of s lay is studied by using a specialized pso method ivić et al 2017 the dynamic influences induced by the ocean waves and vessel motions constitute a further noteworthy problem in the s lay design malahy 1985 presented a nonlinear finite element method for the three dimensional dynamic analysis of the offshore pipe laying problem which utilized nonlinear beam elements and elastic bi linear support elements to simultaneously model the pipeline stinger pipe supports and seabed callegari et al 2003 developed analytical models to study the dynamic pipeline behavior in laying operations and the dynamic equilibrium equations for the pipe model were solved by means of a perturbation technique silva et al 2008 proposed two numerical models that simulated the tensioner behavior and dynamic interaction between the pipe and rollers jensen et al 2010 formulated a nonlinear dynamic partial differential equation which is capable of handling the effects of restoring forces hydrodynamic drag and seabed interaction for marine applications nielsen et al 2013 performed dynamic analysis for the large deformation problem of subsea pipe laying by the absolute nodal coordinate formulation method song et al 2013 proposed a coupling analysis model for the dynamic s lay problem which utilized a generalized elastic contact algorithm to simulate the contact interaction between the overbend pipeline and the rollers on the stinger sun et al 2015 and ai et al 2018 derived the pipeline equilibrium equation based on the lumped mass method and investigated the changes of tensioner force pipeline s effective force bending moment in heave and surge conditions xie et al 2015 analyzed the dynamic process of pipe sliding over the stinger using abaqus software and evaluated the pipe collapse pressure following installation gong et al 2014 2016 employed a comprehensive finite element model for s lay systems to analyze the dynamic laying effects including the surface wave ocean currents vessel motions and clashing contact between the pipeline and stinger rollers although it is convenient to simulate the contact interaction between the pipe and stinger rollers using finite element codes the strong nonlinearity of the contact behaviors in the pipe and roller surfaces can lead to critical convergence problems in solving contact problems moreover owing to the calculation hypothesis established in the finite element method the numerical solutions are often inaccurate and unconvincing considering these reasons it is necessary to also develop experimental methods to investigate the complex s lay contact problems brown and palmer 2007 proposed a 3d physical model technique that provided theoretical support for model scaling of the pipe laying process kulikova et al 2011 studied the effects of the wave current wind and pipe stiffness on the pipeline dynamic behavior by means of a combination model comprising the barge stinger pipe and mooring system xie et al 2013 obtained the dynamic roller forces according to a large scale model experiment and investigated the cyclic plastic deformation of the overbend segment zhang et al 2014 2015 investigated the dynamic loads acting on the stinger of lay vessel hysy201 in the off design conditions by using a middle scaled model experiment and proposed an improved reinforced design for the stinger however relatively few studies have used the experimental methods to study dynamic s lay problems at present published works only consider the dynamic effect from single vessel motion heave roll or pitch on the contact interaction between the pipe and rollers the coupling effects from the heave roll and pitch have not yet been considered in this paper an experimental method based on the substructure technique is introduced to study the dynamic interaction between the pipeline and stinger under the coupling effects of heave roll and pitch a model with a length scale of 1 25 is fabricated and model experiments are carried out in the laboratory to study the static and dynamic interaction between the pipe and rollers at a laying depth of 3000 m 2 experimental purpose during the s lay operation a lay barge with an aft stinger will move with six degrees of freedom under the effects of ocean waves these vessel motions surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw have a significant influence on the dynamic responses between the pipeline and stinger structure and must be treated as a crucial design factor for the deep s lay process in general the dynamic positioning system is used by the lay barge to eliminate the surge sway and yaw motions in comparison the heave roll and pitch motions become the dominant factors affecting the dynamic interaction between the stinger and pipeline therefore it is necessary to study the dynamic effects from the coupling motions of heave roll and pitch on the contact forces between the pipeline and roller supports and prevent damage to the pipe structure during the installation stage therefore the goals set by the model experiment are to 1 study the contact interaction between the pipe and rollers under the static and dynamic pipe laying conditions 2 test the stinger laying ability and estimate the pipe installation safety 3 substructure experiment the s lay process involving the vessel important equipment such as the stinger and tensioner and the pipeline is rather complex to be designed experimentally it is difficult and impracticable to imitate the pipe laying process by means of traditional water tank experiments because such an experiment usually models the vessel stinger and pipeline using a small scale which makes it impossible to measure the interaction forces and mechanical responses between the pipe and stinger model accurately however if a large scale model is used instead the vessel model will be too large to move in the water tank for this reason a substructure experiment may provide a feasible solution for studying the dynamic interaction between the pipeline and stinger under a medium or large scale model 3 1 principles of substructure experiment in order to accurately simulate the interaction between the pipe and stinger under gravity load and inertial vessel motions the overbend section of the pipeline and stinger is selected as a substructure of the entire s lay system and this can be modeled on a medium or large scale for an experimental study the other structures in the s lay system such as the lay vessel sagbend section and touch down zone are replaced by the equivalent kinematic conditions and external forces fig 2 presents an overall view of the substructure model experiment a hydraulic drive platform controlled by a computer program simulates the vessel motions with six degrees of freedom the propeller strut of the stinger model is welded to the top of the platform and its main hinge is constrained in the same manner as that of the prototype the overbend pipe model is laid onto the stinger rollers with the upper end fixed on the platform and its lower end is tied with a heavy slider at the lift off position according to the catenary theory or finite element calculations the pipe configuration under certain s lay conditions can be predicted in advance so the total weight of the sagbend section and pipeline departure angle are calculated prior to the experiment then a slider with the same weight as the sagbend model and with the same slope as the lift off position is used in the experiment to represent the internal force from the sagbend section in this study a deep s lay design that lays a 12 in pipe into water with a depth of 3000 m is investigated according to the substructure experiment both static and dynamic conditions are tested in the laboratory 1 static s lay experiment in the static experiment the effects of vessel motions and dynamic fluid forces are not considered the pipe model of the overbend section is slowly placed onto the stinger model static roller forces of different roller supports are measured when the pipe and stinger model reaches equilibrium under the gravity and buoyancy forces 2 dynamic s lay experiment the dynamic experiment considers the coupling motions of the lay barge the water tank experiment provides the coupling motions of the lay barge at different wave directions 150 165 and 180 through the motion scale transformation the platform transmits the inertia motions of the lay vessel to the static equilibrium system of the pipe and stinger model the dynamic roller forces are measured at a frequency of 50 hz 3 2 model similarity in the dynamic experiment if the mechanical response is within the elastic region the similarity relationship of the quantities in the following equation can be determined by dimensional analysis 1 f σ l e ρ t u v a g ω 0 where σ l e ρ t u v a g and ω are the dynamic stress length elastic modulus density time displacement velocity acceleration gravity acceleration and circular frequency respectively selecting the length density and elastic modulus as the basic quantities according to buckingham s π theory buckingham 1914 the other physical quantities can be expressed as 2 f σ e t l ρ e u l v e ρ a e ρ l g e ρ l ω l e ρ 0 in order to maintain the similarity the prototype and model should have the same dimensionless parameters as eq 2 defining λ as the similarity ratio of any physical quantity of the model to that of the prototype the following similarity relationship can be derived 3 λ σ λ e λ t λ l λ ρ λ e λ u λ l λ v λ e λ ρ λ a λ g λ e λ ρ λ l λ ω 1 λ l λ e λ ρ where λ l λ ρ λ e λ σ λ t λ u λ v λ a λ g and λ ω are the similarity ratios of the length density elastic modulus stress time displacement velocity acceleration gravity acceleration and circular frequency respectively however it is rather difficult to meet all of the aforementioned similarity relationships simultaneously this is because the prototype and model experiment use the same gravity acceleration which requires the model to satisfy the following similarity ratios 4 λ a λ g 1 λ e λ ρ λ l assuming that the model uses the same mechanical properties as the prototype the density of the model should be 1 λ l times that of the prototype which causes significant difficulties in finding suitable materials for the model a feasible means of resolving this conflict is by adding extra mass to the model in order to satisfy the density similarity ratio the value of the additional mass can be calculated according to the following equation 5 m a m p λ e λ l 2 m m where m a m p and m m are the extra mass prototype mass and model mass respectively in this study the model is fabricated using a length scale of 1 25 and the parameters of the model are listed in table 1 3 3 pipe model in the s lay the pipeline consists of two parts the sagbend section and the overbend section in the experimental model the sagbend section is replaced by the equivalent boundary conditions and the overbend section is simulated by the pipe model with a length scale of 1 25 the material and cross section properties of the pipe model are listed in table 2 for the sagbend pipeline the model is a long and freely suspended string departing from the stinger roller supports if we truncate the sagbend section at the inflection point affected by the gravity a significant reaction force will occur at the truncated position which tends to pull the overbend section downwards to the seabed as illustrated in fig 3 in order to simulate this reaction force caused by the sagbend section the following assumptions are made for the dynamic model experiment 1 the change in the lift off position induced by the dynamic process is quite small thus the total length and weight of the sagbend pipeline are almost unchanging 2 compared to the reaction force caused by the submerged weight the dynamic fluid forces have small influences on the contact interaction between the pipe and stinger under these assumptions a clump weight on the ramp is a reasonable substitute for the truncated reaction force caused by the sagbend section as illustrated in fig 4 it should be noted that the mass of the clump weight must follow the mass similarity ratio and the slope angle of the ramp should be consistent with the pipe angle at the truncated position the mass of the clump weight and the ramp slope used in this model experiment are listed in table 3 for the overbend section a model with a smaller scale is used to simulate the contact interaction between the pipe and stinger rollers considering the dynamic effects from the vessel the dynamic similarity of the pipe model should be consistent with that of the prototype during the dynamic laying process the main deflection of the overbend pipeline is the bending deformation caused by the gravity and enforced displacement constraints owing to the roller supports therefore the similarity of the mass and bending stiffness should be maintained for the pipe model and prototype in order to obtain an appropriate dynamic response as the pipe model is constructed using the same material as the prototype in this experiment the similarities of the mass and bending stiffness can be expressed by eqs 6 and 7 respectively thus maintaining the geometric similarity of the pipe model and prototype also satisfies the dynamic similarity 6 λ m λ ρ λ v λ l 3 7 λ k λ e λ i λ l 4 3 4 stinger model as illustrated in fig 2 a length scale of 1 25 is adopted to manufacture the stinger model so that the prototype dynamic behaviors can be studied in the laboratory in the practice of s lay several roller boxes and rollers are installed on the stinger to support the submerged pipe weight therefore the designs of the support length roller space and roller height will have certain influences on the roller forces zhang et al 2015 moreover the mass structural stiffness and basic modal frequency of the stinger model should obey the dynamic similarity rules from the perspective of the dynamic experiment furthermore several crucial components of the stinger model such as the a frame the pup piece and main hinge in fig 5 should have the same structural form as the prototype in order to maintain the same force transmission table 4 gives the performance parameters of the pressure sensor used in the experiment pressure sensors are installed at the bottom of the rollers to measure the roller support forces and the sequence numbers of the roller supports are indicated in fig 6 3 5 vessel motions in general a lay barge exhibits six degrees of freedom at sea namely surge sway yaw roll pitch and heave in a deep or ultra deep s lay dynamic positioning systems are usually employed to eliminate the surge sway and yaw motions thus only the heave roll and pitch need to be considered in the dynamic experiment as illustrated in fig 7 an electric platform which can simultaneously simulate vessel motions in different directions is suitable for the experimental requirements the motion performance of this platform is listed in table 5 the heave roll and pitch motions are measured by water tank experiments at harbin engineering university a hull model with a length scale of 1 50 is used in the water tank experiment to simulate the motions of a lay barge in six degrees of freedom the sea state conditions for the s lay design are considered as the significant wave height of 2 5 m the peak wave period of 9s and the wave direction of 150 165 180 the wave direction is defined according to fig 8 figs 9 11 illustrate the time history curves of the vessel motions measured by water tank experiments 4

similar design radius to that of the stinger this will evenly distribute the pipe weight onto the rollers of the stinger and avoid excessive roller forces excessive reaction forces from the rollers may cause the plastic deformation of the pipe section after the pipeline departs from the stinger there still exists some residual ovality and plastic strain in the pipe section which will lower the

roller forces remain at zero constantly which indicates that the pipeline departs from the stinger before it contacts the final roller in both the static and dynamic s lay cases as a result the length design of the stinger is sufficient for the deep s lay conditions if the static roller force is denoted as s f i i 1 2 12 and the dynamic roller force is denoted as d f i t i 1 2 12 the dynamic factors of the roller force can be expressed as δ i t d f i t s f i i 1 2 12 δ i t df i t sf 1 the maximum value of is the maximum amplification factor and the minimum value of is the minimum reduction factor of the i th roller during a dynamic experiment table 6 lists the maximum amplification and minimum reduction factors of the roller forces during the dynamic model experiments in general the dynamic roller forces from rollers 5 and 7 vary within a relatively small range of 0 8 1 3 compared to the other rollers the dynamic roller forces from rollers 11 and 12 exhibit the largest range variation where the maximum amplification factor is over 1 7 and the minimum reduction factor is almost zero this result indicates that the two rollers at the stinger tip are quite dangerous in the dynamic s lay process and should be considered in detail in the design stage however in terms of the dynamic effects caused by different wave directions the dynamic factors induced by the wave direction of 165 are significantly larger than those induced by the wave directions of 150 and 180 5 discussion in the experiment the reason for the large difference in roller forces from

22959,manoeuvring performance of a ship in actual sea is significantly different from that in calm water due to wave loads it is necessary to estimate the ship s manoeuvrabilities in waves at the early design stage for its safe operations several theoretical approaches have been attempted to estimate the manoeuvring performance of ships with considerations of wave loads in recent decades but there are insufficient model test data for the validation of numerical results in this study free running model tests are systematically performed for well known kvlcc2 tanker model tests are carried out in a square basin regular waves are generated with the variations of directions lengths and heights in particular the wave lengths are selected at around the ship length the number of propeller revolution is determined for the model speed corresponded to full scale service speed in calm water that rps is fixed in all runs therefore the loss of approach speed is observed depending on the encountered wave conditions encountered wave profiles are estimated by using relative wave heights data measured on the side of deck in real time the rudder is always deflected at the moments when the wave crest passes on the midship of the model the timing of rudder deflection has little influence on the low frequency manoeuvring motions of the model ship drifting distances of turning trajectories are relatively large when the wave lengths are below the ship length and relative drifting angles between wave propagation direction and trajectory drifting direction are largest when the wave lengths equal to the ship length drifting distances and relative drifting angles increase with increasing wave heights although the trajectories at the early stage of turns are varied depending on encountered waves drifting distance and angles during steady turns are similar if the wave height and length are identical based on the present test results it is appropriate that the trajectory drifting distances and angles are defined as the magnitude and direction of a vector between two positions with the headings of 360 and 720 finally the effects of velocity fluctuations on the trajectory drifts are analyzed in some cases keywords kvlcc2 free running model test regular waves speed loss turning trajectory in waves drifting distance drifting angle 1 introduction in general manoeuvring performance of a ship is evaluated in calm water however the ship encounters wave forces and moments in a seaway its performance in waves are significantly different from the calm water performance compared with calm water manoeuvres the ship speeds are changed additional ship motions are generated even the ship trajectories may be drifted in waves so it is necessary to estimate the ship s manoeuvrabilities in waves at the early design stage for the safe operations in actual sea integrated analyses on various hydrodynamic performance such as resistance propulsion and seakeeping as well as manoeuvring are required for the accurate estimation of ship performance in waves there are some previous researches about the ship manoeuvrabilities in waves by mainly experimental techniques

analyzed for the 35 turning tests in regular head waves 2 model tests 2 1 model ship 1 100 scaled kvlcc2 model ship is constructed for the free running model tests table 1 show the main dimensions of full scale and the model ship more details of a full scale ship can be also found in the website of simman2014 workshop the model ship constructed is shown in fig 1 2 2 test setup fig 2 describes the setup for the free running model tests the model tests are performed in ocean engineering basin 56 m l x 30 m b x 4 5 m d of korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso piston type wave makers are installed along the short and long ends and wave absorption beaches are located on opposite sides which minimize wave reflections wave calibrations are performed at nine points which mostly cover all the tested area according to the wave calibration results wave lengths and heights at all points are within errors of 0 2 and 2 0 respectively it is confirmed that the effects of reflected waves on model ship trajectories are negligible referring to the experimental system by matsuda et al 2016 two total stations are used in order to measure the model ship positions and headings the slope distance horizontal angle and vertical angle of the target prisms on the model ship are measured with the sampling rates of 20 hz 3 dimensional positions of the model ship can be obtained by using measured data one prism is fixed on the intersection point of midship and centerline and the other is fixed on the intersection of station 18 and centerline the height of all prisms is 0 308 m upwards from the draft of model ship model ship trajectories are obtained by using positions of the prism at the midship model ship speed is calculated by differentiating the positions with time as well self propulsion and steering systems motion measuring devices such as gyro inclinometer onboard pc batteries and wireless modem are mounted on the model ship all synchronized signals are transmitted to the ground control pc wirelessly they are controlled and monitored in real time yun et al 2015 in addition several ultrasonic wave probes are installed on the side of the model ship deck relative wave height data are used to estimate the encounter wave elevations kim et al 2018a and 2018b 2 3 test scenarios the coordinates system used in present study consists of earth fixed o xyz and body fixed o xyz coordinates as shown in fig 3 35 starboard and port turning circle tests are performed in regular waves most of the tests are carried out in regular waves with the directions of 180 and 270 which mean head and port beam waves respectively the wave lengths are varied from 0 5 l to 1 5 l and waves are generated with the directions of 150 and 240 in some cases of 35 starboard turns wave heights are mostly fixed as 2 percent of ship length and for 35 port turns in head waves with the wave length of 1 0 l the wave heights are varied from 1 to 2 percent of ship length total test scenarios are shown in table 2 model ship speed corresponding to the full scale service speed 15 5 knots in calm water is 0 797 m sec the number of revolutions of model propeller is 17 5 rps propeller rps is fixed as 17 5 rps in all runs rudder rate of the model ship is 23 4 second which is corresponding to 2 34 second in the full scale 3 approaching conditions 3 1 acceleration and steady approach at the beginning of the model tests the model ship is straightly accelerated with autopilot controls and maintain the constant approach speeds fig 4 shows the time histories of ship speeds at three phases of accelerations and steady approach in head waves phase 1 acceleration phase 2 acceleration and steady approach take around 5 20 and 10 s in model scale and corresponding model propeller rps are 16 30 and 17 5 rps respectively total approaching distance of the model ship is approximately 20 m which is minimized in order to use tested area as large as possible pd controls are used to keep the straight course of the model ship during accelerations and steady approach in other words rudder angles are controlled in proportion to heading angles and yaw rates of the model ship three kinds of p and d gains are used for calm water head wave and beam wave tests all gains are represented in table 3 although the calm water speed of model ship is 0 797 m sec corresponded to model propulsion point 17 5 rps the speed is decreased in waves due to the added resistance of the model ship fig 5 shows the full scale approach speeds in regular head waves in particular when the wave height is 0 02 l and the wave length is 1 0 l the approach speed is 55 of service speed in calm water as the wave lengths become shorter or longer than 1 0 l the loss of approach speed is decreased and the approach speeds are reduced with increasing wave heights but as shown in fig 6 there are little loss of the approach speeds in beam waves the model ship may experience little added resistance in beam waves 3 2 timing of rudder deflection for all the turning circle tests rudder angles are deflected at the moments when the wave crests pass the model midship relative wave heights measured by wave probes are used in order to estimate the incident wave profiles relative wave height rwi which is measured by i th wave probe i 1 n fixed on the model ship can be represented as eq 1 in the present model tests n is 6 relative wave height is the sum of wave elevation and vertical displacements due to the ship motions η is wave elevation φ θ h are roll pitch and heave of the model ship respectively the ship origin is located on the intersection point between the midship and the centerline xi and yi indicate the longitudinal and lateral coordinates of i th wave probe from the origin 1 rwi η φ xi θ yi h roll and pitch motions are measured by gyro mounted on the model ship in real time and the position xi yi of wave probe is given as well so the vertical displacements by roll and pitch motions can be removed from the relative wave heights as eq 2 2 rwi rwi φ xi θ yi η h at t tj the spatial distributions of 3 dimensional regular waves are the functions of x y as shown in eq 3 a is wave amplitude k is wave number χ is wave direction and ε is the wave phase angle 3 η a cos kxcos χ kysin χ ε by substituting 3 to 2 n simultaneous equations are obtained as eq 4 4 rwi a cos kxi cos χ kyi sin χ ε h i 1 n rwi is measured data and a k χ are given conditions of regular waves phase ε and heave displacement h can be calculated by those simultaneous equations at each time step as shown in fig 7 the rudder angles are deflected at the moment when the wave crests pass the model midship in other words when the phase angle ε equals zero 4 test results and analyses 4 1 initial turning trajectories according to the timing of rudder deflection fig 8 shows the side view of the model ship at the moment of rudder deflection when the wave phase angle is 0 the wave crest is on the model midship on the other hand the wave trough is on the midship with the wave phase angle of 180 for two kinds of wave phase angles initial trajectories incident waves estimated by proposed methods in chapter 3 1 measured relative waves and ship motions in early phase of 35 turns are described in fig 9 although the wave elevations at the moment of rudder deflections differ low frequency manoeuvring characteristics of two tests are almost similar to each other it is concluded that the timing of rudder deflection has little influence on the initial turning characteristics of the model ship the wave phase angle at the moment of rudder deflection is fixed as 0 in all the present model tests 4 2 comparison of turning characteristics in calm water and in regular waves fig 10 shows the trajectories time histories of speeds and yaw rates for the 35 starboard turning circle tests in calm water head and port beam waves all values on the graphs are in full scale wave height and length are 0 02 l and 1 0 l respectively trajectories are drifted in waves due to wave drift forces and moments relative angles between wave propagation direction and trajectory drift direction are similar to each other in head and beam waves the approach speed in beam waves is almost the same as the approach speed in calm water but the speed in head waves are reduced by about half of the calm water speed while ship turns speeds are mostly decreased when the model ship encounters the head waves and in beam and following waves the speeds increase up to around turning speed in calm water although the speeds at the beginning of turns are so different due to encounter wave conditions the histories of speed variations in waves become similar during steady turns yaw rates are largely oscillated in waves but the mean values of yaw rates are not quite different from the steady yaw rates in calm water 4 3 turning trajectories in regular waves turning trajectories in regular waves are analyzed some of the results were also shown in previous research by kim et al 2018b fig 11 shows the trajectories of 35 turns in regular head waves wave height is fixed as 0 02 l and wave lengths are varied from 0 5 to 1 5 l 35 starboard turning circle in calm water is plotted together the drifting distance of trajectory is longest when the wave length is 0 5 l and at that time the drifting direction is almost parallel to the wave propagation direction relative angles between wave propagations and trajectory drifts are largest when the wave length is 1 0 l in other words the trajectories obliquely drift with regard to waves fig 12 shows 35 turning trajectories in regular head waves the drifting distances are similar to 35 turns and the drifting angles are symmetry about the wave propagation direction fig 13 and fig 14 respectively show 35 and 35 turning trajectories in port beam waves when the wave length is 0 5 l the ship advance is remarkably large in 35 turns on the other hand that is relatively small in 35 turns it can be estimated that the wave drift moments in yaw directions with the wave length of 0 5 l are relatively larger than other wave conditions ship may experience the wave drift yaw moments which prevent the ship from turning in stern quartering waves although the histories at the beginning of turns are different in head and in beam waves the drifting distances and angles become similar to each other during steady turns 35 turning trajectories in head waves with variations of wave heights are shown in fig 15 wave length is fixed as 1 0 l and the wave heights are changed as 0 01 0 015 and 0 02 l the sampling time of each test is 2000 s in full scale as the wave heights are higher the wave drift forces and moments may become larger the drifting distances of trajectory increase with increasing wave heights and the relative drifting angles between wave propagation direction and trajectory drifts are slightly increased as well fig 16 represents 35 turns with variations of wave direction wave length is fixed as 1 0 l wave height is fixed as 0 02 l and wave directions are varied from 150 to 270 the sampling time of each test is 2300 s in full scale the advances and the tactical diameters differ according to wave directions but during steady turns the drifting distances as well as the relative drifting angles between wave propagation and trajectory drifting direction become similar to each other 5 drifting distance and drifting angle 5 1 definition of drifting distances and angles of ship turning circles in waves when the ship turns in one kind of regular waves with constant wave drift forces and moments the trajectories are drifted as shown in fig 17 ueno et al 2003 defined drifting distance of turning trajectory as the distance between successive ship positions in which wave encounter angle equals 90 and drifting direction was defined as the angle between wave propagating direction and moving direction of positions of a ship in which wave encounter angle is 90 yasukawa et al 2015 proposed the second advance with heading angle of 450 and the second tactical diameter with heading angle of 540 as well as well known advance and tactical diameter of a ship in order to describe the ship s turning trajectories in waves referring to those previous researches in the present study model test results are analyzed in two ways to define the trajectory drifting distance and angles one is to use lines which are tangent to the path of ship reference point adrl is the angle between the ship s approach direction x axis and tangential line of the left side of second and third turning circles likewise adrr is defined by using tangential line of the right side of second and third circles adr is the mean of adrl and adrr drifting distances can be defined by lines which are perpendicular to the vector of adr and are tangent to the turning circles ddr1 is the distance between lines which are tangent to first and second circles ddr2 is defined by using lines which are tangent to second and third circles ddr3 ddr4 and so on can be defined in the same manner the other way is to use the vector between two points with the interval of 360 heading angles in fig 17 for example ddr180 540 indicates the magnitude of vector between two points which correspond to the heading angles of 180 and 540 adr180 540 is the angle between that vector and the ship s initial approach direction x axis in other words the subscripts in the notations mean the ship s heading angles at start and end points in additions the relative drifting angle rdr between wave propagation direction and drifting angle can be represented as eq 5 5 rdr sign δ χ adr 5 2 drifting distance and angle results tables 4 and 5 show the results of drifting distances and angles of 35 turns in head waves and 35 turns in port beam waves some indices in tables 4 and 5 are described in figs 18 and 19 in fig 18 the drifting distances by using vectors between two points are converged when the heading at start point is above 180 ship speeds or yaw rates are changed at the early phase of turns they cause the variations of drifting distance up to headings of 180 and the drifting distances by using tangential lines are mostly converged since the second circles as shown in fig 19 in other words ddr2 can be used as converged drifting distance fig 20 shows the correlations between ddr2 and drifting distances ddr a b which are obtained by the vectors between two points when the headings at the start points are over 180 ddr a b are almost the same as ddr2 as a result drifting distance ddr and drifting angle adr can be defined by the magnitude and the direction of vector between two ship positions with headings of 360 and 720 adr is defined in the range of 0 to 2π effect of wave length on ddr and rdr are described in fig 21 drifting distances and relative drifting angles seems to be little influenced by the sign of rudder angles and wave propagation directions tables 6 and 7 show the indices of drifting distances and angles of turning trajectories with variations of wave heights and directions when the wave length is the ship length all values are obtained by the trajectories in figs 15 16 the effects of wave heights and directions on the drifting distances and the relative drifting angles are described in figs 22 and 23 in fig 22 the drifting distances and the relative drifting angles increase with increasing the wave heights due to increasing wave drift forces and moments but there are no specific tendencies of drifting distances and angles with variations of wave directions as shown in fig 23 5 3 relation between drifting distance angle and velocity fluctuation in fig 24 the left graph represents the 35 turning trajectories in head waves with λ l of 0 5 and 0 7 the same as curves in fig 11 compared with λ l 0 5 case λ l 0 7 case shows large relative drifting angle with regard to wave propagation direction and the right graph describes the trajectories with λ l of 0 7 and 1 0 λ l 0 7 case shows longer drifting distance than λ l 1 0 case fig 25 shows the time histories of yaw angles and velocity components of λ l 0 5 and λ l 0 7 cases yaw rates are plotted as filtered values both cases show the similar speed histories but compared with λ l 0 5 yaw rates are remarkably disturbed in bow quartering waves in λ l 0 7 case yaw rate is reduced just before the model ship encounter the head wave so the model ship moves further in y direction fig 26 shows the turning histories of λ l 0 7 and λ l 1 0 cases speed fluctuations of λ l 0 7 case are larger than those of λ l 1 0 case in λ l 0 7 case surge velocity is recovered well in following waves whereas the magnitude of sway velocity is reduced by nearly zero in port beam waves the turning trajectories are pushed toward x direction by these phenomenon so the drifting distance of λ l 0 7 case is longer than that of λ l 1 0 case 6 conclusions in this study 1 100 scaled kvlcc2 free running model tests are performed in regular waves the effects of wave conditions such as wave directions lengths and heights on the turning trajectories are investigated main conclusions are as below the rudder is deflected when the wave crests pass the model midship in all runs the timing of rudder deflections has little influence on the ship trajectories model propeller rps is fixed as the model propulsion point corresponded to full scale service speed in calm water approach speeds are reduced by about half of calm water speeds in head waves but there are little loss of speed in beam waves when the wave lengths are below the ship length drifting distances of trajectories are relatively large relative drifting angles between wave propagation direction and trajectory drifting direction are largest when the wave lengths equal to the ship length drifting distances and angles increase with increasing wave heights due to increasing wave drift force and moments drifting distance and angle are defined by using the magnitude and direction of a vector between two ship positions with the headings of 360 and 720 drifting distances and angles are affected by the fluctuations of velocity components relative drifting angles are increased with large perturbation of yaw rates and the trajectories are mainly drifted with the fluctuated surge and sway velocities acknowledgements this research was supported by a grant from endowment project of development of the analysis technology of ship s integrated ability of

22959,manoeuvring performance of a ship in actual sea is significantly different from that in calm water due to wave loads it is necessary to estimate the ship s manoeuvrabilities in waves at the early design stage for its safe operations several theoretical approaches have been attempted to estimate the manoeuvring performance of ships with considerations of wave loads in recent decades but there are insufficient model test data for the validation of numerical results in this study free running model tests are systematically performed for well known kvlcc2 tanker model tests are carried out in a square basin regular waves are generated with the variations of directions lengths and heights in particular the wave lengths are selected at around the ship length the number of propeller revolution is determined for the model speed corresponded to full scale service speed in calm water that rps is fixed in all runs therefore the loss of approach speed is observed depending on the encountered wave conditions encountered wave profiles are estimated by using relative wave heights data measured on the side of deck in real time the rudder is always deflected at the moments when the wave crest passes on the midship of the model the timing of rudder deflection has little influence on the low frequency manoeuvring motions of the model ship drifting distances of turning trajectories are relatively large when the wave lengths are below the ship length and relative drifting angles between wave propagation direction and trajectory drifting direction are largest when the wave lengths equal to the ship length drifting distances and relative drifting angles increase with increasing wave heights although the trajectories at the early stage of turns are varied depending on encountered waves drifting distance and angles during steady turns are similar if the wave height and length are identical based on the present test results it is appropriate that the trajectory drifting distances and angles are defined as the magnitude and direction of a vector between two positions with the headings of 360 and 720 finally the effects of velocity fluctuations on the trajectory drifts

performance of a ship is evaluated in calm water however the ship encounters wave forces and moments in a seaway its performance in waves are significantly different from the calm water performance

speed while ship turns speeds are mostly decreased when the model ship encounters the head waves and in beam and following waves the speeds increase up to around turning speed in calm water although the speeds at the beginning of turns are so different due to encounter wave conditions the histories of speed variations in waves become similar during steady turns yaw rates are largely oscillated in waves but the mean values of yaw rates are not quite different from the steady yaw rates in calm water 4 3 turning trajectories in regular waves turning trajectories in regular waves are analyzed some of the results were also shown in previous research by kim et al 2018b fig 11 shows the trajectories of 35 turns in regular head waves wave height is fixed as 0 02 l and wave lengths are varied from 0 5 to 1 5 l 35 starboard turning circle in calm water is plotted together the drifting distance of trajectory is longest when the wave length is 0 5 l and at that time the drifting direction is almost parallel to the wave propagation direction relative angles between wave propagations and trajectory drifts are largest when the wave length is 1 0 l in other words the trajectories obliquely drift with regard to waves fig 12 shows 35 turning trajectories in regular head waves the drifting distances are similar to 35 turns and the drifting angles are symmetry about the wave propagation direction fig 13 and fig 14 respectively show 35 and 35 turning trajectories in port beam waves when the wave length is 0 5 l the ship advance is remarkably large in 35 turns on the other hand that is relatively small in 35 turns it can be estimated that the wave drift moments in yaw directions with the wave length of 0 5 l are relatively larger than other wave conditions ship may experience the wave drift yaw moments which prevent the ship from turning in stern quartering waves although the histories at the beginning of turns are different in head and in beam waves the drifting distances and angles become similar to each other during steady turns 35 turning trajectories in head waves with variations of wave heights are shown in fig 15 wave length is fixed as 1 0 l and the wave heights are changed as 0 01 0 015 and 0 02 l the sampling time of each test is 2000 s in full scale as the wave heights are higher the wave drift forces and moments may become larger the drifting distances of trajectory increase with increasing wave heights and the relative drifting angles between wave propagation direction and trajectory drifts are slightly increased as well fig 16 represents 35 turns with variations of wave direction wave length is fixed as 1 0 l wave height is fixed as 0 02 l and wave directions are varied from 150 to 270 the sampling time of each test is 2300 s in full scale the advances and the tactical diameters differ according to wave directions but during steady turns the drifting distances as well as the relative drifting angles between wave propagation and trajectory drifting direction become similar to each other 5 drifting distance and drifting angle 5 1 definition of drifting distances and angles of ship turning circles in waves when the ship turns in one kind of regular waves with constant wave drift forces and moments the trajectories are drifted as shown in fig 17 ueno et al 2003 defined drifting distance of turning trajectory as the distance between successive ship positions in which wave encounter angle equals 90 and drifting direction was defined as the angle between wave propagating direction and moving direction of positions of a ship in which wave encounter angle is 90 yasukawa et al 2015 proposed the second advance with heading angle of 450 and the second tactical diameter with heading angle of 540 as well as well known advance and tactical diameter of a ship in order to describe the ship s turning trajectories in waves referring to those previous researches in the present study model test results are analyzed in two ways to define the trajectory drifting distance and angles one is to use lines which are tangent to the path of ship reference point adrl is the angle between the ship s approach direction x axis and tangential line of the left side of second and third turning circles likewise adrr is defined by using tangential line of the right side of second and third circles adr is the mean of adrl and adrr drifting distances can be defined by lines which are perpendicular to the vector of adr and are tangent to the turning circles ddr1 is the distance between lines which are tangent to first and second circles ddr2 is defined by using lines which are tangent to second and third circles ddr3 ddr4 and so on can be defined in the same manner the other way is to use the vector between two points with the interval of 360 heading angles in fig 17 for example ddr180 540 indicates the magnitude of vector between two points which correspond to the heading angles of 180 and 540 adr180 540 is the angle between that vector and the ship s initial approach direction x axis in other words the subscripts in the notations mean the ship s heading angles at start and end points in additions the relative drifting angle rdr between wave propagation direction and drifting angle can be represented as eq 5 5 rdr sign δ χ adr 5 2 drifting distance and angle results tables 4 and 5 show the results of drifting distances and angles of 35 turns in head waves and 35 turns in port beam waves some indices in tables 4 and 5 are described in figs 18 and 19 in fig 18 the drifting distances by using vectors between two points are converged when the heading at start point is above 180 ship speeds or yaw rates are changed at the early phase of turns they cause the variations of drifting distance up to headings of 180 and the drifting distances by using tangential lines are mostly converged since the second circles as shown in fig 19 in other words ddr2 can be used as converged drifting distance fig 20 shows the correlations between ddr2 and drifting distances ddr a b which are obtained by the vectors between two points when the headings at the start points are over 180 ddr a b are almost the same as ddr2 as a result drifting distance ddr and drifting angle adr can be defined by the magnitude and the direction of vector between two ship positions with headings of 360 and 720 adr is defined in the range of 0 to 2π effect of wave length on ddr and rdr are described in fig 21 drifting distances and relative drifting angles seems to be little influenced by the sign of rudder angles and wave propagation directions tables 6 and 7 show the indices of drifting distances and angles of turning trajectories with variations of wave heights and directions when the wave length is the ship length all values are obtained by the trajectories in figs 15 16 the effects of wave heights and directions on the drifting distances and the relative drifting angles are described in figs 22 and 23 in fig 22 the drifting distances and the relative drifting angles increase with increasing the wave heights due to increasing wave drift forces and moments but there are no specific tendencies of drifting distances and angles with variations of wave directions as shown in fig 23 5 3 relation between drifting distance angle and velocity fluctuation in fig 24 the left graph represents the 35 turning trajectories in head waves with λ l of 0 5 and 0 7 the same as curves in fig 11 compared with λ l 0 5 case λ l 0 7 case shows large relative drifting angle with regard to wave propagation direction and the right graph describes the trajectories with λ l of 0 7 and 1 0 λ l 0 7 case shows longer drifting distance than λ l 1 0 case fig 25 shows the time histories of yaw angles and velocity components of λ l 0 5 and λ l 0 7 cases yaw rates are plotted as filtered values both cases show the similar speed histories but compared with λ l 0 5 yaw rates are remarkably disturbed in bow quartering waves in λ l 0 7 case yaw rate is reduced just before the model ship encounter the head wave so the model ship moves further in y direction fig 26 shows the turning histories of λ l 0 7 and λ l 1 0 cases speed fluctuations of λ l 0 7 case are larger than those of λ l 1 0 case in λ l 0 7 case surge velocity is recovered well in following waves whereas the magnitude of sway velocity is reduced by nearly zero in port beam waves the turning trajectories are pushed toward x direction by these phenomenon so the drifting distance of λ l 0 7 case is longer than that of λ l 1 0 case 6 conclusions in this study 1 100 scaled kvlcc2 free running model tests are performed in regular waves the effects of wave conditions such as wave directions lengths and heights on the turning trajectories are investigated main conclusions are as below the rudder is deflected when the wave crests pass the model midship in all runs the timing of rudder deflections has little influence on the ship trajectories model propeller rps is fixed as the model propulsion point corresponded to full scale service speed in calm water approach speeds are reduced by about half of calm water speeds in head waves but there are little loss of speed in beam waves when the wave lengths are below the ship length drifting distances of trajectories are relatively large relative drifting angles between wave propagation direction and trajectory drifting direction are largest when the wave lengths equal to the ship length drifting distances and angles increase with increasing wave heights due to increasing wave drift force and moments drifting distance and angle are defined by using the magnitude and direction of a vector between two ship positions with the headings of 360 and 720 drifting distances and angles are affected by the fluctuations of velocity components relative drifting angles are increased with large perturbation of yaw rates and the trajectories are mainly drifted with the fluctuated surge and sway velocities acknowledgements this research was supported by a grant from endowment project of development of the analysis technology of ship s integrated ability of
