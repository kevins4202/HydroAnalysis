17410,solar energy is considered one of the most promising energy sources for the degradation of pollutants in the water treatments an innovative solar photo thermochemical system involving peroxydisulfate pds as an oxidant and xenon lamp as a solar irradiation light source was applied with hopes to degrade organic matters and alleviate the ultrafiltration uf membrane fouling when treating the real surface water moreover heat activated pds pretreatment was used as a comparison to explore the respective proportions of solar light and heating effects finding that solar light effect dominated the activation of pds to degrade natural organic matters noms when the reaction temperature was below 50 c and they both contributed to the production of free radicals at the temperature of 50 c the results indicated that solar activated pds pretreatment significantly alleviated membrane fouling caused by songhua river water with the highest transmembrane pressure tmp reduction of approximately 69 6 at 70 c organic substances characterized by doc uv254 and the maximum florescent intensity and micropollutant atrazine in the feed water were better degraded in the presence of solar light both total fouling index tfi and hydraulic irreversible fouling index hifi were moderate correlated with the uv254 and doc whereas remarkably correlated with the fmax of component 2 c2 and component 3 c3 in addition no significant correlation was observed between fouling indexes tfi and hifi and the fmax of component 1 c1 the membrane irreversible fouling was attributed to the accumulation of cake layers mainly composed of protein like substances on the membrane surface solar activated pds pretreatment would efficiently degrade the protein like substances and terrestrially derived humic like matters to control uf membrane fouling the findings are beneficial to develop new strategies for membrane fouling alleviation based on the solar irradiation and pds oxidation graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words solar activated peroxydisulfate ultrafiltration membrane fouling natural organic matter nom 1 introduction ultrafiltration uf is increasingly widely being used in the water and wastewater treatments due to its simplicity of operation low cost and excellent retention performance however the membrane fouling caused by natural organic matters noms jermann et al 2008 zularisam et al 2011 has always been a key factor limiting its widespread application various methods can be applied to reduce membrane fouling mainly including reducing contaminants prior to uf by pretreatments saquib et al 2010 zheng et al 2009 optimizing the operating parameters chang et al 2016 and improving the anti pollution performance of membrane material huang et al 2020 nasrollahi et al 2018 the reduction of pollutants is usually by pretreatments prior to uf to degrade or intercept substances that may cause the membrane fouling recently the application of using advanced oxidation process that stimulates persulfate to degrade noms in surface water to alleviate uf membrane fouling has attracted some researchers cheng et al 2017b tian et al 2018 using persulfate in pre oxidation process as an oxidant has its unique advantages over other pretreatments prior to uf persulfate is a cheap chemical oxidant which has lots of advantages firstly it possesses a considerable oxidation potential e0 2 5 3 1 v and reacts with organic compounds with a second order rate constant of 106 109 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2020 moreover the produced sulfate radicals have a longer radical lifetime t1 2 30 40 μs and higher selectivity toward electro rich organic pollutants deng et al 2019 xu et al 2020 more importantly the reactivity of sulfate radicals are less restricted with ph which can react with pollutants under a wide range of ph conditions deng et al 2017 as a result persulfate is increasingly being used in water treatment and various ways to activate persulfate are being developed among them artificial ultraviolet uv light is one of the most widely used methods in a previous study uv light combined with persulfate exhibited a significant effect on the degradation of nom in surface water tian et al 2018 although uv combined with oxidation process had a significant degradation effect on pollutants alvarez et al 2020 uv radiation was generally dependent on the extra power supply and would consume a large amount of electricity xing et al 2018 in addition to uv radiation solar energy regarded as a green and sustainable resource could also stimulate the production of free radicals in advanced oxidation miralles et al miralles cuevas et al 2017 compared ultraviolet and solar combined advanced oxidation technologies to treat five kinds of micro contaminants and reported that the final total costs of solar combined advanced oxidation technology was the lowest when the target pollutant degradation rate reached 90 thus solar energy can be an alternative to ultraviolet light sources in some specific cases especially in some decentralized systems that treat the potable water for a single household or a community peter varbanets et al 2009 recently the utilization of full solar spectrum for the degradation of pollutants in water and wastewater treatments has attracted the attention of many researchers due to its unique advantages kowalska et al 2020 saleh and al nimr 2019 currently the main means of using solar energy to treat water or wastewater include direct use of solar energy using some uv absorbing or visible light absorbing materials xu et al 2019 and conversion of solar energy into electric using photovoltaic panels to generate electricity wang et al 2017 or thermal using infrared absorbing materials or light concentrating elements lin et al 2019 energy for instance wang et al wang et al 2017 constructed a new hybrid system that integrated the photo electrochemical reactor with photovoltaic which activated persulfate in uv bands generated power in the visible and near infrared bands and heated solution temperature in the far infrared bands respectively lin et al lin et al 2019 established a system combining sunlight focusing with solar tracking for the treatment of pharmaceutical pollutants and gained significant effect in the presence of persulfate in this research a system coupling solar energy with an uf system was investigated peroxydisulfate pds was added to the water samples to degrade noms and micro pollutants in this system the uv band of the solar spectrum can activate pds into strong sulfate radicals thereby degrading noms and micro pollutants prior to uf far infrared spectrum can promote the temperature of the solution to contribute to the activation of pds and simultaneously speeding up the reaction rate the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of solar activated pds pre oxidation on the removals of organics in songhua river water and alleviations of uf membrane fouling the impact of pre oxidation on membrane fouling was evaluated by transmembrane pressure tmp developments and reversibility analysis characterization of changes in organic matters by various methods and comparing with heat activated pds pretreatment moreover four typical membrane fouling models and chemical cleaning were applied to investigate the mechanisms of alleviating membrane fouling by solar activated pds pretreatment various organic indicators including uv254 doc and the three fluorescent components were used to establish correlation analysis with membrane fouling indexes to predict membrane fouling the results are expected to provide some new perspectives for membrane fouling control strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw water the raw water was collected from songhua river in harbin between june and september 2019 the collected water samples were pre filtered through a 0 45 µm cellulose ester membrane shanghai xin ya purification equipment co ltd china and then stored in the refrigerator at 4 c before experiments the water characteristics of collected water samples were as follows turbidity 15 2 31 2 ntu uv254 0 156 0 165 cm 1 doc 5 91 6 61 mg l and ph 7 2 7 9 2 2 experimental setup 2 2 1 pretreatments heat activated and solar activated pds were adopted as pretreatments prior to uf membranes sodium peroxydisulfate na2s2o8 purchased from aladdin chemicals shanghai china was used as an oxidant the stock solution of sodium peroxydisulfate was prepared with a concentration of 50 mm since solar energy has a synergistic effect of light and heat a thermostatic water bath was used to investigate the effects of heating during the pretreatments the temperature was kept at 30 50 and 70 c respectively during heat activated recorded as hp30 hp50 and hp70 respectively and solar activated recorded as sp30 sp50 and sp70 respectively pds pre oxidation shown in table 1 the dosage of pds was 0 4 mm and the reaction time lasted 2 h the pre oxidation reactor was displayed in fig 1 a which mainly included a thermostatic control switch lb8 lcd lueabb china a thermostatic water bath a fresnel lens shandong yuying optical instrument co ltd china a solar simulator hsx f uv300 nbet china and a reactor the thermostatic water bath and oxidation reactor were both made of quartz glass and the effective height and diameter of the oxidation reactor were 162 and 113 mm respectively experiments of solar or heat activated pds pre oxidation were conducted by turning on or off the solar simulator and other conditions remained the same solar activated pds pro oxidation were performed under a light intensity of 1 kw m2 corresponding to 1 sun illumination the fresnel lens was used to focus sunlight and the light barrier was used to prevent the effect of external light on the experiments 2 2 2 membrane filtration in order to eliminate the effects of water temperature all water samples were cooled to the room temperature prior to uf in both the heating and solar involving pretreatments a commercially flat sheet polyethersulfone pes membrane 150 kda microdyn nadir germany was employed in the filtration experiments the effective filtration area of the uf membrane was 13 1 cm2 a schematic diagram of the experimental setup is illustrated in fig 1 b uf experiments were conducted in a filtration cell with an effective volume of 160 ml in dead end mode at a constant permeate flux which was maintained by a peristaltic pump bt100 2j lange china the flux was adjusted by controlling the speed of the peristaltic pump during filtration experiments the transmembrane pressure tmp was monitored using a pressure sensor sin p300 sinomeasure china and the output data was recorded via an automatic data acquisition system in order to speed up the irreversible membrane fouling hydraulic backwash for the membrane was utilized at the end of each filtration cycle the permeate flux was adjusted to 237 l m 2 h 1 and the backwashing flux was 1 5 times approximately 355 l m 2 h 1 of it in addition a time sequence of 29 min for filtration and 1 min for backwashing was performed 2 3 fouling resistance analysis the resistance in series model lin et al 2009 was used in this study to investigate the influence of pretreatments on the membrane fouling behavior as shown in eq 1 1 r t t m p μ j r m r i r r r 2 r m t m p 0 μ j 3 r r t m p 1 μ j t m p 2 μ j 4 r i r r t r m r r t m p 2 μ j t m p 0 μ j where rt m 1 is the total resistance during the uf process tmp pa is the transmembrane pressure μ pa s is the dynamic viscosity of the water samples j m s 1 is the membrane permeate flux rm m 1 rr m 1 and rir m 1 are the intrinsic membrane resistance reversible resistance and irreversible resistance respectively at the beginning of each uf experiment pure water filtration was conducted to determine the transmembrane pressure of the membrane tmp0 for calculation of the intrinsic membrane resistance rm as shown in eq 2 after each hydraulic backwash the transmembrane pressure of cleaned membrane was recorded as tmp2 hence rr and rir were calculated according to eqs 3 and 4 respectively in addition fouling index fi was utilized to establish correlation analysis with various organic indicators for membrane fouling assessment in this study fi was described in detail in previous researches huang et al 2008 nguyen et al 2011 and it can be briefly calculated by the following eq 5 5 1 j s t m p i n i t m p 0 1 f i v s where js is the normalized transmembrane pressure tmp0 pa is the same as in the eq 4 tmpini pa is the transmembrane pressure measured after each hydraulic backwash fi m 1 is the fouling index vs m3 m2 is specific volume of filtrate fi can be representative of total fouling index tfi or hydraulic irreversible fouling index hifi if relevant js and vs are determined 2 4 membrane fouling model four typical mathematical models were usually employed to interpret the mechanism of uf membrane fouling which were complete blocking model standard blocking model intermediate blocking model and cake filtration model bowen et al 1995 corbatón báguena et al 2015 hermia 1982 the expressions of the four models are listed in table s1 of the supplementary data where p0 is the initial tmp p is the instantaneous tmp β and σ are the parameters related to the sample j is the permeate flux t is the filtration time r0 is the initial size of membrane pore n is the number of membrane pores per unit area e is the thickness of the membrane and μ is the viscosity of the sample 2 5 analytical methods the uv254 was detected using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer t6 puxi china at the wavelength of 254 nm the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was determined using a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan direct fluorescence measurement used a fluorescence spectrophotometer f7000 hitachi japan to characterize the fluorescence properties of organic matters and then the fluorescence spectra the fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems of the samples were obtained three dimensional fluorescence parallel factor analysis was used to process the obtained fluorescence spectrum by dividing them into several components eems were generated by scanning over excitation wavelengths of 200 450 nm at an interval of 5 nm and emission wavelengths of 250 550 nm at an interval of 1 nm each sample eem deducted an eem of milli q water to remove the raman scatter peaks murphy et al 2010 the details of the approach had been described by stedmon and bro stedmon and bro 2008 moreover an attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy spectrum one perkin elmer usa was utilized to characterize the major functional groups of substances on the membrane surfaces each membrane sample was scanned 16 times with wave numbers ranging from 600 to 4000 cm 1 2 6 extraction of pollutants at the end of each experiment the residual pollutants were extracted from the contaminated membranes after hydraulic backwash firstly the membranes were soaked in the 0 01 mol l naoh solution for 24 h at 20 c then full oscillation ensured that the irreversible contaminants on the membrane surface or in the membrane pores were cleaned out finally the ph of the chemical solution was adjusted to neutral using hcl solution the extracted organic foulants were then stored in the refrigerator 4 c for further analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 removals of organic pollutants 3 1 1 uv254 and doc fig 2 shows the removal efficiencies of uv254 and doc by different pretreatments the uv254 and doc concentrations of raw water were in the range of 0 156 0 165 cm 1 and 5 91 6 61 mg l during the experiments as can be seen in fig 2 a and c single uf had a certain removal for both uv254 and doc however the uv254 and doc removals were limited to approximately 14 05 and 2 15 respectively which was consistent with the previous studies guo et al 2018 shao et al 2017 tang et al 2018 in the condition of heat activated pds pretreatment low temperature 30 c could hardly degrade uv254 and doc in the raw water with the temperature increasing from 50 to 70 c heat activated pds pre oxidation conferred a significant impact on the organic degradation with average removal of uv254 increasing from 1 59 to 34 29 and doc removal elevating from 3 05 to 26 01 by comparison solar activated pds pretreatment had measurable removals of both uv254 9 42 and doc 2 52 in low temperature cases 30 c interestingly when the temperature rose from 30 to 70 c the average removals of uv254 and doc increased to 60 40 and 47 04 respectively the results indicated that solar activated pds pretreatment exhibited better performance in uv254 and doc removal due to the synergistic effect of solar light and heat thus solar light and heating effects both played an important part in activating pds and degrading noms during solar activated pds pretreatment when the temperature was above 50 c and the rising temperature would also accelerate the generation of free radicals and rate of chemical reactions huang et al 2002 lin 2001 from fig 2 it can be inferred that 50 c was a critical value for either heat activated pds or solar activated pds approach when the reaction temperature was below 50 c heat activated pds had almost no effect on removing pollutants uv254 and doc removal by hp30 pretreatment was 0 61 and 0 46 respectively while solar activated pds also just displayed slight removals of organic foulants uv254 and doc removal by sp30 pretreatment was 9 42 and 2 52 respectively these results implied that the solar light effect dominated the activation of pds and the rising temperature 50 c was mainly to accelerate the production of free radicals and rate of chemical reactions when the reaction temperature was below 50 c supportively previous study lin et al 2019 reported that the activation of pds could not occur either under 60 c or without necessary sunlight and the increasing temperature would facilitate the generating rate of so4 further studies even indicated that the activation of pds by a simulated sunlight at 50 c the final removal rate was about 73 after 3 h displayed better performance in the degradation of sulfamethoxazole than only by heating almost no degradation was observed in the dark at the same temperature lin et al 2019 in the present study both heat and solar activated pds pretreatments exhibited efficient removal performance for uv254 and doc when the water temperature was above 50 c the uv254 removal by hp50 hp70 sp50 and sp70 was 3 05 34 29 17 99 and 60 38 respectively while the doc removal by hp50 hp70 sp50 and sp70 was 1 59 26 00 15 51 and 47 04 respectively it was obvious that 50 c was a threshold temperature in such experimental conditions compared with direct uf process pre oxidation hp70 sp50 and sp70 apparently decreased the doc concentration of uf permeate however cheng et al reported that pre ozonation would increased the doc concentration in the uf permeate by converting high molecular weight organic molecules into small and hydrophilic fragments which were easier to pass through membrane pores cheng et al 2017a cheng et al 2016 the conflicting results were related to the facts that heat or solar activated pds pre oxidation not only destroyed the structure of nom but also mineralized it to carbon dioxide thus decreasing the feed doc concentration of uf 3 1 2 fluorescent organic matter fluorescent organic matter played a fundamental role in the uf membrane fouling shao et al 2014 tian et al 2015 parallel factor analysis parafac had been utilized in this study and three typical components had been identified in songhua river water which were c1 ex em 240 310 400 450 nm represented the microbial or marine humic like substances c2 ex em 270 360 470 nm was related to the terrestrially derived humic like matters and c3 ex em 225 280 340 nm belonged to the protein like substances derived biological production in surface water respectively the spectra of three typical components are displayed in fig s1 in supplement material as shown in fig 3 the heat activated pds hardly exerted an effect on degrading c1 and c2 at 30 c and had a slight degradation for them at 50 c the c1 and c2 removals by hp50 were 2 06 and 0 87 respectively but showed a significant removal at 70 c the c1 and c2 removals by hp70 were 24 52 and 61 64 respectively this kept consistent with the doc removal and further proved that 50 c was the threshold temperature of activating pds only the temperature was above it there would be the production of sufficient so4 to degrade pollutants in raw water interestingly the solar activated pds pretreatment displayed an excellent removal performance for both c1 and c2 at only 30 c the c1 and c2 removals by sp30 were 29 22 and 45 98 respectively which indicated that the solar activated pds pretreatment had a better degradation for both c1 and c2 at room temperature strangely the c1 removal by solar activated pds pretreatment at 50 c was lower than that of at 30 c the c1 removals by sp30 and sp50 were 29 22 and 25 67 respectively and the removal efficiency of c2 by solar activated pds pretreatment at 50 c was higher than that of at 30 c the removal of c2 by sp30 and sp50 was 45 98 and 53 40 respectively this might due to the different concentrations of c1 and c2 in raw water that the fmax of c1 in raw water by sp50 7 45 r u was 1 25 times higher than that of sp30 5 96 r u as shown in fig 3 e and f the two pre oxidation approaches both seemed to be very effective for the degradation of c3 apart from hp30 which was significantly different from both c1 and c2 the c3 removal by pre oxidations followed the order of sp70 81 64 hp70 72 32 sp50 36 94 sp30 14 97 hp50 14 40 hp30 2 61 suggesting that c3 was more sensitive to both temperature and solar light in addition the c3 removal by heat activated pds at 50 c was significantly better than that of c1 and c2 indicating that c3 was vulnerable to temperature changes according to the previous researches guo et al 2018 c3 was related to the protein like substances derived biological production and temperature changes liu et al 2016 and solar light mainly ultraviolet light phong and hur 2015 would easily cause apparent denaturation of protein like substances resulting in the destruction of their internal structure there was almost no degradation of pollutants by heat activated pds pretreatment at 30 c the c1 c2 and c3 removals by hp30 were 0 03 0 41 and 2 61 respectively therefore hp30 could be regarded as a reference for sp30 and the removals of pollutants by solar activated pds pretreatment at 30 c the c1 c2 and c3 removals by sp30 were 29 22 45 98 and 14 97 respectively could almost be considered as the result of the solar photo effect alone 3 1 3 micropollutant atrazine atz was selected as a typical micro pollutant representing herbicides which was frequently found in the drinking water sources and posed a threat to human health and aquatic ecosystems guzzella et al 2006 ouyang et al 2017 the removal efficiency of atz in different systems is illustrated in fig 4 in the experiment of atz removal the employed dose of pds was 0 4 mmol l and the concentration of atz in the raw water was about 1 µmol l the direct uf had a limited removal effect on atz with average removal of 5 03 the removal of atz increased from 0 3 to 41 36 by the heat activated pds pretreatment as the temperature increased from 30 c to 70 c noticeably the removal of atz increased from 24 11 to 100 by the solar activated pds pretreatment as the temperature increased from 30 c to 70 c indicating that the solar activated pds pretreatment displayed a more excellent performance for atz degradation in addition it was found that the heat activated pds pre oxidation hardly degraded atz at 30 c the atz removal by hp30 was only 0 3 indicating that the pds was not activated to generate sufficient so4 to degrade atz within the reaction time by contrast the solar activated pds pretreatment displayed a good excellent performance with a removal of 24 11 further verifying that sunlight radiation played a fundamental role in the solar activated pds pretreatment to degrade atz in the solar activated pds system the so4 was generated under the synergistic effects of heating and sunlight radiation when the temperature was at 50 c and 70 c the synergistic effects were enhanced and higher removals of atz were achieved with average removals of 50 25 and 100 respectively in the solar activated pds involved uf system 3 2 membrane fouling control in order to investigate the effects of pretreatments on mitigating membrane fouling the tmp developments and filtration resistance distributions were investigated as shown in fig 5 significant difference of tmp curves was observed under different pretreatments and temperatures which illustrated that pretreatments and temperatures both exerted remarkable influence on the membrane fouling as can be seen in fig 5 a the tmp of direct uf jumped fast and eventually increased to 72 8 kpa after five cycles of filtration the tmp curve of hp30 almost overlapped with the direct uf indicating that the heat activated pds pretreatment at 30 c had no effect on alleviating membrane fouling which was consistent with the weak removal performance of organic matters the tmp of hp70 and sp70 increased most slowly after five cycles of filtration and the final tmp was 22 1 kpa and 22 7 kpa respectively which was reduced by 68 8 and 69 6 compared with the direct uf indicating that the membrane fouling was effectively alleviated by heat or solar activated pds at 70 c due to the mineralization and reduction of organic foulants prior to uf interestingly the removal efficiency of nom by sp70 was significantly higher than that of hp70 but limited difference was observed in their mitigation for membrane fouling for example the doc removal by sp70 was 44 7 higher than that of hp70 however the final tmp value of sp70 was only 1 15 lower than that of hp70 this might be related that the increasing speed of membrane fouling became slower when the nom concentration in the feed prior to uf was lower than a certain value resulting in a slow increase of tmp which was difficult to make a significant difference in tmp within a limited filtration cycle this also showed from another aspect that there was no need to excessively reduce the amount of contaminants in feed water prior to uf when choosing membrane fouling control strategies rather it needed to be combined with actual needs to balance the water quality and membrane fouling instead to avoid the unnecessary waste of economy and energy the final tmp was ordered as follows direct uf hp30 hp50 sp50 sp30 hp70 sp70 and it can be concluded that solar activated pds pre oxidation exhibited more excellent performance in alleviating membrane fouling than heat activated pds pre treatments under the same conditions severe membrane fouling occurred in direct uf and its total and irreversible fouling resistances reached 6 06 1011 and 2 49 1011 m 1 in the last filtration cycle respectively the total and irreversible fouling resistances of the system hp30 were almost equal to direct uf which was consistent with the tmp increase with the temperature rising from 50 to 70 c the irreversible fouling resistance decreased from 1 36 1011 to 0 30 1011 m 1 in the last filtration cycle for the heat activated pds systems which was 45 4 and 88 0 lower than that of duf respectively by contrast the total and irreversible fouling resistances of the systems exposed to the sunlight all decreased significantly with the temperature rising from 30 to 70 c the irreversible fouling resistance in the last filtration cycle of the systems irradiated by sunlight decreased from 0 76 1011 to 0 32 1011 m 1 moreover when the temperature increased from 30 to 70 c the irreversible membranes fouling resistances of solar activated pds systems decreased by 68 3 36 7 and 6 8 respectively compared to heat activated pds systems under the same conditions which was inconsistent with the contaminants removals this further showed that more removals of pollutants did not alleviate membrane fouling more in some extent in addition with the increase of temperature the contribution of the photo effect on alleviating membrane fouling gradually decreased during the solar activated pds pretreatment while the heating effect gradually increased in general the solar activated pds pre oxidation had a better inhibitory effect on total and irreversible fouling resistance 3 3 mechanism of membrane fouling 3 3 1 mathematical modeling in order to explore the mechanism of membrane fouling the tmp curves of each system were fitted with the mathematical model and the results are shown in table 2 the four models could well describe membrane fouling for the groups of direct uf hp30 sp30 hp50 and sp50 in the first two cycles and intermediate blocking model and cake filtration model both exhibited better fitting degree with bigger r2 values than the other two models it was proved that intermediate blocking and cake layers dominated membrane fouling and there also existed complete blockage and standard blockage at the same time furthermore all groups could be well described by cake filtration model with the biggest r2 value in the third to fifth cycles of filtration indicating that membrane fouling was mainly caused by the cake layers in the middle and late stages of filtration since the organics accumulated in the vicinity of membrane surface for the groups of hp70 and sp70 the four models could not well describe membrane fouling with the r2 values 0 8 it could be seen that the increase of tmp was slow and the tmp curve was close to a straight line in fig 5 a this might be because there were rather few pollutants in the feed after heat or solar activated pds pretreatment and resulted in limited membrane fouling in the last two cycles of filtration correlation coefficient values r2 0 8 of regression analyses for membrane fouling were better than the former filtration stage and cake filtration model was more suited with the highest r2 value which suggested that cake layers formed gradually due to the accumulation of pollutants on the membrane surfaces and played the substantial role in the membrane fouling 3 3 2 fouling prediction in order to predict uf membrane fouling based on the concentrations of the main membrane foulants the correlation analysis between various organic fractions and membrane fouling indexes tfi and hifi was performed and the results are shown in fig 6 doc and uv254 displayed moderate correlations with both tfi doc r2 0 5775 p 0 0474 uv254 r2 0 7058 p 0 0180 and hifi doc r2 0 6581 p 0 0268 uv254 r2 0 7900 p 0 0074 in fig 6 a and b however for the hydraulic irreversible fouling the uv254 r2 0 7900 p 0 0074 exhibited a stronger correlation than doc r2 0 6581 p 0 0268 this could provide a new perspective for the pretreatment prior to uf in order to mitigate membrane fouling in treating songhua river water the factors related to membrane fouling were mainly uv254 value rather than the typically doc content sometimes cost effective methods e g oxidation could be used to reduce the uv254 value instead of doc content which could also effectively alleviate membrane fouling fig 6 c f illustrates the correlations between fouling indexes tfi and hifi and the fmax of each fluorescent component the fmax of both c2 and c3 showed outstanding correlations with fouling indexes tfi and hifi with the r2 0 8 and p 0 05 however no significant correlation was observed between fouling indexes tfi and hifi and the fmax of c1 with the r2 0 5 and p 0 05 although both c1 and c2 were related to humic like substances according to the research of phong phong and hur 2015 c1 might be related to microbial transformation products of c2 typically the fluorescence peaks at longer wavelengths i e emission wavelengths exhibited a more condensed and polymerized structure for humic substances lee et al 2015 therefore c2 with a larger molecular weight was more likely to cause uf membrane fouling than c1 in some extends in general c2 showed the best correlation with tfi r2 0 8764 p 0 0019 while c3 showed the best correlation with hifi r2 0 8987 p 0 0011 indicating that c2 represented terrestrially derived humic like matters mainly contributed total membrane fouling while c3 belonged to protein like substances were the main cause of irreversible membrane resistance 3 3 3 membrane cleaning the fluorescence spectra of extracted hydraulic irreversible foulants on the membranes in different systems are displayed in fig 7 b h the fluorescence spectrum of the raw water shown in fig 7 a was measured as a comparison to clarify the substances related to hydraulic irreversible fouling of the membrane for the raw water peak t1 ex em 265 421 nm played a dominant role in the eem spectra which was derived from fulvic acid like substances chen 2003 peaks t2 ex em 275 303 nm and t3 ex em 220 330 nm were obviously observed in the spectra for all water samples from membranes chemically cleaned which represented protein like substances containing tryptophan and aromatic protein respectively cheng et al 2017a guo et al 2018 although fulvic acid like substances were identified in the songhua river raw water the corresponding peak t1 ex em 265 421 nm was not detected in all samples from membranes chemically cleaned wastewater in fig 7 b h therefore the hydraulic irreversible pollutants for the systems of single uf hp30 sp30 hp50 sp50 hp70 and sp70 were mainly composed of aromatic protein and protein like substances containing tryptophan rather than fulvic acid like substances these results were consistent with the aforementioned hypothesis in section 3 3 2 fig 6 e that c3 represented protein like substances showed the strongest correlation with the hydraulic irreversible fouling index hifi surprisingly it was found that the position of peak t1 almost coincided with c1 and the positions of peaks t2 and t3 also almost overlapped with c3 seen in the fig s1 in supplementary material however the peak of c2 was not clearly observed in all samples probably because the concentration of c2 was too low to meet the detection limit and the three dimensional fluorescence parallel factor analysis could identify and pseudo quantify such low concentration the fluorescent component this proved the effectiveness of the three dimensional fluorescence parallel factor analysis method for fluorescent organics that were difficult to distinguish by direct fluorescence measurement since the intensities of fluorescent substances t1 t2 and t3 related to the hydraulic irreversible foulants could not be directly measured and some relationships between fluorescent substances corresponding to the peaks t1 t2 and t3 and fluorescent components c1 c2 and c3 could be obtained from table 3 thus concentrations of c1 c2 and c3 could be pseudo quantified by three dimensional fluorescence parallel factor analysis to quantitatively explore the effects of pretreatments on membrane irreversible fouling table 4 shows the fmax of different components in various water samples from the above studies it had been known that both c1 and c2 belonged to humic like substances and c3 derived from protein like substances for the raw water the fmax of c1 and c2 were comparable which were almost four times higher than the fmax of c3 it was almost the opposite that the fmax of c3 was remarkable higher than that of c1 and c2 for the samples from chemical cleaning based on the huge differences in the concentrations of fluorescent components only humic like and protein like substances were observed in raw water and chemical cleaning wastewater of the contaminated membranes respectively in addition there also existed a small amount of humic like substances in hydraulic irreversible foulants which could explain the positive correlations between c1 c2 and hifi in fig 7 the fmax of c3 in the direct uf system was the highest among all samples indicating that pretreatments prior to uf effectively reduced the fluorescence intensity of irreversible organic foulants the result seemed consistent with the hydraulic irreversible fouling resistance of different systems in fig 5 b it was known that terrestrially derived humic like matters c2 and protein like substances c3 were the main factors causing total membrane fouling and hydraulic irreversible fouling respectively however c2 was not observed in the chemical cleaning wastewater only c3 was found this indicated that hydraulic backwash washed away most of c2 and it had no significant effect on c3 the virgin membrane was hydrophobic with a contact angle of 61 679 2 857 according to our previous studies the uf membrane was made of pes material modified by the manufacturer guo et al 2020 and therefore a hydrophilic layer was easily formed in the boundary layer between the membrane interface and water due to hydrogen bonding interactions which could prevent or reduce undesirable adsorption or adhesion of hydrophobic contaminants on the membrane surface kochkodan and hilal 2015 thus protein like substances was more susceptible to fouling membrane than humic like matters due to stronger hydrophilicity which also implied that it was more difficult to remove protein like substances accumulated on the membrane surfaces or deposited in the membrane pores by hydraulic backwash 3 3 4 characterization of fouled uf membranes ftir spectra of the new and contaminated uf membranes were performed to identify the retained organic pollutants on the membrane surface as shown in fig 8 a all fouled membranes contained a strong absorbance peak at around 3284 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of hydrogen bonds oh and a weak signal at 2936 cm 1 due to ch stretching vibrations namguk et al 2008 tian et al 2018 indicating that some hydrophilic organic pollutants contributed to membrane fouling a typical absorbance peak at around 1080 cm 1 was observed for the virgin uf membrane in fig 8 b which could be ascribable to the presence of aromatic ring vibrations in the pes membrane wang et al 2015 in addition a broad band at 1031 cm 1 was found for both new and contaminated uf membranes which was due to the coc and co bands gamage and shankararaman 2014 meanwhile the peak intensity at 1031 cm 1 of the contaminated membrane was much greater than that of the new membrane which meant that organic matters were significantly accumulated on the membrane surface the peak at 915 cm 1 corresponded to the si o band gamage and shankararaman 2014 which might be a precipitate of silicon due to rejection of inorganic particles by membrane guo et al 2018 although solar and heat activated pds pre oxidation had almost no big difference in the functional groups of irreversible membrane pollutants it could also be seen that organic matters contributed the irreversible membrane fouling 4 conclusions in this study the effects of solar activated pds oxidation and the respective role of heating and sunlight radiation on the uf membrane fouling control in treating the natural surface water were investigated the conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 in the process of solar activated pds pre oxidation solar light effect dominated the activation of pds at the temperature below 50 c and both solar light and heating effects contributed to the production of free radicals at the temperature of 50 c the heating effect conferred the dual function of accelerating the reaction speed 30 70 c and generating free radicals 50 70 c 2 solar activated pds pretreatment can alleviate the membrane fouling caused by organic foulants at 30 c and its performance improved significantly with the increase of temperature however the fouling control performance was comparable to heat activated pds pretreatment at 70 c due to the limited nom concentration in the feed 3 for the groups of raw water hp30 sp30 hp50 and sp50 intermediate blocking and cake layers dominated membrane fouling in the initial filtration and then transferred to cake layer fouling in the middle and late filtration stages for the groups of hp70 and sp70 the four models could not describe membrane fouling well in the first three filtration cycles due to few pollutants in the feed after pretreatments hp70 and sp70 and cake layers mostly contributed to the membrane fouling in the later filtration stages 4 the irreversible membrane fouling were mainly caused by protein like substances containing tryptophan t2 and aromatic protein t3 due to their stronger hydrophilicity rather than humic like matters besides terrestrially derived humic like matters c2 and protein like substances c3 in the feed water were the main causes of total membrane fouling and irreversible membrane fouling respectively moreover uv254 of feed water exhibited a greater impact on the hydraulic irreversible fouling than doc and can be used as the indicator of membrane fouling control strategies in treating the natural surface water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17410,solar energy is considered one of the most promising energy sources for the degradation of pollutants in the water treatments an innovative solar photo thermochemical system involving peroxydisulfate pds as an oxidant and xenon lamp as a solar irradiation light source was applied with hopes to degrade organic matters and alleviate the ultrafiltration uf membrane fouling when treating the real surface water moreover heat activated pds pretreatment was used as a comparison to explore the respective proportions of solar light and heating effects finding that solar light effect dominated the activation of pds to degrade natural organic matters noms when the reaction temperature was below 50 c and they both contributed to the production of free radicals at the temperature of 50 c the results indicated that solar activated pds pretreatment significantly alleviated membrane fouling caused by songhua river water with the highest transmembrane pressure tmp reduction of approximately 69 6 at 70 c organic substances characterized by doc uv254 and the maximum florescent intensity and micropollutant atrazine in the feed water were better degraded in the presence of solar light both total fouling index tfi and hydraulic irreversible fouling index hifi were moderate correlated with the uv254 and doc whereas remarkably correlated with the fmax of component 2 c2 and component 3 c3 in addition no significant correlation was observed between fouling indexes tfi and hifi and the fmax of component 1 c1 the membrane irreversible fouling was attributed to the accumulation of cake layers mainly composed of protein like substances on the membrane surface solar activated pds pretreatment would efficiently degrade the protein like substances and terrestrially derived humic like matters to control uf membrane fouling the findings are beneficial to develop new strategies for membrane fouling alleviation based on the solar irradiation and pds oxidation graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words solar activated peroxydisulfate ultrafiltration membrane fouling natural organic matter nom 1 introduction ultrafiltration uf is increasingly widely being used in the water and wastewater treatments due to its simplicity of operation low cost and excellent retention performance however the membrane fouling caused by natural organic matters noms jermann et al 2008 zularisam et al 2011 has always been a key factor limiting its widespread application various methods can be applied to reduce membrane fouling mainly including reducing contaminants prior to uf by pretreatments saquib et al 2010 zheng et al 2009 optimizing the operating parameters chang et al 2016 and improving the anti pollution performance of membrane material huang et al 2020 nasrollahi et al 2018 the reduction of pollutants is usually by pretreatments prior to uf to degrade or intercept substances that may cause the membrane fouling recently the application of using advanced oxidation process that stimulates persulfate to degrade noms in surface water to alleviate uf membrane fouling has attracted some researchers cheng et al 2017b tian et al 2018 using persulfate in pre oxidation process as an oxidant has its unique advantages over other pretreatments prior to uf persulfate is a cheap chemical oxidant which has lots of advantages firstly it possesses a considerable oxidation potential e0 2 5 3 1 v and reacts with organic compounds with a second order rate constant of 106 109 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2020 moreover the produced sulfate radicals have a longer radical lifetime t1 2 30 40 μs and higher selectivity toward electro rich organic pollutants deng et al 2019 xu et al 2020 more importantly the reactivity of sulfate radicals are less restricted with ph which can react with pollutants under a wide range of ph conditions deng et al 2017 as a result persulfate is increasingly being used in water treatment and various ways to activate persulfate are being developed among them artificial ultraviolet uv light is one of the most widely used methods in a previous study uv light combined with persulfate exhibited a significant effect on the degradation of nom in surface water tian et al 2018 although uv combined with oxidation process had a significant degradation effect on pollutants alvarez et al 2020 uv radiation was generally dependent on the extra power supply and would consume a large amount of electricity xing et al 2018 in addition to uv radiation solar energy regarded as a green and sustainable resource could also stimulate the production of free radicals in advanced oxidation miralles et al miralles cuevas et al 2017 compared ultraviolet and solar combined advanced oxidation technologies to treat five kinds of micro contaminants and reported that the final total costs of solar combined advanced oxidation technology was the lowest when the target pollutant degradation rate reached 90 thus solar energy can be an alternative to ultraviolet light sources in some specific cases especially in some decentralized systems that treat the potable water for a single household or a community peter varbanets et al 2009 recently the utilization of full solar spectrum for the degradation of pollutants in water and wastewater treatments has attracted the attention of many researchers due to its unique advantages kowalska et al 2020 saleh and al nimr 2019 currently the main means of using solar energy to treat water or wastewater include direct use of solar energy using some uv absorbing or visible light absorbing materials xu et al 2019 and conversion of solar energy into electric using photovoltaic panels to generate electricity wang et al 2017 or thermal using infrared absorbing materials or light concentrating elements lin et al 2019 energy for instance wang et al wang et al 2017 constructed a new hybrid system that integrated the photo electrochemical reactor with photovoltaic which activated persulfate in uv bands generated power in the visible and near infrared bands and heated solution temperature in the far infrared bands respectively lin et al lin et al 2019 established a system combining sunlight focusing with solar tracking for the treatment of pharmaceutical pollutants and gained significant effect in the presence of persulfate in this research a system coupling solar energy with an uf system was investigated peroxydisulfate pds was added to the water samples to degrade noms and micro pollutants in this system the uv band of the solar spectrum can activate pds into strong sulfate radicals thereby degrading noms and micro pollutants prior to uf far infrared spectrum can promote the temperature of the solution to contribute to the activation of pds and simultaneously speeding up the reaction rate the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of solar activated pds pre oxidation on the removals of organics in songhua river water and alleviations of uf membrane fouling the impact of pre oxidation on membrane fouling was evaluated by transmembrane pressure tmp developments and reversibility analysis characterization of changes in organic matters by various methods and comparing with heat activated pds pretreatment moreover four typical membrane fouling models and chemical cleaning were applied to investigate the mechanisms of alleviating membrane fouling by solar activated pds pretreatment various organic indicators including uv254 doc and the three fluorescent components were used to establish correlation analysis with membrane fouling indexes to predict membrane fouling the results are expected to provide some new perspectives for membrane fouling control strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw water the raw water was collected from songhua river in harbin between june and september 2019 the collected water samples were pre filtered through a 0 45 µm cellulose ester membrane shanghai xin ya purification equipment co ltd china and then stored in the refrigerator at 4 c before experiments the water characteristics of collected water samples were as follows turbidity 15 2 31 2 ntu uv254 0 156 0 165 cm 1 doc 5 91 6 61 mg l and ph 7 2 7 9 2 2 experimental setup 2 2 1 pretreatments heat activated and solar activated pds were adopted as pretreatments prior to uf membranes sodium peroxydisulfate na2s2o8 purchased from aladdin chemicals shanghai china was used as an oxidant the stock solution of sodium peroxydisulfate was prepared with a concentration of 50 mm since solar energy has a synergistic effect of light and heat a thermostatic water bath was used to investigate the effects of heating during the pretreatments the temperature was kept at 30 50 and 70 c respectively during heat activated recorded as hp30 hp50 and hp70 respectively and solar activated recorded as sp30 sp50 and sp70 respectively pds pre oxidation shown in table 1 the dosage of pds was 0 4 mm and the reaction time lasted 2 h the pre oxidation reactor was displayed in fig 1 a which mainly included a thermostatic control switch lb8 lcd lueabb china a thermostatic water bath a fresnel lens shandong yuying optical instrument co ltd china a solar simulator hsx f uv300 nbet china and a reactor the thermostatic water bath and oxidation reactor were both made of quartz glass and the effective height and diameter of the oxidation reactor were 162 and 113 mm respectively experiments of solar or heat activated pds pre oxidation were conducted by turning on or off the solar simulator and other conditions remained the same solar activated pds pro oxidation were performed under a light intensity of 1 kw m2 corresponding to 1 sun illumination the fresnel lens was used to focus sunlight and the light barrier was used to prevent the effect of external light on the experiments 2 2 2 membrane filtration in order to eliminate the effects of water temperature all water samples were cooled to the room temperature prior to uf in both the heating and solar involving pretreatments a commercially flat sheet polyethersulfone pes membrane 150 kda microdyn nadir germany was employed in the filtration experiments the effective filtration area of the uf membrane was 13 1 cm2 a schematic diagram of the experimental setup is illustrated in fig 1 b uf experiments were conducted in a filtration cell with an effective volume of 160 ml in dead end mode at a constant permeate flux which was maintained by a peristaltic pump bt100 2j lange china the flux was adjusted by controlling the speed of the peristaltic pump during filtration experiments the transmembrane pressure tmp was monitored using a pressure sensor sin p300 sinomeasure china and the output data was recorded via an automatic data acquisition system in order to speed up the irreversible membrane fouling hydraulic backwash for the membrane was utilized at the end of each filtration cycle the permeate flux was adjusted to 237 l m 2 h 1 and the backwashing flux was 1 5 times approximately 355 l m 2 h 1 of it in addition a time sequence of 29 min for filtration and 1 min for backwashing was performed 2 3 fouling resistance analysis the resistance in series model lin et al 2009 was used in this study to investigate the influence of pretreatments on the membrane fouling behavior as shown in eq 1 1 r t t m p μ j r m r i r r r 2 r m t m p 0 μ j 3 r r t m p 1 μ j t m p 2 μ j 4 r i r r t r m r r t m p 2 μ j t m p 0 μ j where rt m 1 is the total resistance during the uf process tmp pa is the transmembrane pressure μ pa s is the dynamic viscosity of the water samples j m s 1 is the membrane permeate flux rm m 1 rr m 1 and rir m 1 are the intrinsic membrane resistance reversible resistance and irreversible resistance respectively at the beginning of each uf experiment pure water filtration was conducted to determine the transmembrane pressure of the membrane tmp0 for calculation of the intrinsic membrane resistance rm as shown in eq 2 after each hydraulic backwash the transmembrane pressure of cleaned membrane was recorded as tmp2 hence rr and rir were calculated according to eqs 3 and 4 respectively in addition fouling index fi was utilized to establish correlation analysis with various organic indicators for membrane fouling assessment in this study fi was described in detail in previous researches huang et al 2008 nguyen et al 2011 and it can be briefly calculated by the following eq 5 5 1 j s t m p i n i t m p 0 1 f i v s where js is the normalized transmembrane pressure tmp0 pa is the same as in the eq 4 tmpini pa is the transmembrane pressure measured after each hydraulic backwash fi m 1 is the fouling index vs m3 m2 is specific volume of filtrate fi can be representative of total fouling index tfi or hydraulic irreversible fouling index hifi if relevant js and vs are determined 2 4 membrane fouling model four typical mathematical models were usually employed to interpret the mechanism of uf membrane fouling which were complete blocking model standard blocking model intermediate blocking model and cake filtration model bowen et al 1995 corbatón báguena et al 2015 hermia 1982 the expressions of the four models are listed in table s1 of the supplementary data where p0 is the initial tmp p is the instantaneous tmp β and σ are the parameters related to the sample j is the permeate flux t is the filtration time r0 is the initial size of membrane pore n is the number of membrane pores per unit area e is the thickness of the membrane and μ is the viscosity of the sample 2 5 analytical methods the uv254 was detected using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer t6 puxi china at the wavelength of 254 nm the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was determined using a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan direct fluorescence measurement used a fluorescence spectrophotometer f7000 hitachi japan to characterize the fluorescence properties of organic matters and then the fluorescence spectra the fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems of the samples were obtained three dimensional fluorescence parallel factor analysis was used to process the obtained fluorescence spectrum by dividing them into several components eems were generated by scanning over excitation wavelengths of 200 450 nm at an interval of 5 nm and emission wavelengths of 250 550 nm at an interval of 1 nm each sample eem deducted an eem of milli q water to remove the raman scatter peaks murphy et al 2010 the details of the approach had been described by stedmon and bro stedmon and bro 2008 moreover an attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy spectrum one perkin elmer usa was utilized to characterize the major functional groups of substances on the membrane surfaces each membrane sample was scanned 16 times with wave numbers ranging from 600 to 4000 cm 1 2 6 extraction of pollutants at the end of each experiment the residual pollutants were extracted from the contaminated membranes after hydraulic backwash firstly the membranes were soaked in the 0 01 mol l naoh solution for 24 h at 20 c then full oscillation ensured that the irreversible contaminants on the membrane surface or in the membrane pores were cleaned out finally the ph of the chemical solution was adjusted to neutral using hcl solution the extracted organic foulants were then stored in the refrigerator 4 c for further analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 removals of organic pollutants 3 1 1 uv254 and doc fig 2 shows the removal efficiencies of uv254 and doc by different pretreatments the uv254 and doc concentrations of raw water were in the range of 0 156 0 165 cm 1 and 5 91 6 61 mg l during the experiments as can be seen in fig 2 a and c single uf had a certain removal for both uv254 and doc however the uv254 and doc removals were limited to approximately 14 05 and 2 15 respectively which was consistent with the previous studies guo et al 2018 shao et al 2017 tang et al 2018 in the condition of heat activated pds pretreatment low temperature 30 c could hardly degrade uv254 and doc in the raw water with the temperature increasing from 50 to 70 c heat activated pds pre oxidation conferred a significant impact on the organic degradation with average removal of uv254 increasing from 1 59 to 34 29 and doc removal elevating from 3 05 to 26 01 by comparison solar activated pds pretreatment had measurable removals of both uv254 9 42 and doc 2 52 in low temperature cases 30 c interestingly when the temperature rose from 30 to 70 c the average removals of uv254 and doc increased to 60 40 and 47 04 respectively the results indicated that solar activated pds pretreatment exhibited better performance in uv254 and doc removal due to the synergistic effect of solar light and heat thus solar light and heating effects both played an important part in activating pds and degrading noms during solar activated pds pretreatment when the temperature was above 50 c and the rising temperature would also accelerate the generation of free radicals and rate of chemical reactions huang et al 2002 lin 2001 from fig 2 it can be inferred that 50 c was a critical value for either heat activated pds or solar activated pds approach when the reaction temperature was below 50 c heat activated pds had almost no effect on removing pollutants uv254 and doc removal by hp30 pretreatment was 0 61 and 0 46 respectively while solar activated pds also just displayed slight removals of organic foulants uv254 and doc removal by sp30 pretreatment was 9 42 and 2 52 respectively these results implied that the solar light effect dominated the activation of pds and the rising temperature 50 c was mainly to accelerate the production of free radicals and rate of chemical reactions when the reaction temperature was below 50 c supportively previous study lin et al 2019 reported that the activation of pds could not occur either under 60 c or without necessary sunlight and the increasing temperature would facilitate the generating rate of so4 further studies even indicated that the activation of pds by a simulated sunlight at 50 c the final removal rate was about 73 after 3 h displayed better performance in the degradation of sulfamethoxazole than only by heating almost no degradation was observed in the dark at the same temperature lin et al 2019 in the present study both heat and solar activated pds pretreatments exhibited efficient removal performance for uv254 and doc when the water temperature was above 50 c the uv254 removal by hp50 hp70 sp50 and sp70 was 3 05 34 29 17 99 and 60 38 respectively while the doc removal by hp50 hp70 sp50 and sp70 was 1 59 26 00 15 51 and 47 04 respectively it was obvious that 50 c was a threshold temperature in such experimental conditions compared with direct uf process pre oxidation hp70 sp50 and sp70 apparently decreased the doc concentration of uf permeate however cheng et al reported that pre ozonation would increased the doc concentration in the uf permeate by converting high molecular weight organic molecules into small and hydrophilic fragments which were easier to pass through membrane pores cheng et al 2017a cheng et al 2016 the conflicting results were related to the facts that heat or solar activated pds pre oxidation not only destroyed the structure of nom but also mineralized it to carbon dioxide thus decreasing the feed doc concentration of uf 3 1 2 fluorescent organic matter fluorescent organic matter played a fundamental role in the uf membrane fouling shao et al 2014 tian et al 2015 parallel factor analysis parafac had been utilized in this study and three typical components had been identified in songhua river water which were c1 ex em 240 310 400 450 nm represented the microbial or marine humic like substances c2 ex em 270 360 470 nm was related to the terrestrially derived humic like matters and c3 ex em 225 280 340 nm belonged to the protein like substances derived biological production in surface water respectively the spectra of three typical components are displayed in fig s1 in supplement material as shown in fig 3 the heat activated pds hardly exerted an effect on degrading c1 and c2 at 30 c and had a slight degradation for them at 50 c the c1 and c2 removals by hp50 were 2 06 and 0 87 respectively but showed a significant removal at 70 c the c1 and c2 removals by hp70 were 24 52 and 61 64 respectively this kept consistent with the doc removal and further proved that 50 c was the threshold temperature of activating pds only the temperature was above it there would be the production of sufficient so4 to degrade pollutants in raw water interestingly the solar activated pds pretreatment displayed an excellent removal performance for both c1 and c2 at only 30 c the c1 and c2 removals by sp30 were 29 22 and 45 98 respectively which indicated that the solar activated pds pretreatment had a better degradation for both c1 and c2 at room temperature strangely the c1 removal by solar activated pds pretreatment at 50 c was lower than that of at 30 c the c1 removals by sp30 and sp50 were 29 22 and 25 67 respectively and the removal efficiency of c2 by solar activated pds pretreatment at 50 c was higher than that of at 30 c the removal of c2 by sp30 and sp50 was 45 98 and 53 40 respectively this might due to the different concentrations of c1 and c2 in raw water that the fmax of c1 in raw water by sp50 7 45 r u was 1 25 times higher than that of sp30 5 96 r u as shown in fig 3 e and f the two pre oxidation approaches both seemed to be very effective for the degradation of c3 apart from hp30 which was significantly different from both c1 and c2 the c3 removal by pre oxidations followed the order of sp70 81 64 hp70 72 32 sp50 36 94 sp30 14 97 hp50 14 40 hp30 2 61 suggesting that c3 was more sensitive to both temperature and solar light in addition the c3 removal by heat activated pds at 50 c was significantly better than that of c1 and c2 indicating that c3 was vulnerable to temperature changes according to the previous researches guo et al 2018 c3 was related to the protein like substances derived biological production and temperature changes liu et al 2016 and solar light mainly ultraviolet light phong and hur 2015 would easily cause apparent denaturation of protein like substances resulting in the destruction of their internal structure there was almost no degradation of pollutants by heat activated pds pretreatment at 30 c the c1 c2 and c3 removals by hp30 were 0 03 0 41 and 2 61 respectively therefore hp30 could be regarded as a reference for sp30 and the removals of pollutants by solar activated pds pretreatment at 30 c the c1 c2 and c3 removals by sp30 were 29 22 45 98 and 14 97 respectively could almost be considered as the result of the solar photo effect alone 3 1 3 micropollutant atrazine atz was selected as a typical micro pollutant representing herbicides which was frequently found in the drinking water sources and posed a threat to human health and aquatic ecosystems guzzella et al 2006 ouyang et al 2017 the removal efficiency of atz in different systems is illustrated in fig 4 in the experiment of atz removal the employed dose of pds was 0 4 mmol l and the concentration of atz in the raw water was about 1 µmol l the direct uf had a limited removal effect on atz with average removal of 5 03 the removal of atz increased from 0 3 to 41 36 by the heat activated pds pretreatment as the temperature increased from 30 c to 70 c noticeably the removal of atz increased from 24 11 to 100 by the solar activated pds pretreatment as the temperature increased from 30 c to 70 c indicating that the solar activated pds pretreatment displayed a more excellent performance for atz degradation in addition it was found that the heat activated pds pre oxidation hardly degraded atz at 30 c the atz removal by hp30 was only 0 3 indicating that the pds was not activated to generate sufficient so4 to degrade atz within the reaction time by contrast the solar activated pds pretreatment displayed a good excellent performance with a removal of 24 11 further verifying that sunlight radiation played a fundamental role in the solar activated pds pretreatment to degrade atz in the solar activated pds system the so4 was generated under the synergistic effects of heating and sunlight radiation when the temperature was at 50 c and 70 c the synergistic effects were enhanced and higher removals of atz were achieved with average removals of 50 25 and 100 respectively in the solar activated pds involved uf system 3 2 membrane fouling control in order to investigate the effects of pretreatments on mitigating membrane fouling the tmp developments and filtration resistance distributions were investigated as shown in fig 5 significant difference of tmp curves was observed under different pretreatments and temperatures which illustrated that pretreatments and temperatures both exerted remarkable influence on the membrane fouling as can be seen in fig 5 a the tmp of direct uf jumped fast and eventually increased to 72 8 kpa after five cycles of filtration the tmp curve of hp30 almost overlapped with the direct uf indicating that the heat activated pds pretreatment at 30 c had no effect on alleviating membrane fouling which was consistent with the weak removal performance of organic matters the tmp of hp70 and sp70 increased most slowly after five cycles of filtration and the final tmp was 22 1 kpa and 22 7 kpa respectively which was reduced by 68 8 and 69 6 compared with the direct uf indicating that the membrane fouling was effectively alleviated by heat or solar activated pds at 70 c due to the mineralization and reduction of organic foulants prior to uf interestingly the removal efficiency of nom by sp70 was significantly higher than that of hp70 but limited difference was observed in their mitigation for membrane fouling for example the doc removal by sp70 was 44 7 higher than that of hp70 however the final tmp value of sp70 was only 1 15 lower than that of hp70 this might be related that the increasing speed of membrane fouling became slower when the nom concentration in the feed prior to uf was lower than a certain value resulting in a slow increase of tmp which was difficult to make a significant difference in tmp within a limited filtration cycle this also showed from another aspect that there was no need to excessively reduce the amount of contaminants in feed water prior to uf when choosing membrane fouling control strategies rather it needed to be combined with actual needs to balance the water quality and membrane fouling instead to avoid the unnecessary waste of economy and energy the final tmp was ordered as follows direct uf hp30 hp50 sp50 sp30 hp70 sp70 and it can be concluded that solar activated pds pre oxidation exhibited more excellent performance in alleviating membrane fouling than heat activated pds pre treatments under the same conditions severe membrane fouling occurred in direct uf and its total and irreversible fouling resistances reached 6 06 1011 and 2 49 1011 m 1 in the last filtration cycle respectively the total and irreversible fouling resistances of the system hp30 were almost equal to direct uf which was consistent with the tmp increase with the temperature rising from 50 to 70 c the irreversible fouling resistance decreased from 1 36 1011 to 0 30 1011 m 1 in the last filtration cycle for the heat activated pds systems which was 45 4 and 88 0 lower than that of duf respectively by contrast the total and irreversible fouling resistances of the systems exposed to the sunlight all decreased significantly with the temperature rising from 30 to 70 c the irreversible fouling resistance in the last filtration cycle of the systems irradiated by sunlight decreased from 0 76 1011 to 0 32 1011 m 1 moreover when the temperature increased from 30 to 70 c the irreversible membranes fouling resistances of solar activated pds systems decreased by 68 3 36 7 and 6 8 respectively compared to heat activated pds systems under the same conditions which was inconsistent with the contaminants removals this further showed that more removals of pollutants did not alleviate membrane fouling more in some extent in addition with the increase of temperature the contribution of the photo effect on alleviating membrane fouling gradually decreased during the solar activated pds pretreatment while the heating effect gradually increased in general the solar activated pds pre oxidation had a better inhibitory effect on total and irreversible fouling resistance 3 3 mechanism of membrane fouling 3 3 1 mathematical modeling in order to explore the mechanism of membrane fouling the tmp curves of each system were fitted with the mathematical model and the results are shown in table 2 the four models could well describe membrane fouling for the groups of direct uf hp30 sp30 hp50 and sp50 in the first two cycles and intermediate blocking model and cake filtration model both exhibited better fitting degree with bigger r2 values than the other two models it was proved that intermediate blocking and cake layers dominated membrane fouling and there also existed complete blockage and standard blockage at the same time furthermore all groups could be well described by cake filtration model with the biggest r2 value in the third to fifth cycles of filtration indicating that membrane fouling was mainly caused by the cake layers in the middle and late stages of filtration since the organics accumulated in the vicinity of membrane surface for the groups of hp70 and sp70 the four models could not well describe membrane fouling with the r2 values 0 8 it could be seen that the increase of tmp was slow and the tmp curve was close to a straight line in fig 5 a this might be because there were rather few pollutants in the feed after heat or solar activated pds pretreatment and resulted in limited membrane fouling in the last two cycles of filtration correlation coefficient values r2 0 8 of regression analyses for membrane fouling were better than the former filtration stage and cake filtration model was more suited with the highest r2 value which suggested that cake layers formed gradually due to the accumulation of pollutants on the membrane surfaces and played the substantial role in the membrane fouling 3 3 2 fouling prediction in order to predict uf membrane fouling based on the concentrations of the main membrane foulants the correlation analysis between various organic fractions and membrane fouling indexes tfi and hifi was performed and the results are shown in fig 6 doc and uv254 displayed moderate correlations with both tfi doc r2 0 5775 p 0 0474 uv254 r2 0 7058 p 0 0180 and hifi doc r2 0 6581 p 0 0268 uv254 r2 0 7900 p 0 0074 in fig 6 a and b however for the hydraulic irreversible fouling the uv254 r2 0 7900 p 0 0074 exhibited a stronger correlation than doc r2 0 6581 p 0 0268 this could provide a new perspective for the pretreatment prior to uf in order to mitigate membrane fouling in treating songhua river water the factors related to membrane fouling were mainly uv254 value rather than the typically doc content sometimes cost effective methods e g oxidation could be used to reduce the uv254 value instead of doc content which could also effectively alleviate membrane fouling fig 6 c f illustrates the correlations between fouling indexes tfi and hifi and the fmax of each fluorescent component the fmax of both c2 and c3 showed outstanding correlations with fouling indexes tfi and hifi with the r2 0 8 and p 0 05 however no significant correlation was observed between fouling indexes tfi and hifi and the fmax of c1 with the r2 0 5 and p 0 05 although both c1 and c2 were related to humic like substances according to the research of phong phong and hur 2015 c1 might be related to microbial transformation products of c2 typically the fluorescence peaks at longer wavelengths i e emission wavelengths exhibited a more condensed and polymerized structure for humic substances lee et al 2015 therefore c2 with a larger molecular weight was more likely to cause uf membrane fouling than c1 in some extends in general c2 showed the best correlation with tfi r2 0 8764 p 0 0019 while c3 showed the best correlation with hifi r2 0 8987 p 0 0011 indicating that c2 represented terrestrially derived humic like matters mainly contributed total membrane fouling while c3 belonged to protein like substances were the main cause of irreversible membrane resistance 3 3 3 membrane cleaning the fluorescence spectra of extracted hydraulic irreversible foulants on the membranes in different systems are displayed in fig 7 b h the fluorescence spectrum of the raw water shown in fig 7 a was measured as a comparison to clarify the substances related to hydraulic irreversible fouling of the membrane for the raw water peak t1 ex em 265 421 nm played a dominant role in the eem spectra which was derived from fulvic acid like substances chen 2003 peaks t2 ex em 275 303 nm and t3 ex em 220 330 nm were obviously observed in the spectra for all water samples from membranes chemically cleaned which represented protein like substances containing tryptophan and aromatic protein respectively cheng et al 2017a guo et al 2018 although fulvic acid like substances were identified in the songhua river raw water the corresponding peak t1 ex em 265 421 nm was not detected in all samples from membranes chemically cleaned wastewater in fig 7 b h therefore the hydraulic irreversible pollutants for the systems of single uf hp30 sp30 hp50 sp50 hp70 and sp70 were mainly composed of aromatic protein and protein like substances containing tryptophan rather than fulvic acid like substances these results were consistent with the aforementioned hypothesis in section 3 3 2 fig 6 e that c3 represented protein like substances showed the strongest correlation with the hydraulic irreversible fouling index hifi surprisingly it was found that the position of peak t1 almost coincided with c1 and the positions of peaks t2 and t3 also almost overlapped with c3 seen in the fig s1 in supplementary material however the peak of c2 was not clearly observed in all samples probably because the concentration of c2 was too low to meet the detection limit and the three dimensional fluorescence parallel factor analysis could identify and pseudo quantify such low concentration the fluorescent component this proved the effectiveness of the three dimensional fluorescence parallel factor analysis method for fluorescent organics that were difficult to distinguish by direct fluorescence measurement since the intensities of fluorescent substances t1 t2 and t3 related to the hydraulic irreversible foulants could not be directly measured and some relationships between fluorescent substances corresponding to the peaks t1 t2 and t3 and fluorescent components c1 c2 and c3 could be obtained from table 3 thus concentrations of c1 c2 and c3 could be pseudo quantified by three dimensional fluorescence parallel factor analysis to quantitatively explore the effects of pretreatments on membrane irreversible fouling table 4 shows the fmax of different components in various water samples from the above studies it had been known that both c1 and c2 belonged to humic like substances and c3 derived from protein like substances for the raw water the fmax of c1 and c2 were comparable which were almost four times higher than the fmax of c3 it was almost the opposite that the fmax of c3 was remarkable higher than that of c1 and c2 for the samples from chemical cleaning based on the huge differences in the concentrations of fluorescent components only humic like and protein like substances were observed in raw water and chemical cleaning wastewater of the contaminated membranes respectively in addition there also existed a small amount of humic like substances in hydraulic irreversible foulants which could explain the positive correlations between c1 c2 and hifi in fig 7 the fmax of c3 in the direct uf system was the highest among all samples indicating that pretreatments prior to uf effectively reduced the fluorescence intensity of irreversible organic foulants the result seemed consistent with the hydraulic irreversible fouling resistance of different systems in fig 5 b it was known that terrestrially derived humic like matters c2 and protein like substances c3 were the main factors causing total membrane fouling and hydraulic irreversible fouling respectively however c2 was not observed in the chemical cleaning wastewater only c3 was found this indicated that hydraulic backwash washed away most of c2 and it had no significant effect on c3 the virgin membrane was hydrophobic with a contact angle of 61 679 2 857 according to our previous studies the uf membrane was made of pes material modified by the manufacturer guo et al 2020 and therefore a hydrophilic layer was easily formed in the boundary layer between the membrane interface and water due to hydrogen bonding interactions which could prevent or reduce undesirable adsorption or adhesion of hydrophobic contaminants on the membrane surface kochkodan and hilal 2015 thus protein like substances was more susceptible to fouling membrane than humic like matters due to stronger hydrophilicity which also implied that it was more difficult to remove protein like substances accumulated on the membrane surfaces or deposited in the membrane pores by hydraulic backwash 3 3 4 characterization of fouled uf membranes ftir spectra of the new and contaminated uf membranes were performed to identify the retained organic pollutants on the membrane surface as shown in fig 8 a all fouled membranes contained a strong absorbance peak at around 3284 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of hydrogen bonds oh and a weak signal at 2936 cm 1 due to ch stretching vibrations namguk et al 2008 tian et al 2018 indicating that some hydrophilic organic pollutants contributed to membrane fouling a typical absorbance peak at around 1080 cm 1 was observed for the virgin uf membrane in fig 8 b which could be ascribable to the presence of aromatic ring vibrations in the pes membrane wang et al 2015 in addition a broad band at 1031 cm 1 was found for both new and contaminated uf membranes which was due to the coc and co bands gamage and shankararaman 2014 meanwhile the peak intensity at 1031 cm 1 of the contaminated membrane was much greater than that of the new membrane which meant that organic matters were significantly accumulated on the membrane surface the peak at 915 cm 1 corresponded to the si o band gamage and shankararaman 2014 which might be a precipitate of silicon due to rejection of inorganic particles by membrane guo et al 2018 although solar and heat activated pds pre oxidation had almost no big difference in the functional groups of irreversible membrane pollutants it could also be seen that organic matters contributed the irreversible membrane fouling 4 conclusions in this study the effects of solar activated pds oxidation and the respective role of heating and sunlight radiation on the uf membrane fouling control in treating the natural surface water were investigated the conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 in the process of solar activated pds pre oxidation solar light effect dominated the activation of pds at the temperature below 50 c and both solar light and heating effects contributed to the production of free radicals at the temperature of 50 c the heating effect conferred the dual function of accelerating the reaction speed 30 70 c and generating free radicals 50 70 c 2 solar activated pds pretreatment can alleviate the membrane fouling caused by organic foulants at 30 c and its performance improved significantly with the increase of temperature however the fouling control performance was comparable to heat activated pds pretreatment at 70 c due to the limited nom concentration in the feed 3 for the groups of raw water hp30 sp30 hp50 and sp50 intermediate blocking and cake layers dominated membrane fouling in the initial filtration and then transferred to cake layer fouling in the middle and late filtration stages for the groups of hp70 and sp70 the four models could not describe membrane fouling well in the first three filtration cycles due to few pollutants in the feed after pretreatments hp70 and sp70 and cake layers mostly contributed to the membrane fouling in the later filtration stages 4 the irreversible membrane fouling were mainly caused by protein like substances containing tryptophan t2 and aromatic protein t3 due to their stronger hydrophilicity rather than humic like matters besides terrestrially derived humic like matters c2 and protein like substances c3 in the feed water were the main causes of total membrane fouling and irreversible membrane fouling respectively moreover uv254 of feed water exhibited a greater impact on the hydraulic irreversible fouling than doc and can be used as the indicator of membrane fouling control strategies in treating the natural surface water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17411,ozonation is a well recognized process in advanced treatment of municipal secondary effluent for water reclamation however the transformation of dissolved effluent organic matter defom during ozonation of real effluents particularly at molecular level has been scarcely reported in this study we performed ozonation treatments on real secondary effluents from two municipal wastewater treatment plants and used fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms and various spectroscopic techniques to probe the transformation of defom at four ozone dosage levels 0 28 0 61 0 89 and 1 21 mg o3 mg doc most of the precursors were unsaturated and reduced compounds positive double bond equivalent minus oxygen per carbon dbe o c and negative nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc whereas the products were mainly the saturated and oxidized ones negative dbe o c and positive nosc as the ozone dosage increased the relative abundance of o8 19 species gradually increased in the ozonated samples whereas an opposite trend was observed for o5 7s1 species further we employed 18 types of reactions to represent the ozonation process and found that the oxygenation reaction 3o possessed the largest number of possible precursor product pairs and chon compounds possessed the highest reactivity besides the dominant oxygenation reactions decyclopropyl c3h4 was relatively common reaction for chon compounds while it was oxidative desulfonation sh2 for chos ones in addition the transformation of precursors to products accompanied with the drop of dbe o c and the increase of nosc and the o c ratio the precursors with aromaticity and fluorescence were mainly correlated with the compounds featuring higher dbe o c and lower nosc values this study is believed to help better understand and improve the application of ozonation process in advanced treatment of real wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords municipal secondary effluent

spectroscopic and chromatographic methods e g uv vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography are usually applied to characterize their overall structural variation chen et al 2017 jin et al 2016 although the changes of aromaticity fluorescence and molecular weight mw during ozonation could be qualitatively quantitatively reflected based on the above methods it still remains a challenge to understand the transformation of defom during ozonation at molecular level in the past years several studies investigated the transformation of nom these and reemtsma 2005 and dissolved organic matter dom phungsai et al 2018 2019 including defom phungsai et al 2016 during ozonation on the basis of high resolution mass spectrometry ms e g time of flight ms and orbitrap ms indicating that the highly unsaturated compounds in nom dom were preferentially decomposed during ozonation and the newly formed compounds usually featured with higher o c schollée et al 2018 employed liquid chromatography coupled with orbitrap ms and statistical analysis to reveal the linkages between potential parents and products during ozonation of micropollutants in wastewater however the

compared with the above ms techniques fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is a more powerful tool in analysis of complex dom at molecular level marshall and chen 2015 ohno et al 2010 the increasing interest has been gained to use ft icr ms to characterize the molecular composition of various environmental samples li et al 2018 maizel et al 2017 maizel and remucal 2017 zhou et al 2019 mostly focusing on deciphering the dom composition of natural water bodies bai et al 2017 kellerman et al 2018 wagner et al 2015 instead of industrial and municipal wastewater maizel and remucal 2017 zhang et al 2019b in a previous study it was reported that the number of molecular formulae identified by ft icr ms was about three times than those identified by orbitrap ms for the same sample hawkes et al 2016 therefore it can be anticipated that more abundant molecular information of dom in secondary effluents and ozonated effluents could be obtained using ft icr ms analysis furthermore ft icr ms combined with statistical analysis should be a promising tool to comprehensively investigate the transformation processes during ozonation of defom herein we collected secondary effluent samples from two municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps and carried out ozonation treatments at four ozone dosage levels the main objective of this study was to reveal the transformation of defom during ozonation based on ft icr ms analysis several spectroscopic tools were also used to characterize the changes of defom and to establish the relationships between the spectral properties and the molecular level parameters based on correlation analyses further identification of the number and elemental composition of possible precursor product pairs during ozonation was conducted based on the mass difference analysis between precursors and products to reveal the dominancy rank of common reactions of different compound categories in such a complex system we believe this study will provide new molecular insights into the transformation of defom during ozonation of the municipal secondary effluent 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and ozonation experiments wastewater samples were collected from two secondary clarifiers of jiangxinzhou and tiebei municipal wwtps respectively both of which are located in nanjing china on the basis of the same main scheme primary clarifier anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o secondary clarifier uv disinfection the samples were filtered through 0 45 μm mixed cellulose membranes jinteng china and stored in brown glass bottles at 4 c for experiments ozonation experiments were conducted in a 1 l glass cylindrical reactor supporting information si fig s1 equipped with a 10 μm micro pore plate of sand core to diffuse ozone into solution the reaction temperature was maintained at 25 1 c through circulating water ozone was generated from high purity oxygen gas by an ozone generator 3s t5 beijing tonglin technology co ltd china and injected into the reactor at a flow rate of 100 ml min the ozone aeration time was about 7 min and the ozone dosage was calculated by the input concentration minus the off gas concentration four specific ozone dosage levels 0 28 0 02 0 61 0 02 0 89 0 03 and 1 21 0 04 mg o3 mg doc were set in this study by adjusting the inlet gas ozone concentration after the ozone aeration the solution stood for 10 more minutes after which the ozone concentration in water was below detection limit 0 012 mg l the phs of secondary effluents were 7 40 for wwtp a and 7 56 for wwtp b and they were not controlled during ozonation as the ph variation was insignificant less than 0 2 2 2 water quality analysis the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was measured by toc lcsh shimadzu japan uv visible absorbance was recorded by a uv 2600 spectrophotometer shimadzu japan the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 was calculated by dividing the uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 by doc concentration fluorescence spectra were recorded using a three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan other analytical methods are described in text s1 as well as the detailed procedures as shown in table s1 the basic water quality parameters of both wwtps samples were similar 2 3 solid phase extraction and ft icr ms analysis 2 3 1 solid phase extraction the solid phase extraction spe cartridges agilent bond elut ppl 1 g 6 ml tandem merk lichrolut en 200 mg 3 ml were used to extract defom for all samples the ppl cartridge was widely used in analysis of environmental samples due to its relatively high doc recovery for nonpolar to polar compounds dittmar et al 2008 while the lichrolut en cartridge was used to recover the strongly polar compounds waska et al 2015 these two types of spe cartridges were used simultaneously to extract defom of different polarities as much as possible the spe processes were described in detail elsewhere dittmar et al 2008 zhang et al 2019b and the brief procedures are available in text s2 the blank sample of acidified ultrapure water ph 2 adjusted by hydrochloric acid went through the same spe procedures as the samples 2 3 2 ft icr ms analysis an ft icr ms bruker solarix equipped with a 15 0 t superconducting magnet and an electrospray ionization esi source was used to analyze the dom composition of each sample and the detailed procedures are available in text s2 a sodium formate solution 10 mm was used to externally calibrate the instrument and the known series nom was used to internally recalibrate the spectra using quadratic mode in bruker dataanalysis 4 0 molecular formula assignment was conducted by matlab the mathworks inc natick ma scripts kujawinski 2016 the calculation of molecular formula was based on the elemental combinations of 12c1 60 13c0 1 1h1 120 16o1 50 14n0 5 32s0 3 31p0 2 and only the peaks with signal to noise s n ratio 6 were employed for calculation the cl containing compounds were not considered due to their low levels less than 0 4 in our samples for a given chemical formula the difference between the calculated mass and the measured one was set to less than 1 ppm in addition the formulae in blank sample were subtracted and other molecular formula restrictions are detailed in text s3 2 3 3 limitations as the non extractable dom could not be analyzed by ft icr ms further efforts should be devoted to identify the composition of the un extractable dom components and to quantify the representativeness of spe extracted dom in wastewater besides the compounds with high mw e g 1000 da were rarely detected using esi ft icr ms possibly attributed to the difficulty of ionization for macromolecular compounds on esi source 2 4 statistical analysis parallel factor analysis parafac was applied to identify and quantify the main components of the fluorescence spectra based on the domfluor toolbox by matlab murphy et al 2013 stedmon and bro 2008 spearman rank correlation was employed to reflect the relationships between the relative intensity of molecular formulae and the ozone dosages and the total set of formulae determined in all samples were used to systematically evaluate the transformation trend of defom kellerman et al 2014 zito et al 2019 bray curtis dissimilarity analysis was visualized using the package vegan in r software zark and dittmar 2018 principle component analysis pca was conducted by matlab codes and the correlations between the spectral indexes and the molecular level parameters were performed with the r package performanceanalytics roth et al 2019 all the exact mws of the assigned formulae were calculated by the atomic mass of international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac of each element c h o n s and p with 9 decimal places and marked as mwscal the number of possible precursor product pairs and the corresponding precursors and products in these pairs were determined by matching the exact mass difference listed in table s6 between the mwscal of precursors and products the detailed descriptions of precursors products and resistants are available in text s4 the accurate statistical analysis processes were carried out in excel spreadsheet mainly with the functions of countif and pivottable all the results were obtained by comparing all the samples before and after ozonation 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall changes in defom during ozonation as shown in table 1 doc concentrations reduced slightly 8 9 for wwtp a and 9 1 for wwtp b even at the highest ozone dosage of 1 21 mg o3 mg doc implying the challenge of defom mineralization during ozonation knopp et al 2016 michael kordatou et al 2015 zimmermann et al 2011 suva254 as a surrogate measurement for aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 was decreased for both wwtp samples with the increasing ozone dosage table 1 suggesting the dom chromophores e g electron rich and light absorbing moieties usually with c c and c o double bonds could be gradually destroyed during ozonation li et al 2017 considering the circumneutral initial phs and the insignificant ph variation during ozonation both ozone and oh could act as oxidants in these reactions however the values of suva254 only decreased by 59 2 for wwtp a and 63 2 for wwtp b even at the highest ozone dosage fig s2 and similar suva254 reduction of 47 9 from 2 80 to 1 46 l mg c 1 m 1 was reported elsewhere phungsai et al 2016 in addition suva254 could be used to reflect the change of hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of dom matilainen et al 2011 phungsai et al 2016 and a drop of suva254 suggested the removal of hydrophobic compounds and or the production of hydrophilic compounds the doc recoveries by the combined spe procedure were listed in table s3 one can see that the extractable dom accounted for the most part 50 2 72 3 and the extraction efficiencies were higher than other similar studies phungsai et al 2016 2019 all the extraction efficiencies of the ozonated samples were lower than the control samples implying that some highly hydrophilic compounds produced during ozonation could not be extracted by the spe procedure in a recent study it further proved that hydrophobic fractions were gradually transformed into hydrophilic ones during ozonation of wastewater using xad 8 resin fractionation method jin et al 2016 similar result was reported for ozonation of drinking water phungsai et al 2019 the fluorescence peaks in eem data are composed of numerous and complex fluorescent molecules and parafac analysis is a useful tool to decipher the fluorescence data into the major fluorescence components yamashita et al 2008 based on the parafac analysis four fluorescence dom components were obtained referred to as microbial humic like catalá et al 2015 mangalgiri et al 2017 component 1 c1 ex em of 240 315 394 nm tryptophan like mangalgiri et al 2017 component 2 c2 ex em of 275 340 nm terrestrial humic like li et al 2014 component 3 c3 ex em of 265 360 430 nm and tryptophan like li et al 2014 queimaliños et al 2019 component 4 c4 ex em of 225 285 340 nm fluorophores figs 1 a d and s6 the microbial humic like component c1 was generally regarded as one of the molded components in wastewater murphy et al 2014 from the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax values in table 1 one can see that c1 accounted for the largest proportion among the four components for wwtp a while c4 occupied the largest proportion for wwtp b as shown in fig 1e h the fmax removal efficiencies of all the four components obviously increased as the ozone dosage increased with the highest one of 100 for c4 of wwtp a at ozone dosage of 0 61 mg o3 mg doc overall the degradation trends of c1 c4 were similar for both wwtps similar removal efficiencies of four fluorescence components 67 8 97 0 were observed during ozonation of secondary effluent chen et al 2017 in addition as shown in figs 1e h and s2 the removal of fmax was more pronounced than that of suva254 under the same conditions all the above results suggested that the fluorescent moieties were more readily attacked by ozone and or oh than the aromatic moieties which is consistent with the previous study reported by chen et al 2017 3 2 molecular transformation of defom during ozonation weighted average wa compositional values of h cwa and o cwa of the secondary effluents were around 1 26 and 0 46 respectively table 1 and the defom was rich in n and s heteroatoms which is similar to other secondary effluent sample 1 24 and 0 49 for h c and o c respectively maizel and remucal 2017 as shown in table 1 as the ozone dosage increased from 0 28 to 1 21 mg o3 mg doc o cwa increased by 6 4 17 4 the similar observation was reported in a previous study with o c increased by 5 5 and 5 4 for cho and chos compounds at ozone dosage of 4 5 g m3 during ozonation of municipal wastewater phungsai et al 2016 all of these results indicated that the increase of oxygen content of dom induced by ozonation whereas the variation in h cwa was negligible possibly attributed to the fact that the main reaction types of ozonation e g electrophilic substitution and hydroxylation gong et al 2008 michael kordatou et al 2015 tend to maintain the number of h atoms the observation of negligible change in h cwa during ozonation was consistent with that reported by phungsai et al 2016 double bond equivalent minus oxygen per carbon dbe o c and nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc were used to reflect the degree of unsaturation phungsai et al 2018 and redox state brooker et al 2018 respectively for a given compound the larger positive value of dbe o c implies the higher degree of unsaturation while the larger positive value of nosc represents the higher oxidized state and more descriptions about both parameters are available in text s5 the gradual increase of noscwa demonstrated the increase of oxidation state of defom occurred during ozonation table 1 on the contrary the gradual drop in dbe o cwa indicated that the saturated degree of defom increased after ozonation further we divided all the compounds into four classes unsaturated and oxidized compounds unsaturated and reduced compounds saturated and reduced compounds and saturated and oxidized compounds based on the positive and negative values of dbe o c phungsai et al 2018 2019 and nosc boye et al 2017 brooker et al 2018 to better reveal the transformation of defom during ozonation and the cutoffs of the four classes are listed in table s4 from the four classes one can see that most of the precursors 42 2 47 5 at all ozone dosages had positive dbe o c and negative nosc values figs 2 and s7 and table s5 indicating that the unsaturated and reduced compounds e g with double bonds and activated aromatic rings were preferentially decomposed during ozonation phungsai et al 2018 von gunten 2003 in addition as the ozone dosage increased the proportion of the saturated and reduced compounds in the precursors rose from 18 4 to 25 4 for wwtp a and from 19 3 to 26 3 for wwtp b table s5 it implied that defom of higher saturation turned to be decomposed gradually with the increasing ozone dosage similar result was reported on the ozonation treatment of drinking water phungsai et al 2019 for the products the saturated and oxidized compounds possessed the largest proportion 40 7 58 9 overall higher ozone dosage resulted in an increasing number of both the precursors and products from all the samples of wwtp a before and after ozonation a total of 9004 molecular formulae could be identified by ft icr ms spearman rank correlation analyses are visually presented in fig s8 with the black dotted lines as the demarcation between low and high oxygen compounds zito et al 2019 in general 2294 molecules 25 5 were significantly correlated p value 0 05 with the ozone dosage and the correlated plots were apparently divided by two groups fig s8a the first group red dots 977 molecules was negatively correlated with the ozone dosage most of which featuring the low oxygen compounds o c 0 5 those positively correlated with the ozone dosage were classified as the second group blue dots 1317 molecules which were mainly high oxygen compounds o c 0 5 similarly about 27 4 of molecules 2450 out of total 8929 molecules were significantly correlated with the ozone dosage of the samples for wwtp b including 1513 positively correlated molecules and 919 negatively correlated molecules fig s8b in brief the results of the correlation analysis indicated that the final defom composition transformed from low oxygen compounds to high oxygen ones as the ozone dosage increased to further explore the changes of o containing compounds during ozonation the distribution of o x species including all o containing formula classes is shown in fig s9 one can see that the number of the precursors and products was close to normal distribution and on the whole the number of oxygen atoms of the products was higher than that of the precursors in detail those of o6 7 in the precursors were the most abundant species whereas the o12 14 species were the most abundant ones in the products in a word ozonation of defom from the municipal secondary effluent was essentially an oxygenation process which has been extensively reported for model pollutants benner and ternes 2009a 2009b mawhinney et al 2012 tay et al 2010 nom these and reemtsma 2005 and drinking water phungsai et al 2018 during ozonation to further reflect the molecular transformation during ozonation the relative abundance plots were described on the basis of four classes of cho chon chos and others fig 3 a b it clearly showed that cho class possessed the largest proportion 48 2 69 6 followed by chos and chon classes and the proportion of others including chop chons chonp and chosp was extremely low in addition the relative abundance of cho class was gradually increased from 56 1 for the secondary effluent to 69 6 for the ozonated effluent at ozone dosage of 1 21 mg o3 mg doc for wwtp a whereas an opposite trend was observed for chos class both wwtps samples exhibited the similar proportion of different formula classes the zoomed negative ion mass spectra of three cho and chos compounds further displayed such similar trends figs s10 s11 possibly because of the gradual decomposition of chos compounds into cho ones with the increasing ozone dosage gonsior et al 2011 indicated that chos compounds in municipal wastewater could be mainly attributed to anionic surfactants that were used as domestic detergents and sulfonic groups of surfactants could be destroyed by oh through the breakage of c s bond during ozonation dai et al 2014 fonagy et al 2018 zsilak et al 2014 as illustrated in figs 3c d and s12 the relative abundance of o2 6 species gradually dropped down with the increasing ozone dosage whereas that for o8 19 species rose up such result further indicated that the oxygen addition reaction is an important process during ozonation for chos compounds the relative abundance of o5 7s1 species dropped down sharply with the increasing ozone dosage suggesting that they were decomposed more easily than others during ozonation 3 3 possible precursor product pairs of defom during ozonation the molecular composition of defom in municipal wastewater is very complex usually including thousands of molecules gonsior et al 2011 maizel and remucal 2017 tseng et al 2013 in the above section one can see that the number of the precursors and products was more than 1000 at all ozone dosages table s5 implying that numerous transformation reactions occurred during ozonation to explore the possible precursor product pairs in such a complex system the mass difference analysis was conducted based on 18 types of transformation reactions of ozonation table s6 and 16 types among them have been summarized by schollée et al 2018 it is worth noting that one precursor can be associated with at least one product and up to 11 products in this complex system during the statistical analysis based on 18 types of reactions on the contrary one product can be associated with at least one precursor and up to 13 precursors as shown in fig 4 the corresponding number of possible precursor product pairs based on the reaction of the addition of 3 oxygen atoms 3o was 85 165 202 and 291 at ozone dosage of 0 28 0 61 0 89 and 1 21 mg o3 mg doc for wwtp b respectively possessing the largest number of possible pairs it indicated that it was the most likely reaction that occurred during ozonation this reaction could proceed via direct reaction between ozone and the target pollutants as well as indirect reaction between oh and pollutants and it has been proved that methylparaben could be transformed into trihydroxy methyl paraben through triple hydroxylation reactions addition of 3o during ozonation tay et al 2010 in addition other reactions of high possibility mainly included addition of 2 oxygen atoms 2o hydration h2o hydroxylation or n s oxidation o and methyl to carboxylic acid or amine to nitro 2h 2o these reactions are commonly encountered during ozonation of given pollutants or wastewater for example the reaction of 2o could occur during ozonation of 1h benzotriazole mawhinney et al 2012 it has been reported that mono hydroxylation reactions widely proceed during ozonation of various wastewater pollutants including carbamazepine huebner et al 2014 paracetamol andreozzi et al 2003 bisphenol a deborde et al 2008 etc besides mono oxygenated compounds could also be formed by n oxides with tertiary amine group during ozonation merel et al 2017 in addition s containing compounds e g penicillin and cephalexin could be transformed into sulfoxide during ozonation dodd et al 2010 the above three reaction types can be summarized as the addition of one oxygen atom and schollée et al 2018 also recognized this reaction as one of the main reaction types in terms of micropollutants at ozone dosage of 0 5 g o3 g doc on the basis of orbitrap ms analysis in negative esi mode besides differences can be found in the dominancy ranks of the reaction types for example dehydrogenation 2h and alcohol to carboxylic acid or primary amine to nitro 2h o were identified as the dominant types by schollée et al 2018 which might be possibly induced by the different wastewater sources to further reflect the reaction trends of each category of compounds e g cho chon chos and chons in possible precursor product pairs four kinds of radar plots were conducted on the basis of the number of corresponding precursors figs s15 s16 for both wwtps overall they possessed the similar number and variation trend of possible precursor product pairs totally the number of these pairs including the 18 types of reactions accounted for 70 of the number of products besides the pairs number of the most of these reactions gradually increased with the increasing ozone dosage for all compounds as well as cho chon chos and chons compounds respectively figs 4 and s15 s16 further indicating the higher reaction efficiency occurred at higher ozone dosage phungsai et al 2019 from figs s15 s16 one can see that the reaction of 3o possessed the largest number of possible precursor product pairs among these four compound categories except chons compounds in wwtp b and the numbers of other oxygen addition reactions e g 2o h2o o and 2h 2o were also relatively large comparatively the most abundant precursor product pairs featured with the elemental composition of chon for these reactions followed by cho chos and chons compounds in fact the overall trend in relative abundance of these compounds in all samples was cho chos chon chons fig 3a b therefore it clearly indicated that chon compounds possessed the highest reactivity among all compound categories in terms of these 18 types of reactions during ozonation it has been reported that ozone reacts easily with amines especially for tertiary amines huebner et al 2015 merel et al 2017 which might partially explain the observed highest reactivity of chon compounds in addition decyclopropyl c3h4 was a relatively common reaction for chon compounds figs s15b and s16b during ozonation and most corresponding precursors contained more than two nitrogen atoms liu et al 2012 detected the decyclopropyl products resulting from the cleavage of piperazine ring suggesting that cyclopropyl groups linked to nitrogen atoms could be more easily destroyed during ozonation for chos compounds the number of oxidative desulfonation reactions sh2 was relatively large besides the oxygenation reactions figs s15c and s16c indicating that some chos compounds underwent desulfurization to cho compounds during ozonation this reaction has been proved to occur during catalytic ozonation of model pollutant of p toluenesulfonic acid dai et al 2014 however the desulfonation reaction so3 was not common in this reaction system more than 200 chos compounds disappeared after ozonation at the highest ozone dosage indicating that other oxidative desulfurization reaction should have occurred the reaction of oxidative deamination was shown to be dominant reaction for chons compounds especially for wwtp b fig s16d and ketone could be formed after deamination schollée et al 2018 besides the common oxygenation reactions the numbers of other reactions were not particularly prominent for cho compounds figs s15a and s16a in terms of compound categories the chon precursors were mainly polyphenols and highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds 0 3 o c 0 6 and their distribution was relatively concentrated figs s17 s18 compared with chon precursors cho chos and chons precursors were relatively scattered further kendrick mass defect kmd analysis was conducted to visually reflect the chemodiversity of possible precursor product pairs raeke et al 2017 spranger et al 2019 in theory the possible precursor product pairs in kmd plots with structural difference after one of the 18 types of reactions e g 3o 2o h2o and o have the same kmd values scattering in the same horizontal line figs s19 s22 in the kmd plots the red markers reflected the possible precursors mainly featuring positive dbe o c negative nosc and low o c values on the contrary the blue markers mainly corresponded to the possible products of negative dbe o c positive nosc and high o c values therefore the transformation process from precursors to products was essentially the one accompanying a drop in dbe o c as well as an increase in nosc and o c in the above four basic reactions which is consistent with the analysis results described in the above section table 1 and figs 2 and s7 s9 3 4 relationships between spectral indexes and molecular level parameters spearman rank correlation analyses were employed to further explore the relationships between the spectral indexes and the molecular level parameters and the correlation matrix is illustrated in fig s24 obviously all the parameters showed significant correlations except h cwa which is similar to the correlation analyses of different parameters of chemical industry park wastewater zhang et al 2019b in detail the six indexes including suva254 fmax of c1 c4 and dbe o cwa were positively correlated with each other and they presented negative correlation with o cwa and noscwa overall the spectral indexes of defom varied with the molecular level parameters during ozonation here we particularly focused on the relationships between spectral indexes and molecular level parameters of dbe o cwa and noscwa and the linear regression analyses were conducted by the variation of these parameters between the ozonated effluent samples and virgin ones as shown in fig 5 the decrement of suva254 was proportional to the decrement of dbe o cwa r 0 988 for wwtp a and r 0 992 for wwtp b both p values 0 05 at different ozone dosages while it was inversely proportional to the increment of noscwa r 0 951 for wwtp a and r 0 973 for wwtp b both p values 0 05 the results indicated that the removed aromatic compounds were mainly correlated with the molecules with higher dbe o c values and lower nosc values besides one can see that the removed fluorescent compounds had a similar correlation in fig s25 therefore we conjectured that fluorescent compounds also had a certain degree of aromaticity in the system however not all the aromatic compounds owned fluorescence activity which can be deduced from the different removal of aromatic compounds and fluorescent compounds figs 1e h and s2 cohen et al 2014 reported a similar correlation between suva254 and the fluorescent components in wastewater in general both dbe o c and nosc are the key molecular level parameters of defom during ozonation which can not only reflect the saturation degree and redox degree of defom but also have significant correlations with the spectral indexes 3 5 implications for municipal wastewater treatment ozonation plays an important role in water decontamination due to its clean and sludge free merit and has been increasingly applied in the advanced treatment of secondary effluents this study may provide a reference for prediction of the complex reaction processes based on molecular composition of different defom categories and statistical analysis and it may also be useful for selection of appropriate post treatment process based on the molecular composition of the ozonation products the result of statistical analysis indicated that chon compounds possessed the highest reactivity based on the 18 types of reactions and some ozonation products chon compounds still remained biological activity merel et al 2017 these active compounds may bring certain contribution to eutrophication and their environmental effects need to be focused in future study in addition the ozonation products could be the precursors of disinfection by products dbps phungsai et al 2016 2019 and the structures and toxicities of these precursors and corresponding dbps also need to be investigated with the help of ms ms analysis and effect direct analysis eda in future when ozone dosage was higher than 0 61 mg o3 mg doc the decrements or increments of spectral indexes e g suva254 and fmax and molecular level parameters e g o cwa dbe o cwa and noscwa were not prominent compared with lower ozone dosage suggesting that ozone dosage of 0 61 mg o3 mg doc might be the optimal dosage from the perspective of treatment effect and operational cost further it is better to determine the optimal ozone dosage by combining the degradation efficiencies of typical target pollutants with the overall biotoxicity 4 conclusions in general this study systemically unveiled the transformation of complex defom during ozonation of municipal secondary effluent based on ft icr ms and spectral analysis the fluorescent compounds with removal efficiencies of 45 6 100 were more readily decomposed than the aromatic ones with reduction of 35 5 63 2 the relative abundance of cho class was gradually increased with the increasing ozone dosage whereas an opposite trend was observed for chos class the unsaturated and reduced compounds were preferentially transformed to saturated and oxidized ones and low oxygen compounds were gradually oxidized to high oxygen ones further the results of mass difference analysis demonstrated the highest frequency of 3o reaction among the 18 types of reactions and the highest reactivity of the chon compounds 0 3 o c 0 6 among the different categories based on elemental composition with the exception of the dominant oxygenation reactions e g 3o 2o h2o o and 2h 2o decyclopropyl c3h4 was a relatively common reaction for chon compounds and it was oxidative desulfonation sh2 for chos ones while it was oxidative deamination nh3 o2 for chons ones overall these results provided molecular insights to better understand the complex reaction processes during ozonation of defom moreover significant correlations were established between the molecular level parameters e g nosc and dbe o c and spectral indexes e g suva254 and fmax supporting the use of these spectral indexes as simple surrogates to represent the chemical compositions of the target

17411,ozonation is a well recognized process in advanced treatment of municipal secondary effluent for water reclamation however the transformation of dissolved effluent organic matter defom during ozonation of real effluents particularly at molecular level has been scarcely reported in this study we performed ozonation treatments on real secondary effluents from two municipal wastewater treatment plants and used fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms and various spectroscopic techniques to probe the transformation of defom at four ozone dosage levels 0 28 0 61 0 89 and 1 21 mg o3 mg doc most of the precursors were unsaturated and reduced compounds positive double bond equivalent minus oxygen per carbon dbe o c and negative nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc whereas the products were mainly the saturated and oxidized ones negative dbe o c and positive nosc as the ozone dosage increased the relative abundance of o8 19 species gradually increased in the ozonated samples whereas an opposite trend was observed for o5 7s1 species further we employed 18 types of reactions to represent the ozonation process and found that the oxygenation reaction 3o possessed the largest number of possible precursor product pairs and chon compounds possessed the highest reactivity besides the dominant oxygenation reactions decyclopropyl c3h4 was relatively common reaction for chon compounds while it was oxidative desulfonation sh2 for chos ones in addition the transformation of precursors to products accompanied with the drop of dbe o c and the increase of nosc and the o c ratio the precursors with aromaticity and fluorescence were mainly correlated with the compounds featuring higher dbe o c and lower nosc values this study is believed to help better understand and improve the application of ozonation process in advanced treatment of real wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords municipal secondary effluent

estrogenic activity tang et al 2013 zhang et al 2019a to ecosystem and human health therefore advanced treatment of municipal wastewater is usually a requisite step to minimize the environmental risks before water reuse chen et al 2017 knopp et al 2016 michael kordatou et al 2015 in the past decades ozonation has been extensively utilized as an advanced treatment option for secondary effluent to

spectroscopic and chromatographic methods e g uv vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography are usually applied to characterize their overall structural variation chen et al 2017 jin et al 2016 although the changes of aromaticity fluorescence and molecular weight mw during ozonation could be qualitatively quantitatively reflected based on the above methods it still remains a challenge to understand the transformation of defom during ozonation at molecular level in the past years several studies investigated the transformation of nom these and reemtsma 2005 and dissolved organic matter dom phungsai et al 2018 2019 including defom phungsai et al 2016 during ozonation on the basis of high resolution mass spectrometry ms e g time of flight ms and orbitrap ms indicating that the highly unsaturated compounds in nom dom were preferentially decomposed during ozonation and the newly formed compounds usually featured with higher o c schollée et al 2018 employed liquid chromatography coupled with orbitrap ms and statistical analysis to reveal the linkages between potential parents and products during ozonation of micropollutants in wastewater however the

for different categories of compounds based on elemental composition e g cho chon chos and chons in a complicated dom system e g secondary effluent during ozonation are still not fully understood compared with the above ms techniques fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is a more powerful tool in analysis of complex dom at molecular level marshall and chen 2015 ohno et al 2010 the increasing interest has been gained to use ft icr ms to characterize the molecular composition of various environmental samples li et al 2018 maizel et al 2017 maizel and remucal 2017 zhou et al 2019 mostly focusing on deciphering the dom composition of natural water bodies bai et al 2017 kellerman et al 2018 wagner et al 2015 instead of industrial and municipal wastewater maizel and remucal 2017 zhang et al 2019b in a previous study it was reported that the number of molecular formulae identified by ft icr ms was about three times than those identified by orbitrap ms for the same sample hawkes et al 2016 therefore it can be anticipated that more abundant molecular information of dom in secondary effluents and ozonated effluents could be obtained using ft icr ms analysis furthermore ft icr ms combined with statistical analysis should be a promising tool to comprehensively investigate the transformation processes during ozonation of defom herein we collected secondary effluent samples from two municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps and carried out ozonation treatments at four ozone dosage levels the main objective of this study was to reveal the transformation of defom during ozonation based on ft icr ms analysis several spectroscopic tools were also used to characterize the changes of defom and to establish the relationships between the spectral properties and the molecular level parameters based on correlation analyses further identification of the number and elemental composition of possible precursor product pairs during ozonation was conducted based on the mass difference analysis between precursors and products to reveal the dominancy rank of common reactions of different compound categories in such a complex system we believe this study will provide new molecular insights into the transformation of defom during ozonation of the municipal secondary effluent 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and ozonation experiments wastewater samples were collected from two secondary clarifiers of jiangxinzhou and tiebei municipal wwtps respectively both of which are located in nanjing china on the basis of the same main scheme primary clarifier anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o secondary clarifier uv disinfection the samples were filtered through 0 45 μm mixed cellulose membranes jinteng china and stored in brown glass bottles at 4 c for experiments ozonation experiments were conducted in a 1 l glass cylindrical reactor supporting information si fig s1 equipped with a 10 μm micro pore plate of sand core to diffuse ozone into solution the reaction temperature was maintained at 25 1 c through circulating water ozone was generated from high purity oxygen gas by an ozone generator 3s t5 beijing tonglin technology co ltd china and injected into the reactor at a flow rate of 100 ml min the ozone aeration time was about 7 min and the ozone dosage was calculated by the input concentration minus the off gas concentration four specific ozone dosage levels 0 28 0 02 0 61 0 02 0 89 0 03 and 1 21 0 04 mg o3 mg doc were set in this study by adjusting the inlet gas ozone concentration after the ozone aeration the solution stood for 10 more minutes after which the ozone concentration in water was below detection limit 0 012 mg l the phs of secondary effluents were 7 40 for wwtp a and 7 56 for wwtp b and they were not controlled during ozonation as the ph variation was insignificant less than 0 2 2 2 water quality analysis the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was measured by toc lcsh shimadzu japan uv visible absorbance was recorded by a uv 2600 spectrophotometer shimadzu japan the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 was calculated by dividing the uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 by doc concentration fluorescence spectra were recorded using a three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan other analytical methods are described in text s1 as well as the detailed procedures as shown in table s1 the basic water quality parameters of both wwtps samples were similar 2 3 solid phase extraction and ft icr ms analysis 2 3 1 solid phase extraction the solid phase extraction spe cartridges agilent bond elut ppl 1 g 6 ml tandem merk lichrolut en 200 mg 3 ml were used to extract defom for all samples the ppl cartridge was widely used in analysis of environmental samples due to its relatively high doc recovery for nonpolar to polar compounds dittmar et al 2008 while the lichrolut en cartridge was used to recover the strongly polar compounds waska et al 2015 these two types of spe cartridges were used simultaneously to extract defom of different polarities as much as possible the spe processes were described in detail elsewhere dittmar et al 2008 zhang et al 2019b and the brief procedures are available in text s2 the blank sample of acidified ultrapure water ph 2 adjusted by hydrochloric acid went through the same spe procedures as the samples 2 3 2 ft icr ms analysis an ft icr ms bruker solarix equipped with a 15 0 t superconducting magnet and an electrospray ionization esi source was used to analyze the dom composition of each sample and the detailed procedures are available in text s2 a sodium formate solution 10 mm was used to externally calibrate the instrument and the known series nom was used to internally recalibrate the spectra using quadratic mode in bruker dataanalysis 4 0 molecular formula assignment was conducted by matlab the mathworks inc natick ma scripts kujawinski 2016 the calculation of molecular formula was based on the elemental combinations of 12c1 60 13c0 1 1h1 120 16o1 50 14n0 5 32s0 3 31p0 2 and only the peaks with signal to noise s n ratio 6 were employed for calculation the cl containing compounds were not considered due to their low levels less than 0 4 in our samples for a given chemical formula the difference between the calculated mass and the measured one was set to less than 1 ppm in addition the formulae in blank sample were subtracted and other molecular formula restrictions are detailed in text s3 2 3 3 limitations as the non extractable dom could not be analyzed by ft icr ms further efforts should be devoted to identify the composition of the un extractable dom components and to quantify the representativeness of spe extracted dom in wastewater besides the compounds with high mw e g 1000 da were rarely detected using esi ft icr ms possibly attributed to the difficulty of ionization for macromolecular compounds on esi source 2 4 statistical analysis parallel factor analysis parafac was applied to identify and quantify the main components of the fluorescence spectra based on the domfluor toolbox by matlab murphy et al 2013 stedmon and bro 2008 spearman rank correlation was employed to reflect the relationships between the relative intensity of molecular formulae and the ozone dosages and the total set of formulae determined in all samples were used to systematically evaluate the transformation trend of defom kellerman et al 2014 zito et al 2019 bray curtis dissimilarity analysis was visualized using the package vegan in r software zark and dittmar 2018 principle component analysis pca was conducted by matlab codes and the correlations between the spectral indexes and the molecular level parameters were performed with the r package performanceanalytics roth et al 2019 all the exact mws of the assigned formulae were calculated by the atomic mass of international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac of each element c h o n s and p with 9 decimal places and marked as mwscal the number of possible precursor product pairs and the corresponding precursors and products in these pairs were determined by matching the exact mass difference listed in table s6 between the mwscal of precursors and products the detailed descriptions of precursors products and resistants are available in text s4 the accurate statistical analysis processes were carried out in excel spreadsheet mainly with the functions of countif and pivottable all the results were obtained by comparing all the samples before and after ozonation 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall changes in defom during ozonation as shown in table 1 doc concentrations reduced slightly 8 9 for wwtp a and 9 1 for wwtp b even at the highest ozone dosage of 1 21 mg o3 mg doc implying the challenge of defom mineralization during ozonation knopp et al 2016 michael kordatou et al 2015 zimmermann et al 2011 suva254 as a surrogate measurement for aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 was decreased for both wwtp samples with the increasing ozone dosage table 1 suggesting the dom chromophores e g electron rich and light absorbing moieties usually with c c and c o double bonds could be gradually destroyed during ozonation li et al 2017 considering the circumneutral initial phs and the insignificant ph variation during ozonation both ozone and oh could act as oxidants in these reactions however the values of suva254 only decreased by 59 2 for wwtp a and 63 2 for wwtp b even at the highest ozone dosage fig s2 and similar suva254 reduction of 47 9 from 2 80 to 1 46 l mg c 1 m 1 was reported elsewhere phungsai et al 2016 in addition suva254 could be used to reflect the change of hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of dom matilainen et al 2011 phungsai et al 2016 and a drop of suva254 suggested the removal of hydrophobic compounds and or the production of hydrophilic compounds the doc recoveries by the combined spe procedure were listed in table s3 one can see that the extractable dom accounted for the most part 50 2 72 3 and the extraction efficiencies were higher than other similar studies phungsai et al 2016 2019 all the extraction efficiencies of the ozonated samples were lower than the control samples implying that some highly hydrophilic compounds produced during ozonation could not be extracted by the spe procedure in a recent study it further proved that hydrophobic fractions were gradually transformed into hydrophilic ones during ozonation of wastewater using xad 8 resin fractionation method jin et al 2016 similar result was reported for ozonation of drinking water phungsai et al 2019 the fluorescence peaks in eem data are composed of numerous and complex fluorescent molecules and parafac analysis is a useful tool to decipher the fluorescence data into the major fluorescence components yamashita et al 2008 based on the parafac analysis four fluorescence dom components were obtained referred to as microbial humic like catalá et al 2015 mangalgiri et al 2017 component 1 c1 ex em of 240 315 394 nm tryptophan like mangalgiri et al 2017 component 2 c2 ex em of 275 340 nm terrestrial humic like li et al 2014 component 3 c3 ex em of 265 360 430 nm and tryptophan like li et al 2014 queimaliños et al 2019 component 4 c4 ex em of 225 285 340 nm fluorophores figs 1 a d and s6 the microbial humic like component c1 was generally regarded as one of the molded components in wastewater murphy et al 2014 from the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax values in table 1 one can see that c1 accounted for the largest proportion among the four components for wwtp a while c4 occupied the largest proportion for wwtp b as shown in fig 1e h the fmax removal efficiencies of all the four components obviously increased as the ozone dosage increased with the highest one of 100 for c4 of wwtp a at ozone dosage of 0 61 mg o3 mg doc overall the degradation trends of c1 c4 were similar for both wwtps similar removal efficiencies of four fluorescence components 67 8 97 0 were observed during ozonation of secondary effluent chen et al 2017 in addition as shown in figs 1e h and s2 the removal of fmax was more pronounced than that of suva254 under the same conditions all the above results suggested that the fluorescent moieties were more readily attacked by ozone and or oh than the aromatic moieties which is consistent with the previous study reported by chen et al 2017 3 2 molecular transformation of defom during ozonation weighted average wa compositional values of h cwa and o cwa of the secondary effluents were around 1 26 and 0 46 respectively table 1 and the defom was rich in n and s heteroatoms which is similar to other secondary effluent sample 1 24 and 0 49 for h c and o c respectively maizel and remucal 2017 as shown in table 1 as the ozone dosage increased from 0 28 to 1 21 mg o3 mg doc o cwa increased by 6 4 17 4 the similar observation was reported in a previous study with o c increased by 5 5 and 5 4 for cho and chos compounds at ozone dosage of 4 5 g m3 during ozonation of municipal wastewater phungsai et al 2016 all of these results indicated that the increase of oxygen content of dom induced by ozonation whereas the variation in h cwa was negligible possibly attributed to the fact that the main reaction types of ozonation e g electrophilic substitution and hydroxylation gong et al 2008 michael kordatou et al 2015 tend to maintain the number of h atoms the observation of negligible change in h cwa during ozonation was consistent with that reported by phungsai et al 2016 double bond equivalent minus oxygen per carbon dbe o c and nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc were used to reflect the degree of unsaturation phungsai et al 2018 and redox state brooker et al 2018 respectively for a given compound the larger positive value of dbe o c implies the higher degree of unsaturation while the larger positive value of nosc represents the higher oxidized state and more descriptions about both parameters are available in text s5 the gradual increase of noscwa demonstrated the increase of oxidation state of defom occurred during ozonation table 1 on the contrary the gradual drop in dbe o cwa indicated that the saturated degree of defom increased after ozonation further we divided all the compounds into four classes unsaturated and oxidized compounds unsaturated and reduced compounds saturated and reduced compounds and saturated and oxidized compounds based on the positive and negative values of dbe o c phungsai et al 2018 2019 and nosc boye et al 2017 brooker et al 2018 to better reveal the transformation of defom during ozonation and the cutoffs of the four classes are listed in table s4 from the four classes one can see that most of the precursors 42 2 47 5 at all ozone dosages had positive dbe o c and negative nosc values figs 2 and s7 and table s5 indicating that the unsaturated and reduced compounds e g with double bonds and activated aromatic rings were preferentially decomposed during ozonation phungsai et al 2018 von gunten 2003 in addition as the ozone dosage increased the proportion of the saturated and reduced compounds in the precursors rose from 18 4 to 25 4 for wwtp a and from 19 3 to 26 3 for wwtp b table s5 it implied that defom of higher saturation turned to be decomposed gradually with the increasing ozone dosage similar result was reported on the ozonation treatment of drinking water phungsai et al 2019 for the products the saturated and oxidized compounds possessed the largest proportion 40 7 58 9 overall higher ozone dosage resulted in an increasing number of both the precursors and products from all the samples of wwtp a before and after ozonation a total of 9004 molecular formulae could be identified by ft icr ms spearman rank correlation analyses are visually presented in fig s8 with the black dotted lines as the demarcation between low and high oxygen compounds zito et al 2019 in general 2294 molecules 25 5 were significantly correlated p value 0 05 with the ozone dosage and the correlated plots were apparently divided by two groups fig s8a the first group red dots 977 molecules was negatively correlated with the ozone dosage most of which featuring the low oxygen compounds o c 0 5 those positively correlated with the ozone dosage were classified as the second group blue dots 1317 molecules which were mainly high oxygen compounds o c 0 5 similarly about 27 4 of molecules 2450 out of total 8929 molecules were significantly correlated with the ozone dosage of the samples for wwtp b including 1513 positively correlated molecules and 919 negatively correlated molecules fig s8b in brief the results of the correlation analysis indicated that the final defom composition transformed from low oxygen compounds to high oxygen ones as the ozone dosage increased to further explore the changes of o containing compounds during ozonation the distribution of o x species including all o containing formula classes is shown in fig s9 one can see that the number of the precursors and products was close to normal distribution and on the whole the number of oxygen atoms of the products was higher than that of the precursors in detail those of o6 7 in the precursors were the most abundant species whereas the o12 14 species were the most abundant ones in the products in a word ozonation of defom from the municipal secondary effluent was essentially an oxygenation process which has been extensively reported for model pollutants benner and ternes 2009a 2009b mawhinney et al 2012 tay et al 2010 nom these and reemtsma 2005 and drinking water phungsai et al 2018 during ozonation to further reflect the molecular transformation during ozonation the relative abundance plots were described on the basis of four classes of cho chon chos and others fig 3 a b it clearly showed that cho class possessed the largest proportion 48 2 69 6 followed by chos and chon classes and the proportion of others including chop chons chonp and chosp was extremely low in addition the relative abundance of cho class was gradually increased from 56 1 for the secondary effluent to 69 6 for the ozonated effluent at ozone dosage of 1 21 mg o3 mg doc for wwtp a whereas an opposite trend was observed for chos class both wwtps samples exhibited the similar proportion of different formula classes the zoomed negative ion mass spectra of three cho and chos compounds further displayed such similar trends figs s10 s11 possibly because of the gradual decomposition of chos compounds into cho ones with the increasing ozone dosage gonsior et al 2011 indicated that chos compounds in municipal wastewater could be mainly attributed to anionic surfactants that were used as domestic detergents and sulfonic groups of surfactants could be destroyed by oh through the breakage of c s bond during ozonation dai et al 2014 fonagy et al 2018 zsilak et al 2014 as illustrated in figs 3c d and s12 the relative abundance of o2 6 species gradually dropped down with the increasing ozone dosage whereas that for o8 19 species rose up such result further indicated that the oxygen addition reaction is an important process during ozonation for chos compounds the relative abundance of o5 7s1 species dropped down sharply with the increasing ozone dosage suggesting that they were decomposed more easily than others during ozonation 3 3 possible precursor product pairs of defom during ozonation the molecular composition of defom in municipal wastewater is very complex usually including thousands of molecules gonsior et al 2011 maizel and remucal 2017 tseng et al 2013 in the above section one can see that the number of the precursors and products was more than 1000 at all ozone dosages table s5 implying that numerous transformation reactions occurred during ozonation to explore the possible precursor product pairs in such a complex system the mass difference analysis was conducted based on 18 types of transformation reactions of ozonation table s6 and 16 types among them have been summarized by schollée et al 2018 it is worth noting that one precursor can be associated with at least one product and up to 11 products in this complex system during the statistical analysis based on 18 types of reactions on the contrary one product can be associated with at least one precursor and up to 13 precursors as shown in fig 4 the corresponding number of possible precursor product pairs based on the reaction of the addition of 3 oxygen atoms 3o was 85 165 202 and 291 at ozone dosage of 0 28 0 61 0 89 and 1 21 mg o3 mg doc for wwtp b respectively possessing the largest number of possible pairs it indicated that it was the most likely reaction that occurred during ozonation this reaction could proceed via direct reaction between ozone and the target pollutants as well as indirect reaction between oh and pollutants and it has been proved that methylparaben could be transformed into trihydroxy methyl paraben through triple hydroxylation reactions addition of 3o during ozonation tay et al 2010 in addition other reactions of high possibility mainly included addition of 2 oxygen atoms 2o hydration h2o hydroxylation or n s oxidation o and methyl to carboxylic acid or amine to nitro 2h 2o these reactions are commonly encountered during ozonation of given pollutants or wastewater for example the reaction of 2o could occur during ozonation of 1h benzotriazole mawhinney et al 2012 it has been reported that mono hydroxylation reactions widely proceed during ozonation of various wastewater pollutants including carbamazepine huebner et al 2014 paracetamol andreozzi et al 2003 bisphenol a deborde et al 2008 etc besides mono oxygenated compounds could also be formed by n oxides with tertiary amine group during ozonation merel et al 2017 in addition s containing compounds e g penicillin and cephalexin could be transformed into sulfoxide during ozonation dodd et al 2010 the above three reaction types can be summarized as the addition of one oxygen atom and schollée et al 2018 also recognized this reaction as one of the main reaction types in terms of micropollutants at ozone dosage of 0 5 g o3 g doc on the basis of orbitrap ms analysis in negative esi mode besides differences can be found in the dominancy ranks of the reaction types for example dehydrogenation 2h and alcohol to carboxylic acid or primary amine to nitro 2h o were identified as the dominant types by schollée et al 2018 which might be possibly induced by the different wastewater sources to further reflect the reaction trends of each category of compounds e g cho chon chos and chons in possible precursor product pairs four kinds of radar plots were conducted on the basis of the number of corresponding precursors figs s15 s16 for both wwtps overall they possessed the similar number and variation trend of possible precursor product pairs totally the number of these pairs including the 18 types of reactions accounted for 70 of the number of products besides the pairs number of the most of these reactions gradually increased with the increasing ozone dosage for all compounds as well as cho chon chos and chons compounds respectively figs 4 and s15 s16 further indicating the higher reaction efficiency occurred at higher ozone dosage phungsai et al 2019 from figs s15 s16 one can see that the reaction of 3o possessed the largest number of possible precursor product pairs among these four compound categories except chons compounds in wwtp b and the numbers of other oxygen addition reactions e g 2o h2o o and 2h 2o were also relatively large comparatively the most abundant precursor product pairs featured with the elemental composition of chon for these reactions followed by cho chos and chons compounds in fact the overall trend in relative abundance of these compounds in all samples was cho chos chon chons fig 3a b therefore it clearly indicated that chon compounds possessed the highest reactivity among all compound categories in terms of these 18 types of reactions during ozonation it has been reported that ozone reacts easily with amines especially for tertiary amines huebner et al 2015 merel et al 2017 which might partially explain the observed highest reactivity of chon compounds in addition decyclopropyl c3h4 was a relatively common reaction for chon compounds figs s15b and s16b during ozonation and most corresponding precursors contained more than two nitrogen atoms liu et al 2012 detected the decyclopropyl products resulting from the cleavage of piperazine ring suggesting that cyclopropyl groups linked to nitrogen atoms could be more easily destroyed during ozonation for chos compounds the number of oxidative desulfonation reactions sh2 was relatively large besides the oxygenation reactions figs s15c and s16c indicating that some chos compounds underwent desulfurization to cho compounds during ozonation this reaction has been proved to occur during catalytic ozonation of model pollutant of p toluenesulfonic acid dai et al 2014 however the desulfonation reaction so3 was not common in this reaction system more than 200 chos compounds disappeared after ozonation at the highest ozone dosage indicating that other oxidative desulfurization reaction should have occurred the reaction of oxidative deamination was shown to be dominant reaction for chons compounds especially for wwtp b fig s16d and ketone could be formed after deamination schollée et al 2018 besides the common oxygenation reactions the numbers of other reactions were not particularly prominent for cho compounds figs s15a and s16a in terms of compound categories the chon precursors were mainly polyphenols and highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds 0 3 o c 0 6 and their distribution was relatively concentrated figs s17 s18 compared with chon precursors cho chos and chons precursors were relatively scattered further kendrick mass defect kmd analysis was conducted to visually reflect the chemodiversity of possible precursor product pairs raeke et al 2017 spranger et al 2019 in theory the possible precursor product pairs in kmd plots with structural difference after one of the 18 types of reactions e g 3o 2o h2o and o have the same kmd values scattering in the same horizontal line figs s19 s22 in the kmd plots the red markers reflected the possible precursors mainly featuring positive dbe o c negative nosc and low o c values on the contrary the blue markers mainly corresponded to the possible products of negative dbe o c positive nosc and high o c values therefore the transformation process from precursors to products was essentially the one accompanying a drop in dbe o c as well as an increase in nosc and o c in the above four basic reactions which is consistent with the analysis results described in the above section table 1 and figs 2 and s7 s9 3 4 relationships between spectral indexes and molecular level parameters spearman rank correlation analyses were employed to further explore the relationships between the spectral indexes and the molecular level parameters and the correlation matrix is illustrated in fig s24 obviously all the parameters showed significant correlations except h cwa which is similar to the correlation analyses of different parameters of chemical industry park wastewater zhang et al 2019b in detail the six indexes including suva254 fmax of c1 c4 and dbe o cwa were positively correlated with each other and they presented negative correlation with o cwa and noscwa overall the spectral indexes of defom varied with the molecular level parameters during ozonation here we particularly focused on the relationships between spectral indexes and molecular level parameters of dbe o cwa and noscwa and the linear regression analyses were conducted by the variation of these parameters between the ozonated effluent samples and virgin ones as shown in fig 5 the decrement of suva254 was proportional to the decrement of dbe o cwa r 0 988 for wwtp a and r 0 992 for wwtp b both p values 0 05 at different ozone dosages while it was inversely proportional to the increment of noscwa r 0 951 for wwtp a and r 0 973 for wwtp b both p values 0 05 the results indicated that the removed aromatic compounds were mainly correlated with the molecules with higher dbe o c values and lower nosc values besides one can see that the removed fluorescent compounds had a similar correlation in fig s25 therefore we conjectured that fluorescent compounds also had a certain degree of aromaticity in the system however not all the aromatic compounds owned fluorescence activity which can be deduced from the different removal of aromatic compounds and fluorescent compounds figs 1e h and s2 cohen et al 2014 reported a similar correlation between suva254 and the fluorescent components in wastewater in general both dbe o c and nosc are the key molecular level parameters of defom during ozonation which can not only reflect the saturation degree and redox degree of defom but also have significant correlations with the spectral indexes 3 5 implications for municipal wastewater treatment ozonation plays an important role in water decontamination due to its clean and sludge free merit and has been increasingly applied in the advanced treatment of secondary effluents this study may provide a reference for prediction of the complex reaction processes based on molecular composition of different defom categories and statistical analysis and it may also be useful for selection of appropriate post treatment process based on the molecular composition of the ozonation products the result of statistical analysis indicated that chon compounds possessed the highest reactivity based on the 18 types of reactions and some ozonation products chon compounds still remained biological activity merel et al 2017 these active compounds may bring certain contribution to eutrophication and their environmental effects need to be focused in future study in addition the ozonation products could be the precursors of disinfection by products dbps phungsai et al 2016 2019 and the structures and toxicities of these precursors and corresponding dbps also need to be investigated with the help of ms ms analysis and effect direct analysis eda in future when ozone dosage was higher than 0 61 mg o3 mg doc the decrements or increments of spectral indexes e g suva254 and fmax and molecular level parameters e g o cwa dbe o cwa and noscwa were not prominent compared with lower ozone dosage suggesting that ozone dosage of 0 61 mg o3 mg doc might be the optimal dosage from the perspective of treatment effect and operational cost further it is better to determine the optimal ozone dosage by combining the degradation efficiencies of typical target pollutants with the overall biotoxicity 4 conclusions in general this study systemically unveiled the transformation of complex defom during ozonation of municipal secondary effluent based on ft icr ms and spectral analysis the fluorescent compounds with removal efficiencies of 45 6 100 were more readily decomposed than the aromatic ones with reduction of 35 5 63 2 the relative abundance of cho class was gradually increased with the increasing ozone dosage whereas an opposite trend was observed for chos class the unsaturated and reduced compounds were preferentially transformed to saturated and oxidized ones and low oxygen compounds were gradually oxidized to high oxygen ones further the results of mass difference analysis demonstrated the highest frequency of 3o reaction among the 18 types of reactions and the highest reactivity of the chon compounds 0 3 o c 0 6 among the different categories based on elemental composition with the exception of the dominant oxygenation reactions e g 3o 2o h2o o and 2h 2o decyclopropyl c3h4 was a relatively common reaction for chon compounds and it was oxidative desulfonation sh2 for chos ones while it was oxidative deamination nh3 o2 for chons ones overall these results provided molecular insights to better understand the complex reaction processes during ozonation of defom moreover significant correlations were established between the molecular level parameters e g nosc and dbe o c and spectral indexes e g suva254 and fmax supporting the use of these spectral indexes as simple surrogates to represent the chemical compositions of the target

17412,the effect of sodium silicate addition on lead release from lead service lines lsls was investigated using laboratory based pipe loop experiments with lsls harvested from a water utility that has one of the great lakes as its source water the lsls were first conditioned with a synthetic water similar to that of buffalo water that matched the major water chemistry that the pipes had experienced in the field the one exception was the absence of dissolved organic carbon in the synthetic water after conditioning the lsls were used in tests with the same synthetic water and with sodium silicate added to the water for half of the lsls in one test sodium silicate addition was performed with adjustment of the ph to maintain it at the same value ph 7 7 as before addition in this test sodium silicate effectively reduced the dissolved and particulate lead concentrations in the water within six weeks of treatment periodic assessments of the corrosion scales in the pipes found that sodium silicate accumulated throughout the scale thickness and gradually decreased the lead release in the other test the ph was allowed to increase from 7 7 to 8 8 upon addition of 20 mg l as sio2 sodium silicates and parallel control experiments were performed with the same ph increase made using sodium hydroxide addition in these tests the lead concentrations decreased in both the silicate treated and control pipes and the decreases were not significantly different between the silicate treated and control pipes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sodium

create an additional 10 µg l trigger level that would necessitate specific steps if exceeded at individual residences usepa 2019 with millions of lsls still in use for water supply in the united

lead corrosion control and our understanding of its mechanisms of control have been limited sodium silicate dissociates in water to form dissolved silica comprising orthosilicic acid h4sio4 with its conjugate bases and both soluble and colloidal polysilicates bass and turner 1997 dietzel and usdowski 1995 glasser and lachowski 1980b iler 1979 stumm et al 1967 discussed in detail in section s1 and fig s1 sodium silicate is alkaline in nature and its addition increases the ph of water sodium silicate with a sio2 na2o weight ratio of 3 22 is recommended for use in water above ph 6 stericker 1938 there has been research on sodium silicate for control of corrosion of metals other than lead for nearly 100 years naturally present silica in water was suggested to react with ferric hydrate and form corrosion inhibiting films in iron pipes speller 1925 the mechanism of sodium silicate inhibition of yellow brass corrosion was hypothesized to involve an interaction of negative silicate ions or micelles with positive metal ions stericker 1945 several studies described the passivating film formed on yellow brass to consist of a lower layer consisting of initial corrosion products and an upper layer of colloidal metal hydroxides enmeshed in silica gel glasser and lachowski 1980a lehrman and shuldener 1951 1952 shuldener and lehrman 1957 shuldener and sussman 1960 in work by rushing et al 2003 dissolved silica was shown to decrease the rate of oxidation of iron from fe ii to fe iii and increase the particulate iron released to water with a decrease in size of suspended particles in well mixed batch reactors in another study a silicate inhibitor reduced the copper release from copper coupon surfaces at low concentration of silica the mechanism was hypothesized to be the formation of copper silicate macnevin 2007 application of sodium silicate for reducing lead release from lead based salts can be dated back to the 1920s thresh 1922 lytle et al 1996 reported that sodium silicate at 15 to 30 mg l as sio2 can reduce lead concentrations in water from lead based premise plumbing materials and schock et al 2005 found that it decreased lead release from lsls in a study by hosseinibalajadeh 2018 addition of a silicate chemical decreased lead release because of an associated increase in ph from 7 7 to 9 0 in all these studies the ph of the water increased as a result of inhibitor addition and the specific effect of increased silica concentration could not be fully distinguished from the effect of the ph increase decrease in lead release from lead coupons was seen in waters receiving sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide where both treatments resulted in high ph water pinto et al 1997 similarly both sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide decreased lead concentrations in water in lsls aghasadeghi et al 2019 woszczynski et al 2015 observed no difference in two scenarios of sodium silicate s effect on lead release one was a system receiving sodium silicate as is and the other was a system that received sodium silicate with the ph of the water then being further increased after the addition of sodium silicate very few studies have examined sodium silicate addition while maintaining a constant ph thompson et al 1997 lowering the ph after sodium silicate was not deemed favorable in a study by macquarrie et al 1997 for reducing lead in water stagnating in premise plumbing materials there has been a knowledge gap in understanding if sodium silicate has an independent effect on lead release to water from lsls or if the effect is just that of an increase in ph this study aimed to determine the effectiveness of sodium silicate addition in reducing lead release from lsls to drinking water both with and without concurrent changes in ph this was pursued in two separate studies one in which sodium silicate treated and control pipes were maintained at the original ph of the water ph 7 7 and another with sodium silicate and control loops both having their ph increased to 8 8 the mechanism of the corrosion inhibition was explored by examining changes in concentrations of metals species following sodium silicate addition and by characterizing the structure and composition of the pipe scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup for loops experiments with lead pipes at ph 7 7 and 8 8 2 1 1 design of the loop system nine harvested lead pipes were provided by buffalo water for the experiments six harvested lsls were used directly for the first experiment the other three lsls were long enough to yield six pipe assemblies for the second experiment each pipe loop had a high density polyethene hdpe reservoir 10 l magnetic drive pump flowmeter and lead pipe assembly each pipe assembly had one 15 inch segment and three 4 inch segments assembled from segments cut from the same harvested pipes the edges of each segment were covered with epoxy to prevent bare lead exposure to water the segments were held together with rubber gaskets pvc pipes plastic tubing and valves were used to complete each loop figs s2 and s3 each day the water in a pipe loop recirculated for 16 hours at a flow rate of 4 5 l min and remained stagnant for 8 hours to simulate an overnight stagnation condition the entire volume 10 l of water recirculates many times through the pipe at 4 5 l min allowing for the dissolved lead concentrations to increase and equilibrate in one week at the same concentrations in the reservoir and pipe before the water is analyzed at this flow rate one week of the experiment represents about 3000 hydraulic residence times of the reservoir i e the reservoir has been turned over about 3000 times through recirculation through the pipe assembly the reservoirs were exchanged at the end of each week with reservoirs containing freshly prepared lead free water 2 1 2 preparation of water chemistry the experiment used synthetic water with an overall composition similar to that which the pipes were exposed to when in use the synthetic buffalo water sb water matched the typical dic alkalinity hardness ph free chlorine and blended phosphate of the original water buffalo water 2018 table 1 using chemicals indicated in the supplementary material section s2 the sb water lacked organic carbon and therefore the experiments did not show the effects of organic matter on lead release both during conditioning and treatment three pipe loops in the first experiment loops n1 a n1 b and n1 c were treated with sodium silicate n pq corporation and their ph was readjusted to 7 7 with h2so4 the other three loops served as controls loops c1 a c1 b and c1 c that did not receive sodium silicate in the second experiment three pipe loops loops n2 a n2 b and n2 c were treated with sodium silicate without ph readjustment which resulted in an increase to ph 8 8 when receiving 20 mg l as sio2 sodium silicate fig s4 and three control pipe loops loops c2 a c2 b and c2 c were treated with sodium hydroxide to match the ph of 8 8 in the test loops the sodium silicate added to the freshly prepared water remains entirely in the dissolved state in the reservoirs as shown in fig s1 2 1 3 stages of the experiment the two major phases of the experiments were conditioning and treatment table 2 during conditioning sb water was recirculated in the pipe loops until the lead concentration in the water flowing through each of them had a week to week variability of less than 25 over a 5 week period the pipes in the first and second experiment were conditioned for 28 and 27 weeks respectively after conditioning 20 mg l as sio2 of sodium silicate was added to the test pipes for 20 weeks in the first experiment and 18 weeks in the second experiment the first experiment was then continued to test a lower dose of sodium silicate at 16 mg l as sio2 for 9 weeks before returning to 20 mg l as sio2 for 9 more weeks conditioning for the second experiment occurred in two phases in both phases the water had daily cycles of recirculation 16 hours day and stagnation 8 hours day the first phase was comprised of the first 14 weeks of experiment where the water flowed at 2 6 l min using peristaltic pumps during the recirculation periods followed by the second phase spanning over 12 weeks with the same 4 5 l min flow rate and magnetic drive pumps that were used in in the test stage of the experiment 2 1 4 timeline of sample collection based on stagnation and flow samples were collected to monitor dissolved and total lead in water after the first stagnation period of 8 hours h and at the end of each week 168 h prior to exchange of the water in the reservoir aluminum concentrations were also measured in selected samples the free chlorine was monitored and readjusted daily in the first experiment ph was adjusted once in the middle of the week during the conditioning period of the second experiment the ph was adjusted once a week and the frequency of ph adjustment increased to thrice a week during the treatment period because of larger changes in ph in this experiment than in the first experiment the dissolved silica concentration was measured for the freshly prepared water and at the end of each week filtered samples were also collected in the first experiment during week 65 at different times to determine the lead release during 16 hours of recirculation 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 measurement of free chlorine ph dissolved silica dissolved and total lead and aluminum free chlorine and dissolved silica in the water were measured by standard methods 4500 cl g and 4500 si c respectively rice et al 2012 with a spectrophotometer perkinelmer lambda xls the ph was measured using a ph electrode and meter accumet inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms perkinelmer elan drc ii was used to measure lead and aluminum in the water for dissolved metals the water was filtered with 0 22 µm polyethersulfone pes filters and then acidified to 1 nitric acid for measurements of total lead the water remaining in the reservoir at the end of one week was treated with hydroxylamine hydrochloride and then acidified to 1 nitric acid without any filtration and held for at least 24 hours prior to analysis the hydroxylamine hydrochloride was used to dissolve any lead iv oxide pbo2 particles in the reservoir edwards and dudi 2004 2 2 2 scale characterization pairs of pipe segments from test and control loops were removed at the start and end of the conditioning stage for each experiment additional pairs of pipe segments were removed for characterization after sodium silicate addition at three separate times for the first experiment and once for the second experiment the scale analysis involved the examination of a cross section of the pipe and scales inside the pipe cross sections were prepared by embedding pipe sections in epoxy and then cutting and polishing them with increasingly fine sand paper each cross section was imaged using a fei nova scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive x ray eds spectroscopy was used to semi quantitatively determine the spatial distribution of elements within the scale the remaining length of the pipe was cut lengthwise to yield two half cylinders transverse sections the inner surfaces of these half cylinders were photographed and then scales were collected by scraping them off with a metal spatula or with 1200 grit sandpaper portions of the removed scale were analyzed by x ray powder diffraction xrd on a bruker d8 advance x ray diffractometer with cu ka radiation portions of the scale were also digested in a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid in a ratio of 1 3 by volume and then analyzed for their elemental compositions using icp ms 2 3 statistical analysis the statistical analysis was conducted on lead concentrations averaged over five week intervals using sample t tests lead concentrations during multiple intervals in the treatment period were compared to the concentrations during the stable final portion of the conditioning period the significance level was considered as 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 scale characterization of as received pipes the corrosion scales present in most of the as received lead pipes were 300 µm to 1 mm thick with a layered structure the layer closer to the pipe bottom layer was gray and the layer exposed to the water top layer was dark yellow fig 1 xrd analysis of the scales revealed the presence of hydrocerussite pb3 co3 2 oh 2 litharge pbo and quartz sio2 fig s5 while the layers were separately analyzed peaks for most of the minerals were present in both layers broad peaks between 8 and 14 degrees for an unknown phase indicate the presence of a poorly crystalline material fig s5 visualization and element mapping with sem eds determined that the bottom layer was rich in lead containing solids most likely carbonates and oxides while the top layer was comprised mostly of oxides of silicon and aluminum with minor quantities of phosphorus the xrd patterns suggests that the top layer is poorly crystalline or amorphous in nature the aluminum containing solids in this layer may include aluminosilicate aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate phases the overall thickness of the scale was predominantly from the top layer whereas the bottom layer was 50 µm or thinner the scale characteristics of the as received lsls used in the first and second experiment were similar to those harvested from the mid western region of the united states and other systems with the great lakes as their source water scales in the lsls excavated from the midwestern united states were similar to those seen in the as received pipes tully et al 2019 the presence of aluminosilicates in lsls that received treated great lakes water has been observed previously kim and herrera 2010 the source of aluminum is likely the aluminum based coagulants used in water treatment letterman and driscoll 1988 snoeyink et al 2003 several studies have also shown that aluminum phosphate based minerals can be formed on lsls receiving water treated with blended phosphate snoeyink et al 2003 tully et al 2019 wasserstrom et al 2017 other elements identified in the scales were iron and manganese table s1 deposition of these elements occurs in the pipe scales mainly due to the composition of treated water or iron pipes upstream of lsls as has been reported by other studies hill et al 2010 kim et al 2011 peng et al 2010 schock et al 2014 3 2 role of sodium silicate in lead corrosion control at original ph condition 3 2 1 lead concentrations before the addition of sodium silicate in the lsls before conditioning xrd analysis of the scales in all the pipes revealed hydrocerussite as the dominant lead corrosion product the predicted dissolved lead in equilibrium with hydrocerussite with 24 mg l dic is 56 µg l at ph 7 7 and 40 µg l at ph 8 1 fig s6 which covers the ph range encountered by the pipes in a week fig s7 a however the 168 h dissolved lead concentration in the six harvested lead pipes for the last five weeks of conditioning fell in the range of 11 36 µg l the lead concentration measured at 168 h in the first experiment had actually stabilized at that value within 16 hours of recirculation during the week as seen in fig 2 from here on the lead concentrations discussed are for168 h samples unless stated otherwise the lower dissolved lead concentrations than predicted as seen in fig 3 a is speculated to be a result of simultaneous dissolution of hydrocerussite and precipitation of pbo2 evidence for the formation of pbo2 in the system is discussed in more detail in section 3 2 3 2 the dissolved lead from the dissolution of pbo2 in chlorinated water at near neutral ph at equilibrium in a different study by xie et al 2010 was measured as 0 2 17 µg l pbo2 probably forms in the lsls of this study as a result of the meticulous readjustment of free chlorine concentration to 1 1 mg l as cl2 fig s8a 3 2 2 effect of sodium silicate on lead release at ph 7 7 within six weeks of treatment with sodium silicate at 20 mg l as sio2 the dissolved and total lead concentrations decreased significantly for all three pipes and then stabilized below 10 µg l in loops n1 a and n1 b fig 3a during weeks 44 to 48 17 21 weeks after sodium silicate addition had started the dissolved lead concentrations in loops n1 a n1 b and n1 c were respectively 69 88 and 41 lower than those seen during the final 5 weeks of the conditioning period total lead concentrations also decreased by 69 73 and 50 in the three pipes respectively fig 4 this drop was significant when compared to the control pipes with average total lead concentrations that stayed above 30 µg l fig 3a when dissolved lead concentrations began to stabilize at the end of conditioning the percentage of lead contributed by dissolved lead to the total lead in the water was about 50 the difference in the dissolved lead concentrations were statistically significant for the pipes receiving treatment when compared to the control with p values of 0 00015 for treatment with 20 mg l as sio2 and 0 00934 for treatment with 16 mg l as sio2 table 3 similarly the p values calculated for total lead released during treatment with 20 mg l as sio2 and 16 mg l as sio2 suggest that the differences in total lead concentrations between the test and control loops are also statistically significant the t test performed for comparing the lead released in treatment phases b and c with conditioning phase a done separately for test and control loops are tabulated in table s2 the lead concentrations in loops n1 a b c during treatment with sodium silicate at 16 mg l as sio2 were not significantly different from those seen during treatment with 20 mg l as sio2 the relationship of the decrease in the lead concentrations to silica uptake by the scales was explored by measuring the changes in the concentration of dissolved silica in the water an average of 7 5 mg l of dissolved silica was taken up by the pipes in the first week of treatment with sodium silicate fig 5 a followed by lower extents of silica uptake the high initial uptake of dissolved silica in the water could be due the reaction between h4sio4 the dominant species in sb water at ph 7 7 and the pipe surface the continued exposure of the lsls to dissolved silica in the water gradually decreased their capacity for further uptake thereby reducing the amount of silica lost from the water in the subsequent weeks of treatment with 20 mg l as sio2 the silica uptake in loop n1 c reached a plateau at 1 5 mg l which was lower than the steady loss of 2 5 3 mg l seen in loops n1 a and n1 b fig 5a the percentage of silica uptake during the entire treatment period correlated well with the percentage decrease in the total and dissolved lead concentrations fig s9 the pipes that took up more silica loops n1 a and n1 b had greater overall decreases in dissolved and total lead concentrations than did loop n1 c while we did not expect any loss of dissolved silica to components of the loop other than the lead pipes we did check for solid deposition on the pump pvc pipe and flowmeter to confirm that this was the case to determine if the entire amount of dissolved silica lost from the water was deposited within the scale a mass balance analysis section s3 estimated the total silica uptake during the treatment with 20 mg l of sodium silicate for two pipe segments each from loops n1 b and n1 c these two pipes were selected so that the results from the mass balance could be compared with the semi quantitative eds results from these two segments performed at the end of weeks 36 and 48 respectively based on measured extents of silica loss from the water the mass of silica was predicted to increase by 0 015 and 0 021 g per gram of the scale in loops n1 b and loop n1 c respectively which accounted for an increase of 0 7 at the end of week 36 for loop n1 b and 1 0 at the end of week 48 for loop n1 c the observed wt of silicon in the highlighted areas a and b on sem images of loop n1 b and n1 c fig 6 was in the range of 1 2 the lsls before sodium silicate treatment had a background concentration of 0 3 0 5 the increase in silicon content since the start of treatment was close to the concentrations estimated based on the measured water samples sem eds analysis of control pipes did not show any increase in si 3 2 3 characterization of scales in the lsls at ph 7 7 3 2 3 1 effect of sodium silicate on the scales the analysis of the scales and the changes in lead concentrations associated with the change in dissolved silica concentrations offers insight into the interactions occurring inside the pipes when sodium silicate was added as eds showed in fig 6 accumulation of silica in pipe segments treated with sodium silicate was consistent with the percentage increase in mass of si in the scale the accumulation of silica appears to be relatively uniform throughout the upper portion of the scale there is no localized layer of silica based on the eds mapping of all elements in the scale and the si content in different regions of the scale are similar the appearance of the localized high intensity regions of silicon are from silica that was already present in the as received pipe scales and did not result from treatment no discrete layers of silica were observed along the circumference of the scale in the cross section fig 6 fig s10 while there were zones of interaction between dissolved silica and dissolved lead no lead silicate solids formed on the pipe scales based on sem eds analysis and xrd results fig s5 a b c recent research has suggested that such phases are not thermodynamically favorable at similar conditions lintereur et al 2012 alam et al 2019 observed formation of crystalline lead silicate on the surface of rapidly corroding lead coupons in the presence of high silica concentrations of 120 mg l and they found that the deposition of lead silicate was less likely at silica concentrations of 40 mg l moreover silica in the water can react with aluminum in the scales to form aluminosilicates and deposit within the scale layer as has been seen at concentrations of 1 to 2 mg l sio2 in the presence of aluminum hydroxides brace and matijević 1977 kim and herrera 2010 based on the eds and xrd data and solubility considerations it is conceptualized to form si and al containing precipitates fig 7 as there is no evidence for the formation of crystalline minerals containing al or si it is assumed that these precipitates are amorphous the surface interaction between dissolved silica and hydroxides of lead and aluminum can be compared to the sorption of monomeric or dimeric silica onto the surface of ferric hydroxide davis et al 2002 the gradual accumulation of an amorphous si containing compound in the scales could explain the observed decrease in lead release the strength of passivation is likely to be a function of the amount of the aluminum rich scale deposited on the surface of these pipes while no studies in the past show that aluminum in the scales of the pipe helps sodium silicate to inhibit lead release two recent studies aghasadeghi et al 2019 li et al 2020 in which silicate treated and control loops at the same ph were compared found no inhibitory effect of sodium silicate addition on lead release the pipes used in those two studies did not have a thick aluminum rich layer the scales in loops n1 a and n1 b were deposited throughout the entire length of the pipes unlike the scales in loop n1 c that had patches of the bottom layer exposed to water as seen for loop n1 c week 48 in fig 1 the thinner and less continuous upper layer of al rich scale for loop n1 c would have resulted in less uptake of silica fig 5a from water and less overall inhibition of lead release fig 3a on the basis of the surface interactions the concentration gradients for dissolved lead aluminum and silica can be predicted to change across the thickness of the scale as conceptualized in fig 7 3 2 3 2 effect of free chlorine on the scales from the periodic assessments of the scales carried out at different points in time section 2 2 2 low intensity peaks for plattnerite β pbo2 were observed in the xrd patterns of the scales collected from loops n1 c and c1 c at the end of week 48 and loops n1 a and c1 a at the end of week 66 fig s5a no peaks for plattnerite were observed in the scales analyzed in the as received pipes or at the end of the conditioning period so plattnerite formed only after 37 to 48 weeks of operation of the pipe loops fig s5a and c plattnerite was observed only in the bottom layer of the scales originally composed of hydrocerussite and litharge the oxidation of lead ii solids to pbo2 was only observed at ph 7 7 in the first experiment due to the presence of free chlorine at concentration of 1 1 mg l as cl2 in the pipes fig s8 a the residual free chlorine concentrations in the pipes after a 24 hour period gradually decreased from a high concentration of 0 9 mg l as cl2 from week 21 onwards which could be an indication of the initial formation of pbo2 accelerating the consumption of free chlorine as lead ii solids are oxidized oxidation of pbo2 can be autocatalytic pan et al 2019 with growth of pbo2 accelerating once an initial amount has formed formation of pbo2 in lab scale experiments has been previously seen in chlorinated water with initial pipes that did not contain pbo2 bae et al 2020 xie et al 2010 the solubility of pbo2 is much lower than hydrocerussite xie et al 2010 and can lower the lead concentration in the pipes the transformation of hydrocerussite into plattnerite would be consistent with the dissolved lead concentrations at the end of the conditioning period being lower than the predicted solubility of hydrocerussite and the gradual decrease in the dissolved lead concentrations seen in the control pipes over the duration of the experiment fig 3a the absence of peaks from litharge would also be consistent with conversion of that solid to pbo2 the possible implications of dissolved organic carbon doc on pbo2 have not been considered here owing to its absence in the sb water in lead corrosion control studies with appreciable doc lead release from pbo2 particles as a colloidal dispersion has been suggested korshin and liu 2019 however this was not expected in our study because of the absence of doc in the work by zhou et al 2015 the presence of doc and monochloramine can have a negative effect on corrosion control by sodium silicate on lead release in this study we do not expect any negative effect from doc or monochloramine owing to their absence 3 3 effect of sodium silicate on lead release at a higher ph of 8 8 the total lead concentrations in all the lsls of the second experiment dropped to 10 to 40 µg l in the two weeks after the ph was increased from 7 7 to 8 8 fig 3b this drop occurred for both pipes receiving sodium silicate and those with their ph adjusted with naoh the lead concentrations were close to the predicted equilibrium solubility of 25 µg l of hydrocerussite at ph 8 8 for the conditions of sb water fig s6 decrease in lead release from lsls has also been observed with sodium silicate addition and naoh addition to increase the ph of water from 7 7 to 8 2 in a different study by aghasadeghi et al 2019 the difference in the total lead for the test loops and control loops based on the t test for the second experiment tabulated in table 3 was not statistically significant p 0 1 however the average dissolved lead in the three test loops was lower by 4 28 µg l compared to the control loops during week 41 45 which was significant with 90 confidence p 0 1 based on the t test for the second experiment suggesting that sodium silicate might have an additional effect over ph adjustment when the ph increased from 7 7 to 8 8 the dissolved lead concentrations decreased in most of the loops to 8 35 µg l except in loops n2 c and c2 a where an increase by 2 µg l was observed prior to treatment at high ph the lead concentration in loops n2 c and c2 a during conditioning between weeks 23 and 27 were close to 10 µg l fig 3b the low concentration of lead in loops n2 c and c2 a could be attributed to the simultaneous dissolution of hydrocerussite and precipitation of pbo2 in the pipes during conditioning that was not in the as received lsls silica uptake was high 10 mg l as sio2 from week 28 to 32 and decreased to less than 1 mg l as sio2 in subsequent weeks fig 5b the loss in dissolved silica lowered the ph in the test pipes within one day whereas the ph was more stable at 8 8 in the control pipes the ph in pipes receiving sodium silicate dropped from 8 8 to 8 3 at the beginning of the treatment phase whereas in the later stages of the experiment the ph remained stable at 8 5 fig s7 b 3 4 comparison of lead release from lsls with an increase in ph to that at baseline ph the extent of decrease in lead concentration was more when sodium silicate was added and the ph was adjusted back to the original ph conditions of sb water than when the ph was allowed to increase as a result of sodium silicate addition a reduction of 50 to 73 in total lead concentrations with concentrations below 10 µg l due to sodium silicate addition was observed at ph 7 7 in contrast a decrease of 33 to 50 of total lead concentrations was observed when the ph was increased to 8 8 fig 4 the decrease was more consistent in the latter case where the lead concentrations lowered to similar values in all three loops the effect of increasing ph with sodium silicate on reducing lead concentration was seen more quickly i e within two weeks than the effect when maintaining ph 7 7 within six weeks in loops n2 c and c2 c at ph 8 8 low intensity peaks from plattnerite were observed fig s5 d suggesting a similar oxidative environment with free chlorine as seen at ph 7 7 at the end of the experiment pipe segments from loops n2 a and c2 a also showed minor peaks associated with plattnerite these peaks were not as tall as the ones formed in loops n1 a and n1 c by the end week 66 of the first experiment where the peak intensities of plattnerite grew stronger with time fig s5 a the reasons for not observing an accelerated growth in plattnerite in the second experiment could be due to a the change in ph during the treatment phase which reduced the amount of soluble lead ii available from hydrocerussite dissolution and b the relatively less oxidative environment with the proportion of the free chlorine present as hypochlorous acid the more potent oxidant decreasing 3 5 effect of sodium silicate on aluminum release in lsls besides lead aluminum was also released in the lsls into the sb water which was monitored for both experiments for selected periods of time during the treatment phase of the experiment at ph 7 7 where half of the loops received sodium silicate the total aluminum concentration in the control pipes was 60 100 µg l every week fig s11 whereas in loops n1 a n1 b and n1 c it was 35 60 µg l in the weeks immediately after sodium silicate addition and lowered to a range of 12 40 µg l by the end of the experiment the aluminum released in loop n1 c was consistently the lowest among all three test loops which could have resulted from different scale characteristics than for the other two loops as seen in fig 1 despite the consistent loss in aluminum from the pipe and no source of aluminum in the sb water the scale thickness in the pipes did not decrease significantly over 66 weeks as seen in the sem images of loop n1 a on week 66 fig 1 when compared to sem images from weeks 0 and 28 the maximum aluminum lost in the control pipes within 66 weeks at the rate of 100 µg l per week would account for only 0 4 wt wt of the total scale content in the pipe which is too small of a change to be determined using the sem images initially during the treatment period of the second experiment the total aluminum concentration was 150 200 µg l in the control loops compared to 150 µg l or lower concentrations in test loops fig s12 with increasing treatment time the aluminum concentration decreased below 30 µg l in the three test pipes and gradually increased to 450 µg l with fluctuations as high as 750 µg l in the control pipes the considerable decrease in aluminum released in the presence of silica shows that dissolved silica in the water interacts with aluminum present in the top layer formation of hydrated al si species with silica at low concentrations of 2 mg l as sio2 and 100 µg l of al has been reported at low temperatures of 25 c farmer and lumsdon 1994 and such species are likely to form in drinking water distribution systems snoeyink et al 2003 similar to the first experiment the loss in scale thickness was too small to be observed by sem during the 18 weeks of treatment without sodium silicate 0 135 g of aluminum was anticipated to be lost which was only 0 5 of the total amount of scale present in the pipe 3 6 corrosion control with sodium silicate dissolved silica in the water was hypothesized to have either reacted with aluminum or lead present in the top layer of the scale to form amorphous precipitates or deposit as amorphous silica within the pores of the scale layer this hypothesis is supported by the loss in silica from the reservoir fig 5 and the gradual decrease in aluminum fig s11 released upon continued treatment with sodium silicate the deposition of the amorphous materials can affect the lead released via mass transfer through the top layer fig 7 however the lead release rate was not seen to be affected due to silicate addition which suggests that the equilibrium dissolved lead concentration may have been affected by the addition of sodium silicate fig 2 such a lowering of the equilibrium dissolved lead concentration could be associated with the formation of an amorphous lead containing solid that we have been unable to identify or to the adsorption of lead to freshly formed silicon containing materials within the scale if a new solid formed as either an adsorbent or lead containing precipitate then the lack of detectable peaks in the xrd pattern indicates that the solid is either x ray amorphous or not sufficiently abundant to be detectable since the ph and dic were constant in both treatment and control for the first experiment decrease in the solubility of lead ii and lead iv based solids was not a likely cause for the lead concentrations observed interaction of silica with the scale to form this hypothesized barrier is estimated to have occurred within eight weeks of treatment resulting in simultaneous lowering of lead concentrations decreased weekly loss of silica from solution and increase in the percentage of silicon in the scale the corrosion control is also believed to be sensitive to the amount and morphology of the aluminum rich amorphous scale that is on top of the lead rich scale sodium silicate was found to be more effective for loops n1 a and n1 b when compared to loop n1 c which had lower scale density and exposed patches of lead based scale to water fig 1 at higher ph sodium silicate decreased the dissolved lead concentrations with 90 significance when compared to ph adjustment with naoh alone 4 conclusions sodium silicate effectively controlled lead release to water from pipes for which the ph was maintained at pre silicate levels for two out of three pipes the concentration of lead dropped below 10 µg l within six to eight weeks of treatment the extent of decrease in lead concentrations was directly associated with the extent of silica uptake by these pipes silica uptake was more pronounced in two pipes with the most aluminum rich corrosion scales these scales allow the dissolved silica in the water to diffuse through the pores of the scales and to adsorb or deposit as amorphous solid phases throughout the scale thickness when sodium silicate addition was allowed to raise the ph from 7 7 to 8 8 sodium silicate significantly decreased the dissolved lead concentration when compared to dissolved lead concentrations achieved at the same ph using sodium hydroxide silica was still taken up by the scales at ph 8 8 but the benefits of silica uptake by scale may be too small to be detected against the benefit of the increased ph the research has not considered the effect of silicate on lead release in the

17412,the effect of sodium silicate addition on lead release from lead service lines lsls was investigated using laboratory based pipe loop experiments with lsls harvested from a water utility that has one of the great lakes as its source water the lsls were first conditioned with a synthetic water similar to that of buffalo water that matched the major water chemistry that the pipes had experienced in the field the one exception was the absence of dissolved organic carbon in the synthetic water after conditioning the lsls were used in tests with the same synthetic water and with sodium silicate added to the water for half of the lsls in one test sodium silicate addition was performed with adjustment of the ph to maintain it at the same value ph 7 7 as before addition in this test sodium silicate effectively reduced the dissolved and particulate lead concentrations in the water within six weeks of treatment periodic assessments of the corrosion scales in the pipes found that sodium silicate accumulated throughout the scale thickness and gradually decreased the lead release in the other test the ph was allowed to increase from 7 7 to 8 8 upon addition of 20 mg l as sio2 sodium silicates and parallel control experiments were performed with the same ph increase made using sodium hydroxide addition in these tests the lead concentrations decreased in both the silicate treated and control pipes and the decreases were not significantly different between the silicate treated and control pipes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sodium

there has been research on sodium silicate for control of corrosion of metals other than lead for nearly 100 years naturally present silica in water was suggested to react with ferric hydrate and form corrosion inhibiting films in iron pipes speller 1925 the mechanism of sodium silicate inhibition of yellow brass corrosion was hypothesized to involve an interaction of negative silicate ions or micelles with positive metal ions stericker 1945 several studies described the passivating film formed on yellow brass to consist of a lower layer consisting of initial corrosion products and an upper layer of colloidal metal hydroxides enmeshed in silica gel glasser and lachowski 1980a lehrman and shuldener 1951 1952 shuldener and lehrman 1957 shuldener and sussman 1960 in work by rushing et al 2003 dissolved silica was shown to decrease the rate of oxidation of iron from fe ii to fe iii and increase the particulate iron released to water with a decrease in size of suspended particles in well mixed batch reactors in another study a silicate inhibitor reduced the copper release from copper coupon surfaces at low concentration of silica the mechanism was hypothesized to be the formation of copper silicate macnevin 2007 application of sodium silicate for reducing lead release from lead based salts can be dated back to the 1920s thresh 1922 lytle et al 1996 reported that sodium silicate at 15 to 30 mg l as sio2 can reduce lead concentrations in water from lead based premise plumbing materials and schock et al 2005 found that it decreased lead release from lsls in a study by hosseinibalajadeh 2018 addition of a silicate chemical decreased lead release because of an associated increase in ph from 7 7 to 9 0 in all these studies the ph of the water increased as a result of inhibitor addition and the specific effect of increased silica concentration could not be fully distinguished from the effect of the ph increase decrease in lead release from lead coupons was seen in waters receiving sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide where both treatments resulted in high ph water pinto et al 1997 similarly both sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide decreased lead concentrations in water in lsls aghasadeghi et al 2019 woszczynski et al 2015 observed no difference in two scenarios of sodium silicate s effect on lead release one was a system receiving sodium silicate as is and the other was a system that received sodium silicate with the ph of the water then being further increased after the addition of sodium silicate very few studies have examined sodium silicate addition while maintaining a constant ph thompson et al 1997 lowering the ph after sodium silicate was not deemed favorable in a study by macquarrie et al 1997 for reducing lead in water stagnating in premise plumbing materials there has been a knowledge gap in understanding if sodium silicate has an independent effect on lead release to water from lsls or if the effect is just that of an increase in ph this study aimed to determine the effectiveness of sodium silicate addition in reducing lead release from lsls to drinking water both with and without concurrent changes in ph this was pursued in two separate studies one in which sodium silicate treated and control pipes were maintained at the original ph of the water ph 7 7 and another with sodium silicate and control loops both having their ph increased to 8 8 the mechanism of the corrosion inhibition was explored by examining changes in concentrations of metals species following sodium silicate addition and by characterizing the structure and composition of the pipe scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup for loops experiments with lead pipes at ph 7 7 and 8 8 2 1 1 design of the loop system nine harvested lead pipes were provided by buffalo water for the experiments six harvested lsls were used directly for the first experiment the other three lsls were long enough to yield six pipe assemblies for the second experiment each pipe loop had a high density polyethene hdpe reservoir 10 l magnetic drive pump flowmeter and lead pipe assembly each pipe assembly had one 15 inch segment and three 4 inch segments assembled from segments cut from the same harvested pipes the edges of each segment were covered with epoxy to prevent bare lead exposure to water the segments were held together with rubber gaskets pvc pipes plastic tubing and valves were used to complete each loop figs s2 and s3 each day the water in a pipe loop recirculated for 16 hours at a flow rate of 4 5 l min and remained stagnant for 8 hours to simulate an overnight stagnation condition the entire volume 10 l of water recirculates many times through the pipe at 4 5 l min allowing for the dissolved lead concentrations to increase and equilibrate in one week at the same concentrations in the reservoir and pipe before the water is analyzed at this flow rate one week of the experiment represents about 3000 hydraulic residence times of the reservoir i e the reservoir has been turned over about 3000 times through recirculation through the pipe assembly the reservoirs were exchanged at the end of each week with reservoirs containing freshly prepared lead free water 2 1 2 preparation of water chemistry the experiment used synthetic water with an overall composition similar to that which the pipes were exposed to when in use the synthetic buffalo water sb water matched the typical dic alkalinity hardness ph free chlorine and blended phosphate of the original water buffalo water 2018 table 1 using chemicals indicated in the supplementary material section s2 the sb water lacked organic carbon and therefore the experiments did not show the effects of organic matter on lead release both during conditioning and treatment three pipe loops in the first experiment loops n1 a n1 b and n1 c were treated with sodium silicate n pq corporation and their ph was readjusted to 7 7 with h2so4 the other three loops served as controls loops c1 a c1 b and c1 c that did not receive sodium silicate in the second experiment three pipe loops loops n2 a n2 b and n2 c were treated with sodium silicate without ph readjustment which resulted in an increase to ph 8 8 when receiving 20 mg l as sio2 sodium silicate fig s4 and three control pipe loops loops c2 a c2 b and c2 c were treated with sodium hydroxide to match the ph of 8 8 in the test loops the sodium silicate added to the freshly prepared water remains entirely in the dissolved state in the reservoirs as shown in fig s1 2 1 3 stages of the experiment the two major phases of the experiments were conditioning and treatment table 2 during conditioning sb water was recirculated in the pipe loops until the lead concentration in the water flowing through each of them had a week to week variability of less than 25 over a 5 week period the pipes in the first and second experiment were conditioned for 28 and 27 weeks respectively after conditioning 20 mg l as sio2 of sodium silicate was added to the test pipes for 20 weeks in the first experiment and 18 weeks in the second experiment the first experiment was then continued to test a lower dose of sodium silicate at 16 mg l as sio2 for 9 weeks before returning to 20 mg l as sio2 for 9 more weeks conditioning for the second experiment occurred in two phases in both phases the water had daily cycles of recirculation 16 hours day and stagnation 8 hours day the first phase was comprised of the first 14 weeks of experiment where the water flowed at 2 6 l min using peristaltic pumps during the recirculation periods followed by the second phase spanning over 12 weeks with the same 4 5 l min flow rate and magnetic drive pumps that were used in in the test stage of the experiment 2 1 4 timeline of sample collection based on stagnation and flow samples were collected to monitor dissolved and total lead in water after the first stagnation period of 8 hours h and at the end of each week 168 h prior to exchange of the water in the reservoir aluminum concentrations were also measured in selected samples the free chlorine was monitored and readjusted daily in the first experiment ph was adjusted once in the middle of the week during the conditioning period of the second experiment the ph was adjusted once a week and the frequency of ph adjustment increased to thrice a week during the treatment period because of larger changes in ph in this experiment than in the first experiment the dissolved silica concentration was measured for the freshly prepared water and at the end of each week filtered samples were also collected in the first experiment during week 65 at different times to determine the lead release during 16 hours of recirculation 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 measurement of free chlorine ph dissolved silica dissolved and total lead and aluminum free chlorine and dissolved silica in the water were measured by standard methods 4500 cl g and 4500 si c respectively rice et al 2012 with a spectrophotometer perkinelmer lambda xls the ph was measured using a ph electrode and meter accumet inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms perkinelmer elan drc ii was used to measure lead and aluminum in the water for dissolved metals the water was filtered with 0 22 µm polyethersulfone pes filters and then acidified to 1 nitric acid for measurements of total lead the water remaining in the reservoir at the end of one week was treated with hydroxylamine hydrochloride and then acidified to 1 nitric acid without any filtration and held for at least 24 hours prior to analysis the hydroxylamine hydrochloride was used to dissolve any lead iv oxide pbo2 particles in the reservoir edwards and dudi 2004 2 2 2 scale characterization pairs of pipe segments from test and control loops were removed at the start and end of the conditioning stage for each experiment additional pairs of pipe segments were removed for characterization after sodium silicate addition at three separate times for the first experiment and once for the second experiment the scale analysis involved the examination of a cross section of the pipe and scales inside the pipe cross sections were prepared by embedding pipe sections in epoxy and then cutting and polishing them with increasingly fine sand paper each cross section was imaged using a fei nova scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive x ray eds spectroscopy was used to semi quantitatively determine the spatial distribution of elements within the scale the remaining length of the pipe was cut lengthwise to yield two half cylinders transverse sections the inner surfaces of these half cylinders were photographed and then scales were collected by scraping them off with a metal spatula or with 1200 grit sandpaper portions of the removed scale were analyzed by x ray powder diffraction xrd on a bruker d8 advance x ray diffractometer with cu ka radiation portions of the scale were also digested in a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid in a ratio of 1 3 by volume and then analyzed for their elemental compositions using icp ms 2 3 statistical analysis the statistical analysis was conducted on lead concentrations averaged over five week intervals using sample t tests lead concentrations during multiple intervals in the treatment period were compared to the concentrations during the stable final portion of the conditioning period the significance level was considered as 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 scale characterization of as received pipes the corrosion scales present in most of the as received lead pipes were 300 µm to 1 mm thick with a layered structure the layer closer to the pipe bottom layer was gray and the layer exposed to the water top layer was dark yellow fig 1 xrd analysis of the scales revealed the presence of hydrocerussite pb3 co3 2 oh 2 litharge pbo and quartz sio2 fig s5 while the layers were separately analyzed peaks for most of the minerals were present in both layers broad peaks between 8 and 14 degrees for an unknown phase indicate the presence of a poorly crystalline material fig s5 visualization and element mapping with sem eds determined that the bottom layer was rich in lead containing solids most likely carbonates and oxides while the top layer was comprised mostly of oxides of silicon and aluminum with minor quantities of phosphorus the xrd patterns suggests that the top layer is poorly crystalline or amorphous in nature the aluminum containing solids in this layer may include aluminosilicate aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate phases the overall thickness of the scale was predominantly from the top layer whereas the bottom layer was 50 µm or thinner the scale characteristics of the as received lsls used in the first and second experiment were similar to those harvested from the mid western region of the united states and other systems with the great lakes as their source water scales in the lsls excavated from the midwestern united states were similar to those seen in the as received pipes tully et al 2019 the presence of aluminosilicates in lsls that received treated great lakes water has been observed previously kim and herrera 2010 the source of aluminum is likely the aluminum based coagulants used in water treatment letterman and driscoll 1988 snoeyink et al 2003 several studies have also shown that aluminum phosphate based minerals can be formed on lsls receiving water treated with blended phosphate snoeyink et al 2003 tully et al 2019 wasserstrom et al 2017 other elements identified in the scales were iron and manganese table s1 deposition of these elements occurs in the pipe scales mainly due to the composition of treated water or iron pipes upstream of lsls as has been reported by other studies hill et al 2010 kim et al 2011 peng et al 2010 schock et al 2014 3 2 role of sodium silicate in lead corrosion control at original ph condition 3 2 1 lead concentrations before the addition of sodium silicate in the lsls before conditioning xrd analysis of the scales in all the pipes revealed hydrocerussite as the dominant lead corrosion product the predicted dissolved lead in equilibrium with hydrocerussite with 24 mg l dic is 56 µg l at ph 7 7 and 40 µg l at ph 8 1 fig s6 which covers the ph range encountered by the pipes in a week fig s7 a however the 168 h dissolved lead concentration in the six harvested lead pipes for the last five weeks of conditioning fell in the range of 11 36 µg l the lead concentration measured at 168 h in the first experiment had actually stabilized at that value within 16 hours of recirculation during the week as seen in fig 2 from here on the lead concentrations discussed are for168 h samples unless stated otherwise the lower dissolved lead concentrations than predicted as seen in fig 3 a is speculated to be a result of simultaneous dissolution of hydrocerussite and precipitation of pbo2 evidence for the formation of pbo2 in the system is discussed in more detail in section 3 2 3 2 the dissolved lead from the dissolution of pbo2 in chlorinated water at near neutral ph at equilibrium in a different study by xie et al 2010 was measured as 0 2 17 µg l pbo2 probably forms in the lsls of this study as a result of the meticulous readjustment of free chlorine concentration to 1 1 mg l as cl2 fig s8a 3 2 2 effect of sodium silicate on lead release at ph 7 7 within six weeks of treatment with sodium silicate at 20 mg l as sio2 the dissolved and total lead concentrations decreased significantly for all three pipes and then stabilized below 10 µg l in loops n1 a and n1 b fig 3a during weeks 44 to 48 17 21 weeks after sodium silicate addition had started the dissolved lead concentrations in loops n1 a n1 b and n1 c were respectively 69 88 and 41 lower than those seen during the final 5 weeks of the conditioning period total lead concentrations also decreased by 69 73 and 50 in the three pipes respectively fig 4 this drop was significant when compared to the control pipes with average total lead concentrations that stayed above 30 µg l fig 3a when dissolved lead concentrations began to stabilize at the end of conditioning the percentage of lead contributed by dissolved lead to the total lead in the water was about 50 the difference in the dissolved lead concentrations were statistically significant for the pipes receiving treatment when compared to the control with p values of 0 00015 for treatment with 20 mg l as sio2 and 0 00934 for treatment with 16 mg l as sio2 table 3 similarly the p values calculated for total lead released during treatment with 20 mg l as sio2 and 16 mg l as sio2 suggest that the differences in total lead concentrations between the test and control loops are also statistically significant the t test performed for comparing the lead released in treatment phases b and c with conditioning phase a done separately for test and control loops are tabulated in table s2 the lead concentrations in loops n1 a b c during treatment with sodium silicate at 16 mg l as sio2 were not significantly different from those seen during treatment with 20 mg l as sio2 the relationship of the decrease in the lead concentrations to silica uptake by the scales was explored by measuring the changes in the concentration of dissolved silica in the water an average of 7 5 mg l of dissolved silica was taken up by the pipes in the first week of treatment with sodium silicate fig 5 a followed by lower extents of silica uptake the high initial uptake of dissolved silica in the water could be due the reaction between h4sio4 the dominant species in sb water at ph 7 7 and the pipe surface the continued exposure of the lsls to dissolved silica in the water gradually decreased their capacity for further uptake thereby reducing the amount of silica lost from the water in the subsequent weeks of treatment with 20 mg l as sio2 the silica uptake in loop n1 c reached a plateau at 1 5 mg l which was lower than the steady loss of 2 5 3 mg l seen in loops n1 a and n1 b fig 5a the percentage of silica uptake during the entire treatment period correlated well with the percentage decrease in the total and dissolved lead concentrations fig s9 the pipes that took up more silica loops n1 a and n1 b had greater overall decreases in dissolved and total lead concentrations than did loop n1 c while we did not expect any loss of dissolved silica to components of the loop other than the lead pipes we did check for solid deposition on the pump pvc pipe and flowmeter to confirm that this was the case to determine if the entire amount of dissolved silica lost from the water was deposited within the scale a mass balance analysis section s3 estimated the total silica uptake during the treatment with 20 mg l of sodium silicate for two pipe segments each from loops n1 b and n1 c these two pipes were selected so that the results from the mass balance could be compared with the semi quantitative eds results from these two segments performed at the end of weeks 36 and 48 respectively based on measured extents of silica loss from the water the mass of silica was predicted to increase by 0 015 and 0 021 g per gram of the scale in loops n1 b and loop n1 c respectively which accounted for an increase of 0 7 at the end of week 36 for loop n1 b and 1 0 at the end of week 48 for loop n1 c the observed wt of silicon in the highlighted areas a and b on sem images of loop n1 b and n1 c fig 6 was in the range of 1 2 the lsls before sodium silicate treatment had a background concentration of 0 3 0 5 the increase in silicon content since the start of treatment was close to the concentrations estimated based on the measured water samples sem eds analysis of control pipes did not show any increase in si 3 2 3 characterization of scales in the lsls at ph 7 7 3 2 3 1 effect of sodium silicate on the scales the analysis of the scales and the changes in lead concentrations associated with the change in dissolved silica concentrations offers insight into the interactions occurring inside the pipes when sodium silicate was added as eds showed in fig 6 accumulation of silica in pipe segments treated with sodium silicate was consistent with the percentage increase in mass of si in the scale the accumulation of silica appears to be relatively uniform throughout the upper portion of the scale there is no localized layer of silica based on the eds mapping of all elements in the scale and the si content in different regions of the scale are similar the appearance of the localized high intensity regions of silicon are from silica that was already present in the as received pipe scales and did not result from treatment no discrete layers of silica were observed along the circumference of the scale in the cross section fig 6 fig s10 while there were zones of interaction between dissolved silica and dissolved lead no lead silicate solids formed on the pipe scales based on sem eds analysis and xrd results fig s5 a b c recent research has suggested that such phases are not thermodynamically favorable at similar conditions lintereur et al 2012 alam et al 2019 observed formation of crystalline lead silicate on the surface of rapidly corroding lead coupons in the presence of high silica concentrations of 120 mg l and they found that the deposition of lead silicate was less likely at silica concentrations of 40 mg l moreover silica in the water can react with aluminum in the scales to form aluminosilicates and deposit within the scale layer as has been seen at concentrations of 1 to 2 mg l sio2 in the presence of aluminum hydroxides brace and matijević 1977 kim and herrera 2010 based on the eds and xrd data and solubility considerations it is conceptualized to form si and al containing precipitates fig 7 as there is no evidence for the formation of crystalline minerals containing al or si it is assumed that these precipitates are amorphous the surface interaction between dissolved silica and hydroxides of lead and aluminum can be compared to the sorption of monomeric or dimeric silica onto the surface of ferric hydroxide davis et al 2002 the gradual accumulation of an amorphous si containing compound in the scales could explain the observed decrease in lead release the strength of passivation is likely to be a function of the amount of the aluminum rich scale deposited on the surface of these pipes while no studies in the past show that aluminum in the scales of the pipe helps sodium silicate to inhibit lead release two recent studies aghasadeghi et al 2019 li et al 2020 in which silicate treated and control loops at the same ph were compared found no inhibitory effect of sodium silicate addition on lead release the pipes used in those two studies did not have a thick aluminum rich layer the scales in loops n1 a and n1 b were deposited throughout the entire length of the pipes unlike the scales in loop n1 c that had patches of the bottom layer exposed to water as seen for loop n1 c week 48 in fig 1 the thinner and less continuous upper layer of al rich scale for loop n1 c would have resulted in less uptake of silica fig 5a from water and less overall inhibition of lead release fig 3a on the basis of the surface interactions the concentration gradients for dissolved lead aluminum and silica can be predicted to change across the thickness of the scale as conceptualized in fig 7 3 2 3 2 effect of free chlorine on the scales from the periodic assessments of the scales carried out at different points in time section 2 2 2 low intensity peaks for plattnerite β pbo2 were observed in the xrd patterns of the scales collected from loops n1 c and c1 c at the end of week 48 and loops n1 a and c1 a at the end of week 66 fig s5a no peaks for plattnerite were observed in the scales analyzed in the as received pipes or at the end of the conditioning period so plattnerite formed only after 37 to 48 weeks of operation of the pipe loops fig s5a and c plattnerite was observed only in the bottom layer of the scales originally composed of hydrocerussite and litharge the oxidation of lead ii solids to pbo2 was only observed at ph 7 7 in the first experiment due to the presence of free chlorine at concentration of 1 1 mg l as cl2 in the pipes fig s8 a the residual free chlorine concentrations in the pipes after a 24 hour period gradually decreased from a high concentration of 0 9 mg l as cl2 from week 21 onwards which could be an indication of the initial formation of pbo2 accelerating the consumption of free chlorine as lead ii solids are oxidized oxidation of pbo2 can be autocatalytic pan et al 2019 with growth of pbo2 accelerating once an initial amount has formed formation of pbo2 in lab scale experiments has been previously seen in chlorinated water with initial pipes that did not contain pbo2 bae et al 2020 xie et al 2010 the solubility of pbo2 is much lower than hydrocerussite xie et al 2010 and can lower the lead concentration in the pipes the transformation of hydrocerussite into plattnerite would be consistent with the dissolved lead concentrations at the end of the conditioning period being lower than the predicted solubility of hydrocerussite and the gradual decrease in the dissolved lead concentrations seen in the control pipes over the duration of the experiment fig 3a the absence of peaks from litharge would also be consistent with conversion of that solid to pbo2 the possible implications of dissolved organic carbon doc on pbo2 have not been considered here owing to its absence in the sb water in lead corrosion control studies with appreciable doc lead release from pbo2 particles as a colloidal dispersion has been suggested korshin and liu 2019 however this was not expected in our study because of the absence of doc in the work by zhou et al 2015 the presence of doc and monochloramine can have a negative effect on corrosion control by sodium silicate on lead release in this study we do not expect any negative effect from doc or monochloramine owing to their absence 3 3 effect of sodium silicate on lead release at a higher ph of 8 8 the total lead concentrations in all the lsls of the second experiment dropped to 10 to 40 µg l in the two weeks after the ph was increased from 7 7 to 8 8 fig 3b this drop occurred for both pipes receiving sodium silicate and those with their ph adjusted with naoh the lead concentrations were close to the predicted equilibrium solubility of 25 µg l of hydrocerussite at ph 8 8 for the conditions of sb water fig s6 decrease in lead release from lsls has also been observed with sodium silicate addition and naoh addition to increase the ph of water from 7 7 to 8 2 in a different study by aghasadeghi et al 2019 the difference in the total lead for the test loops and control loops based on the t test for the second experiment tabulated in table 3 was not statistically significant p 0 1 however the average dissolved lead in the three test loops was lower by 4 28 µg l compared to the control loops during week 41 45 which was significant with 90 confidence p 0 1 based on the t test for the second experiment suggesting that sodium silicate might have an additional effect over ph adjustment when the ph increased from 7 7 to 8 8 the dissolved lead concentrations decreased in most of the loops to 8 35 µg l except in loops n2 c and c2 a where an increase by 2 µg l was observed prior to treatment at high ph the lead concentration in loops n2 c and c2 a during conditioning between weeks 23 and 27 were close to 10 µg l fig 3b the low concentration of lead in loops n2 c and c2 a could be attributed to the simultaneous dissolution of hydrocerussite and precipitation of pbo2 in the pipes during conditioning that was not in the as received lsls silica uptake was high 10 mg l as sio2 from week 28 to 32 and decreased to less than 1 mg l as sio2 in subsequent weeks fig 5b the loss in dissolved silica lowered the ph in the test pipes within one day whereas the ph was more stable at 8 8 in the control pipes the ph in pipes receiving sodium silicate dropped from 8 8 to 8 3 at the beginning of the treatment phase whereas in the later stages of the experiment the ph remained stable at 8 5 fig s7 b 3 4 comparison of lead release from lsls with an increase in ph to that at baseline ph the extent of decrease in lead concentration was more when sodium silicate was added and the ph was adjusted back to the original ph conditions of sb water than when the ph was allowed to increase as a result of sodium silicate addition a reduction of 50 to 73 in total lead concentrations with concentrations below 10 µg l due to sodium silicate addition was observed at ph 7 7 in contrast a decrease of 33 to 50 of total lead concentrations was observed when the ph was increased to 8 8 fig 4 the decrease was more consistent in the latter case where the lead concentrations lowered to similar values in all three loops the effect of increasing ph with sodium silicate on reducing lead concentration was seen more quickly i e within two weeks than the effect when maintaining ph 7 7 within six weeks in loops n2 c and c2 c at ph 8 8 low intensity peaks from plattnerite were observed fig s5 d suggesting a similar oxidative environment with free chlorine as seen at ph 7 7 at the end of the experiment pipe segments from loops n2 a and c2 a also showed minor peaks associated with plattnerite these peaks were not as tall as the ones formed in loops n1 a and n1 c by the end week 66 of the first experiment where the peak intensities of plattnerite grew stronger with time fig s5 a the reasons for not observing an accelerated growth in plattnerite in the second experiment could be due to a the change in ph during the treatment phase which reduced the amount of soluble lead ii available from hydrocerussite dissolution and b the relatively less oxidative environment with the proportion of the free chlorine present as hypochlorous acid the more potent oxidant decreasing 3 5 effect of sodium silicate on aluminum release in lsls besides lead aluminum was also released in the lsls into the sb water which was monitored for both experiments for selected periods of time during the treatment phase of the experiment at ph 7 7 where half of the loops received sodium silicate the total aluminum concentration in the control pipes was 60 100 µg l every week fig s11 whereas in loops n1 a n1 b and n1 c it was 35 60 µg l in the weeks immediately after sodium silicate addition and lowered to a range of 12 40 µg l by the end of the experiment the aluminum released in loop n1 c was consistently the lowest among all three test loops which could have resulted from different scale characteristics than for the other two loops as seen in fig 1 despite the consistent loss in aluminum from the pipe and no source of aluminum in the sb water the scale thickness in the pipes did not decrease significantly over 66 weeks as seen in the sem images of loop n1 a on week 66 fig 1 when compared to sem images from weeks 0 and 28 the maximum aluminum lost in the control pipes within 66 weeks at the rate of 100 µg l per week would account for only 0 4 wt wt of the total scale content in the pipe which is too small of a change to be determined using the sem images initially during the treatment period of the second experiment the total aluminum concentration was 150 200 µg l in the control loops compared to 150 µg l or lower concentrations in test loops fig s12 with increasing treatment time the aluminum concentration decreased below 30 µg l in the three test pipes and gradually increased to 450 µg l with fluctuations as high as 750 µg l in the control pipes the considerable decrease in aluminum released in the presence of silica shows that dissolved silica in the water interacts with aluminum present in the top layer formation of hydrated al si species with silica at low concentrations of 2 mg l as sio2 and 100 µg l of al has been reported at low temperatures of 25 c farmer and lumsdon 1994 and such species are likely to form in drinking water distribution systems snoeyink et al 2003 similar to the first experiment the loss in scale thickness was too small to be observed by sem during the 18 weeks of treatment without sodium silicate 0 135 g of aluminum was anticipated to be lost which was only 0 5 of the total amount of scale present in the pipe 3 6 corrosion control with sodium silicate dissolved silica in the water was hypothesized to have either reacted with aluminum or lead present in the top layer of the scale to form amorphous precipitates or deposit as amorphous silica within the pores of the scale layer this hypothesis is supported by the loss in silica from the reservoir fig 5 and the gradual decrease in aluminum fig s11 released upon continued treatment with sodium silicate the deposition of the amorphous materials can affect the lead released via mass transfer through the top layer fig 7 however the lead release rate was not seen to be affected due to silicate addition which suggests that the equilibrium dissolved lead concentration may have been affected by the addition of sodium silicate fig 2 such a lowering of the equilibrium dissolved lead concentration could be associated with the formation of an amorphous lead containing solid that we have been unable to identify or to the adsorption of lead to freshly formed silicon containing materials within the scale if a new solid formed as either an adsorbent or lead containing precipitate then the lack of detectable peaks in the xrd pattern indicates that the solid is either x ray amorphous or not sufficiently abundant to be detectable since the ph and dic were constant in both treatment and control for the first experiment decrease in the solubility of lead ii and lead iv based solids was not a likely cause for the lead concentrations observed interaction of silica with the scale to form this hypothesized barrier is estimated to have occurred within eight weeks of treatment resulting in simultaneous lowering of lead concentrations decreased weekly loss of silica from solution and increase in the percentage of silicon in the scale the corrosion control is also believed to be sensitive to the amount and morphology of the aluminum rich amorphous scale that is on top of the lead rich scale sodium silicate was found to be more effective for loops n1 a and n1 b when compared to loop n1 c which had lower scale density and exposed patches of lead based scale to water fig 1 at higher ph sodium silicate decreased the dissolved lead concentrations with 90 significance when compared to ph adjustment with naoh alone 4 conclusions sodium silicate effectively controlled lead release to water from pipes for which the ph was maintained at pre silicate levels for two out of three pipes the concentration of lead dropped below 10 µg l within six to eight weeks of treatment the extent of decrease in lead concentrations was directly associated with the extent of silica uptake by these pipes silica uptake was more pronounced in two pipes with the most aluminum rich corrosion scales these scales allow the dissolved silica in the water to diffuse through the pores of the scales and to adsorb or deposit as amorphous solid phases throughout the scale thickness when sodium silicate addition was allowed to raise the ph from 7 7 to 8 8 sodium silicate significantly decreased the dissolved lead concentration when compared to dissolved lead concentrations achieved at the same ph using sodium hydroxide silica was still taken up by the scales at ph 8 8 but the benefits of silica uptake by scale may be too small to be detected against the benefit of the increased ph the research has not considered the effect of silicate on lead release in the presence of doc and future research can examine whether concentrations and properties of doc influence the ability of sodium silicate to control lease release declaration of competing interest the

17413,in this paper we analyse the feasibility of low voltage iron electrocoagulation as a means of municipal secondary effluent treatment with a focus on removal of microbial indicators antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and nutrients a laboratory scale batch unit equipped with iron electrodes was used on synthetic and real secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant synthetic secondary effluent was separately assayed with spiked escherichia coli wr1 and with bacteriophage φx174 while real effluent samples were screened before and after treatment for e coli extended spectrum betalactamase producing e coli enterococci vancomycin resistant enterococci clostridium perfringens spores and somatic coliphages charge dosage cd and charge dosage rate cdr were used as the main process control parameters experiments with synthetic secondary effluent showed 4log10 and 5log10 removal for phage φx174 and for e coli wr1 respectively in real effluents bacterial indicator removal exceeded 3 5log10 arb were removed below detection limit 2 5log10 virus removal reached 2 3log10 and c perfringens spore removal exceeded 2 5log10 experiments in both real and synthetic wastewater showed that bacterial removal increased with increasing cd and decreasing cdr virus removal increased with increasing cd but was irresponsive to cdr c perfringens spore removal increased with increasing cd yet reached a removal plateau being also irresponsive to cdr phosphate removal exceeded 99 while total nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand removal were below 15 and 58 respectively operational cost estimates were made for power and iron plate consumption and were found to be in the range of 0 01 to 0 24 m3 for the different assayed configurations in conclusion low voltage fe ec is a promising technology for pathogen reduction of secondary municipal effluents with log10 removals comparable to those achieved by conventional disinfection methods such as chlorination uv or ozonation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antimicrobial resistance electrocoagulation iron pathogens secondary effluent water reclamation 1 introduction at present one third of the world s population lives in water stressed countries and by 2025 the figure is expected to rise to two thirds elimelech 2006 discharge of untreated wastewater into the water sources can degrade water quality increasing the risk to human health and ecosystem degradation in this context water reuse is often recognised as a solution with great potential in reducing the gap between availability and demand agriculture is currently the largest consumer of reclaimed water providing an all year round water source with an estimate 200 million farmers worldwide using either raw or treated wastewater for irrigation of over 2000 km2 qadir et al 2007 raschid sally jayakody 2008 constituting roughly 8 of all irrigated land in the planet most of which happens in asia howell 2001 the united nations agenda for sustainable development goals targets improvement in water quality by reducing pollution eliminating the discharge of polluted waters halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and increasing safe water reuse globally anfruns estrada et al 2017 despite reclamation being an attractive concept municipal wastewater harbours a wide range of enteric pathogens such as virus bacteria protozoa parasitic worms and eggs and its re use calls for careful management of its associated health risks such risks depend on the type of water to be recycled the type and concentration of pathogens and in particular the ability of such pathogens to survive treatment as well as the type of exposure of susceptible community members to such waters the required level of pathogen reduction in reclaimed water depends on the nature of reuse application and potential for human exposure to water in this context the feasibility of iron 0 electrocoagulation fe ec for microbial attenuation in municipal secondary effluents was explored previous studies have demonstrated the effect of fe ec in the removal of a wide range of microorganisms from bacteria to viruses in different water matrices mainly for drinking water applications ghernaout et al 2019 heffron et al 2019a heffron et al 2019c delaire 2016 the application of fe ec for the reclamation of secondary municipal effluents provides interesting advantages since their higher conductivities reduce electrolysis cost plus residual iron is a lesser concern than for drinking water in spite of this only few fe ec studies focussed on real secondary effluents ding et al 2017 anfruns estrada et al 2017 llanos et al 2014 and to the best of our knowledge none investigated the removal of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb the main objective of the present research is to evaluate the performance of low voltage fe ec during the treatment of municipal secondary effluents for reclamation purposes in the removal of microbial pathogen indicators escherichia coli enterococci somatic coliphages and clostridium perfringens spores and antibiotic resistant bacteria extended spectrum beta lactamase esbl and carbapenem resistant cre e coli and vancomycin resistant enterococci vre other parameters of importance such as nutrients cod turbidity colour ph and residual iron were also analysed si table s4 charge dosage cd and charge dosage rate cdr were selected as the main process control parameters for the iron dosage directly linked to the electrolysis time and current intensity respectively ghernaout et al 2019 van genuchten et al 2017 delaire et al 2015 amrose et al 2013 gu et al 2009 cd is defined as the total electric charge per unit volume applied to a given water sample while cdr is defined as the speed of application of electric charge charge dosage per unit time in this way cd c l represents the total dose of current while cdr c l min represents the current dosing speed the influence of cd and cdr in the microbial removal of municipal secondary effluents using fe ec is central to this research 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling and selection of microbial indicators prior to the beginning of the ec experiments and in order to collect data on the expected background levels on pathogenic indicator organisms and arb in secondary effluents a six month sampling campaign june dec 2018 was conducted in a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp from the netherlands this facility is of the activated sludge type with primary and secondary treatment and no disinfection grab samples from raw sewage and secondary effluent were collected approximately every two weeks and screened for diverse indicators namely e coli enterococci extended spectrum betalactamase producing e coli esble carbapenemase producing e coli cre vancomycin resistant enterococci vre c perfringens spores and somatic coliphages the premise underlying such selection was to cover bacterial viral and protozoan indicators as well as arb the screening was culture based using selective agar medium for each one of the aforementioned indicators this microbial toolkit is described in further detail in supporting information si table s1 2 2 laboratory setup parallel experiments in cylindrical glass beakers 0 5 l for synthetic effluents and 1 l for real effluents were conducted in the laboratory as depicted in fig 1 the dual power source was a 30v 3a tenma 72 10500 bench dc power supply connected with crocodile clip cables to two s235 steel plates maximum percentages 0 14 carbon 0 10 silicium 0 80 manganese 0 025 phosphorous 0 015 sulphur 0 010 nitrogen 0 20 copper and 0 080 aluminium dimensions of the steel plates were 6cm x 4cm of which 4cm x 4cm were submerged 2cm emerging to connect the clip cables being polished with coarse and fine sand paper before each use the plates were mounted in the end of a plastic tube with carved parallel slots ensuring the plates remained parallel and spaced approximately 1cm as described elsewhere heffron et al 2019b anfruns estrada et al 2017 ndjomgoue yossa et al 2015 merzouk et al 2009 the beakers were mounted on identical labnico l23 magnetic stirrers and fitted with ptfe coated bars for stirring purposes during each individual experiment only two process control parameters were varied namely cd and cdr by controlling the electrolysis time and the supplied amperage respectively these parameter combinations were selected beforehand for each experiment stirring was provided by the magnetic stirrers and the speed was set to 100rpm for all experiments for each assay after the current was applied the iron plates were removed from the beaker and the latter was covered with aluminium foil to prevent the entry of dust particles were left to settle overnight as reported by delaire et al 2016 delaire et al 2015 after which the supernatant was carefully harvested with the use of a sterile 50ml serological pipette supernatant was collected from the surface until only a 1 2cm layer of water over the sediments was left the harvesting procedure was conducted carefully in order not to generate ripples that could disturb the settled particles the collected supernatant was transitorily deposited in a clean container and used immediately for microbiological and physical chemical characterization 2 3 synthetic and real secondary effluents the formula for the synthetic secondary effluent was based on the specifications from the organisation for economic co operation and development guidelines oecd 2001 and then adjusted based on a preceding water sampling campaign at the wwtp based on these samples readily biodegradable cod was replaced by less degradable compounds as expected in secondary effluents yeast extract was replaced by starch and peptone was replaced by microcrystaline cellulose which also provided particulates the nitrogen and phosphorous sources urea and dipotassium phosphate respectively were adjusted following the same principle sodium chloride was increased in order to provide a conductivity of approximately 1000μs cm similar to that of the grab samples collected from the municipal wwtp adopting this composition as the baseline two variants were produced one medium with higher nutrients than the baseline hnm the other with lower half the level of nutrients lnm table 1 two non pathogenic organisms were used to spike the synthetic effluents namely e coli wr1 nctc 13167 and somatic coliphage φx174 atcc 13706 b1 bacterial and viral indicators respectively it is worth noting that experiments were conducted either with e coli or with coliphage φx174 but not both simultaneously to prevent e coli from being infected by the coliphage e coli wr1 was propagated in tygb broth for 3h at 37 c to concentrations of approximately 2 108cfu ml while phage φx174 was propagated following the iso 10705 2 2000 method to concentrations of approximately 1 1012pfu ml e coli wr1 and φx174 were dosed into the test liquid at initial concentrations of approximately 1 105 cfu pfu l in order to match the concentrations in the real secondary effluent detected during the sampling campaign experiments involving real secondary effluents were conducted with unaltered grab samples 20 30l collected downstream from the secondary settlers of the aforementioned wwtp during the months of may june 2019 all assays on these samples were performed immediately upon arrival in the laboratory during the same day of collection the complete physical chemical characteristics of these samples can be observed in si table s2 2 4 operational fe ec parameters fe ec experiments conducted on the spiked synthetic secondary effluents and real secondary effluents followed the configurations of cd and cdr described in table 2 for synthetic medium conditions apply for both kinds of effluent hnm and lnm and for both spiked indicators e coli wr1 and somatic coliphage φx174 all fe ec experiments with synthetic effluent were performed in 0 5l beakers equipped with iron electrodes as described in 2 2 synthetic medium was freshly prepared every day before the assays experiments using real secondary effluent were conducted in 1l beakers using e coli esbl e coli enterococci vre somatic coliphages and c perfringens spores as indicators the experiments described in this section were conducted on four different days and hence under slightly different real secondary effluent qualities the characteristics of the real secondary effluent and the scheduling for the different days and microbial groups can be found under si tables s2 and s3 the theoretically dosed iron concentration fetheo was calculated according to faraday s law si 2 5 analytical methods microbiological screening and quantification was performed either by spread plate method or by membrane filtration according to apha standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 23rd edition depending on the expected microbial load of the sample the specific culture media used for each indicator is detailed in si table s1 screening of somatic coliphages was performed by pour plate technique following iso 10705 2 analysis of ions such as no2 no3 2 nh4 po4 3 and cl in filtered water samples was carried out with metrohm 881 basic ic plus and 883 compact ic pro ion chromatography for the analysis of total nitrogen spectroquant nitrogen cell test were used with digestion at 120 c for 1h followed by reading in a spectroquant nova60 photometer merck germany total iron fe 2 fe 3 was measured using spectroquant iron cell test 1 50mgfe l read in the aforementioned spectroquant nova60 merck germany photometer cod analysis was performed using hach lange test kits lck314 15 150mgo2 l with 2h digestion at 148 c and reading in a hach dr3900 spectrophotometer total suspended solids analysis of samples was carried out according to apha standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 23rd edition turbidity was measured using turb 430ir multimeter colour was analysed in both unfiltered and filtered samples using uv vis spectrophotometer at a 410nm wavelength 2 6 methodology for fe ec cost estimation simplified operational cost estimates for each individual fe ec experiment were performed considering as inputs the consumed electric power and metallic iron as for 2019 average energy cost in the netherlands for a medium size consumer 0 0679 kwh eurostat 2019 and the steel s235 cost 0 21 kg meps international ltd 2019 for a given fe ec experiment in which u is the applied voltage v i is the current intensity ma t is the treatment time h and v is the volume of the cell m3 then the consumed power can be estimated as 1 p k w h m 3 u i t v then the operational cost for each particular experiment is determined by the amount of consumed power and the amount of dosed iron described in si faraday s equation multiplied by their respective unit costs 2 cost m 3 p kw h m 3 0 0679 kwh m fe kg 0 21 kg 2 7 data analysis data series of somatic coliphage and e coli attenuation in synthetic effluents was analysed with the statistical test anova analysis of variance in order to determine if cdr introduced significant logarithmic removal variations for the different cds assayed in this case the obtained data was comprised by duplicate microbial sampling in duplicate assays n 4 for real effluent samples obtained data was comprised by duplicate microbial samples in single assays n 2 for microbial indicators presenting removal stagnation tukey s honest significance range test was used to verify the so called removal plateau faradaic efficiency determination in real effluent experiments was determined by the use of the least square function approximation 3 results 3 1 microbial indicators in raw sewage and secondary effluent the average concentrations of target microbial indicators in the wwtp influent were found in the 1 105 1 108cfu l or pfu l range while for the effluent average values were between 1 102 and 1 105cfu l or pfu l the observed 2 3log10 removal is typical for activate sludge based treatment systems hata et al 2013 de luca et al 2013 fu et al 2010 tanji et al 2002 rose et al 1996 concentrations of bacterial indicators e coli and enterococci exceeded that of esble and vre by 2 3log10 in both influent and effluent indicating that arb were present in lower numbers fig 2 also the removal of esble and vre by secondary treatment was comparable to that of e coli and enterococci the levels of the selected indicators in the wwtp influent and effluent streams were in line with published literature schmitt et al 2017 karon et al 2016 harwood et al 2005 lodder de roda husman 2005 noble et al 2004 hot et al 2003 cetinkaya et al 2000 lasobras et al 1999 gantzer et al 1998 therefore the wwtp was selected as source of real wastewater for further laboratory experiments of particular interest were the levels of e coli and somatic coliphages in the effluent approximately 1 105cfu l and 1 104pfu l respectively as these were used to determine the spike concentration values for e coli wr1 and somatic coliphage φx174 in the synthetic effluent during fe ec experiments section 2 3 3 2 e coli wr1 and φx174 removal from synthetic effluent experiments assessing the removal of e coli wr1 are shown in fig 3 for both synthetic water types removal of e coli wr1 increased gradually with increasing cd in the experiments using lnm fig 3a the effect of cdr in the removal appears negligible with no clear pattern for microbial attenuation anova tests conducted for all cds in lnm using cdr as the independent variable produced p values consistently below 0 05 for cds 50c l meaning that although for a given cd 50c l removal variations seem unimportant in operational terms 0 5log the influence of cdr in removal is statistically present in the experiments using hnm fig 3b similar anova tests were conducted once again producing for cds 50c l p values below 0 05 meaning that the influence of cdr in removal is statistically significant with greater removal values associated to lower cdrs obtained e coli removal using hnm was lower than with lnm reaching 4 9log10 hence suggesting that the presence of higher nutrient concentration negatively affected e coli removal somatic coliphage φx174 attenuation during lnm experiments fig 4 a and hnm experiments fig 4b displayed in qualitative terms a very similar behaviour removal being 1log10 in the 10 75c l range without any significant variation and levelling off at 150 200c l reaching a plateau of 3 0 4 0log10 removal anova tests conducted for all cds in both water matrices using cdr as the independent variable produced for all cases p values above 0 05 meaning that for somatic coliphages the influence of cdr in removal is statistically insignificant throughout the whole range of dosed charge irrespective of the considered water matrix for the aforementioned plateaus in removal observable at 150c l and 200c l tukey tests were performed taking all 16 bars comprising both plateaus as independent variables no combination of 2 bars yielded a tukey p value 0 05 meaning that all 16 bars constitute the same plateau hence the concentration of nutrients was not found to affect the response of coliphages to the iron dosing speed cdr nor to the value of the maximum removal plateau 3 3 microbial and physical chemical attenuation in real effluents following the experiments using spiked synthetic secondary effluent real secondary effluent from the wwtp was assayed two cdrs 7 2 and 36c l min in combination with four different cds 50 100 200 and 400c l were assayed for all experiments here described a single assay was conducted in which duplicate samples were screened for microbial indicators the results for e coli and esbl e coli are depicted in fig 5 the removal was found to increase with increasing cd for both assayed cdrs e coli removal spanned from 0 5log10 at cd 50c l to a maximum of 3 7log10 at 400c l this is considerably lower than the results obtained for e coli in synthetic effluent since removals of 5 4log10 were achieved using half of the iron dose 200c l cdr showed a significant effect on e coli attenuation with removal rates of 3 7log10 and 2 4log10 at 7 2 and 36c l min respectively anova p values between same cds and either cdr 0 05 for 50 100 and 200c l a similar behaviour was observed during fe ec experiments with esbl e coli with increasing removal following increases in cd and favoured by the lower cdr of 7 2c l min over 36c l min minimum removal of 0 2log10 was observed for 50c l while a maximum surpassing 2 6log10 was estimated for 400c l it is noteworthy that experiments with cd 200 and 400c l involving esbl e coli achieved removal rates high enough to hinder detection through culture based methods meaning that the filtered samples were below the limit of detection lod for these experiments the minimum removal efficiency for esbl e coli was calculated on a mathematical basis considering the method appreciation of 1cfu and the filtered volume in each case from a comparison perspective obtained esbl e coli removal under 7 2c l min was lower than that of sensitive e coli anova p values 0 05 while for 36c l min removal was equal for 50c l anova p value 0 2 but lower for 100c l anova p value 0 05 this suggests that sensitive e coli is a conservative indicator for esbl e coli since sensitive e coli is removed equally or less than esbl e coli the fact that esbl e coli was removed below lod for cd 200 and 400c l while sensitive e coli was not should not be misread as esbl ecoli being better removed since concentrations of esbl e coli were 3 orders of magnitude lower than sensitive e coli in the real secondary effluent samples as depicted in fig 2 for enterococci and vre fig 6 removal also increased with cd for both cdrs enterococci removal spanned from 0 4log10 for cd of 50c l to a maximum of 3 6log10 at 400c l with attenuation of enterococci being very similar to that of e coli fig 5 cdr also showed a major effect on enterococci attenuation with removal rates at 7 2c l min being up to 0 9log10 higher than those at 36 0c l min anova p values between same cds and either cdr 0 05 for all cds regarding vre attenuation levels were in the same range as those of esbl e coli with a minimum of 0 3log10 achieved at 50c l 36 0c l min and a maximum exceeding 2 5log10 at 200 400c l 7 2c l min respectively vre removal for 200 and 400c l at 7 2c l min and 400c l at 36c l min were also estimated minimum values since the resulting concentration for these experiments was below lod enterococci and vre behave in a very similar way with vre being removed in almost identical ratios to that of sensitive enterococci at least for the samples with concentrations above lod anova p values 0 05 for both cdrs this suggests that removal of enterococci can be used as a proxy for removal of vre due to the observed similarities in their attenuation patterns c perfringens spores showed the most complex behaviour under fe ec fig 7 from a cd perspective removal increased with cd yet appeared to stagnate under 200 and 400c l reaching over 2log10 anova test between the 7 2 and 36c l min series revealed no considerable statistical difference between them indicating that cdr plays no major role in c perfringens spore removal while tukey test indicated two statistically different groups namely the 50c l samples and the 100 200 and 400c l samples confirming the existence of the removal stagnation this behaviour was not observed for any other indicator organism in this study for somatic coliphages removal below 1log10 was observed for the three lower cds assayed 50 100 and 200c l yet increasing to over 2log10 for 400c l under both cdrs cdr seems to play a less significant role for this indicator compared to bacteria with no major difference between 7 2 and 36c l min in terms of achieved removal anova p values 0 05 3 4 nutrient removal in synthetic and real effluents together with the removal of microbial indicators po4 3 cod and tn removal was also measured for each of the samples under each configuration of cd and cdr in either synthetic or real effluent experiments for synthetic hnm and lnm experiments po4 3 removal increased rapidly with increasing cd to values below lod 98 removal while tn removal displayed a decreasing trend with increasing cd for all cdrs si figure s1 and s2 in real secondary effluents fig 8 removal of po4 3 was high dropping from 1 50mg l to values below detection with associated removal rates above 99 cod removal reached 30 40 for the higher cds in particular for cdr of 36c l min while tn achieved a maximum removal of 15 4 for cd 200c l and cdr 36c l min the influence of cdr on phosphate removal was not conclusive since very high removal values were quickly reached irrespective of cdr interestingly cod and tn exhibit higher removal for higher cdr opposite of what is observed for most microbial indicators 3 5 cost estimation the operational cost of the fe ec process for the real secondary effluent experiments and their achieved microbial removal for each indicator are shown in table 3 the calculations indicate lower costs at lower cdrs due to a reduced power consumption for all cds operational costs from 0 01 to 0 08 m3 were obtained for the experiments using real secondary effluent under a cdr of 7 2c l min while for cdr of 36c l min estimations range from 0 03 to 0 24 m3 it is worth noting that lower cdrs produce better outcomes in terms of microbial removal and also result in lower operational costs due to lower required operational voltage from these estimates although the iron electrode cost is the same for both scenarios the power cost is the most important factor in the total operating cost with an impact of about 70 for cdr of 7 2c l min and 90 for cdr of 36c l min for the experimental conditions explored in this research the combination that produced the best outcome from a microbial perspective was cd 400c l and cdr 7 2c l min involving an associated cost of 0 082 m3 faradaic efficiencies during real secondary effluent assays were calculated using least square method with reporting values of 113 for cdr of 7 2c l min and 114 for 36 0c l min si figure s3 4 discussion 4 1 effect of water matrix on removal efficiencies the present study confirms the influence of water matrix i e synthetic versus real secondary effluent for bacteria and virus indicator removal by ec as well as nutrient removal in real secondary effluents e coli removal was 1 2log10 lower than that observed for e coli in synthetic effluents even when the dosage of iron was doubled similar observations were made regarding phage φx174 with removal also dropping by 1 2log10 in real secondary effluents although the response obtained with synthetic and real secondary effluent was similar in qualitative terms removal obtained for e coli and phage φx174 still differs by orders of magnitude it was hypothesised that the complexity of the water matrix from real secondary effluents and its higher concentration of organic matter iron scavenging anions and complexation agents such as phosphates citrates carbonates and sulphates are responsible for substantially reduced coagulant generation or microbial removals coinciding with the observations of heffron et al 2019a van genuchten et al 2017 and ghernaout et al 2019 these compounds are recognized as responsible for hindering fe 2 oxidation into insoluble fe 3 hence reducing coagulant precipitation and subsequent sweep flocculation c perfringens spore removal was only assessed in real secondary effluents showing similar characteristics both in quantitative and qualitative terms with previous fe ec research conducted in real sewage and secondary effluents by anfruns estrada et al 2017 in the mentioned study they determined the maximum removal of c perfringens spores to 2 79log10 with removal stagnating as the dosage of current progressed this behaviour was also observed in the present research particularly at lower cdrs underlining that increasing cd will not enhance spores removal beyond a certain plateau whatever the cdr in terms of po4 3 cod and tn removal the obtained results are well within range of previous research where high po4 3 removal ranging from 50 to 98 26 to 85 for organics and less than 30 for tn was observed zaleschi et al 2013 ikematsu et al 2006 inan alaydin 2014 lacasa et al 2011 malinovic et al 2016 4 2 microbial attenuation mechanisms removal of all bacterial indicators was in general terms very similar irrespective of their resistance to antibiotics or their gram classification with removal being strongly dependent on the amount and speed of iron dosage similar conclusions are also valid for somatic coliphages although appearing less sensitive to the speed of dosage but do not fully apply for c perfringens spores this evidences a differing response to the fe ec process for each type of microorganism the aim of this research was not to look into the mechanisms of removal for each one yet the body of literature recognizes three pathways for microbial attenuation namely a entrapment or adsorption in the metallic hydroxide flocs and removal by sedimentation b inactivation due to formation of reactive oxygen species ros or disinfectants and c inactivation due to electrical current according to most researchers entrapment seems to be the dominant removal mechanism for bacteria ghernaout et al 2019 delaire et al 2016 delaire et al 2015 mainly due to the affinity of their surface functional groups such as teichoic acids and phospholipids with the ec precipitates these functional groups are found in similar amounts in gram positive and gram negative bacterial cell walls delaire et al 2016 borrok et al 2005 virus removal has been attributed to both iron hydroxide floc entrapment heffron et al 2019a tanneru chellam 2012 and inactivation by either ros or chlorine based oxidants formed by reduction in the anode heffron et al 2019 formation of cl2 was ruled out as a mechanism of disinfection in our experiments since cl concentration was measured by icp ms before and after the application of current and no variations were detected in any of the samples also in line with the findings of delaire et al 2015 and diao et al 2004 inactivation due to the effect of electric current has been the least reported biocidal pathway with the research from jeong et al 2006 giving it a larger relevance at high current densities from 33 to 100ma cm2 it is noteworthy that throughout the experiments conducted in this publication current density never exceeded 20ma cm2 for which this pathway of removal is not regarded as dominant in terms of cdr in promoting either of the aforementioned mitigation mechanism heffron et al 2019b correlated ferrous iron oxidation rate and bacteriophage removal concluding that fast oxidation of fe 2 leads to a shorter exposure time and hence poorer contact between the phages and the reactive iron species yielding a less important disinfection in other words implying that ros generated during ferrous iron oxidation are a major contributor in the disinfection during fe ec with the effect of these being stronger for slowly occurring oxidations however the selected overnight settling for all experiments likely influences oxygen diffusion into the effluent promoting the slow oxidation of ferrous iron hence potentially impacting in the removal besides from it having a reduced practicality on a municipal scale the present research observed for both synthetic and real effluents an increasing removal efficiency for bacterial and viral indicators under decreasing cdrs less prominent for viruses even when the amount of dosed iron and coagulation products was identical although this study did not look into the mechanistic aspects of the microbial removal via fe ec the observed dependency of microbial removal on cdr suggests that the production of ros could in fact be a contributing factor during fe ec the aerobic oxidation of fe 2 released during the anode oxidation produces a cascade of reactive species which includes superoxide ion o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh van genuchten peña 2017 hug leupin 2003 rush et al 1990 all of which are known to have disinfectant properties tanneru chellam 2012 jeong et al 2006 elena pulido 2005 this implies that microbial removal by fe ec could be in fact a combination of physical separation and chemical inactivation and not just an adsorption sedimentation phenomenon it could also explain why spores dormant bacterial structures highly resistant to chemical attack are significantly less affected than bacterial indicators by varying cd or cdr 4 3 fe ec as a disinfection technology when compared against typical wastewater disinfection technologies in terms of pathogen removal fe ec performs in a similar way to that of conventional alternatives such as chlorination ozonation or uv light typical removal values for chlorination range from 2 6log10 for bacteria 0 4log10 for viruses and 0 3log10 for protozoa disinfection values for ozonation include 2 6log10 for bacteria 3 6log10 for viruses and 2log10 for protozoa for uv expected performance is 2 4log10 for bacteria 1 3log10 for viruses and 2 3log10 for protozoa collivignarelli et al 2018 usepa 2012 bitton 2005 usepa 2003 rose et al 1996 who 1989 this means that fe ec can in fact be regarded as an unconventional chemical addition free disinfection technology based on comparable performance to other classically accepted disinfection methods abou elela et al 2012 provides reference o m cost values for municipal secondary effluent disinfection using chlorine 32mg l 15 minutes contact time ozone 15mg l 15 minutes contact time and uv irradiation 164mws cm2 15 minutes contact time cost estimates are 0 024 m3 for chlorine 0 030 m3 for ozone and 0 044 m3 for uv irradiation for the lowest studied cdr of this research 7 2c l min the obtained operation costs 0 01 to 0 082 m3 fall within comparable range to those obtained by abou elela et al 2012 although a proper comparison should be made on a basis of equal microbial inactivation 5 conclusions low voltage fe ec is a promising technology for microbial removal in secondary municipal effluents with log10 removal comparable to those achieved by conventional disinfection methods such as chlorination uv or ozonation for real secondary effluents achieved bacterial removal exceeded 3 5log10 arb removal reached or exceeded 2 5log10 spores were removed between 2 3log10 and virus elimination reached or exceeded 2 3log10 in synthetic secondary effluent bacterial and virus log10 removal was consistently higher with 1 2 orders of magnitude microbial removal was found to increase with cd while decreasing cdrs showed a higher mitigation of bacteria yet no significant effect on viruses or spores the latter showed a different removal trend with elimination reaching a plateau for medium high cds this being slightly higher for higher cdrs sensitive e coli and enterococci appear as conservative indicators for esbl e coli and vre respectively although it must be noted that arb determination was limited by relatively low concentrations in the secondary effluent iron plates and electric consumption were the main components contributing to the costs with the latter having the largest impact 70 90 for the assayed conditions for the most favourable microbial removal set of conditions cd 400c l cdr 7 2c l min the estimated unit cost of the process is 0 08 m3 within comparable range to other conventional disinfection technologies as chlorine uv or ozone besides from

17413,in this paper we analyse the feasibility of low voltage iron electrocoagulation as a means of municipal secondary effluent treatment with a focus on removal of microbial indicators antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and nutrients a laboratory scale batch unit equipped with iron electrodes was used on synthetic and real secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant synthetic secondary effluent was separately assayed with spiked escherichia coli wr1 and with bacteriophage φx174 while real effluent samples were screened before and after treatment for e coli extended spectrum betalactamase producing e coli enterococci vancomycin resistant enterococci clostridium perfringens spores and somatic coliphages charge dosage cd and charge dosage rate cdr were used as the main process control parameters experiments with synthetic secondary effluent showed 4log10 and 5log10 removal for phage φx174 and for e coli wr1 respectively in real effluents bacterial indicator removal exceeded 3 5log10 arb were removed below detection limit 2 5log10 virus removal reached 2 3log10 and c perfringens spore removal exceeded 2 5log10 experiments in both real and synthetic wastewater showed that bacterial removal increased with increasing cd and decreasing cdr virus removal increased with increasing cd but was irresponsive to cdr c perfringens spore removal increased with increasing cd yet reached a removal plateau being also irresponsive to cdr phosphate removal exceeded 99 while total nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand removal were below 15 and 58 respectively operational cost estimates were made for power and iron plate consumption and were found to be in the range of 0 01 to 0 24 m3 for the different assayed configurations in conclusion low voltage fe ec is a promising technology for pathogen reduction of secondary municipal effluents with log10 removals comparable to those achieved by conventional disinfection methods such as chlorination uv or ozonation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antimicrobial resistance electrocoagulation iron pathogens secondary effluent water reclamation 1 introduction at present one third of the world s population lives in water stressed countries and by 2025 the figure is expected to rise to two thirds elimelech 2006 discharge of untreated wastewater into the water sources can degrade water quality increasing the risk to human health and ecosystem degradation in this context water reuse is often recognised as a solution with great potential in reducing the gap between availability and demand agriculture is currently the largest consumer of reclaimed water providing an all year round water source with an estimate 200 million farmers worldwide using either raw or treated wastewater for irrigation of over 2000 km2 qadir et al 2007 raschid sally jayakody 2008 constituting roughly 8 of all irrigated land in the planet most of which happens in asia howell 2001 the united nations agenda for sustainable development goals targets improvement in water quality by reducing pollution eliminating the discharge of polluted waters halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and increasing safe water reuse globally anfruns estrada et al 2017 despite reclamation being an attractive concept municipal wastewater harbours a wide range of enteric pathogens such as virus bacteria protozoa parasitic worms and eggs and its re use calls for careful management of its associated health risks such risks depend on the type of water to be recycled the type and concentration of pathogens and in particular the ability of such pathogens to survive treatment as well as the type of exposure of susceptible community members to such waters the required level of pathogen reduction in reclaimed water depends on the nature of reuse application and potential for human exposure to water in this context the feasibility of iron 0 electrocoagulation fe ec for microbial attenuation in municipal secondary effluents was explored previous studies have demonstrated the effect of fe ec in the removal of a wide range of microorganisms from bacteria to viruses in different water matrices mainly for drinking water applications ghernaout et al 2019 heffron et al 2019a heffron et al 2019c delaire 2016 the application of fe ec for the reclamation of secondary municipal effluents provides interesting advantages since their higher conductivities reduce electrolysis cost plus residual iron is a lesser concern than for drinking water in spite of this only few fe ec studies focussed on real secondary effluents ding et al 2017 anfruns estrada et al 2017 llanos et al 2014 and to the best of our knowledge none investigated the removal of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb the main objective of the present research is to evaluate the performance of low voltage fe ec during the treatment of municipal secondary effluents for reclamation purposes in the removal of microbial pathogen indicators escherichia coli enterococci somatic coliphages and clostridium perfringens spores and antibiotic resistant bacteria extended spectrum beta lactamase esbl and carbapenem resistant cre e coli and vancomycin resistant enterococci vre other parameters of importance such as nutrients cod turbidity colour ph and residual iron were also analysed si table s4 charge dosage cd and charge dosage rate cdr were selected as the main process control parameters for the iron dosage directly linked to the electrolysis time and current intensity respectively ghernaout et al 2019 van genuchten et al 2017 delaire et al 2015 amrose et al 2013 gu et al 2009 cd is defined as the total electric charge per unit volume applied to a given water sample while cdr is defined as the speed of application of electric charge charge dosage per unit time in this way cd c l represents the total dose of current while cdr c l min represents the current dosing speed the influence of cd and cdr in the microbial removal of municipal secondary effluents using fe ec is central to this research 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling and selection of microbial indicators prior to the beginning of the ec experiments and in order to collect data on the expected background levels on pathogenic indicator organisms and arb in secondary effluents a six month sampling campaign june dec 2018 was conducted in a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp from the netherlands this facility is of the activated sludge type with primary and secondary treatment and no disinfection grab samples from raw sewage and secondary effluent were collected approximately every two weeks and screened for diverse indicators namely e coli enterococci extended spectrum betalactamase producing e coli esble carbapenemase producing e coli cre vancomycin resistant enterococci vre c perfringens spores and somatic coliphages the premise underlying such selection was to cover bacterial viral and protozoan indicators as well as arb the screening was culture based using selective agar medium for each one of the aforementioned indicators this microbial toolkit is described in further detail in supporting information si table s1 2 2 laboratory setup parallel experiments in cylindrical glass beakers 0 5 l for synthetic effluents and 1 l for real effluents were conducted in the laboratory as depicted in fig 1 the dual power source was a 30v 3a tenma 72 10500 bench dc power supply connected with crocodile clip cables to two s235 steel plates maximum percentages 0 14 carbon 0 10 silicium 0 80 manganese 0 025 phosphorous 0 015 sulphur 0 010 nitrogen 0 20 copper and 0 080 aluminium dimensions of the steel plates were 6cm x 4cm of which 4cm x 4cm were submerged 2cm emerging to connect the clip cables being polished with coarse and fine sand paper before each use the plates were mounted in the end of a plastic tube with carved parallel slots ensuring the plates remained parallel and spaced approximately 1cm as described elsewhere heffron et al 2019b anfruns estrada et al 2017 ndjomgoue yossa et al 2015 merzouk et al 2009 the beakers were mounted on identical labnico l23 magnetic stirrers and fitted with ptfe coated bars for stirring purposes during each individual experiment only two process control parameters were varied namely cd and cdr by controlling the electrolysis time and the supplied amperage respectively these parameter combinations were selected beforehand for each experiment stirring was provided by the magnetic stirrers and the speed was set to 100rpm for all experiments for each assay after the current was applied the iron plates were removed from the beaker and the latter was covered with aluminium foil to prevent the entry of dust particles were left to settle overnight as reported by delaire et al 2016 delaire et al 2015 after which the supernatant was carefully harvested with the use of a sterile 50ml serological pipette supernatant was collected from the surface until only a 1 2cm layer of water over the sediments was left the harvesting procedure was conducted carefully in order not to generate ripples that could disturb the settled particles the collected supernatant was transitorily deposited in a clean container and used immediately for microbiological and physical chemical characterization 2 3 synthetic and real secondary effluents the formula for the synthetic secondary effluent was based on the specifications from the organisation for economic co operation and development guidelines oecd 2001 and then adjusted based on a preceding water sampling campaign at the wwtp based on these samples readily biodegradable cod was replaced by less degradable compounds as expected in secondary effluents yeast extract was replaced by starch and peptone was replaced by microcrystaline cellulose which also provided particulates the nitrogen and phosphorous sources urea and dipotassium phosphate respectively were adjusted following the same principle sodium chloride was increased in order to provide a conductivity of approximately 1000μs cm similar to that of the grab samples collected from the municipal wwtp adopting this composition as the baseline two variants were produced one medium with higher nutrients than the baseline hnm the other with lower half the level of nutrients lnm table 1 two non pathogenic organisms were used to spike the synthetic effluents namely e coli wr1 nctc 13167 and somatic coliphage φx174 atcc 13706 b1 bacterial and viral indicators respectively it is worth noting that experiments were conducted either with e coli or with coliphage φx174 but not both simultaneously to prevent e coli from being infected by the coliphage e coli wr1 was propagated in tygb broth for 3h at 37 c to concentrations of approximately 2 108cfu ml while phage φx174 was propagated following the iso 10705 2 2000 method to concentrations of approximately 1 1012pfu ml e coli wr1 and φx174 were dosed into the test liquid at initial concentrations of approximately 1 105 cfu pfu l in order to match the concentrations in the real secondary effluent detected during the sampling campaign experiments involving real secondary effluents were conducted with unaltered grab samples 20 30l collected downstream from the secondary settlers of the aforementioned wwtp during the months of may june 2019 all assays on these samples were performed immediately upon arrival in the laboratory during the same day of collection the complete physical chemical characteristics of these samples can be observed in si table s2 2 4 operational fe ec parameters fe ec experiments conducted on the spiked synthetic secondary effluents and real secondary effluents followed the configurations of cd and cdr described in table 2 for synthetic medium conditions apply for both kinds of effluent hnm and lnm and for both spiked indicators e coli wr1 and somatic coliphage φx174 all fe ec experiments with synthetic effluent were performed in 0 5l beakers equipped with iron electrodes as described in 2 2 synthetic medium was freshly prepared every day before the assays experiments using real secondary effluent were conducted in 1l beakers using e coli esbl e coli enterococci vre somatic coliphages and c perfringens spores as indicators the experiments described in this section were conducted on four different days and hence under slightly different real secondary effluent qualities the characteristics of the real secondary effluent and the scheduling for the different days and microbial groups can be found under si tables s2 and s3 the theoretically dosed iron concentration fetheo was calculated according to faraday s law si 2 5 analytical methods microbiological screening and quantification was performed either by spread plate method or by membrane filtration according to apha standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 23rd edition depending on the expected microbial load of the sample the specific culture media used for each indicator is detailed in si table s1 screening of somatic coliphages was performed by pour plate technique following iso 10705 2 analysis of ions such as no2 no3 2 nh4 po4 3 and cl in filtered water samples was carried out with metrohm 881 basic ic plus and 883 compact ic pro ion chromatography for the analysis of total nitrogen spectroquant nitrogen cell test were used with digestion at 120 c for 1h followed by reading in a spectroquant nova60 photometer merck germany total iron fe 2 fe 3 was measured using spectroquant iron cell test 1 50mgfe l read in the aforementioned spectroquant nova60 merck germany photometer cod analysis was performed using hach lange test kits lck314 15 150mgo2 l with 2h digestion at 148 c and reading in a hach dr3900 spectrophotometer total suspended solids analysis of samples was carried out according to apha standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 23rd edition turbidity was measured using turb 430ir multimeter colour was analysed in both unfiltered and filtered samples using uv vis spectrophotometer at a 410nm wavelength 2 6 methodology for fe ec cost estimation simplified operational cost estimates for each individual fe ec experiment were performed considering as inputs the consumed electric power and metallic iron as for 2019 average energy cost in the netherlands for a medium size consumer 0 0679 kwh eurostat 2019 and the steel s235 cost 0 21 kg meps international ltd 2019 for a given fe ec experiment in which u is the applied voltage v i is the current intensity ma t is the treatment time h and v is the volume of the cell m3 then the consumed power can be estimated as 1 p k w h m 3 u i t v then the operational cost for each particular experiment is determined by the amount of consumed power and the amount of dosed iron described in si faraday s equation multiplied by their respective unit costs 2 cost m 3 p kw h m 3 0 0679 kwh m fe kg 0 21 kg 2 7 data analysis data series of somatic coliphage and e coli attenuation in synthetic effluents was analysed with the statistical test anova analysis of variance in order to determine if cdr introduced significant logarithmic removal variations for the different cds assayed in this case the obtained data was comprised by duplicate microbial sampling in duplicate assays n 4 for real effluent samples obtained data was comprised by duplicate microbial samples in single assays n 2 for microbial indicators presenting removal stagnation tukey s honest significance range test was used to verify the so called removal plateau faradaic efficiency determination in real effluent experiments was determined by the use of the least square function approximation 3 results 3 1 microbial indicators in raw sewage and secondary effluent the average concentrations of target microbial indicators in the wwtp influent were found in the 1 105 1 108cfu l or pfu l range while for the effluent average values were between 1 102 and 1 105cfu l or pfu l the observed 2 3log10 removal is typical for activate sludge based treatment systems hata et al 2013 de luca et al 2013 fu et al 2010 tanji et al 2002 rose et al 1996 concentrations of bacterial indicators e coli and enterococci exceeded that of esble and vre by 2 3log10 in both influent and effluent indicating that arb were present in lower numbers fig 2 also the removal of esble and vre by secondary treatment was comparable to that of e coli and enterococci the levels of the selected indicators in the wwtp influent and effluent streams were in line with published literature schmitt et al 2017 karon et al 2016 harwood et al 2005 lodder de roda husman 2005 noble et al 2004 hot et al 2003 cetinkaya et al 2000 lasobras et al 1999 gantzer et al 1998 therefore the wwtp was selected as source of real wastewater for further laboratory experiments of particular interest were the levels of e coli and somatic coliphages in the effluent approximately 1 105cfu l and 1 104pfu l respectively as these were used to determine the spike concentration values for e coli wr1 and somatic coliphage φx174 in the synthetic effluent during fe ec experiments section 2 3 3 2 e coli wr1 and φx174 removal from synthetic effluent experiments assessing the removal of e coli wr1 are shown in fig 3 for both synthetic water types removal of e coli wr1 increased gradually with increasing cd in the experiments using lnm fig 3a the effect of cdr in the removal appears negligible with no clear pattern for microbial attenuation anova tests conducted for all cds in lnm using cdr as the independent variable produced p values consistently below 0 05 for cds 50c l meaning that although for a given cd 50c l removal variations seem unimportant in operational terms 0 5log the influence of cdr in removal is statistically present in the experiments using hnm fig 3b similar anova tests were conducted once again producing for cds 50c l p values below 0 05 meaning that the influence of cdr in removal is statistically significant with greater removal values associated to lower cdrs obtained e coli removal using hnm was lower than with lnm reaching 4 9log10 hence suggesting that the presence of higher nutrient concentration negatively affected e coli removal somatic coliphage φx174 attenuation during lnm experiments fig 4 a and hnm experiments fig 4b displayed in qualitative terms a very similar behaviour removal being 1log10 in the 10 75c l range without any significant variation and levelling off at 150 200c l reaching a plateau of 3 0 4 0log10 removal anova tests conducted for all cds in both water matrices using cdr as the independent variable produced for all cases p values above 0 05 meaning that for somatic coliphages the influence of cdr in removal is statistically insignificant throughout the whole range of dosed charge irrespective of the considered water matrix for the aforementioned plateaus in removal observable at 150c l and 200c l tukey tests were performed taking all 16 bars comprising both plateaus as independent variables no combination of 2 bars yielded a tukey p value 0 05 meaning that all 16 bars constitute the same plateau hence the concentration of nutrients was not found to affect the response of coliphages to the iron dosing speed cdr nor to the value of the maximum removal plateau 3 3 microbial and physical chemical attenuation in real effluents following the experiments using spiked synthetic secondary effluent real secondary effluent from the wwtp was assayed two cdrs 7 2 and 36c l min in combination with four different cds 50 100 200 and 400c l were assayed for all experiments here described a single assay was conducted in which duplicate samples were screened for microbial indicators the results for e coli and esbl e coli are depicted in fig 5 the removal was found to increase with increasing cd for both assayed cdrs e coli removal spanned from 0 5log10 at cd 50c l to a maximum of 3 7log10 at 400c l this is considerably lower than the results obtained for e coli in synthetic effluent since removals of 5 4log10 were achieved using half of the iron dose 200c l cdr showed a significant effect on e coli attenuation with removal rates of 3 7log10 and 2 4log10 at 7 2 and 36c l min respectively anova p values between same cds and either cdr 0 05 for 50 100 and 200c l a similar behaviour was observed during fe ec experiments with esbl e coli with increasing removal following increases in cd and favoured by the lower cdr of 7 2c l min over 36c l min minimum removal of 0 2log10 was observed for 50c l while a maximum surpassing 2 6log10 was estimated for 400c l it is noteworthy that experiments with cd 200 and 400c l involving esbl e coli achieved removal rates high enough to hinder detection through culture based methods meaning that the filtered samples were below the limit of detection lod for these experiments the minimum removal efficiency for esbl e coli was calculated on a mathematical basis considering the method appreciation of 1cfu and the filtered volume in each case from a comparison perspective obtained esbl e coli removal under 7 2c l min was lower than that of sensitive e coli anova p values 0 05 while for 36c l min removal was equal for 50c l anova p value 0 2 but lower for 100c l anova p value 0 05 this suggests that sensitive e coli is a conservative indicator for esbl e coli since sensitive e coli is removed equally or less than esbl e coli the fact that esbl e coli was removed below lod for cd 200 and 400c l while sensitive e coli was not should not be misread as esbl ecoli being better removed since concentrations of esbl e coli were 3 orders of magnitude lower than sensitive e coli in the real secondary effluent samples as depicted in fig 2 for enterococci and vre fig 6 removal also increased with cd for both cdrs enterococci removal spanned from 0 4log10 for cd of 50c l to a maximum of 3 6log10 at 400c l with attenuation of enterococci being very similar to that of e coli fig 5 cdr also showed a major effect on enterococci attenuation with removal rates at 7 2c l min being up to 0 9log10 higher than those at 36 0c l min anova p values between same cds and either cdr 0 05 for all cds regarding vre attenuation levels were in the same range as those of esbl e coli with a minimum of 0 3log10 achieved at 50c l 36 0c l min and a maximum exceeding 2 5log10 at 200 400c l 7 2c l min respectively vre removal for 200 and 400c l at 7 2c l min and 400c l at 36c l min were also estimated minimum values since the resulting concentration for these experiments was below lod enterococci and vre behave in a very similar way with vre being removed in almost identical ratios to that of sensitive enterococci at least for the samples with concentrations above lod anova p values 0 05 for both cdrs this suggests that removal of enterococci can be used as a proxy for removal of vre due to the observed similarities in their attenuation patterns c perfringens spores showed the most complex behaviour under fe ec fig 7 from a cd perspective removal increased with cd yet appeared to stagnate under 200 and 400c l reaching over 2log10 anova test between the 7 2 and 36c l min series revealed no considerable statistical difference between them indicating that cdr plays no major role in c perfringens spore removal while tukey test indicated two statistically different groups namely the 50c l samples and the 100 200 and 400c l samples confirming the existence of the removal stagnation this behaviour was not observed for any other indicator organism in this study for somatic coliphages removal below 1log10 was observed for the three lower cds assayed 50 100 and 200c l yet increasing to over 2log10 for 400c l under both cdrs cdr seems to play a less significant role for this indicator compared to bacteria with no major difference between 7 2 and 36c l min in terms of achieved removal anova p values 0 05 3 4 nutrient removal in synthetic and real effluents together with the removal of microbial indicators po4 3 cod and tn removal was also measured for each of the samples under each configuration of cd and cdr in either synthetic or real effluent experiments for synthetic hnm and lnm experiments po4 3 removal increased rapidly with increasing cd to values below lod 98 removal while tn removal displayed a decreasing trend with increasing cd for all cdrs si figure s1 and s2 in real secondary effluents fig 8 removal of po4 3 was high dropping from 1 50mg l to values below detection with associated removal rates above 99 cod removal reached 30 40 for the higher cds in particular for cdr of 36c l min while tn achieved a maximum removal of 15 4 for cd 200c l and cdr 36c l min the influence of cdr on phosphate removal was not conclusive since very high removal values were quickly reached irrespective of cdr interestingly cod and tn exhibit higher removal for higher cdr opposite of what is observed for most microbial indicators 3 5 cost estimation the operational cost of the fe ec process for the real secondary effluent experiments and their achieved microbial removal for each indicator are shown in table 3 the calculations indicate lower costs at lower cdrs due to a reduced power consumption for all cds operational costs from 0 01 to 0 08 m3 were obtained for the experiments using real secondary effluent under a cdr of 7 2c l min while for cdr of 36c l min estimations range from 0 03 to 0 24 m3 it is worth noting that lower cdrs produce better outcomes in terms of microbial removal and also result in lower operational costs due to lower required operational voltage from these estimates although the iron electrode cost is the same for both scenarios the power cost is the most important factor in the total operating cost with an impact of about 70 for cdr of 7 2c l min and 90 for cdr of 36c l min for the experimental conditions explored in this research the combination that produced the best outcome from a microbial perspective was cd 400c l and cdr 7 2c l min involving an associated cost of 0 082 m3 faradaic efficiencies during real secondary effluent assays were calculated using least square method with reporting values of 113 for cdr of 7 2c l min and 114 for 36 0c l min si figure s3 4 discussion 4 1 effect of water matrix on removal efficiencies the present study confirms the influence of water matrix i e synthetic versus real secondary effluent for bacteria and virus indicator removal by ec as well as nutrient removal in real secondary effluents e coli removal was 1 2log10 lower than that observed for e coli in synthetic effluents even when the dosage of iron was doubled similar observations were made regarding phage φx174 with removal also dropping by 1 2log10 in real secondary effluents although the response obtained with synthetic and real secondary effluent was similar in qualitative terms removal obtained for e coli and phage φx174 still differs by orders of magnitude it was hypothesised that the complexity of the water matrix from real secondary effluents and its higher concentration of organic matter iron scavenging anions and complexation agents such as phosphates citrates carbonates and sulphates are responsible for substantially reduced coagulant generation or microbial removals coinciding with the observations of heffron et al 2019a van genuchten et al 2017 and ghernaout et al 2019 these compounds are recognized as responsible for hindering fe 2 oxidation into insoluble fe 3 hence reducing coagulant precipitation and subsequent sweep flocculation c perfringens spore removal was only assessed in real secondary effluents showing similar characteristics both in quantitative and qualitative terms with previous fe ec research conducted in real sewage and secondary effluents by anfruns estrada et al 2017 in the mentioned study they determined the maximum removal of c perfringens spores to 2 79log10 with removal stagnating as the dosage of current progressed this behaviour was also observed in the present research particularly at lower cdrs underlining that increasing cd will not enhance spores removal beyond a certain plateau whatever the cdr in terms of po4 3 cod and tn removal the obtained results are well within range of previous research where high po4 3 removal ranging from 50 to 98 26 to 85 for organics and less than 30 for tn was observed zaleschi et al 2013 ikematsu et al 2006 inan alaydin 2014 lacasa et al 2011 malinovic et al 2016 4 2 microbial attenuation mechanisms removal of all bacterial indicators was in general terms very similar irrespective of their resistance to antibiotics or their gram classification with removal being strongly dependent on the amount and speed of iron dosage similar conclusions are also valid for somatic coliphages although appearing less sensitive to the speed of dosage but do not fully apply for c perfringens spores this evidences a differing response to the fe ec process for each type of microorganism the aim of this research was not to look into the mechanisms of removal for each one yet the body of literature recognizes three pathways for microbial attenuation namely a entrapment or adsorption in the metallic hydroxide flocs and removal by sedimentation b inactivation due to formation of reactive oxygen species ros or disinfectants and c inactivation due to electrical current according to most researchers entrapment seems to be the dominant removal mechanism for bacteria ghernaout et al 2019 delaire et al 2016 delaire et al 2015 mainly due to the affinity of their surface functional groups such as teichoic acids and phospholipids with the ec precipitates these functional groups are found in similar amounts in gram positive and gram negative bacterial cell walls delaire et al 2016 borrok et al 2005 virus removal has been attributed to both iron hydroxide floc entrapment heffron et al 2019a tanneru chellam 2012 and inactivation by either ros or chlorine based oxidants formed by reduction in the anode heffron et al 2019 formation of cl2 was ruled out as a mechanism of disinfection in our experiments since cl concentration was measured by icp ms before and after the application of current and no variations were detected in any of the samples also in line with the findings of delaire et al 2015 and diao et al 2004 inactivation due to the effect of electric current has been the least reported biocidal pathway with the research from jeong et al 2006 giving it a larger relevance at high current densities from 33 to 100ma cm2 it is noteworthy that throughout the experiments conducted in this publication current density never exceeded 20ma cm2 for which this pathway of removal is not regarded as dominant in terms of cdr in promoting either of the aforementioned mitigation mechanism heffron et al 2019b correlated ferrous iron oxidation rate and bacteriophage removal concluding that fast oxidation of fe 2 leads to a shorter exposure time and hence poorer contact between the phages and the reactive iron species yielding a less important disinfection in other words implying that ros generated during ferrous iron oxidation are a major contributor in the disinfection during fe ec with the effect of these being stronger for slowly occurring oxidations however the selected overnight settling for all experiments likely influences oxygen diffusion into the effluent promoting the slow oxidation of ferrous iron hence potentially impacting in the removal besides from it having a reduced practicality on a municipal scale the present research observed for both synthetic and real effluents an increasing removal efficiency for bacterial and viral indicators under decreasing cdrs less prominent for viruses even when the amount of dosed iron and coagulation products was identical although this study did not look into the mechanistic aspects of the microbial removal via fe ec the observed dependency of microbial removal on cdr suggests that the production of ros could in fact be a contributing factor during fe ec the aerobic oxidation of fe 2 released during the anode oxidation produces a cascade of reactive species which includes superoxide ion o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh van genuchten peña 2017 hug leupin 2003 rush et al 1990 all of which are known to have disinfectant properties tanneru chellam 2012 jeong et al 2006 elena pulido 2005 this implies that microbial removal by fe ec could be in fact a combination of physical separation and chemical inactivation and not just an adsorption sedimentation phenomenon it could also explain why spores dormant bacterial structures highly resistant to chemical attack are significantly less affected than bacterial indicators by varying cd or cdr 4 3 fe ec as a disinfection technology when compared against typical wastewater disinfection technologies in terms of pathogen removal fe ec performs in a similar way to that of conventional alternatives such as chlorination ozonation or uv light typical removal values for chlorination range from 2 6log10 for bacteria 0 4log10 for viruses and 0 3log10 for protozoa disinfection values for ozonation include 2 6log10 for bacteria 3 6log10 for viruses and 2log10 for protozoa for uv expected performance is 2 4log10 for bacteria 1 3log10 for viruses and 2 3log10 for protozoa collivignarelli et al 2018 usepa 2012 bitton 2005 usepa 2003 rose et al 1996 who 1989 this means that fe ec can in fact be regarded as an unconventional chemical addition free disinfection technology based on comparable performance to other classically accepted disinfection methods abou elela et al 2012 provides reference o m cost values for municipal secondary effluent disinfection using chlorine 32mg l 15 minutes contact time ozone 15mg l 15 minutes contact time and uv irradiation 164mws cm2 15 minutes contact time cost estimates are 0 024 m3 for chlorine 0 030 m3 for ozone and 0 044 m3 for uv irradiation for the lowest studied cdr of this research 7 2c l min the obtained operation costs 0 01 to 0 082 m3 fall within comparable range to those obtained by abou elela et al 2012 although a proper comparison should be made on a basis of equal microbial inactivation 5 conclusions low voltage fe ec is a promising technology for microbial removal in secondary municipal effluents with log10 removal comparable to those achieved by conventional disinfection methods such as chlorination uv or ozonation for real secondary effluents achieved bacterial removal exceeded 3 5log10 arb removal reached or exceeded 2 5log10 spores were removed between 2 3log10 and virus elimination reached or exceeded 2 3log10 in synthetic secondary effluent bacterial and virus log10 removal was consistently higher with 1 2 orders of magnitude microbial removal was found to increase with cd while decreasing cdrs showed a higher mitigation of bacteria yet no significant effect on viruses or spores the latter showed a different removal trend with elimination reaching a plateau for medium high cds this being slightly higher for higher cdrs sensitive e coli and enterococci appear as conservative indicators for esbl e coli and vre respectively although it must be noted that arb determination was limited by relatively low concentrations in the secondary effluent iron plates and electric consumption were the main components contributing to the costs with the latter having the largest impact 70 90 for the assayed conditions for the most favourable microbial removal set of conditions cd 400c l cdr 7 2c l min the estimated unit cost of the process is 0 08 m3 within comparable range to other conventional disinfection technologies as chlorine uv or ozone besides from

17414,we created a hydrogen based membrane palladium film reactor mpfr by depositing palladium nanoparticles pdnps on hollow fiber membranes via autocatalytic hydrogenation to form a pd film the mpfr was used for hydrodechlorination hdc of 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp hdc performances and mechanisms were systematically evaluated and a continuous flow dechlorination model was established approximately 87 of the input 2 4 dcp was reduced to the end product phenol p while 2 chlorophenol 2 cp was an intermediate but only at 2 selective adsorption of the 2 4 dcp onto the pd film and fast desorption of p facilitated efficient dechlorination modeling results represented well the concentrations of 2 4 dcp and its intermediates it demonstrated three dechlorination pathways the majority of 2 4 dcp was completely dechlorinated to p in an adsorbed state without release of monochlorphenol some 2 4 dcp was degraded to 2 cp that was released and subsequently adsorbed and reduced to p and a small amount was reduced to 4 cp that was released and subsequently adsorbed and reduced to p analysis based on density functional theory suggests that the pathway of full dechlorination was dominant due to its thermodynamically favorable adsorption configuration with both cl atoms bonded to pd this study documents full dechlorination of 2 4 dcp in the mpfr and the interacting roles of adsorption

hdc also known as reductive dechlorination on palladium pd nanoparticles pdnps has emerged as a sustainable alternative that facilitates fast kinetics high efficiency operation under mild conditions

capacity is determined by the h2 permeability in the membranes material and can be controlled by regulating the h2 pressure tang et al 2012 the membranes can be the support and stabilizer for the pdnps zhou et al 2016 that are generated in situ via an autocatalytic reduction of pd ii to metallic palladium pd 0 to form pdnps besson et al 2005 this autocatalytic deposition of pdnps executed in

2013 xu et al 2016a xu et al 2016b zhao et al 2016 existing kinetic models cannot simulate entire hdc process in continuous flow reactors that are used in practical application since stepwise hdc that leads to accumulation of lower cps in the liquid presents a risk for water pollution due to the higher solubilities of the less chlorinated phenols cho et al 2000 it would be meaningful to develop a mathematical model that describes the fate of 2 4 dcp and its dechlorinated products for continuous flow cps transformation pathways can be deduced from the reduction kinetics the over arching objective of this study was to systematically evaluate hdc of 2 4 dcp using a mpfr operated in continuous mode specific objectives were 1 to analyze the content and structural characteristics of the

110 µm inner diameter teijin japan with a total membrane surface area of 54 cm2 the main column contained 32 hollow fiber membranes while the other column contained 10 fibers used as pd film sampling coupons the fibers of the main bundles were glued at both ends and connected to a h2 gas supply while the coupon bundles had only an upper h2 gas supply h2 gas was constantly supplied to fiber bundles at 2 atm absolute pressure adjusted by a pressure regulator and it diffused through the fiber walls in a bubble free manner the maximum h2 delivery capacity 0 37 g h2 m 2 day 1 calculated according to

with n2 gas to eliminate dissolved oxygen do 0 15 mg l 1 the medium was then pumped into the mpfr which was run in batch mode for 2 days to produce a film of pdnps on the fibers pd ii concentrations in solution were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes agilent 720es usa at a wavelength of 340 46 nm the coating process was repeated three times until that a thick pdnps film accumulated on the fibers and at least 99 of the input soluble pd ii was reduced by h2 in each time to examine the pdnps we recorded a powder x ray diffraction xrd pattern using an x pert pro mpd diffractometer with cu kα wavelength 1 54 å 40 kv 55 ma radiation and 0 5 grazing incidence angle an x ray photoelectron spectrum xps thermo escalab 250 usa was used to characterize the pd oxidation state of the pd film a scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss sigma 300 german and a transmission electron microscopy tem jeol jem 2100f japan equipped with an energy dispersive x ray detector edx were used to obtain the morphology characteristics of pdnps immobilized on the fibers 2 4 adsorption experiments equilibrium adsorption experiments was performed after a pd film formed on the fiber surface the mpfr was set to a batch mode to explore the adsorption of 2 4 dcp 2 cp 4 cp or p onto the pd film the h2 supply was disconnected and the liquid medium was replaced by 70 ml of new medium contained 2 4 dcp at desired concentrations 25 55 100 or 200 µm and then 2 4 dcp was replaced by 2 cp 4 cp or p successively at the same concentrations between each experiment the mpfr was rinsed with alcohol and distilled water to remove adsorbed phenols until the solute became undetectable in the rinse water when solute concentrations had reached equilibrium we measured the concentration of the solute in liquid and computed the mass of adsorbed phenols by difference the adsorption capacities of pd film for the phenols could be represented well using the langmuir isotherm 1 q e q 0 c t c t b 1 where q e mmol gcat 1 is the equilibrium adsorption density q 0 mmol gcat 1 and b 1 mmol l 1 are langmuir constants for the maximum adsorption capacity and the affinity concentration respectively and ct is the equilibrium solute concentration mmol l 1 the adsorption kinetics of 2 4 dcp 2 cp 4 cp or p were evaluated in batch experiments with an initial concentration of 200 µm the loss of the solute was represented well by a pseudo second order rate which can be described by its linear form as 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e 1 v 0 t q e where k 2 gcat mmol 1 min 1 is the rate constants of pseudo second order adsorption v 0 was the initial adsorption rate mmol min 1 gcat 1 and qe and qt are amount of the phenols adsorbed onto the pd film mmol gcat 1 at equilibrium and at time t min respectively 2 5 dechlorination experiments experiments for hdc of 2 4 dcp 2 cp and 4 cp were executed after completion of the adsorption experiments before each experiment the mpfr was purged and refilled with influent medium the h2 supply was turned on and the mpfr was shifted to continuous mode with an influent flow rate of 0 265 ml min 1 the influent concentrations of 2 4 dcp 2 cp or 4 cp were set at 25 55 100 or 200 µm respectively for the different experiments 2 6 sampling and analyses we collected liquid samples from the mpfr at preselected time intervals and immediately filtered them through ptfe syringe filters 0 22 µm the concentrations of 2 4 dcp 2 cp 4 cp and p were measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms trace dsq usa equipped with a db 5ms column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 µm film thickness and high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu prominence lc 20a japan equipped with an agilent c18 column 250 4 6 mm and a diode array detector the mobile phase was a mixture of acetonitrile and ultrapure water with 0 1 acetic acid in the volume proportion of 65 35 the flow rate of hplc pump was controlled at 1 0 ml min 1 and the uv detector was set at 190 nm we also collected unfiltered samples to analyze the pd concentration in effluent and digested them by thickish hot mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid before analyzing and no pd ii was detected in liquid samples from adsorption and dechlorination experiments 2 7 mathematical model for hdc we represented the mpfr as continuous stirred tank reactor cstr with

al 2013 xu et al 2016b zhao et al 2016 because the liquid in the reactor was uniformly mixed the solute concentration inside a mpfr was equal to its effluent concentration c i c e substitution of eq 4

the product of the first dechlorination step 2 cp or 4 cp remains adsorbed and rapidly undergoes the second dechlorination step thus neither 2 cp nor 4 cp appears as an intermediate of reaction 10 because previous studies have shown that the dechlorination reactions of cps by pdnps follow pseudo first order kinetics wang et al 2013 xu et al 2016b zhao et al 2016 the corresponding rate

the pd ii was reduced to pd 0 that nucleated on the mpfr s membrane surface and formed a black film having an average pd density of 7 5 g pd m 2 membrane a total of 40 mg pd the xrd spectra of freeze dried sample collected from the fibers figure s3a in si exhibited the four pd 0 peaks 40 1 1 1 1 46 7 2 0 0 68 1 2 2 0 and 82 1 3 1 1 jcpds no 46 1043 pd 0 was further confirmed by xps analysis figure s3b in si with the peaks at 340 7 and 335 5 ev corresponding to the typical 3d3 2 and 3d5 2 respectively zhou et al 2017 the xps spectra also reveals tiny fractions of unreduced na2pdcl4 4 3 and pdo 9 7 on pdnps surfaces because the mpfr was oxygen free do 0 15 mg l the pdo was likely created from surface oxidation during sample preparation procedure such as mashing of the pd solid moreover characteristic peaks of pdo did not appear in the xrd spectra which indicates negligible amounts of pdo retained these results document that pd 0 formed on the fiber surface sem and tem images characterize the morphology of the pd film fig 2 a shows the surface of the pd film was rough and compact a closer look fig 2b reveals the massive accumulated pdnps and pores on this rough surface and indicates that the pd 0 crystallites formed into larger particles the results manifest that the pd film is the aggregation of pdnps and possesses the porous structure tem edx elemental mapping figure s3c of a cross section of pd film provides further evidence of stabilization of pdnps fig 2c shows a multi layer dark black film stably attached to the fiber surface individual pd 0 crystallites with an average size of 12 4 0 9 nm 110 counts can be observed on a pdnps layer fig 2d and their characteristic lattice fringes dominated by the 1 1 1 d spacing of 2 3 å khan et al 2014 calculations in si indicate that this level of pdnp coverage corresponded to approximately 66 layers of 12 4 nm crystallites packed on the membrane surface the theoretical maximum specific surface area of the pd film was 40 m2 gcat 1 and the calculated film thickness was 670 nm a value close to the average thickness of 710 nm obtained from image areas in fig 2c and figure s3c which infers the accumulated structure of the pdnps is approximate to be hexagonal close packed structure 3 2 adsorption kinetics and isotherms of 2 4 dcp by pd film results of adsorption experiments shown in figure s4 si show that the four phenolic compounds had fast initial adsorption to the pd film and adsorption equilibrium was achieved within 5 min for all experiments the highest adsorption capacity was for 2 4 dcp up to 0 092 mmol gcat 1 followed by 4 cp 0 066 mmol gcat 1 2 cp 0 060 mmol gcat 1 and p 0 015 mmol gcat 1 the pseudo second order adsorption kinetics of 2 4 dcp 2 cp 4 cp and p by the pd film are summarized in table 1 the v0 followed the order of 2 4 dcp 4 cp 2 cp p more electronegative chloro substituents led to increased affinity qe to the pd surface and this correlated to a larger v0 value since the k 2 kinetic coefficients were 5 6 gcat mmol 1 min 1 for 2 4 dcp 2 cp and 4 cp phenol s k 2 value was much larger which supports that its transport away from the pd film was not rate limiting the langmuir isotherm using the q0 and 1 b values in table 1 could represent well equilibrium adoption of all solutes r 2 value 0 99 and no systematic errors figure s5 q0 the indicator of adsorption capacity was in the order 2 4 dcp 4 cp 2 cp p almost the same relationship for qe from the kinetic experiments and consistent with computations from dft for the adsorption energy of 2 4 dcp on pdnps supported on carbon or titanium nitride fu et al 2019 yuzhuo chen 2019 the 1 b affinity concentrations declined in the same order as q0 which indicates that solutes with higher adsorption capacity required a higher solute concentration to approach their capacity the langmuir isotherm represents monolayer adsorption on distinct localized adsorption sites with no adsorbate mobility among the sites langmuir 1918 it also requires negligible interactions such as steric hindrance between the adsorbed phenols the estimated 2 4 dcp coverage ratio on the pdnps surface qr was 0 54 calculations are in si which supports that adsorption was not more than a monolayer coverage 3 3 reductive dechlorination of 2 4 dcp in the mpfr in the reductive dechlorination experiments the influent concentrations of 2 4 dcp were 25 55 95 or 195 µm fig 3 presents the effluent concentrations of 2 4 dcp and its dechlorinated products 2 cp 4 cp and p over 6 h of continuous operation table s1 summarizes the average concentrations in the effluent and their coefficients of variation during the period from 2 h to 6 h rapid adsorption of 2 4 dcp caused the gap of mass balance closure of 90 1 3 0 in the first 5 min of the experiments then 2 4 dcp approached steady state removal of approximately 92 the monochlorphenols mcps i e 2 cp and 4 cp had small peaks around 30 min but then decreased to a steady low value about 2 of influent 2 4 dcp the concentration of p increased to a stable concentration that was about 87 of the influent concentration of 2 4 dcp over the last 4 h the measured concentrations accounted for 96 5 0 8 of the input 2 4 dcp gc ms results showed no other products besides 2 cp 4 cp and p during the dechlorination process this small deficiency in the mass balance probably can be attributed to volatilization during sampling and analysis because volatilization tests showed an average 6 loss of 2 4 dcp during experimental operation without pd loading or h2 supplying figure s6 si 2 cp was detected in all series but 4 cp was only detected at c0 2 4 dcp 200 µm this supports that the reactivity of ccl at para position is higher than that of ccl at ortho position possibly due to steric hindrance at ortho position than that at para position sun et al 2014 3 4 kinetics and mechanisms for 2 4 dcp dechlorination as revealed in figs 4 and 5 stable effluent patterns were achieved within 2 h for all cps species and concentrations for 2 4 dcp reduction experiments the measured concentrations of intermediate mcps during the initial 2 h were slightly lower than that fitted by the model dotted line in fig 4 simultaneously the average mass balance closure during initial 2 h 94 3 was lower than that in the steady state 96 5 this discrepancy reflects some phenols were adsorbed on the pd film however it was unlikely due to the adsorption of 2 4 dcp or p as the adsorption equilibrium was achieved within 5 min for 2 4 dcp and p featured low adsorption capacity and fast transport rate discussed in section 3 2 therefore the adsorption of mcps causes the experiment data of mcps concentrations are lower than the model results based on the identified dechlorinated products the transformations of 2 4 dcp in mpfr followed the steps shown in eqs 6 10 substitution of the measured effluent concentrations after 5 min into eqs 15 21 led to the hdc rate constants k k 1 k 2 k 3 k 1 and k 2 displayed in table 2 these parameters gave good fits with relatively high correlation coefficients all r 2 0 98 and without systematic errors assuming that the overall kinetics were controlled by the catalytic reaction is supported by the initial adsorption rate of 2 4 dcp v0 0 043 mmol min 1 gcat 1 c0 200 µm being greater than the initial reduction rate vr 0 013 mmol min 1 gcat 1 c0 200 µm the rate order was k 3 k 1 k 2 which indicates that successive dechlorinations without desorption of an mcp was the dominant pathway nearly 70 of 2 4 dcp was dechlorinated to p this way followed by stepwise dechlorination via 2 cp at 26 and 4 cp at 4 because the dominant reaction did not require desorption of 2 cp or 4 cp their accumulations of mcps were small after 5 min the sequence of reductive dehalogenation reactions of halogenated aromatic compounds generally follows the electron affinity of the electron acceptors present in anaerobic environments dolfing and harrison 1992 we calculated the gibbs free energy change g0 of full and semi dechlorination reactions 2 4 dcp 2 h 2 p 2 c l 2 h δ g 0 57 7 kj mol e 1 2 4 dcp h 2 2 cp c l h δ g 0 52 9 kj mol e 1 2 4 dcp h 2 4 cp c l h δ g 0 51 0 kj mol e 1 comparing the g0 values full dechlorination is thermodynamically favorable and it is kinetically possible when the catalyst brings together two activated h s with adsorbed 2 4 dcp and it still adsorbed mcps dechlorination of the para cl proceeded at a greater rate than ortho cl removal k 1 k 2 1 and this is consistent with published studies that ascribed this trend to steric constraints imposed by the ortho cl substituent shin and keane 1999 wei et al 2006 table 2 also shows that hdc of mcp intermediates was faster than for 2 4 dcp i e k 1 k 2 k 1 or k 2 which is consistent with an electrophilic aromatic substitution where the second electron withdrawing cl has a inactivating effect shin et al 1999 it also explains why effluent concentrations of 2 cp and 4 cp were low because adsorption precedes reduction dechlorination of 2 4 dcp occurred in two steps 1 2 4 dcp adsorption to pdnp with activation of the ccl bond and 2 ccl bond breaking coupled electron transfer from activated h that also was adsorbed to the pdnps jiang et al 2018 calculated the adsorption energy δe ads for typical adsorption configurations of 2 4 dcp s cl atoms to pd 1 1 1 plane table s2 si the adsorption configurations are illustrated in fig 6 they found that adsorption configuration iii with two cl atoms bonded to pd 0 is favorable based on its largest δe ads compared with single para i or ortho ii cl bonds with pd atoms this result supports that our findings that 2 4 dcp had the strongest adsorption to pdnps and also the fastest hydrodechlorination after the first substitution occurs the second dechlorination can come along rapidly because the mcp molecule remains adsorbed due to the second activated cl pd bond and without release of the mcp 4 conclusion in the h2 based mpfr the hollow fiber membranes delivered h2 and were the supporting material for pdnps that formed to a stable film in situ and provided good reductive dechlorination of 2 4 dcp to p the pd film was an efficient adsorbent for 2 4 dcp and this was essential catalytic contact with activated h operated in the continuous flow mode the mpfr gave nearly 90 reduction of 2 4 dcp to p kinetic modeling simulated well the hdc of 2 4 dcp in continuous flow conditions and showed that the dominant pathway was full dechlorination of 2 4 dcp to p in adsorbed state small fractions were stepwise dechlorinated through 2 cp and 4 cp which were released to the solution dft analysis suggests that the dominant pathway resulted from a thermodynamically favorable adsorption configuration in summary the experimental results and modeling indicate that full dechlorination of 2 4 dcp occurred primarily in the adsorbed state and with minimal release of mcps a desirable outcome for potential application of the mpfr technology supporting information experimental details additional results of adsorption and hdc experiments calculation process and the results of dft analysis were presented

17414,we created a hydrogen based membrane palladium film reactor mpfr by depositing palladium nanoparticles pdnps on hollow fiber membranes via autocatalytic hydrogenation to form a pd film the mpfr was used for hydrodechlorination hdc of 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp hdc performances and mechanisms were systematically evaluated and a continuous flow dechlorination model was established approximately 87 of the input 2 4 dcp was reduced to the end product phenol p while 2 chlorophenol 2 cp was an intermediate but only at 2 selective adsorption of the 2 4 dcp onto the pd film and fast desorption of p facilitated efficient dechlorination modeling results represented well the concentrations of 2 4 dcp and its intermediates it demonstrated three dechlorination pathways the majority of 2 4 dcp was completely dechlorinated to p in an adsorbed state without release of monochlorphenol some 2 4 dcp was degraded to 2 cp that was released and subsequently adsorbed and reduced to p and a small amount was reduced to 4 cp that was released and subsequently adsorbed and reduced to p analysis based on density functional theory suggests that the pathway of full dechlorination was dominant due to its thermodynamically favorable adsorption configuration with both cl atoms bonded to pd this study documents full dechlorination of 2 4 dcp in the mpfr and the interacting roles of adsorption and hdc graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrodechlorination 2 4 dichlorophenol membrane palladium film reactor mathematical model 1 introduction chlorophenols cps which are widely

surface waters gao et al 2008 and contaminated soils witthuhn et al 2005a witthuhn et al 2005b where it causes ecological human health risks vallecillo et al 1999 because its dechlorinated end product phenol is relatively more biodegradable and less toxic dechlorination of 2 4 dcp is a promising method for 2 4 dcp treatment using hydrogen gas h2 as the electron donor catalytic hydrodechlorination hdc also known as reductive dechlorination on palladium pd nanoparticles pdnps has emerged as a sustainable alternative that facilitates fast kinetics high efficiency operation under mild conditions and no secondary waste stream diaz et al 2016 yuan and keane 2003b highly reductive atomic hydrogen is generated on the pd surface by homolytic cleavage of adsorbed h2 which is activated to substitute the cl atoms in cps chaplin et al 2012 conrad et al 1974 fu et al 2019 however the safe and efficient h2 delivery in practical application is challenging chaplin et al 2012 in additional pdnps normally need to be dispersed and stabilized on suitable supporting materials to acquire high active and long term sustainability benitez and del angel 2000 deng et al 2014 yuan and keane 2003a the h2

capacity is determined by the h2 permeability in the membranes material and can be controlled by regulating the h2 pressure tang et al 2012 the membranes can be the support and stabilizer for the pdnps zhou et al 2016 that are generated in situ via an autocatalytic reduction of pd ii to metallic palladium pd 0 to form pdnps besson et al 2005 this autocatalytic deposition of pdnps executed in

2013 xu et al 2016a xu et al 2016b zhao et al 2016 existing kinetic models cannot simulate entire hdc process in continuous flow reactors that are used in practical application since stepwise hdc that leads to accumulation of lower cps in the liquid presents a risk for water pollution due to the higher solubilities of the less chlorinated phenols cho et al 2000 it would be meaningful to develop a mathematical model that describes the fate of 2 4 dcp and its dechlorinated products for continuous flow cps transformation pathways can be deduced from the reduction kinetics the over arching objective of this study was to systematically evaluate hdc of 2 4 dcp using a mpfr operated in continuous mode specific objectives were 1 to analyze the content and structural characteristics of the

polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe tubing norprene chemical saint gobain usa had a 70 ml working volume and contained two bundles of nonporous polypropylene hollow fiber membranes 200 µm outer diameter 100 110 µm inner diameter teijin japan with a total membrane surface area of 54 cm2 the main column contained 32 hollow fiber membranes while the other column contained 10 fibers used as pd film sampling coupons the fibers of the main bundles were glued at both ends and connected to a h2 gas supply while the coupon bundles had only an upper h2 gas supply h2 gas was constantly supplied to fiber bundles at 2 atm absolute pressure adjusted by a pressure regulator and it diffused through the fiber walls in a bubble free manner the maximum h2 delivery capacity 0 37 g h2 m 2 day 1 calculated according to tang et al 2012 was sufficient for pd reduction to form pdnps and for complete hdc of 2 4 dcp in all experiments the liquid contents of the mpfr was well mixed through a recirculation rate of 100 ml min 1 achieved by a peristaltic pump model 1515x longer china thus the solute concentrations inside the mpfr were equal to its effluent concentrations the temperature was maintained at 25 1 c 2 3 preparation and characterization of pdnps film for deposition of pdnps on the surface of the hollow fiber membranes medium contained pd ii 1 mm as na2pdcl4 and 2 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 2 was purged with n2 gas to eliminate dissolved oxygen do 0 15 mg l 1 the medium was then pumped into the mpfr which was run in batch mode for 2 days to produce a film of pdnps on the fibers pd ii concentrations in solution were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes agilent 720es usa at a wavelength of 340 46 nm the coating process was repeated three times until that a thick pdnps film accumulated on the fibers and at least 99 of the input soluble pd ii was reduced by h2 in each time to examine the pdnps we recorded a powder x ray diffraction xrd pattern using an x

detector edx were used to obtain the morphology characteristics of pdnps immobilized on the fibers 2 4 adsorption experiments equilibrium adsorption experiments was performed after a pd film formed on the fiber surface the mpfr was set to a batch mode to explore the adsorption of 2 4 dcp 2 cp 4 cp or p onto the pd film the h2 supply was disconnected and the liquid medium was replaced by 70 ml of new medium contained 2 4 dcp at desired concentrations 25 55 100 or 200 µm and then 2 4 dcp was replaced by 2 cp 4 cp or p successively at the same concentrations between each experiment the mpfr was rinsed with alcohol and distilled water to remove adsorbed phenols until the solute became undetectable in the rinse water when solute concentrations had reached equilibrium we measured the concentration of the solute in liquid and computed the mass of adsorbed phenols by difference the adsorption capacities of pd film for the phenols could be represented well using the langmuir isotherm 1 q e q 0 c t c t b 1 where q e mmol gcat 1 is the equilibrium adsorption density q 0 mmol gcat 1 and b 1 mmol l 1 are langmuir constants for the maximum adsorption capacity and the affinity concentration respectively and ct is the equilibrium solute concentration mmol l 1 the adsorption kinetics of 2 4 dcp 2 cp 4 cp or p were evaluated in batch experiments with an initial concentration

was purged and refilled with influent medium the h2 supply was turned on and the mpfr was shifted to continuous mode with an influent flow rate of 0 265 ml min 1 the influent concentrations of 2 4 dcp 2 cp or 4 cp were set at 25 55 100 or 200 µm respectively for the different experiments 2 6 sampling and analyses we collected liquid samples from the mpfr at preselected time intervals and

detector the mobile phase was a mixture of acetonitrile and ultrapure water with 0 1 acetic acid in the volume proportion of 65 35 the flow rate of hplc pump was controlled at 1 0 ml min 1 and the uv detector was set at 190 nm we also collected unfiltered samples to analyze the pd concentration in effluent and digested them by thickish hot mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid before analyzing and no pd ii was detected in liquid samples from adsorption and dechlorination experiments 2 7 mathematical model for hdc we represented the mpfr as continuous stirred tank reactor cstr with

al 2013 xu et al 2016b zhao et al 2016 because the liquid in the reactor was uniformly mixed the solute concentration inside a mpfr was equal to its effluent concentration c i c e substitution of eq 4

the product of the first dechlorination step 2 cp or 4 cp remains adsorbed and rapidly undergoes the second dechlorination step thus neither 2 cp nor 4 cp appears as an intermediate of reaction 10 because previous studies have shown that the dechlorination reactions of cps by pdnps follow pseudo first order kinetics wang et al 2013 xu et al 2016b zhao et al 2016 the corresponding rate

the pd ii was reduced to pd 0 that nucleated on the mpfr s membrane surface and formed a black film having an average pd density of 7 5 g pd m 2 membrane a total of 40 mg pd the xrd spectra of freeze dried sample collected from the fibers figure s3a in si exhibited the four pd 0 peaks 40 1 1 1 1 46 7 2 0 0 68 1 2 2 0 and 82 1 3 1 1 jcpds no 46 1043 pd 0 was further confirmed by xps analysis figure s3b in si with the peaks at 340 7 and 335 5 ev corresponding to the typical 3d3 2 and 3d5 2 respectively zhou et al 2017 the xps spectra also reveals tiny fractions of unreduced na2pdcl4 4 3 and pdo 9 7 on pdnps surfaces because the mpfr was oxygen free do 0 15 mg l the pdo was likely created from surface oxidation during sample preparation procedure such as mashing of the pd solid moreover characteristic peaks of pdo did not appear in the xrd spectra which indicates negligible amounts of pdo retained these results document that pd 0 formed on the fiber surface sem and tem images characterize the morphology of the pd film fig 2 a shows the surface of the pd film was rough and compact a closer look fig 2b reveals the massive accumulated pdnps and pores on this rough surface and indicates that the pd 0 crystallites formed into larger particles the results manifest that the pd film is the aggregation of pdnps and possesses the porous structure tem edx elemental mapping figure s3c of a cross section of pd film provides further evidence of stabilization of pdnps fig 2c shows a multi layer dark black film stably attached to the fiber surface individual pd 0 crystallites with an average size of 12 4 0 9 nm 110 counts can be observed on a pdnps layer fig 2d and their characteristic lattice fringes dominated by the 1 1 1 d spacing of 2 3 å khan et al 2014 calculations in si indicate that this level of pdnp coverage corresponded to approximately 66 layers of 12 4 nm crystallites packed on the membrane surface the theoretical maximum specific surface area of the pd film was 40 m2 gcat 1 and the calculated film thickness was 670 nm a value close to the average thickness of 710 nm obtained from image areas in fig 2c and figure s3c which infers the accumulated structure of the pdnps is approximate to be hexagonal close packed structure 3 2 adsorption kinetics and isotherms of 2 4 dcp by pd film results of adsorption experiments shown in figure s4 si show that the four phenolic compounds had fast initial adsorption to the pd film and adsorption equilibrium was achieved within 5 min for all experiments the highest adsorption capacity was for 2 4 dcp up to 0 092 mmol gcat 1 followed by 4 cp 0 066 mmol gcat 1 2 cp 0 060 mmol gcat 1 and p 0 015 mmol gcat 1 the pseudo second order adsorption kinetics of 2 4 dcp 2 cp 4 cp and p by the pd film are summarized in table 1 the v0 followed the order of 2 4 dcp 4 cp 2 cp p more electronegative chloro substituents led to increased affinity qe to the pd surface and this correlated to a larger v0 value since the k 2 kinetic coefficients were 5 6 gcat mmol 1 min 1 for 2 4 dcp 2 cp and 4 cp phenol s k 2 value was much larger which supports that its transport away from the pd film was not rate limiting the langmuir isotherm using the q0 and 1 b values in table 1 could represent well equilibrium adoption of all solutes r 2 value 0 99 and no systematic errors figure s5 q0 the indicator of adsorption capacity was in the order 2 4 dcp 4 cp 2 cp p almost the same relationship for qe from the kinetic experiments and consistent with computations from dft for the adsorption energy of 2 4 dcp on pdnps supported on carbon or titanium nitride fu et al 2019 yuzhuo chen 2019 the 1 b affinity concentrations declined in the same order as q0 which indicates that solutes with higher adsorption capacity required a higher solute concentration to approach their capacity the langmuir isotherm represents monolayer adsorption on distinct localized adsorption sites with no adsorbate mobility among the sites langmuir 1918 it also requires negligible interactions such as steric hindrance between the adsorbed phenols the estimated 2 4 dcp coverage ratio on the pdnps surface qr was 0 54 calculations are in si which supports that adsorption was not more than a monolayer coverage 3 3 reductive dechlorination of 2 4 dcp in the mpfr in the reductive dechlorination experiments the influent concentrations of 2 4 dcp were 25 55 95 or 195 µm fig 3 presents the effluent concentrations of 2 4 dcp and its dechlorinated products 2 cp 4 cp and p over 6 h of continuous operation table s1 summarizes the average concentrations in the effluent and their coefficients of variation during the period from 2 h to 6 h rapid adsorption of 2 4 dcp caused the gap of mass balance closure of 90 1 3 0 in the first 5 min of the experiments then 2 4 dcp approached steady state removal of approximately 92 the monochlorphenols mcps i e 2 cp and 4 cp had small peaks around 30 min but then decreased to a steady low value about 2 of influent 2 4 dcp the concentration of p increased to a stable concentration that was about 87 of the influent concentration of 2 4 dcp over the last 4 h the measured concentrations accounted for 96 5 0 8 of the input 2 4 dcp gc ms results showed no other products besides 2 cp 4 cp and p during the dechlorination process this small deficiency in the mass balance probably can be attributed to volatilization during sampling and analysis because volatilization tests showed an average 6 loss of 2 4 dcp during experimental operation without pd loading or h2 supplying figure s6 si 2 cp was detected in all series but 4 cp was only detected at c0 2 4 dcp 200 µm this supports that the reactivity of ccl at para position is higher than that of ccl at ortho position possibly due to steric hindrance at ortho position than that at para position sun et al 2014 3 4 kinetics and mechanisms for 2 4 dcp dechlorination as revealed in figs 4 and 5 stable effluent patterns were achieved within 2 h for all cps species and concentrations for 2 4 dcp reduction experiments the measured concentrations of intermediate mcps during the initial 2 h were slightly lower than that fitted by the model dotted line in fig 4 simultaneously the average mass balance closure during initial 2 h 94 3 was lower than that in the steady state 96 5 this discrepancy reflects some phenols were adsorbed on the pd film however it was unlikely due to the adsorption of 2 4 dcp or p as the adsorption equilibrium was achieved within 5 min for 2 4 dcp and p featured low adsorption capacity and fast transport rate discussed in section 3 2 therefore the adsorption of mcps causes the experiment data of mcps concentrations are lower than the model results based on the identified dechlorinated products the transformations of 2 4 dcp in mpfr followed the steps shown in eqs 6 10 substitution of the measured effluent concentrations after 5 min into eqs 15 21 led to the hdc rate constants k k 1 k 2 k 3 k 1 and k 2 displayed in table 2 these parameters gave good fits with relatively high correlation coefficients all r 2 0 98 and without systematic errors assuming that the overall kinetics were controlled by the catalytic reaction is supported by the initial adsorption rate of 2 4 dcp v0 0 043 mmol min 1 gcat 1 c0 200 µm being greater than the initial reduction rate vr 0 013 mmol min 1 gcat 1 c0 200 µm the rate order was k 3 k 1 k 2 which indicates that successive dechlorinations without desorption of an mcp was the dominant pathway nearly 70 of 2 4 dcp was dechlorinated to p this way followed by stepwise dechlorination via 2 cp at 26 and 4 cp at 4 because the dominant reaction did not require desorption of 2 cp or 4 cp their accumulations of mcps were small after 5 min the sequence of reductive dehalogenation reactions of halogenated aromatic compounds generally follows the electron affinity of the electron acceptors present in anaerobic environments dolfing and harrison 1992 we calculated the gibbs free energy change g0 of full and semi dechlorination reactions 2 4 dcp 2 h 2 p 2 c l 2 h δ g 0 57 7 kj mol e 1 2 4 dcp h 2 2 cp c l h δ g 0 52 9 kj mol e 1 2 4 dcp h 2 4 cp c l h δ g 0 51 0 kj mol e 1 comparing the g0 values full dechlorination is thermodynamically favorable and it is kinetically possible when the catalyst brings together two activated h s with adsorbed 2 4 dcp and it still adsorbed mcps dechlorination of the para cl proceeded at a greater rate than ortho cl removal k 1 k 2 1 and this is consistent with published studies that ascribed this trend to steric constraints imposed by the ortho cl substituent shin and keane 1999 wei et al 2006 table 2 also shows that hdc of mcp intermediates was faster than for 2 4 dcp i e k 1 k 2 k 1 or k 2 which is consistent with an electrophilic aromatic substitution where the second electron withdrawing cl has a inactivating effect shin et al 1999 it also explains why effluent concentrations of 2 cp and 4 cp were low because adsorption precedes reduction dechlorination of 2 4 dcp occurred in two steps 1 2 4 dcp adsorption to pdnp with activation of the ccl bond and 2 ccl bond breaking coupled electron transfer from activated h that also was adsorbed to the pdnps jiang et al 2018 calculated the adsorption energy δe ads for typical adsorption configurations of 2 4 dcp s cl atoms to pd 1 1 1 plane table s2 si the adsorption configurations are illustrated in fig 6 they found that adsorption configuration iii with two cl atoms bonded to pd 0 is favorable based on its largest δe ads compared with single para i or ortho ii cl bonds with pd atoms this result supports that our findings that 2 4 dcp had the strongest adsorption to pdnps and also the fastest hydrodechlorination after the first substitution occurs the second dechlorination can come along rapidly because the mcp molecule remains adsorbed due to the second activated cl pd bond and without release of the mcp 4 conclusion in the h2 based mpfr the hollow fiber membranes delivered h2 and were the supporting material for pdnps that formed to a stable film in situ and provided good reductive dechlorination of 2 4 dcp to p the pd film was an efficient adsorbent for 2 4 dcp and this was essential catalytic contact with activated h operated in the continuous flow mode the mpfr gave nearly 90 reduction of 2 4 dcp to p kinetic modeling simulated well the hdc of 2 4 dcp in continuous flow conditions and showed that the dominant pathway was full dechlorination of 2 4 dcp to p in adsorbed state small fractions were stepwise dechlorinated through 2 cp and 4 cp which were released to the solution dft analysis suggests that the dominant pathway resulted from a thermodynamically favorable adsorption configuration in summary the experimental results and modeling indicate that full dechlorination of 2 4 dcp occurred primarily in the adsorbed state and with minimal release of mcps a desirable outcome for potential application of the mpfr technology supporting information experimental details additional results of adsorption and hdc experiments calculation process and the results of dft analysis were presented
