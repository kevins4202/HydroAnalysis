15505,the interaction between microplastics mps and hydrophilic organic contaminants hocs in natural water environment has recently raised great public attentions due to the potential toxicity to humans however the quantitative assessment is less studied in this study the interaction between ciprofloxacin cip and ofloxacin ofl two important hocs and virgin and aged polystyrene ps was investigated the aged ps showed higher adsorption rate and capacity than the virgin ps due to its larger surface area and more o containing groups the ph dependent adsorption of cip was higher than ofl on both virgin and aged ps the maximum adsorption for both hocs occurred at ph 5 the sequential orders of functional groups for the adsorption were discovered according to the study by the 2d correlation fourier transform infrared spectroscopy several mechanisms existed for the interaction 1 at 3 0 ph 5 0 the electrostatic attraction ea was inhibited while h bond hb was dominant accounting for 60 of the total uptake 2 at 5 0 ph 8 0 the contribution of ea increased to around 50 60 while hb decreased to 30 40 3 at 8 0 ph 10 0 ea hb and π π conjugation caused 30 40 25 40 and 20 45 of the total uptake respectively 4 at 10 0 ph 12 0 π π conjugation accounted for 90 100 notably higher adsorption of cip was mainly attributed to the presence of secondary amino groups and its higher pka value correspondingly leading to the additional ordinary hb and negative charge assisted hb and ea interactions with ps this study further provides clear evidences on the risk of mps and hocs on humans and aqueous living organisms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ofloxacin ciprofloxacin electrostatic attraction negative charge assisted hydrogen bond two dimensional correlation fourier transform infrared spectroscopy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction recently microplastics mps commonly defined as the plastic matters with a diameter 5 mm have attracted more attention due to their ubiquitous existence and wide distribution difficulty in degradation potential risks to humans and most importantly increasing public concerns tirkey and upadhyay 2021 li et al 2021 koh et al 2022 owing to the fine sizes the ingestion of mps by amphipods lugworms seabirds shark and fishes through the food chain was reported luo et al 2022 the mps acted as the carriers for such harmful hydrophobic organic chemicals as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah and hydrophobic antibiotics and heavy metals li et al 2018 llorca et al 2018 liu et al 2022b fu et al 2021b the contaminant loaded mps may enter the food web act as a source of mp based complex pollution and eventually cause higher toxicity to humans and organisms sighicelli et al 2018 the organics from aged mps may leach out to waters hence the concentrations of disinfection byproducts were reportedly increased koh et al 2022 therefore it is of importance to study the adsorption behavior and mechanisms adsorption by mps can be for both hydrophobic organic pollutant and hydrophilic organic contaminants hocs such as most pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps sun et al 2022 yang et al 2022a generally the adsorption of hocs is dependent upon properties of mps and hocs given a certain type of mps the surface properties especially surface morphology and chemistry played key roles on the adsorption fu et al 2021a due to the changes in surface properties caused by aging process the adsorption behavior onto the aged mps would become different from the virgin mps that are commonly studied and reported aging in natural environment would cause formation of cracks and voids on mps wang et al 2021b the new o containing functional groups appeared under such conditions as weathering uv exposure and biological degradation ren et al 2021 the newly formed o containing groups on the aged mps significantly affected the adsorption of hocs by the interactions between o containing groups and functional groups of hocs liu et al 2019 yilimulati et al 2021 additionally the aging may enhance the hydrophilicity of surfaces leading to higher adsorption of hydrophilic organic matters wang et al 2021a for example the adsorption of antibiotics namely ciprofloxacin cip log kow 0 28 onto the aged polystyrene ps and polyvinyl chloride pvc was more than that onto the virgin ones liu et al 2019 furthermore the mps have different behavior in adsorption of organic contaminants with different hydrophilicity such as tetracycline tc sulfamethoxazole smx and norfloxacin nor guo and wang 2019 yu et al 2020b zhang et al 2021 the reported studies were limited to conceptual mechanisms on the uptake of hocs while very limited information is available on the mechanisms in molecular level and the quantitative evaluation for instance the influence of molecular structure and properties of antibiotics with similar pka and structure on the adsorption was not well addressed fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir can only provide the general information on the changes in the chemical structures of mps due to the adsorption rather than the detailed information on the change in functional groups of the mps abdulla et al 2010 a powerful analysis technique 2d correlation ftir 2d ftir cos can accurately unveil the changes in functional groups due to physical and chemical interactions with several successful reported studies e g interaction of nanomaterials and proteins šašić et al 2005 chen et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 guo et al 2019a recently it was used to study the interactions between mps and contaminants ding et al 2020 guo et al 2020 therefore this study was aimed at the quantitative study on the influence of molecular structure and properties of cip and ofloxacin ofl on the adsorption on the virgin and aged ps they were selected as they have wide applications and high solubility in water and frequently detected in water environments liang et al 2022 yang et al 2022b they belong to fluoroquinolones fqs antibiotics and have similar aromatic skeleton but different functional branch structure and hydrophilicity logkow values of 0 28 and 0 39 for cip and ofl respectively as shown in table s1 ps was selected due to its large production and use as typical non fiber plastics and common presence in aquatic environments chen et al 2022 ho et al 2020 the adsorption kinetics and isotherm and effects of ph and co existing ions on the uptake were studied the mechanisms for the adsorption of cip and ofl onto virgin and aged ps were investigated by 2d ftir cos and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analyses it was anticipated that the mechanisms for adsorption of hocs can be better understood and the information on potential toxicity can be obtained 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the ps with sizes of 80 150 μ m was purchased from guangdong zhongcheng plastic chemical factory since mps with size smaller than 200 μ m were abundant with high percentage in natural water han et al 2020 cip and ofl with the purity above 98 were purchased from beijing solarbio technology co ltd sodium chloride sodium hydroxide hydrochloric acid anhydrous calcium chloride and magnesium chloride of analytical grade were purchased from chengdu kelong chemical reagent factory the aging process of ps was described in section 1 1 in supporting information si 2 2 characterization of ps the surface morphology of the virgin and aged ps was studied by the scanning electron microscope sem zeiss gemini 300 the surface chemistry of ps was studied by the ftir spectrum two and 2d ftir cos technique and the xps thermo sciencetific k alpha the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area ssa of ps was determined by the surface area analyzer microactive for asap 2460 through n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 k the crystallinity of different ps was determined by the x ray diffraction analyzer xrd smart lab and the degree of crystallinity of ps was calculated by jade6 software the water contact angle wca of the ps particles was measured by a contact angle analyzer fangrui jyc 2 shanghai china the point of zero charge phpzc of the ps samples was measured according to the reported approach zhang et al 2013 2 3 adsorption experiments all adsorption experiments were carried out by brown glass bottles in triplicate so as to minimize the experimental errors meanwhile the blank experiments were conducted at the same conditions for all adsorption experiments to ensure the experimental accuracy to simulate the natural water all solutions contained 0 01 m nacl as ionic strength background the adsorption kinetics adsorption isotherm effect of ph and effect of co existing ions were studied after the adsorption the water samples were collected and filtrated by a 0 45 μ m filter the cip or ofl concentration was tested using the uv spectrophotometer hach dr6000 at wavelength of 275 and 293 nm respectively yu et al 2020a the details of the experiments were given in section 1 2 in si 2 4 quantitative analysis quantitative analysis of adsorption mechanisms at different ph regions was carried out by using two sets of the cip or ofl solutions prepared with concentrations of nacl solution 0 and 0 25 m of which the solution ph was set in a range of 3 0 to 12 0 when the solution was in the absence of nacl all the adsorption interactions may occur and the adsorption was regarded as total adsorption or overall adsorption the solution containing high nacl concentration may hinder the electrostatic attraction ea so as to separate the contribution of ea from the total adsorption gao et al 2022 therefore the adsorption was considered as the contribution of total ea at ph 10 and under 0 25 m nacl both ps and all fq species were negatively charged the ea and h bond hb interactions were hindered to separate the contributions of both from the total adsorption therefore the adsorption could be considered as the contribution of total ea hb the detailed information on the method was given in fig s1 in si other procedures were the same as those in adsorption isotherm experiment given in section 1 2 in si 2 5 analytical method 2d ftir cos was used to investigate the changes in the functional groups during the adsorption of cip and ofl in general the process could produce two types of 2d maps that are named as synchronous and asynchronous maps by using origin 2019 software originlab usa the φ x1 x2 obtained from synchronous maps reveals the similarity of the sequential variations in spectral intensities the ψ x1 x2 obtained from asynchronous maps composed of off diagonal cross peaks suggests the difference in the time dependent sequential variations in spectral intensities according to the reported approach noda et al 2000 a positive cross peak ψ x1 x2 indicates that the change in spectral intensity of x1 occurs prior to x2 while a negative cross peak suggests that the intensity change occurs at x2 before x1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mps fig 1 a e show that the color of virgin ps was white and became light yellow after being exposed under the uv light suggesting the surface degradation of the ps due to the aging the sem images in fig s2a b show that the ps particles were irregular and uneven with the size of 80 150 μ m after the aging uv treatment the surface of ps got more cracks and striped folds as shown in fig 1f resulting in a small increase in the ssa bet of ps from 0 162 m2 g to 0 627 m2 g table s2 the surface chemistry of virgin and aged ps particles was studied by ftir and xps analyses as shown in fig s3 the characteristic peaks at 1745 1312 1493 2925 and 3025 cm 1 could be assigned to the vibrations of coo c o aromatic ring skeleton ch2 and ch on the benzene ring for both virgin and aged ps respectively according to the references liu et al 2019 wang et al 2022 the peak at around 3450 cm 1 could be assigned to the hydroxyl bond its signal from the aged ps was much stronger than the virgin ps this finding indicates that such o containing groups as cooh groups were formed during the uv exposure the xps results given in table s2 indicate that the o element content of ps particles increased after the aging which also confirms the formation of o containing groups onto the surface of ps due to the uv exposure under the uv exposure the surface functional groups of ps were oxidized indicating the occurrence of aging as reported hüffer and hofmann 2016 the increase in specific surface area and content of o containing groups may introduce more active sites in the aged ps which could be beneficial for the adsorption of fqs as suggested in the literature liu et al 2019 the phpzc was determined with the results shown in table s2 the value of phpzc of aged ps became slightly lower than that of virgin ps the difference between virgin and aged ps may be due to the increase in the content of o containing functional groups which could be easily ionized and become negatively charged at a relatively lower ph liu et al 2019 at the solution ph phpzc the surface of ps became positively charged at ph phpzc the surface of ps became negatively charged an indicator of the surface hydrophilicity the wca was determined for both virgin and aged ps table s2 shows that the aged ps has a much lower wca than virgin ps indicating the enhancement in the surface hydrophilicity of ps due to aging such enhancement in the hydrophilicity of ps may be due to the increase in the intensity of o containing functional groups which would further affect the adsorption of hocs fan et al 2021 liu et al 2019 3 2 adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics fig s5 shows the adsorption history for the fqs on virgin and aged ps the trend of adsorption behavior of cip on ps was similar to that of ofl at 25 c the adsorption of both cip and ofl onto virgin ps occurred quickly within the first 2 h and gradually slowed down and reached the equilibrium at contact time of 12 h the above adsorption kinetics of fqs is similar with the reported findings in the adsorption of fqs by other mps sun et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 for example about 90 of equilibrium adsorption of nor by ps and polyethylene pe was reached within 12 h sun et al 2022 besides the adsorption of nor by four types of mps could take place quickly within the first 5 h around 80 of the ultimate adsorption and achieved the equilibrium at the contact time of 18 h zhang et al 2021 as shown in table 1 and fig s5 the adsorption onto the aged ps was faster than the virgin ps the equilibrium adsorption capacities of the aged ps were much higher than those of the virgin ps which could be due to more cracks and adsorption interactions with the aged ps as demonstrated in section 3 1 the cracks and o containing groups may likely accelerate achieving the adsorption equilibrium of hocs liu et al 2019 additionally when the temperature was increased from 15 to 35 c the adsorption rate increased and the equilibrium adsorption was achieved at the shorter contact time e g 8 h for the case of 35 c which may result from the facilitated molecular thermal motions at higher temperature and the faster diffusion of adsorbate bao et al 2021 sun et al 2013 meanwhile the equilibrium adsorption of cip and ofl onto the virgin ps at high temperature decreased for example the adsorption amount of cip and pfl at 35 c was less than that at 25 c by 73 6 and 38 8 respectively these results indicate that the higher temperature improved the adsorption rate but reduced the adsorption capacity which could be confirmed by the adsorption thermodynamic results given in section 2 1 in si the adsorption history of cip and ofl onto the mps was analyzed by the pseudo first and second order equations the experimental data of ofl adsorption on the virgin ps was well fit by both equations with higher regression coefficient r2 values of 0 934 0 981 as shown in table 1 on the other hand the data for the cip adsorption onto the virgin ps was slightly better fitted by the pseudo second order equation according to the r2 values whereas the adsorption capacities obtained by the pseudo first order equation were much closer to the experimental data however for the aged ps the adsorption kinetics of cip and ofl by the aged ps were better fitted by the pseudo second order equation and the adsorption capacities were closer to the adsorption data furthermore the higher k2 values obtained from the adsorption conditions with aged ps and higher temperature suggest that the aging process or high temperature enhanced the adsorption rate of both fqs onto the ps particles 3 3 adsorption isotherm the adsorption isotherm of the cip and ofl onto the virgin and aged ps is shown in fig s6 the aged ps displayed a much higher adsorption of cip and ofl than the virgin ps by 34 2 for cip and 49 9 for ofl under the same initial concentration of 30 mg l a recent paper also illustrated that weathered ps had a higher adsorption affinity for hocs e g cip than the virgin ps because of the rougher surface and stronger hydrophilicity of the weathered ps particles yang et al 2022a the aging process can change the properties of mps via increasing the contents of o containing functional groups and enhancing the hydrophilicity of mps particles thus improving the adsorption interactions with hocs liu et al 2019 for the aged ps the formation of cracks and increase in contents of o containing functional groups caused more available adsorption sites and relatively hydrophilic surfaces as a result the aged ps had better adsorption ability of cip and ofl than the virgin ps interestingly despite that cip and ofl have similar pka values and structure the maximum adsorption capacity of cip on ps was slightly higher than that of ofl namely 459 8 µg g vs 395 25 µg g by the virgin ps and 617 0 µg g vs 592 5 µg g by the aged ps however ofl is slightly hydrophilic than cip when one compares their logkow values such results indirectly indicate that the hydrophilicity is not the dominant factor determining the adsorption behavior of two fqs onto ps the molecule structure and speciation of cip and ofl in water environment may play roles in adsorption which is in line with the suggestion in the literature gao et al 2021 at ph 7 0 more fq and fq species of cip existed in the water than those of ofl due to the higher pka value shown in fig 2 c d which could be easily adsorbed by negative charged ps via ea therefore the ps can adsorb more cip than ofl to better understanding the adsorption behavior the linear freundlich and langmuir isotherms were used to describe the data as shown in fig s6 and table 2 the linear model can well describe the experimental data with a high r2 value 0 92 this suggests that the partition effect plays an important role in the adsorption of cip and ofl similarly it was hypothesized that the partition effect was associated with hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic interaction guo et al 2019b generally speaking hydrophobic organic matters can attach onto surface of mps via hydrophobic interactions however as cip logkow 0 28 and ofl logkow 0 39 were hocs gao et al 2021 the hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophilic fqs and ps was limited at ph 7 controlled in the adsorption isotherm study fq or fq0 was the dominant species in the water and the fq could be easily adsorbed on the negatively charged ps surface due the electrostatic attraction ea more importantly the kd values given in table 2 followed the order of aged ps cip aged ps ofl virgin ps cip virgin ps ofl this finding indicates that 1 the aged ps exhibited higher affinity toward these two fqs than the virgin ps 2 both virgin ps and aged ps showed higher adsorption ability of cip than ofl 3 the electrostatic interaction played a key role in the adsorption of hydrophilic organics the adsorption behavior of both antibiotics onto the virgin ps can well be described by langmuir and freundlich isotherms as shown in table 2 freundlich isotherm performed better than or similar to langmuir isotherm in the description of the experimental data the adsorption of antibiotics by ps may be controlled by the multi layer adsorption processes due to the heterogeneous surface with cracks especially for aged ps similar findings were reported in the literature liu et al 2019 3 4 effect of ph on adsorption the ph can greatly affect the adsorption performance by influencing the surface properties of the adsorbent and species of antibiotics in solution zhang et al 2020 fig 2 shows the similar ph dependence for the adsorption of cip and ofl on virgin and aged ps more specifically the adsorption capacities of cip and ofl onto ps increased from ph 3 0 reached the peak at ph around 5 0 and then gradually decreased at high ph range and became much less at ph 10 the highly ph depended adsorption could be attributed to the ph dependance of surface charges of the ps and fqs according to the phpzc of the virgin and aged ps table s2 and the pka values table s1 the values of phpzc of the virgin and aged ps were 4 95 and 4 78 respectively meanwhile the two fqs with similar pka values roughly changed their major existing species from fq fq or fq0 to fq at 3 0 ph 6 0 6 0 ph 8 0 and 8 0 ph 12 as shown in fig 2c d at ph between 3 0 and 4 5 the electrostatic repulsion between fq and positive charged ps could suppress the adsorption as ph was increased the suppression effect became weaken and the ps surface became negatively charged at ph phpzc therefore the ea would occur around ph 5 0 when the ph was increased from 5 0 to 7 0 the adsorption of fqs onto the negatively charged ps gradually decreased as fq species was changed to fq or fq0 as the ph was continuously increased the adsorption greatly dropped due to the electrostatic repulsion effect since the fq or fq0 became fq the results indicate that the electrostatic interaction was obviously involved in the adsorption of the fqs by ps that was also suggested in the literature yilimulati et al 2021 however it was not the only dominant mechanism interestingly at the same ph the adsorption capacity of cip by ps was higher than that of ofl this suggests the involvement of other interactions in addition to electrostatic interactions both cip and ofl have the cooh groups which can form h bond hb with the o containing groups of ps e g cooh groups notably the cip had a secondary amino group that could form additional hb with cooh of ps while it was not available for ofl gao et al 2021 in addition the slightly higher pka value of cip led to more cip and cip species under the same ph than those species of ofl as shown in fig 2c d resulting in more ea of cip than ofl with ps thus the adsorption of cip was higher than that of ofl 3 5 influence of co existing ions on adsorption generally several dissolved salts exist in natural waters and may affect the adsorption of antibiotics figs s7a b and s8 1a b demonstrate that the increase in salinity nacl from 0 05 to 3 significantly reduced the adsorption of both cip and ofl this is in line with the findings reported for other types of mps and contaminants guo et al 2019c wu et al 2020 compared the adsorption capacity under the same salinity the aged ps can adsorb more cip and ofl than the virgin one to further understand the effect of co existing salts the effect of ca2 and mg2 were studied as shown in figs s7c f and s8 1c f the presence of both ca2 and mg2 greatly hindered the adsorption in particular the adsorption of both antibiotics reduced by 87 04 to 95 27 when the concentration of ca2 or mg2 was increased to 100 mg l the reduced adsorption may be caused by the mechanism of ea the increasing cation concentration na ca2 or mg2 could break down the charge balance between fqs and ps system and neutralize the negatively charged ps at ph 7 leading to the suppression of the ea it should be noted that the hinder effect caused by nacl was much less than that by ca2 and mg2 fig s8 1 for example the adsorption of cip onto aged ps was 240 μg g at na 8 56 mm while that was 45 and 125 μg g at ca2 mg2 2 5 mm respectively as divalent cations took more positive charges and thus could much more easily neutralize the negative charges of the ps than monovalent cations the ea interaction between fqs and ps was reduced figs s8 1c f show that at the same molar concentration e g 2 5 mm the presence of calcium caused more inhibition on the adsorption than magnesium in order to find out the reason an equilibrium modeling program mineql 5 0 was used to study the chemical speciation environmental research software 2018 our result showed that both calcium and magnesium existed as free metal form namely ca2 and mg2 thus the charge effect seemed not to play a key role in the adsorption the greater effect from calcium than magnesium was likely due to the higher affinity from calcium for the surface of adsorbent ps typically the affinity between metal and adsorbent follows a common rule metal with higher molecular weight has higher affinity for adsorbent chen and wang 2000 chen 2013 as calcium had a larger molecular weight than magnesium more calcium ions occupied more functional groups of ps as a result less adsorption of hocs occurred at the presence of calcium ion additionally the presence of anionic chloride ion seemed to have less effect on the adsorption as shown in fig s8 2 3 6 adsorption mechanisms the ftir was used to analyze the chemical changes in different ps samples the ftir spectrum of cip loaded virgin ps given in fig s3a shows that the peak at 3439 cm 1 assigned to hydroxyl or hydrogen bonds became stronger than the virgin ps this implies that the hb was related to the adsorption of cip on the virgin ps the similar results were found in the adsorption of cip by ps reported in the literature liu et al 2022a yang et al 2022a the same phenomenon was also observed for the adsorption of ofl onto the virgin ps for the aged ps the hydroxyl or hydrogen bonds at 3442 cm 1 became much stronger after the adsorption fig s3b suggesting the involvement of stronger hb in the adsorption process compared with that by virgin ps the 2d cos analysis was used to resolve ftir spectra of ps the maps synchronous and asynchronous for the fq adsorbed ps with different loading of fqs were obtained in the regions of 1000 1800 cm 1 and 2800 3600 cm 1 the synchronous maps for the fq adsorbed virgin ps given in figs 3 b and s9a b showed seven main auto peaks at 1030 1370 1452 1491 1603 1640 and 3440 cm 1 along the diagonal line which could be assigned to the peaks of c o c oh c h aromatic ring skeleton c c h c o and oh respectively meanwhile the positive signals were found for all the cross peaks this suggests that the cross peaks were synchronously changed in the adsorption according to noda s rules the asynchronous correlation spectra can provide the sequential order of the functional groups in the adsorption ding et al 2020 as illustrated in the asynchronous maps there were significant differences in the cross peaks due to the adsorption tables s4 s5 provide 2d cos data for the fq adsorbed virgin ps a positive signal was shown for cross peaks ψ x1 1640 this indicates that the peak at 1640 cm 1 occurred after all other peaks in addition the cross peak at ψ 3040 3440 was negative suggesting that the functional peak at 3440 cm 1 occurred prior to the peaks at 3040 cm 1 the reaction sequence of the functional groups in the fq adsorption by the virgin ps was as follows 1491 aromatic ring skeleton 1452 c h 1030 c o 1603 c c 1370 c oh 1640 h c o correspondingly the phenyl rings can mainly interact the fqs by π π conjugation while the o containing groups may interact with fqs via ea thus the sequence of related interactions of fqs with ps during the adsorption may follow an order of π π conjugation ea for the fq adsorbed aged ps the synchronous maps showed seven main auto peaks at 1030 1375 1453 1491 1603 1740 and 3440 cm 1 along the diagonal line which could be ascribed to the peaks of c o c oh c h aromatic ring skeleton c c o c o and oh respectively as shown in figs 3d and s9c d the higher intensity values of o c o and o h peaks indicate the formation of more o containing groups during the aging through oxidation according to noda s rules a negative signal was shown for cross peak ψ 3040 3440 as illustrated in tables s6 7 this indicates that the peak at 3440 cm 1 occurred prior to the peaks at 3040 cm 1 similarly the sequential order in the adsorption of fqs by aged ps was as 1491 aromatic ring skeleton 1453 c h 1030 c o 1603 c c 1375 c oh 1740 o c o the finding here indicates that the related interaction of fq with ps follows the order of π π conjugation ea the xps analysis was used for further analysis of the adsorption mechanism the wide scan xps spectra of all ps before adsorption given in fig 4 a b showed that the virgin and aged ps mainly contained elements c o and n after the adsorption the contents of o and n became higher table s2 suggesting the successful loading of cip and ofl onto the ps as shown in fig 4c the high resolution scan of c1s spectra of virgin ps can be decomposed to three peaks which can be assigned to c c c h 284 8 ev c o 286 09 ev and π π 291 61 ev bond respectively according to the references given in literature lin et al 2021 liu et al 2022a after the adsorption of cip or ofl the be of c o bond slightly moved to a higher shift suggesting the participation of c o groups in the adsorption as an electron donating group furthermore the be of the π π bond shifted from 291 61 to 291 71 ev after the adsorption of cip and 291 68 ev after the adsorption of ofl respectively this implies that the π π conjugation between the benzene rings of ps and the benzene rings of the cip or ofl may occur in adsorption process for the aged ps a new peak at be of 288 09 ev assigned to c o bond appeared and the content of c o bond increased compared to that of the virgin ps as shown in fig 4d and table s8 further confirming the formation of the o containing groups cooh during the aging more importantly the new appeared peak c o occurred and an the obvious shift to higher be was seen namely from 288 09 ev to 288 19 ev after the cip adsorption and 288 36 ev after the ofl adsorption the similar phenomenon was also observed for the c o bond these indicate that o containing functional groups were formed during the aging as electron donor played an important role via ea in the adsorption these results further confirm that the aging can enhance the hydrophilicity of ps with more o containing groups and further increase the adsorption capacity of cip and ofl as shown in fig 4e f the high resolution scan of o1s spectra of virgin ps and aged ps can be divided into two peaks which can correspondingly be assigned to oh and c o c o respectively the intensity of both peaks in the presence of aged ps was much higher than that in the virgin ps after the adsorption of cip or ofl the be of c o c o group shifted to a slightly higher value further confirming the involvement of ea in the adsorption process the be of oh group also showed small changes after the adsorption suggesting the involvement of hb in the adsorption this finding was consistent with that from the ftir study 3 7 quantitative analysis the quantitative analysis for ea hb and π π conjugation was conducted based on the adsorption behaviors the ph range could be roughly divided into four stages 3 0 5 0 5 0 8 0 8 0 10 0 and 10 0 12 0 respectively as shown in fig 5 at ph 10 0 12 0 the species of fq was mainly in the form of fq and the surface of virgin or aged ps was negatively charged e g ps coo as a result the ea and hb hardly occurred at the ph range leading to the significantly lower adsorption herein the π π conjugation contributes around 90 100 to the overall adsorption at 10 0 ph 12 0 as shown in fig 6 at ph 3 0 5 0 the contribution of ea to the adsorption was extremely low due to the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged ps and the dominant species fq which accounted for about 20 30 for fqs onto the virgin and aged ps fig 6 the π π conjugation interaction contributed only 5 10 for the overall adsorption thus hb was the main cause for the uptake of above 60 in this ph range furthermore the adsorption capacities were positively correlated with the content of o containing groups in ps i e virgin ps versus aged ps indicating the occurrence of hb mainly between the amino and or carboxyl groups of fqs and carboxyl groups of ps according to eqs 1 and 2 1 ps cooh hooc fqs ps coo h ohoc fqs 2 ps cooh n h fqs ps coo h nh fqs 3 ps cooh nh 2 cip ps coho h n h cip the higher cip adsorption could be due to the formation of additional hb between the secondary amino groups of cip and ps according to eq 3 which was not available for ofl the finding that the contribution rate of hb in the cip adsorption was higher than the ofl adsorption further confirmed the above conclusion at ph 5 0 8 0 the ps became negatively charged while cip and ofl mainly existed in the forms of fq fq and fq0 the adsorption capacities of cip and ofl on virgin and aged ps achieved the maximum at ph 5 0 mainly due to the co occurrence of hb and ea as shown in eqs 4 and 5 notably the ea contributed about 50 60 more than other two effects for the overall adsorption under this ph range fig 6 the hb was suppressed with contributions around 30 40 of the total adsorption 4 ps co o n h fqs ps co o n h fqs 5 ps co o n h fq s ps co o n h fq s the observation that the adsorption capacities of cip on ps were than ofl can be due to their difference in pka values of which more fq fq and fq0 species of cip existed at the same ph condition because of the larger pka of cip than ofl consequently more cip molecules could easily interact with ps via the strong ea which could be proved by the higher contribution of ea to the total adsorption fig 6a d more importantly negative charge assisted hb cahb given in eq 6 beside the ordinary hb ohb could occur at this ph range cahb reportedly happened when hb donors and acceptors had similar ionization constants δpka pka hb donor pka hb acceptor 4 00 kah et al 2017 ling et al 2016 it usually has a higher bond energy than ohb as the δpka of hb donors fq cooh and acceptors ps coo was zero the strong cahb1 can be formed between carboxyl groups of ps and two fqs refer to eq 6 a strong type of cahb on the other hand the difference in molecular structures of cip and ofl should also account for the difference in the uptake the secondary amino groups of cip could form another relatively weak cahb cahb2 a relatively weak type of cahb with coo groups eq 7 which cannot be available for ofl 6 ps co o hooc fqs ps coo h ooc fqs 7 ps co o nh ci p 0 ps coo h n ci p 0 at ph 8 0 10 0 the content of fq increased and the electrostatic repulsion interaction inhibited the adsorption of cip and ofl by ps both ea and cahb1 would also occur for contribution to the adsorption due to existence of partial fq and fq0 species as shown in eqs 5 and 6 the contributions of ea and hb trended to be slightly reduced while the role of π π conjugation was becoming important fig 6 the ea hb and π π conjugation could separately contribute about 30 40 25 40 20 45 to the total adsorption respectively the possible quantitative adsorption mechanisms of cip and ofl on ps is illustrated in scheme 1 the aged ps showed higher adsorption of hocs than the virgin ps the ea hb and π π conjugation devoted together to the adsorption with different contribution degree at four ph regions it can therefore be concluded that the adsorption of hoc on ps may quantitatively be adjusted by controlling the adsorption interactions 4 conclusions in this study the adsorption behavior and mechanisms of two fqs represented by cip and ofl onto the virgin and aged ps were quantitatively studied the aged ps surface contained more cracks and o containing functional groups such as carboxyl groups than the virgin one the kinetics of adsorption of both cip and ofl onto the aged ps increased compared with that for virgin ps due to its larger surface area the adsorption isotherm data were well described by the linear equation a higher affinity between aged ps and fqs was observed the adsorption of fqs was highly ph depended the adsorption increased from ph 3 reached the maximum at ph 5 then started to decrease and finally reached the very low level at ph 10 furthermore the ionic strength significantly inhibited the adsorption due to the competition between the cation s and the fqs for adsorption sites divalent calcium and magnesium ions inhibited the uptake more than monovalent sodium ions the presence of calcium caused more decrease in the adsorption than magnesium the sequential order of important functional groups in the adsorption was determined by 2d ftir cos the quantitative analysis suggested four ph regions on adsorption mechanisms 1 at 3 0 ph 5 0 hb was the main adsorption mechanisms taking above 60 of the overall adsorption 2 at 5 0 ph 8 0 ea and hb played important roles with corresponding contribution about 50 60 and 30 40 respectively 3 at 8 0 ph 10 0 ea was suppressed accounting for 30 40 hb and π π conjugation caused 25 40 and 20 45 respectively 4 at 10 0 ph 12 0 the π π conjugation played the sole key role in the uptake more importantly the higher adsorption of cip than ofl by the ps was attributed to the additional hb and cahb between secondary amino groups of cip and ps and more cationic zwitterions and neutral species of cip due to higher pka declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

15505,the interaction between microplastics mps and hydrophilic organic contaminants hocs in natural water environment has recently raised great public attentions due to the potential toxicity to humans however the quantitative assessment is less studied in this study the interaction between ciprofloxacin cip and ofloxacin ofl two important hocs and virgin and aged polystyrene ps was investigated the aged ps showed higher adsorption rate and capacity than the virgin ps due to its larger surface area and more o containing groups the ph dependent adsorption of cip was higher than ofl on both virgin and aged ps the maximum adsorption for both hocs occurred at ph 5 the sequential orders of functional groups for the adsorption were discovered according to the study by the 2d correlation fourier transform infrared spectroscopy several mechanisms existed for the interaction 1 at 3 0 ph 5 0 the electrostatic attraction ea was inhibited while h bond hb was dominant accounting for 60 of the total uptake 2 at 5 0 ph 8 0 the contribution of ea increased to around 50 60 while hb decreased to 30 40 3 at 8 0 ph 10 0 ea hb and π π conjugation caused 30 40 25 40 and 20 45 of the total uptake respectively 4 at 10 0 ph 12 0 π π conjugation accounted for 90 100 notably higher adsorption of cip was mainly attributed to the presence of secondary amino groups and its higher pka value correspondingly leading to the additional ordinary hb and negative charge assisted hb and ea interactions with ps this study further provides clear evidences on the risk of mps and hocs on humans and aqueous living organisms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ofloxacin ciprofloxacin electrostatic attraction negative charge assisted hydrogen bond two dimensional correlation fourier transform infrared spectroscopy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction recently microplastics mps commonly defined as the plastic matters with a diameter 5 mm have attracted more attention due to their ubiquitous existence and wide distribution difficulty in degradation potential risks to humans and most importantly increasing public concerns tirkey and upadhyay 2021 li et al 2021 koh et al 2022 owing to the fine sizes the ingestion of mps by amphipods lugworms seabirds shark and fishes through the food chain was reported luo et al 2022 the mps acted as the carriers for such harmful hydrophobic organic chemicals as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah and hydrophobic antibiotics and heavy metals li et al 2018 llorca et al 2018 liu et al 2022b fu et al 2021b the contaminant loaded mps may enter the food web act as a source of mp based complex pollution and eventually cause higher toxicity to humans and organisms sighicelli et al 2018 the organics from aged mps may leach out to waters hence the concentrations of disinfection byproducts were reportedly increased koh et al 2022 therefore it is of importance to study the adsorption behavior and mechanisms adsorption by mps can be for both hydrophobic organic pollutant and hydrophilic organic contaminants hocs such as most pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps sun et al 2022 yang et al 2022a generally the adsorption of hocs is dependent upon properties of mps and hocs given a certain type of mps the surface properties especially surface morphology and chemistry played key roles on the adsorption fu et al 2021a due to the changes in surface properties caused by aging process the adsorption behavior onto the aged mps would become different from the virgin mps that are commonly studied and reported aging in natural environment would cause formation of cracks and voids on mps wang et al 2021b the new o containing functional groups appeared under such conditions as weathering uv exposure and biological degradation ren et al 2021 the newly formed o containing groups on the aged mps significantly affected the adsorption of hocs by the interactions between o containing groups and functional groups of hocs liu et al 2019 yilimulati et al 2021 additionally the aging may enhance the hydrophilicity of surfaces leading to higher adsorption of hydrophilic organic matters wang et al 2021a for example the adsorption of antibiotics namely ciprofloxacin cip log kow 0 28 onto the aged polystyrene ps and polyvinyl chloride pvc was more than that onto the virgin ones liu et al 2019 furthermore the mps have different behavior in adsorption of organic contaminants with different hydrophilicity such as tetracycline tc sulfamethoxazole smx and norfloxacin nor guo and wang 2019 yu et al 2020b zhang et al 2021 the reported studies were limited to conceptual mechanisms on the uptake of hocs while very limited information is available on the mechanisms in molecular level and the quantitative evaluation for instance the influence of molecular structure and properties of antibiotics with similar pka and structure on the adsorption was not well addressed fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir can only provide the general information on the changes in the chemical structures of mps due to the adsorption rather than the detailed information on the change in functional groups of the mps abdulla et al 2010 a powerful analysis technique 2d correlation ftir 2d ftir cos can accurately unveil the changes in functional groups due to physical and chemical interactions with several successful reported studies e g interaction of nanomaterials and proteins šašić et al 2005 chen et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 guo et al 2019a recently it was used to study the interactions between mps and contaminants ding et al 2020 guo et al 2020 therefore this study was aimed at the quantitative study on the influence of molecular structure and properties of cip and ofloxacin ofl on the adsorption on the virgin and aged ps they were selected as they have wide applications and high solubility in water and frequently detected in water environments liang et al 2022 yang et al 2022b they belong to fluoroquinolones fqs antibiotics and have similar aromatic skeleton but different functional branch structure and hydrophilicity logkow values of 0 28 and 0 39 for cip and ofl respectively as shown in table s1 ps was selected due to its large production and use as typical non fiber plastics and common presence in aquatic environments chen et al 2022 ho et al 2020 the adsorption kinetics and isotherm and effects of ph and co existing ions on the uptake were studied the mechanisms for the adsorption of cip and ofl onto virgin and aged ps were investigated by 2d ftir cos and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analyses it was anticipated that the mechanisms for adsorption of hocs can be better understood and the information on potential toxicity can be obtained 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the ps with sizes of 80 150 μ m was purchased from guangdong zhongcheng plastic chemical factory since mps with size smaller than 200 μ m were abundant with high percentage in natural water han et al 2020 cip and ofl with the purity above 98 were purchased from beijing solarbio technology co ltd sodium chloride sodium hydroxide hydrochloric acid anhydrous calcium chloride and magnesium chloride of analytical grade were purchased from chengdu kelong chemical reagent factory the aging process of ps was described in section 1 1 in supporting information si 2 2 characterization of ps the surface morphology of the virgin and aged ps was studied by the scanning electron microscope sem zeiss gemini 300 the surface chemistry of ps was studied by the ftir spectrum two and 2d ftir cos technique and the xps thermo sciencetific k alpha the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area ssa of ps was determined by the surface area analyzer microactive for asap 2460 through n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 k the crystallinity of different ps was determined by the x ray diffraction analyzer xrd smart lab and the degree of crystallinity of ps was calculated by jade6 software the water contact angle wca of the ps particles was measured by a contact angle analyzer fangrui jyc 2 shanghai china the point of zero charge phpzc of the ps samples was measured according to the reported approach zhang et al 2013 2 3 adsorption experiments all adsorption experiments were carried out by brown glass bottles in triplicate so as to minimize the experimental errors meanwhile the blank experiments were conducted at the same conditions for all adsorption experiments to ensure the experimental accuracy to simulate the natural water all solutions contained 0 01 m nacl as ionic strength background the adsorption kinetics adsorption isotherm effect of ph and effect of co existing ions were studied after the adsorption the water samples were collected and filtrated by a 0 45 μ m filter the cip or ofl concentration was tested using the uv spectrophotometer hach dr6000 at wavelength of 275 and 293 nm respectively yu et al 2020a the details of the experiments were given in section 1 2 in si 2 4 quantitative analysis quantitative analysis of adsorption mechanisms at different ph regions was carried out by using two sets of the cip or ofl solutions prepared with concentrations of nacl solution 0 and 0 25 m of which the solution ph was set in a range of 3 0 to 12 0 when the solution was in the absence of nacl all the adsorption interactions may occur and the adsorption was regarded as total adsorption or overall adsorption the solution containing high nacl concentration may hinder the electrostatic attraction ea so as to separate the contribution of ea from the total adsorption gao et al 2022 therefore the adsorption was considered as the contribution of total ea at ph 10 and under 0 25 m nacl both ps and all fq species were negatively charged the ea and h bond hb interactions were hindered to separate the contributions of both from the total adsorption therefore the adsorption could be considered as the contribution of total ea hb the detailed information on the method was given in fig s1 in si other procedures were the same as those in adsorption isotherm experiment given in section 1 2 in si 2 5 analytical method 2d ftir cos was used to investigate the changes in the functional groups during the adsorption of cip and ofl in general the process could produce two types of 2d maps that are named as synchronous and asynchronous maps by using origin 2019 software originlab usa the φ x1 x2 obtained from synchronous maps reveals the similarity of the sequential variations in spectral intensities the ψ x1 x2 obtained from asynchronous maps composed of off diagonal cross peaks suggests the difference in the time dependent sequential variations in spectral intensities according to the reported approach noda et al 2000 a positive cross peak ψ x1 x2 indicates that the change in spectral intensity of x1 occurs prior to x2 while a negative cross peak suggests that the intensity change occurs at x2 before x1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mps fig 1 a e show that the color of virgin ps was white and became light yellow after being exposed under the uv light suggesting the surface degradation of the ps due to the aging the sem images in fig s2a b show that the ps particles were irregular and uneven with the size of 80 150 μ m after the aging uv treatment the surface of ps got more cracks and striped folds as shown in fig 1f resulting in a small increase in the ssa bet of ps from 0 162 m2 g to 0 627 m2 g table s2 the surface chemistry of virgin and aged ps particles was studied by ftir and xps analyses as shown in fig s3 the characteristic peaks at 1745 1312 1493 2925 and 3025 cm 1 could be assigned to the vibrations of coo c o aromatic ring skeleton ch2 and ch on the benzene ring for both virgin and aged ps respectively according to the references liu et al 2019 wang et al 2022 the peak at around 3450 cm 1 could be assigned to the hydroxyl bond its signal from the aged ps was much stronger than the virgin ps this finding indicates that such o containing groups as cooh groups were formed during the uv exposure the xps results given in table s2 indicate that the o element content of ps particles increased after the aging which also confirms the formation of o containing groups onto the surface of ps due to the uv exposure under the uv exposure the surface functional groups of ps were oxidized indicating the occurrence of aging as reported hüffer and hofmann 2016 the increase in specific surface area and content of o containing groups may introduce more active sites in the aged ps which could be beneficial for the adsorption of fqs as suggested in the literature liu et al 2019 the phpzc was determined with the results shown in table s2 the value of phpzc of aged ps became slightly lower than that of virgin ps the difference between virgin and aged ps may be due to the increase in the content of o containing functional groups which could be easily ionized and become negatively charged at a relatively lower ph liu et al 2019 at the solution ph phpzc the surface of ps became positively charged at ph phpzc the surface of ps became negatively charged an indicator of the surface hydrophilicity the wca was determined for both virgin and aged ps table s2 shows that the aged ps has a much lower wca than virgin ps indicating the enhancement in the surface hydrophilicity of ps due to aging such enhancement in the hydrophilicity of ps may be due to the increase in the intensity of o containing functional groups which would further affect the adsorption of hocs fan et al 2021 liu et al 2019 3 2 adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics fig s5 shows the adsorption history for the fqs on virgin and aged ps the trend of adsorption behavior of cip on ps was similar to that of ofl at 25 c the adsorption of both cip and ofl onto virgin ps occurred quickly within the first 2 h and gradually slowed down and reached the equilibrium at contact time of 12 h the above adsorption kinetics of fqs is similar with the reported findings in the adsorption of fqs by other mps sun et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 for example about 90 of equilibrium adsorption of nor by ps and polyethylene pe was reached within 12 h sun et al 2022 besides the adsorption of nor by four types of mps could take place quickly within the first 5 h around 80 of the ultimate adsorption and achieved the equilibrium at the contact time of 18 h zhang et al 2021 as shown in table 1 and fig s5 the adsorption onto the aged ps was faster than the virgin ps the equilibrium adsorption capacities of the aged ps were much higher than those of the virgin ps which could be due to more cracks and adsorption interactions with the aged ps as demonstrated in section 3 1 the cracks and o containing groups may likely accelerate achieving the adsorption equilibrium of hocs liu et al 2019 additionally when the temperature was increased from 15 to 35 c the adsorption rate increased and the equilibrium adsorption was achieved at the shorter contact time e g 8 h for the case of 35 c which may result from the facilitated molecular thermal motions at higher temperature and the faster diffusion of adsorbate bao et al 2021 sun et al 2013 meanwhile the equilibrium adsorption of cip and ofl onto the virgin ps at high temperature decreased for example the adsorption amount of cip and pfl at 35 c was less than that at 25 c by 73 6 and 38 8 respectively these results indicate that the higher temperature improved the adsorption rate but reduced the adsorption capacity which could be confirmed by the adsorption thermodynamic results given in section 2 1 in si the adsorption history of cip and ofl onto the mps was analyzed by the pseudo first and second order equations the experimental data of ofl adsorption on the virgin ps was well fit by both equations with higher regression coefficient r2 values of 0 934 0 981 as shown in table 1 on the other hand the data for the cip adsorption onto the virgin ps was slightly better fitted by the pseudo second order equation according to the r2 values whereas the adsorption capacities obtained by the pseudo first order equation were much closer to the experimental data however for the aged ps the adsorption kinetics of cip and ofl by the aged ps were better fitted by the pseudo second order equation and the adsorption capacities were closer to the adsorption data furthermore the higher k2 values obtained from the adsorption conditions with aged ps and higher temperature suggest that the aging process or high temperature enhanced the adsorption rate of both fqs onto the ps particles 3 3 adsorption isotherm the adsorption isotherm of the cip and ofl onto the virgin and aged ps is shown in fig s6 the aged ps displayed a much higher adsorption of cip and ofl than the virgin ps by 34 2 for cip and 49 9 for ofl under the same initial concentration of 30 mg l a recent paper also illustrated that weathered ps had a higher adsorption affinity for hocs e g cip than the virgin ps because of the rougher surface and stronger hydrophilicity of the weathered ps particles yang et al 2022a the aging process can change the properties of mps via increasing the contents of o containing functional groups and enhancing the hydrophilicity of mps particles thus improving the adsorption interactions with hocs liu et al 2019 for the aged ps the formation of cracks and increase in contents of o containing functional groups caused more available adsorption sites and relatively hydrophilic surfaces as a result the aged ps had better adsorption ability of cip and ofl than the virgin ps interestingly despite that cip and ofl have similar pka values and structure the maximum adsorption capacity of cip on ps was slightly higher than that of ofl namely 459 8 µg g vs 395 25 µg g by the virgin ps and 617 0 µg g vs 592 5 µg g by the aged ps however ofl is slightly hydrophilic than cip when one compares their logkow values such results indirectly indicate that the hydrophilicity is not the dominant factor determining the adsorption behavior of two fqs onto ps the molecule structure and speciation of cip and ofl in water environment may play roles in adsorption which is in line with the suggestion in the literature gao et al 2021 at ph 7 0 more fq and fq species of cip existed in the water than those of ofl due to the higher pka value shown in fig 2 c d which could be easily adsorbed by negative charged ps via ea therefore the ps can adsorb more cip than ofl to better understanding the adsorption behavior the linear freundlich and langmuir isotherms were used to describe the data as shown in fig s6 and table 2 the linear model can well describe the experimental data with a high r2 value 0 92 this suggests that the partition effect plays an important role in the adsorption of cip and ofl similarly it was hypothesized that the partition effect was associated with hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic interaction guo et al 2019b generally speaking hydrophobic organic matters can attach onto surface of mps via hydrophobic interactions however as cip logkow 0 28 and ofl logkow 0 39 were hocs gao et al 2021 the hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophilic fqs and ps was limited at ph 7 controlled in the adsorption isotherm study fq or fq0 was the dominant species in the water and the fq could be easily adsorbed on the negatively charged ps surface due the electrostatic attraction ea more importantly the kd values given in table 2 followed the order of aged ps cip aged ps ofl virgin ps cip virgin ps ofl this finding indicates that 1 the aged ps exhibited higher affinity toward these two fqs than the virgin ps 2 both virgin ps and aged ps showed higher adsorption ability of cip than ofl 3 the electrostatic interaction played a key role in the adsorption of hydrophilic organics the adsorption behavior of both antibiotics onto the virgin ps can well be described by langmuir and freundlich isotherms as shown in table 2 freundlich isotherm performed better than or similar to langmuir isotherm in the description of the experimental data the adsorption of antibiotics by ps may be controlled by the multi layer adsorption processes due to the heterogeneous surface with cracks especially for aged ps similar findings were reported in the literature liu et al 2019 3 4 effect of ph on adsorption the ph can greatly affect the adsorption performance by influencing the surface properties of the adsorbent and species of antibiotics in solution zhang et al 2020 fig 2 shows the similar ph dependence for the adsorption of cip and ofl on virgin and aged ps more specifically the adsorption capacities of cip and ofl onto ps increased from ph 3 0 reached the peak at ph around 5 0 and then gradually decreased at high ph range and became much less at ph 10 the highly ph depended adsorption could be attributed to the ph dependance of surface charges of the ps and fqs according to the phpzc of the virgin and aged ps table s2 and the pka values table s1 the values of phpzc of the virgin and aged ps were 4 95 and 4 78 respectively meanwhile the two fqs with similar pka values roughly changed their major existing species from fq fq or fq0 to fq at 3 0 ph 6 0 6 0 ph 8 0 and 8 0 ph 12 as shown in fig 2c d at ph between 3 0 and 4 5 the electrostatic repulsion between fq and positive charged ps could suppress the adsorption as ph was increased the suppression effect became weaken and the ps surface became negatively charged at ph phpzc therefore the ea would occur around ph 5 0 when the ph was increased from 5 0 to 7 0 the adsorption of fqs onto the negatively charged ps gradually decreased as fq species was changed to fq or fq0 as the ph was continuously increased the adsorption greatly dropped due to the electrostatic repulsion effect since the fq or fq0 became fq the results indicate that the electrostatic interaction was obviously involved in the adsorption of the fqs by ps that was also suggested in the literature yilimulati et al 2021 however it was not the only dominant mechanism interestingly at the same ph the adsorption capacity of cip by ps was higher than that of ofl this suggests the involvement of other interactions in addition to electrostatic interactions both cip and ofl have the cooh groups which can form h bond hb with the o containing groups of ps e g cooh groups notably the cip had a secondary amino group that could form additional hb with cooh of ps while it was not available for ofl gao et al 2021 in addition the slightly higher pka value of cip led to more cip and cip species under the same ph than those species of ofl as shown in fig 2c d resulting in more ea of cip than ofl with ps thus the adsorption of cip was higher than that of ofl 3 5 influence of co existing ions on adsorption generally several dissolved salts exist in natural waters and may affect the adsorption of antibiotics figs s7a b and s8 1a b demonstrate that the increase in salinity nacl from 0 05 to 3 significantly reduced the adsorption of both cip and ofl this is in line with the findings reported for other types of mps and contaminants guo et al 2019c wu et al 2020 compared the adsorption capacity under the same salinity the aged ps can adsorb more cip and ofl than the virgin one to further understand the effect of co existing salts the effect of ca2 and mg2 were studied as shown in figs s7c f and s8 1c f the presence of both ca2 and mg2 greatly hindered the adsorption in particular the adsorption of both antibiotics reduced by 87 04 to 95 27 when the concentration of ca2 or mg2 was increased to 100 mg l the reduced adsorption may be caused by the mechanism of ea the increasing cation concentration na ca2 or mg2 could break down the charge balance between fqs and ps system and neutralize the negatively charged ps at ph 7 leading to the suppression of the ea it should be noted that the hinder effect caused by nacl was much less than that by ca2 and mg2 fig s8 1 for example the adsorption of cip onto aged ps was 240 μg g at na 8 56 mm while that was 45 and 125 μg g at ca2 mg2 2 5 mm respectively as divalent cations took more positive charges and thus could much more easily neutralize the negative charges of the ps than monovalent cations the ea interaction between fqs and ps was reduced figs s8 1c f show that at the same molar concentration e g 2 5 mm the presence of calcium caused more inhibition on the adsorption than magnesium in order to find out the reason an equilibrium modeling program mineql 5 0 was used to study the chemical speciation environmental research software 2018 our result showed that both calcium and magnesium existed as free metal form namely ca2 and mg2 thus the charge effect seemed not to play a key role in the adsorption the greater effect from calcium than magnesium was likely due to the higher affinity from calcium for the surface of adsorbent ps typically the affinity between metal and adsorbent follows a common rule metal with higher molecular weight has higher affinity for adsorbent chen and wang 2000 chen 2013 as calcium had a larger molecular weight than magnesium more calcium ions occupied more functional groups of ps as a result less adsorption of hocs occurred at the presence of calcium ion additionally the presence of anionic chloride ion seemed to have less effect on the adsorption as shown in fig s8 2 3 6 adsorption mechanisms the ftir was used to analyze the chemical changes in different ps samples the ftir spectrum of cip loaded virgin ps given in fig s3a shows that the peak at 3439 cm 1 assigned to hydroxyl or hydrogen bonds became stronger than the virgin ps this implies that the hb was related to the adsorption of cip on the virgin ps the similar results were found in the adsorption of cip by ps reported in the literature liu et al 2022a yang et al 2022a the same phenomenon was also observed for the adsorption of ofl onto the virgin ps for the aged ps the hydroxyl or hydrogen bonds at 3442 cm 1 became much stronger after the adsorption fig s3b suggesting the involvement of stronger hb in the adsorption process compared with that by virgin ps the 2d cos analysis was used to resolve ftir spectra of ps the maps synchronous and asynchronous for the fq adsorbed ps with different loading of fqs were obtained in the regions of 1000 1800 cm 1 and 2800 3600 cm 1 the synchronous maps for the fq adsorbed virgin ps given in figs 3 b and s9a b showed seven main auto peaks at 1030 1370 1452 1491 1603 1640 and 3440 cm 1 along the diagonal line which could be assigned to the peaks of c o c oh c h aromatic ring skeleton c c h c o and oh respectively meanwhile the positive signals were found for all the cross peaks this suggests that the cross peaks were synchronously changed in the adsorption according to noda s rules the asynchronous correlation spectra can provide the sequential order of the functional groups in the adsorption ding et al 2020 as illustrated in the asynchronous maps there were significant differences in the cross peaks due to the adsorption tables s4 s5 provide 2d cos data for the fq adsorbed virgin ps a positive signal was shown for cross peaks ψ x1 1640 this indicates that the peak at 1640 cm 1 occurred after all other peaks in addition the cross peak at ψ 3040 3440 was negative suggesting that the functional peak at 3440 cm 1 occurred prior to the peaks at 3040 cm 1 the reaction sequence of the functional groups in the fq adsorption by the virgin ps was as follows 1491 aromatic ring skeleton 1452 c h 1030 c o 1603 c c 1370 c oh 1640 h c o correspondingly the phenyl rings can mainly interact the fqs by π π conjugation while the o containing groups may interact with fqs via ea thus the sequence of related interactions of fqs with ps during the adsorption may follow an order of π π conjugation ea for the fq adsorbed aged ps the synchronous maps showed seven main auto peaks at 1030 1375 1453 1491 1603 1740 and 3440 cm 1 along the diagonal line which could be ascribed to the peaks of c o c oh c h aromatic ring skeleton c c o c o and oh respectively as shown in figs 3d and s9c d the higher intensity values of o c o and o h peaks indicate the formation of more o containing groups during the aging through oxidation according to noda s rules a negative signal was shown for cross peak ψ 3040 3440 as illustrated in tables s6 7 this indicates that the peak at 3440 cm 1 occurred prior to the peaks at 3040 cm 1 similarly the sequential order in the adsorption of fqs by aged ps was as 1491 aromatic ring skeleton 1453 c h 1030 c o 1603 c c 1375 c oh 1740 o c o the finding here indicates that the related interaction of fq with ps follows the order of π π conjugation ea the xps analysis was used for further analysis of the adsorption mechanism the wide scan xps spectra of all ps before adsorption given in fig 4 a b showed that the virgin and aged ps mainly contained elements c o and n after the adsorption the contents of o and n became higher table s2 suggesting the successful loading of cip and ofl onto the ps as shown in fig 4c the high resolution scan of c1s spectra of virgin ps can be decomposed to three peaks which can be assigned to c c c h 284 8 ev c o 286 09 ev and π π 291 61 ev bond respectively according to the references given in literature lin et al 2021 liu et al 2022a after the adsorption of cip or ofl the be of c o bond slightly moved to a higher shift suggesting the participation of c o groups in the adsorption as an electron donating group furthermore the be of the π π bond shifted from 291 61 to 291 71 ev after the adsorption of cip and 291 68 ev after the adsorption of ofl respectively this implies that the π π conjugation between the benzene rings of ps and the benzene rings of the cip or ofl may occur in adsorption process for the aged ps a new peak at be of 288 09 ev assigned to c o bond appeared and the content of c o bond increased compared to that of the virgin ps as shown in fig 4d and table s8 further confirming the formation of the o containing groups cooh during the aging more importantly the new appeared peak c o occurred and an the obvious shift to higher be was seen namely from 288 09 ev to 288 19 ev after the cip adsorption and 288 36 ev after the ofl adsorption the similar phenomenon was also observed for the c o bond these indicate that o containing functional groups were formed during the aging as electron donor played an important role via ea in the adsorption these results further confirm that the aging can enhance the hydrophilicity of ps with more o containing groups and further increase the adsorption capacity of cip and ofl as shown in fig 4e f the high resolution scan of o1s spectra of virgin ps and aged ps can be divided into two peaks which can correspondingly be assigned to oh and c o c o respectively the intensity of both peaks in the presence of aged ps was much higher than that in the virgin ps after the adsorption of cip or ofl the be of c o c o group shifted to a slightly higher value further confirming the involvement of ea in the adsorption process the be of oh group also showed small changes after the adsorption suggesting the involvement of hb in the adsorption this finding was consistent with that from the ftir study 3 7 quantitative analysis the quantitative analysis for ea hb and π π conjugation was conducted based on the adsorption behaviors the ph range could be roughly divided into four stages 3 0 5 0 5 0 8 0 8 0 10 0 and 10 0 12 0 respectively as shown in fig 5 at ph 10 0 12 0 the species of fq was mainly in the form of fq and the surface of virgin or aged ps was negatively charged e g ps coo as a result the ea and hb hardly occurred at the ph range leading to the significantly lower adsorption herein the π π conjugation contributes around 90 100 to the overall adsorption at 10 0 ph 12 0 as shown in fig 6 at ph 3 0 5 0 the contribution of ea to the adsorption was extremely low due to the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged ps and the dominant species fq which accounted for about 20 30 for fqs onto the virgin and aged ps fig 6 the π π conjugation interaction contributed only 5 10 for the overall adsorption thus hb was the main cause for the uptake of above 60 in this ph range furthermore the adsorption capacities were positively correlated with the content of o containing groups in ps i e virgin ps versus aged ps indicating the occurrence of hb mainly between the amino and or carboxyl groups of fqs and carboxyl groups of ps according to eqs 1 and 2 1 ps cooh hooc fqs ps coo h ohoc fqs 2 ps cooh n h fqs ps coo h nh fqs 3 ps cooh nh 2 cip ps coho h n h cip the higher cip adsorption could be due to the formation of additional hb between the secondary amino groups of cip and ps according to eq 3 which was not available for ofl the finding that the contribution rate of hb in the cip adsorption was higher than the ofl adsorption further confirmed the above conclusion at ph 5 0 8 0 the ps became negatively charged while cip and ofl mainly existed in the forms of fq fq and fq0 the adsorption capacities of cip and ofl on virgin and aged ps achieved the maximum at ph 5 0 mainly due to the co occurrence of hb and ea as shown in eqs 4 and 5 notably the ea contributed about 50 60 more than other two effects for the overall adsorption under this ph range fig 6 the hb was suppressed with contributions around 30 40 of the total adsorption 4 ps co o n h fqs ps co o n h fqs 5 ps co o n h fq s ps co o n h fq s the observation that the adsorption capacities of cip on ps were than ofl can be due to their difference in pka values of which more fq fq and fq0 species of cip existed at the same ph condition because of the larger pka of cip than ofl consequently more cip molecules could easily interact with ps via the strong ea which could be proved by the higher contribution of ea to the total adsorption fig 6a d more importantly negative charge assisted hb cahb given in eq 6 beside the ordinary hb ohb could occur at this ph range cahb reportedly happened when hb donors and acceptors had similar ionization constants δpka pka hb donor pka hb acceptor 4 00 kah et al 2017 ling et al 2016 it usually has a higher bond energy than ohb as the δpka of hb donors fq cooh and acceptors ps coo was zero the strong cahb1 can be formed between carboxyl groups of ps and two fqs refer to eq 6 a strong type of cahb on the other hand the difference in molecular structures of cip and ofl should also account for the difference in the uptake the secondary amino groups of cip could form another relatively weak cahb cahb2 a relatively weak type of cahb with coo groups eq 7 which cannot be available for ofl 6 ps co o hooc fqs ps coo h ooc fqs 7 ps co o nh ci p 0 ps coo h n ci p 0 at ph 8 0 10 0 the content of fq increased and the electrostatic repulsion interaction inhibited the adsorption of cip and ofl by ps both ea and cahb1 would also occur for contribution to the adsorption due to existence of partial fq and fq0 species as shown in eqs 5 and 6 the contributions of ea and hb trended to be slightly reduced while the role of π π conjugation was becoming important fig 6 the ea hb and π π conjugation could separately contribute about 30 40 25 40 20 45 to the total adsorption respectively the possible quantitative adsorption mechanisms of cip and ofl on ps is illustrated in scheme 1 the aged ps showed higher adsorption of hocs than the virgin ps the ea hb and π π conjugation devoted together to the adsorption with different contribution degree at four ph regions it can therefore be concluded that the adsorption of hoc on ps may quantitatively be adjusted by controlling the adsorption interactions 4 conclusions in this study the adsorption behavior and mechanisms of two fqs represented by cip and ofl onto the virgin and aged ps were quantitatively studied the aged ps surface contained more cracks and o containing functional groups such as carboxyl groups than the virgin one the kinetics of adsorption of both cip and ofl onto the aged ps increased compared with that for virgin ps due to its larger surface area the adsorption isotherm data were well described by the linear equation a higher affinity between aged ps and fqs was observed the adsorption of fqs was highly ph depended the adsorption increased from ph 3 reached the maximum at ph 5 then started to decrease and finally reached the very low level at ph 10 furthermore the ionic strength significantly inhibited the adsorption due to the competition between the cation s and the fqs for adsorption sites divalent calcium and magnesium ions inhibited the uptake more than monovalent sodium ions the presence of calcium caused more decrease in the adsorption than magnesium the sequential order of important functional groups in the adsorption was determined by 2d ftir cos the quantitative analysis suggested four ph regions on adsorption mechanisms 1 at 3 0 ph 5 0 hb was the main adsorption mechanisms taking above 60 of the overall adsorption 2 at 5 0 ph 8 0 ea and hb played important roles with corresponding contribution about 50 60 and 30 40 respectively 3 at 8 0 ph 10 0 ea was suppressed accounting for 30 40 hb and π π conjugation caused 25 40 and 20 45 respectively 4 at 10 0 ph 12 0 the π π conjugation played the sole key role in the uptake more importantly the higher adsorption of cip than ofl by the ps was attributed to the additional hb and cahb between secondary amino groups of cip and ps and more cationic zwitterions and neutral species of cip due to higher pka declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

15506,biofilms in water storage systems may harbor pathogens that threaten public health chemical disinfectants are marginally effective in eradicating biofilms due to limited penetration and often generate harmful disinfection byproducts to enhance biofouling mitigation in household water storage tanks we encapsulated bacteriophages phages in chitosan crosslinked with tri polyphosphate and 3 glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane phages served as self propagating green biocides that exclusively infect bacteria this ph responsive encapsulation 244 11 nm enabled autonomous release of phages in response to acidic ph associated with biofilms corroborated by confocal microscopy with ph indicator dye snarf 4f but otherwise remained stable in ph neutral tap water for one month encapsulated phages instantly bind to plasma treated plastic and fiberglass surfaces providing a facile coating method that protects surfaces highly vulnerable to biofouling biofilm formation assays were conducted in tap water amended with 200 mg l glucose to accelerate growth and attachment of pseudomonas aeruginosa an opportunistic pathogen commonly associated with biofilms in drinking water distribution and storage systems biofilms formation on plastic surfaces coated with encapsulated phages decreased to only 6 7 0 2 on a biomass basis relative to the uncoated controls likewise biofilm surface area coverage 4 8 0 2 log cfu mm2 and live dead fluorescence ratio 1 80 were also lower than the controls 6 6 0 2 log cfu mm2 and live dead ratio of 11 05 overall this study offers proof of concept of a chemical free easily implementable approach to control problematic biofilm dwelling bacteria and highlights benefits of this bottom up biofouling control approach that obviates the challenge of poor biofilm penetration by biocides graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ph responsive controlled release biofilm control crosslinked chitosan plasma treatment biopolymer data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction biofilms are the preferred lifestyle for most bacteria including those present in drinking water treatment distribution and storage systems flemming and wuertz 2019 this poses significant challenges for public and infrastructure health since biofilms may harbor pathogenic bacteria and promote biofouling and corrosion flemming et al 2016 biofilms are notoriously difficult to eradicate due to limited penetration by chemical disinfectants which incidentally may produce harmful disinfection byproducts dbps bridier et al 2011 mechanical approaches are occasionally used to remove biofilms but these work only for accessible surfaces which is not the case for much of the water infrastructure and are generally energy intensive thus there is a need for alternative chemical free eco friendly approaches to mitigate biofilm formation bacteriophages phages are green biocides that can exclusively and selectively target pathogenic and other problematic bacteria strains without producing harmful disinfection byproducts de jonge et al 2019 hicks et al 2020 due to their biological nature phages can self propagate exponentially resulting in cost effective bactericidal capacity even with low initial dosage yu et al 2019 this self propagating nature also makes phage production easily scalable and relatively inexpensive anam et al 2020 luong et al 2020 thus phage technology could be suitable for some resource limited areas with infrastructure limitations hindering conventional biocontrol approaches phages can also work synergistically with other biofilm control approaches to supplement current treatment methods and curtail chemical use stachler et al 2021 encapsulation technology which is commonly used to protect medicinal drugs and other therapeutics from degradation and enable targeted release at desired locations may offer opportunities to mitigate biofilm formation by theoretically facilitating on demand autonomous release of phages triggered by the presence of bacteria herrera et al 2021 current technology is focused on oral drug delivery to the intestines using a ph responsive encapsulation that is stable at low ph but releases the contents at slightly basic ph these encapsulations protect the medical drug cargo from degradation in the low ph of the stomach and enables controlled release in the slightly basic ph of the intestines centurion et al 2021 du et al 2015 liu et al 2017 this drug encapsulation technology for targeted delivery is underutilized outside of medicine by reversing the ph responsiveness of these encapsulations to protect the cargo at the slightly basic ph of tap water and release it into the acidic ph of biofilms which was demonstrated to be possible for chemical compounds chen et al 2018 we could mitigate wasteful release of phages and target where nascent biofilms form with greater precision note that two major limitations of using free phages for biofilm control is the general lack of targeted delivery to where biofilms form and poor penetration into the biofilm thus encapsulation technology which has been used for targeted delivery of chemical compounds to biofilms peng et al 2021 shows promise for enabling targeted delivery of phages to nascent biofilms accordingly we envision a system for encapsulating various phages which could be switched out and rotated as needed to ensure the phages are fit for purpose as coatings to selectively protect vulnerable surfaces and attack biofilms from the bottom up to circumvent poor penetration from the top this approach would serve as an alternative or supplement to chemical disinfectants which bluntly target bacteria in the bulk volume of water storage systems in this study we demonstrate an autonomous bottom up approach to mitigate nascent biofilms using an encapsulated phage coating a phage isolated from wastewater as previously described yu et al 2019 was used against the opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa a common biofilm forming bacterium prevalent in water distribution and storage systems chao et al 2015 tanner et al 2019 additionally pseudomonas spp are early colonizers that facilitate subsequent attachment by other bacterial species in chlorinated drinking water distribution systems douterelo et al 2014 liu et al 2016 and commonly harbor antibiotic resistance genes making them an important target for biocontrol haller et al 2018 mortimer et al 2018 phages were encapsulated in a responsive coating made of chitosan crosslinked with tri polyphosphate tpp and 3 glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane gptms we examined the long term stability and efficacy of the encapsulated phages to mitigate biofilm formation in tap water storage systems a facile coating process was developed to attach the encapsulated phages to surfaces where biofilm formation is most likely to occur e g bottom of water storage tanks that are commonly used by households in resource limited areas overall we offer proof of concept that autonomous release of bactericidal phages from their encapsulation triggered by the presence of bacteria acts as a preventative treatment against biofilm formation to mitigate bacterial reservoirs that could cause water borne infectious diseases 2 experimental methods 2 1 materials acetic acid sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl were purchased from sigma aldrich the chitosan used in this study was 85 deacetylated and purchased from thermo fisher sodium tri polyphosphate tpp 85 pure was from acros organics and 3 glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane gptms 97 pure was from tokyo chemical industry solutions were prepared in deionized water di for biofilm viability assays syto 9 5mm stock was from invitrogen and propidium iodide 20 mm was from sigma aldrich phosphate buffered solution pbs was made using pbs tablets from vwr life science snarf 4f 5 and 6 carboxylic acid was obtained from thermo fisher for biofilm ph measurements hunter and beveridge 2005 schlafer et al 2015 pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 atcc 15692 was cultured in tryptic soy broth tsb bd difco at 30 c the phage peb2 used in this study infecting p aeruginosa pao1 was isolated from wastewater as previously described and characterized to be around 86 nm yu et al 2019 phage stocks were suspended in sulfate magnesium sm buffer as previously described and stored at 4 c zuo et al 2021 double layer plaque assays were done using a base layer of dextrose bd difco plate count agar and a top layer of tryptic soy agar 0 3 wt vol agar 2 2 encapsulating phages in crosslinked chitosan nanospheres under continuous magnetic stirring at room temperature 5 mg ml of chitosan was dissolved into a 2 v v acetic acid aqueous solution then the ph was adjusted to 4 5 using naoh and phages were added to a final concentration of 109 plaque forming units ml pfu ml two aqueous solutions of 5 wt v tpp and 5 v v gptms were added together 1 ml each drop wise into 10 ml of the continuously stirred chitosan phage solution completing the encapsulation process the resulting suspension was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min to collect the encapsulated phages which were washed three times with ph 7 tap water and stored in 10 ml of ph 7 tap water at room temperature and shaken vigorously before use empty encapsulation suspension was made following the same steps but without addition of phages to control for the effect of the encapsulation itself synthesis of encapsulated phages is limited by concentration of encapsulating nanomaterials i e chitosan tpp and gtpms however when the chitosan concentration is about 10 mg ml twice the concentration used in this study the solution becomes too viscous and difficult to work with since it cannot be stirred magnetically with a stir bar thus viscosity of the chitosan solution limits the concentration of phages that can be encapsulated furthermore while the encapsulated phages are protected from the acidic ph of the chitosan solution ph 4 5 the unencapsulated free phages are continuously degraded by this acidic ph therefore the concentration of phages added during production 109 pfu ml is oversaturated to ensure maximum encapsulation however this results in around just 1 of phages used in production that can be released as viable phages 107 pfu ml from the encapsulation further optimization is still required to improve this low percentage though compared to encapsulating more expensive therapeutic drugs this is less consequential since the exponential self propagation of phages makes phage production fast and relatively inexpensive anam et al 2020 luong et al 2020 2 3 coating plasma treated surfaces with encapsulated phages high density polyethylene hdpe from nalgene was cut into discs 35 and 16 mm in diameter that could be fitted into individual wells of 6 and 24 well plates respectively the hdpe discs were wiped with ethanol to clean the surfaces as a pretreatment measure plasma treatment was then performed for 5 min using fischione model 1020 plasma cleaner with 25 oxygen 75 argon gas mix the plasma treated hdpe discs were dip coated into 1 ml suspension of either encapsulated phages or empty encapsulation which instantly formed a coating 2 4 biofilm biomass measurements the smaller 16 mm hdpe discs fitted for 24 well plates used for other experiments in this study did not form enough total biofilm biomass to facilitate quantification thus larger 35 mm hdpe discs were used these disks were coated with encapsulated phages or with empty encapsulations or left uncoated as controls and were taped to the bottom of each well in a 6 well plate then tap water 5 ml unfiltered and used as is amended with 200 mg l glucose and 250 μl of a p aeruginosa pao1 overnight culture 0 4 od600nm was added to each well and samples were collected after 3 days at 30 c to quantify total biofilm biomass the concentration of p aeruginosa and glucose used for biofilm experiments is relatively high for water systems but allowed us to work with sufficient biomass to more easily quantify the effect of phages and limit potential interactions between phages and non target bacterial species a modified crystal violet cv assay was used for biomass quantification cv is often used for colorimetric quantification of biofilm biomass azeredo et al 2017 but it binds to the chitosan coating as well as to the biofilm confounding results thus biofilms were first resuspended to separate them from the chitosan coating this procedure was used for all treatments and the biofilm biomass measurements are presented as percentages relative to the uncoated control briefly biofilms were resuspended into 1 ml pbs by sonication at 40 khz for 5min in a bath sonicator branson danbury ct mixed by pipetting up and down 10 times and transferred into a 1 5 ml centrifuge tube then 50 μl of the resuspended biofilm in pbs was set aside for enumeration using viable plate counts next 50 μl of a 1 wt vol cv aqueous solution was added to reach a concentration of 0 05 wt vol cv in the tubes after 15 min incubation in the dark at room temperature the tube was centrifuged at 13 000 g for 5 min to pellet the resuspended biofilm the pellet was washed 5 times with pbs to remove residual cv in the supernatant then 1 ml of 70 ethanol was added and the tube was incubated again for 15 min and inverted 10 times to release the cv in the biofilm pellet finally 200 μl from each tube was transferred into a clean 96 well plate and absorbance at 595 nm was measured using a tecan infinite 200 pro plate reader 2 5 live dead cells staining to assess biofilms via live dead staining biofilms were grown on 16 mm hdpe discs coated with empty encapsulation or encapsulated phages or uncoated controls these discs were taped into individual wells of a 24 well plate and submerged in 2 ml tap water ph 7 6 amended with 200 mg l glucose and inoculated with 100 μl of a p aeruginosa overnight culture 0 4 od600nm after 3 days at 30 c media and planktonic cells were pipetted out of each well and the remaining biofilm was washed by gently adding and removing 1 ml pbs to remove any remaining planktonic cells the staining solution 200 μl of 7 5 μm syto 9 and 30 μm propidium iodide in di was added to each well and the plate was incubated in the dark for 15 min to avoid the hdpe discs from interfering with measurements the biofilm was resuspended into the staining solution which was then transferred to a clean 96 well black walled plate using tecan infinite 200 pro plate reader with excitation wavelength at 485 nm fluorescence intensities at 535 nm syto 9 green emission for live cells and 635 nm propidium iodide red emission for dead cells were measured the ratio of live to dead cells within each individual biofilm on uncoated and coated surfaces was obtained by dividing the fluorescence intensity corresponding to green live cells by that of the red dead cells 2 6 biofilm visualization and ph measurement using confocal laser scanning microscopy biofilms were formed on 16 mm hdpe discs after 3 days at 30 c as described above the biofilms were then fixed onto the hdpe discs using methanol and carbon tape was used to attach the discs onto a glass slide next 100 μl of the live dead staining solution was added to the biofilm and incubated in the dark for 30 min and one drop of prolong gold antifade thermo fisher was added to the biofilm and covered with a no 1 5 cover slip the sample was observed using a 20x dry objective using nikon a1 rsi confocal laser scanning microscope clsm z stack image were collected and 3d images of the biofilm was generated using nikon nis element software images were acquired with excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength from 500 to 550 nm for viable live bacteria stained with syto 9 and excitation wavelength of 560 nm with emission wavelength from 570 to 620 nm for non viable dead bacteria stained with propidium iodide images were 512 by 512 pixels in size and pixel dwell time was 2 4 μs with 2x line averaging for ph measurements biofilms were formed as described above but not fixed with methanol and were stained with 100 μl of 20 μm snarf 4f in tap water amended with 200 mg l glucose instead calibration for ph was generated using 20 μm snarf 4f in ph adjusted tap water ranging from ph 5 to 8 fig s1 clsm images were acquired using 40x dry objective with 4x line averaging for higher resolution which is more relevant for discerning acidic microenvironments than image size the excitation wavelength was 488 nm and emission wavelengths were measured from 550 to 610 nm green and 610 to 670 nm red no autofluorescence was detected in unstained biofilms imagej software with ratio plus plugin https imagej nih gov ij plugins ratio plus html was used to generate images based on green red fluorescence ratio fulaz et al 2019 to approximate the trend of ph distributions within biofilms images were background subtracted and clipped to reduce noise mean and median filtered and false colored with a look up table modified based on ph scale calibrations fig s1 2 7 measuring release of encapsulated phages the number of phage particles was determined through double layer plaque assay to test the effect of ph on phage release 10 μl of encapsulated phage suspension was added to 1 ml tap water or adjusted to various ph 7 6 and 5 using hcl and incubated for 1 h at room temperature to test effect of salt concentration on phage release the same steps were taken but using 1 ml solutions of nacl 0 1 and 0 01 m and cacl2 0 01 and 0 001 m in tap water with an unadjusted ph of 7 6 instead afterwards the incubated phages were added along with 50 μl of a p aeruginosa pao1 overnight culture to 5 ml of 50 c tsb agar poured onto the base layer inverted after solidifying and incubated overnight at 30 c the experiment was repeated after encapsulated phages were stored for 1 month in ph 7 tap water at room temperature to determine longer term stability 2 8 scanning electron microscopy sem imaging and nanoparticle size measurement encapsulated phage suspension 10 μl was pipetted onto carbon tape on sem pin stubs from electron microscopy sciences and air dried samples were then sputter coated with 10 nm layer of gold using denton vacuum desk v samples were then visualized with a fei helios nanolab 660 sem fib operated at an accelerating voltage of 20 kv imagej software was used to measure 100 nanoparticles to determine average size and standard deviation 2 9 measuring phage release from surface coating flat hdpe and fiberglass squares 1 cm2 where plasma treated and coated with encapsulated phages as described in section 2 3 the hdpe and fiberglass squares were then incubated in 5 ml ph 7 6 and ph 5 tap water for 1 h at 30 c without shaking the number of phage particles released from the coating into the tap water was then determined by the double layer plaque assay 2 10 statistical analysis experiments were run as independent triplicates student s t test two tailed unpaired assuming equal variance was used to determine if differences in phage plaque forming units bacterial optical density and fluorescence intensity were significant at the 95 confidence level i e p 0 05 3 results discussion 3 1 pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 triggered and was subsequently controlled by release of encapsulated phages mitigating biofilm formation crystal violet staining showed that relative biofilm biomass was significantly lower for biofilms formed on hdpe plastic coated with encapsulated phages 6 7 0 2 than for the empty encapsulation coating 95 3 3 2 and uncoated controls 100 10 5 fig 1 a this was corroborated by viable count assays showing that encapsulated phage coating resulted in a much lower biofilm surface area coverage 4 8 0 2 log cfu mm2 compared to the empty encapsulation coating 6 8 0 3 log cfu mm2 and uncoated controls 6 6 0 2 log cfu mm2 fig 1a live dead viability assay was performed on the biofilms using syto 9 to stain viable live cells and propidium iodide to stain non viable dead cells for biofilms formed on hdpe plastic surfaces coated with encapsulated phages fluorescence intensity in arbitrary units a u corresponding to viable live cells 4 578 362 a u was lower than biofilms formed on empty encapsulation coating 23 545 1 716 a u and the uncoated controls 23 170 1 579 a u fig 1b conversely fluorescence intensity corresponding to non viable dead cells were 2 537 50 2 137 64 and 2 097 140 a u respectively for biofilms grown on hdpe plastic with encapsulated phages coating empty encapsulation coating and uncoated controls fig 1b thus biofilms formed on hdpe plastic with encapsulated phage coating had fluorescence intensities that were much lower for viable live cells and slightly higher for non viable dead cells resulting in a live dead fluorescence ratio of 1 80 this was lower than both the empty encapsulation coating live dead ratio of 11 02 and uncoated controls live dead ratio of 11 05 fig 1b mitigation of biofilms by encapsulated phage coating was visualized and confirmed by clsm which showed that biofilm formation on uncoated control and empty encapsulation coating was much greater than on hdpe surfaces with encapsulated phage coating fig 1c here phage release from encapsulation was autonomously triggered by the biofilm formed in tap water with a slightly basic bulk volume ph of 7 6 enabling phages to be released only as needed note that dissolved biocides do not target biofilm locations with precision possibly wasting some treatment capacity on side reactions over the entire bulk volume armbruster et al 2015 this coating process allows precise mitigation for the bottom surface of storage tanks where bacteria typically settle and attach phages are released from under the biofilm and target the inner layer of biofilms using a bottom up approach that avoids the challenge of limited penetration through the outer biofilm matrix the encapsulated phages would target the early stages of biofilm formation from the bottom surface i e a bottom up approach previous studies have shown enhanced efficacy of the bottom up approach to biofilm control compared to free phages which have limited penetration through the biofilm matrix and are diluted throughout the bulk volume instead of concentrated on the biofilm interface yu et al 2019 additionally targeting early colonizers like pseudomonas spp may also hinder or even prevent subsequent attachment by other species that do not initiate surface attachment douterelo et al 2014 liu et al 2016 in this study experiments were run for 3 days to obtain proof of concept of biofilm mitigation however further studies at larger temporal and spatial scales are needed to establish the feasibility of this promising approach a potential limitation would be bacteria developing resistant to phage infections this could be addressed in part by encapsulating a cocktail of broad host range phages or by rotating phages when the coating is replenished lewis and hill 2020 furthermore bacterial resistance to phages come with a fitness cost that slows host growth and increases susceptibility to disinfectants mangalea and duerkop 2020 yu et al 2017 another potential limitation is low temperatures since very few phages can infect and lyse bacteria at temperatures lower than 7 c jurczak kurek et al 2016 however biofouling would also be mitigated by low temperatures 3 2 encapsulated phages are stable for over 1 month in ph neutral tap water and phage release can be triggered by low ph release of encapsulated phages can be triggered by low ph this was demonstrated by incubating encapsulated phages for 1 h in room temperature tap water adjusted to various ph values 5 6 and 7 using hcl after 1 h of incubation in ph 5 and ph 6 tap water 7 60 0 03 and 4 65 0 01 log pfu ml of phages were respectively released from the stock suspension of encapsulated phages but in ph 7 tap water the normal storage condition there was only 2 94 0 25 log pfu ml of released phages fig 2 a this is attributed to unencapsulated phages that were not removed by the washing step and represents a negligible amount in the context of source depletion when phage release is not needed this experiment was repeated after encapsulated phages were left in ph 7 tap water at room temperature for 1 month to assess longer term viability after one month encapsulated phages incubated for 1 h in ph 7 6 and 5 tap water resulted in release of 3 29 0 10 4 19 0 21 and 7 22 0 08 log pfu ml of phages fig 2a this pattern suggests a slight leakage of phages from the encapsulation over time but the differences are minor and negligible on a log scale thus in the absence of bacteria the vast majority of the encapsulated phages would not be wastefully released or decay for at least 1 month when phage release is not needed chitosan crosslinked with gptms is known to be ph responsive at low ph proton solvation imparts positive charge to various functional groups e g carboxylate and amino groups leading to electrostatic repulsion between the now positively charged groups which causes swelling of the encapsulation and subsequent release of its cargo li et al 2020 this ph sensitivity is dependent on the gptms mass ratio i e higher ratios of gptms will increase ph sensitivity and vice versa wu and sailor 2009 thus this allows the ph responsiveness of the encapsulation to be adjusted and optimized for delivery and cargo release in different environments ratiometric ph indicator dye snarf 4f was used to measure ph ranges within p aeruginosa biofilms to determine whether phage release could be autonomously triggered biofilm ph colormaps were generated from clsm images and showed that acidic microenvironments were scattered throughout the biofilm with ph as low as 5 3 especially in the inner layers close to the biofouled surface which is acidic enough to trigger phage release and autonomously exert biofouling control fig 2b this result is supported by previous research which used the same ph indicator dye and reported ph as low as 5 6 which was their limit of detection within p aeruginosa biofilms hunter and beveridge 2005 additionally ph as low as 5 1 has also been found in pseudomonas fluorescens biofilm inner layers fulaz et al 2019 apparently limited oxygen penetration into biofilm inner layers create anoxic microenvironments leading to glycolysis and acidic fermentation by product e g lactic and acetic acid build up which in turn creates an acidic microenvironment hu et al 2019 these processes are not species specific so most biofilm inner layers have acidic ph and can be broadly targeted by ph responsive antimicrobial delivery systems chen et al 2018 incidentally previous biomedical studies have similarly exploited ph gradients to enhance selective treatment for example healthy tissues have slightly basic ph 7 4 were avoided in efforts to selectively target methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus biofilm infections ph 5 5 in rabbits by heat killing gold nanoparticles peng et al 2021 a similar approach also worked for targeting s aureus biofilm infections ph 5 0 rather than healthy tissues in mice ph 7 4 zhao et al 2019 additionally ph responsive nanoparticles have been used to deliver antimicrobial agents to oral biofilms ph 5 5 5 and avoid nonspecific release into healthy oral tissues ph 7 4 niaz et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 tap water generally has a slightly basic ph similar to the ph of healthy tissues avoided by ph responsive nanoparticles salehi et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 thus by using an encapsulation with similar ph responsiveness i e stable at neutral slightly basic ph and release at acidic ph we could protect the encapsulated phages from unintended release into sterile tap water and selectively target nascent biofilms 3 3 phage release could be inadvertently triggered by high salt concentrations but not by low salinity found in drinking water systems the ability of hydrogen ions at low ph to trigger phage release raises the concern that sodium and calcium cations which are common in tap water could unintentionally do the same thus we also examined how fluctuations in water chemistry can affect encapsulation stability phage release from encapsulations could be triggered by 5 840 mg l or 0 1 m nacl 7 03 0 20 log pfu ml and 1 110 mg l or 0 01 m cacl2 7 21 0 09 log pfu ml fig 3 however when lower concentrations were used i e 584 and 111 mg l or 0 01 or 0 001 m of nacl and cacl2 respectively the concentration of phages detected was only 3 51 0 09 and 2 96 0 20 log pfu ml respectively which is comparable to the number of phages passively released in unadjusted ph 7 6 tap water thus while phage release is less sensitive to sodium and calcium ions than to low ph high concentrations of sodium and calcium chloride i e 5 840 and 1 110 mg l or 0 1 and 0 01 m respectively can still trigger phage release comparable to ph 5 or 0 00001 m h at around 7 log pfu ml fig 3 however there is little concern with unintended phage release triggered by fluctuations in water chemistry and salinity because the ion concentrations required are above secondary drinking water standards of 500 mg l for total dissolved solids and 250 mg l for chloride usepa 1979 thus under most tap water conditions the encapsulated phages should remain stable we ruled out the possibility of phage release due to biodegradation of the encapsulating materials which is unlikely to provide nutrients and promote biofouling specifically we examined growth of p aeruginosa pao1 after one week incubation at 30 c in tap water unadjusted ph of 7 6 amended with 3 6 or 0 36 g l of either glucose or empty chitosan encapsulations when the carbon source was 3 6 or 0 36 g l glucose p aeruginosa pao1 reached an optical density of 0 54 0 02 and 0 17 0 01 od600nm respectively fig s2 however when glucose was replaced with empty chitosan encapsulations instead optical density after 1 week was only 0 008 0 013 and 0 004 0 0004 od600nm respectively indicating that no growth occurred fig s2 chitosan is known to be biodegradable but degradation rates are lower for chitosan with higher degrees of deacetylation 85 deacetylated chitosan used in this study which can take multiple months to biodegrade kurita 2006 ren et al 2005 since 5 ml of tap water was inoculated with 100 μl of p aeruginosa pao1 bacterial presence is much higher than normal conditions for this experiment but still no growth was detected while biodegradation may still be possible on a longer time scale the coating method greatly lowers chitosan concentration used for biofilm mitigation and that could be inadvertently biodegraded 3 4 encapsulated phages adhere to plasma treated plastic and fiberglass surfaces upon contact enabling an instant method of coating biofouling susceptible surfaces the chitosan encapsulation enabled this simple coating method which resulted in a visibly rougher texture after dip coating of plasma treated materials into the encapsulated phage suspension fig 4 a to determine whether efficacy of the encapsulated phage coating process is affected by different surface materials phage release patterns from hdpe and fiberglass both common materials used to make water storage tanks were examined plasma treated hdpe and fiberglass surfaces with encapsulated phage coating were able to release 3 75 0 05 and 3 58 0 12 log pfu cm2 of phages respectively when exposed to ph 5 tap water compared to the 1 40 0 14 and 1 55 0 43 log pfu cm2 of phages released in normal ph 7 6 tap water fig 4b thus low ph can trigger comparable phage release from coatings on both surface materials demonstrating that the coating process is equally effective for two of the most common materials used for water storage tanks previous studies have attributed this coating process to the formation hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl groups on the plasma treated plastic surface and hydroxyl or amino groups on the chitosan suganya et al 2018 since this hydrogen bonding occurs on the carbon chain and does not involve functional groups specific to different kinds of plastic the coating process is versatile and applicable to other plastics such as polyvinylchloride pvc and polystyrene as well additionally there are various other methods such as corona treatment that could replace plasma treatment to increase the free surface energy and facilitate coating of encapsulated phages munteanu et al 2014 in addition to facilitating this coating process the chitosan encapsulation has other advantageous properties worth noting most phages range from 20 to 200 nm sulcius et al 2011 in size and the phage used in this study is 86 nm yu et al 2019 in comparison the crosslinked chitosan with tpp and gtmps formed uniformly sized spheres 244 11 nm in diameter fig 4c this is much smaller than previously reported alginate based phage encapsulations including alginate chitosan encapsulations which usually had diameters in the micrometer range abdelsattar et al 2019 colom et al 2017 soto et al 2018 the smaller encapsulation size here is more in line with other chitosan based encapsulations and is conducive to higher surface area to volume ratios and thus more direct contact between the encapsulated phages and their bacterial targets xu et al 2019 additionally we previously found that smaller phage nanoparticle conjugates disperse phages more evenly than their larger counterparts and therefore cause greater disruption of biofilm inner layers and are more efficient at biofilm removal yu et al 2019 finally chitosan tpp and select phage products are all generally regarded as safe i e gras status by the u s food and drug administration while gptms is an indirect additive used in food contact substances garg et al 2019 silano et al 2017 wu et al 2017 thus unlike dbps that can be carcinogenic the phages encapsulated in chitosan tpp and gptms raise no concerns with regards to public health 4 conclusion the use of chemical disinfectants for biofilm eradication faces several drawbacks including low efficacy due to limited biofilm penetration and the generation of harmful dbps phages are self propagating green biocides that can provide a chemical free alternative to biofilm control encapsulating phages in crosslinked chitosan enabled autonomous release of the bactericidal phage cargo in response to biofilm formation but otherwise remains stable in room temperature tap water for at least one month the encapsulated phages could also be selectively coated onto surfaces to precisely mitigate biofouling where it is needed this method allows for increased precision for targeting where nascent biofilms form using a bottom ups approach that bypasses the problem of limited penetration through the biofilm matrix overall we present a simple technology for small scale point of use applications and to complement established water treatment methods to curtail chemical intensity for improving water safety declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no known competing financial interests or personal

15506,biofilms in water storage systems may harbor pathogens that threaten public health chemical disinfectants are marginally effective in eradicating biofilms due to limited penetration and often generate harmful disinfection byproducts to enhance biofouling mitigation in household water storage tanks we encapsulated bacteriophages phages in chitosan crosslinked with tri polyphosphate and 3 glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane phages served as self propagating green biocides that exclusively infect bacteria this ph responsive encapsulation 244 11 nm enabled autonomous release of phages in response to acidic ph associated with biofilms corroborated by confocal microscopy with ph indicator dye snarf 4f but otherwise remained stable in ph neutral tap water for one month encapsulated phages instantly bind to plasma treated plastic and fiberglass surfaces providing a facile coating method that protects surfaces highly vulnerable to biofouling biofilm formation assays were conducted in tap water amended with 200 mg l glucose to accelerate growth and attachment of pseudomonas aeruginosa an opportunistic pathogen commonly associated with biofilms in drinking water distribution and storage systems biofilms formation on plastic surfaces coated with encapsulated phages decreased to only 6 7 0 2 on a biomass basis relative to the uncoated controls likewise biofilm surface area coverage 4 8 0 2 log cfu mm2 and live dead fluorescence ratio 1 80 were also lower than the controls 6 6 0 2 log cfu mm2 and live dead ratio of 11 05 overall this study offers proof of concept of a chemical free easily implementable approach to control problematic biofilm dwelling bacteria and highlights benefits of this bottom up biofouling control approach that obviates the challenge of poor biofilm penetration by biocides graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ph responsive controlled release biofilm control crosslinked chitosan plasma treatment biopolymer data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction biofilms are the preferred lifestyle for most bacteria including those present in drinking water treatment distribution and storage systems flemming and wuertz 2019 this poses significant challenges for public and infrastructure health since biofilms may harbor pathogenic bacteria and promote biofouling and corrosion flemming et al 2016 biofilms are notoriously difficult to eradicate due to limited penetration by chemical disinfectants which incidentally may produce harmful disinfection byproducts dbps bridier et al 2011 mechanical approaches are occasionally used to remove biofilms but these work only for accessible surfaces which is not the case for much of the water infrastructure and are generally energy intensive thus there is a need for alternative chemical free eco friendly approaches to mitigate biofilm formation bacteriophages phages are green biocides that can exclusively and selectively target pathogenic and other problematic bacteria strains without producing harmful disinfection byproducts de jonge et al 2019 hicks et al 2020 due to their biological nature phages can self propagate exponentially resulting in cost effective bactericidal capacity even with low initial dosage yu et al 2019 this self propagating nature also makes phage production easily scalable and relatively inexpensive anam et al 2020 luong et al 2020 thus phage technology could be suitable for some resource limited areas with infrastructure limitations hindering conventional biocontrol approaches phages can also work synergistically with other biofilm control approaches to supplement current treatment methods and curtail chemical use stachler et al 2021 encapsulation technology which is commonly used to protect medicinal drugs and other therapeutics from degradation and enable targeted release at desired locations may offer opportunities to mitigate biofilm formation by theoretically facilitating on demand autonomous release of phages triggered by the presence of bacteria herrera et al 2021 current technology is focused on oral drug delivery to the intestines using a ph responsive encapsulation that is stable at low ph but releases the contents at slightly basic ph these encapsulations protect the medical drug cargo from degradation in the low ph of the stomach and enables controlled release in the slightly basic ph of the intestines centurion et al 2021 du et al 2015 liu et al 2017 this drug encapsulation technology for targeted delivery is underutilized outside of medicine by reversing the ph responsiveness of these encapsulations to protect the cargo at the slightly basic ph of tap water and release it into the acidic ph of biofilms which was demonstrated to be possible for chemical compounds chen et al 2018 we could mitigate wasteful release of phages and target where nascent biofilms form with greater precision note that two major limitations of using free phages for biofilm control is the general lack of targeted delivery to where biofilms form and poor penetration into the biofilm thus encapsulation technology which has been used for targeted delivery of chemical compounds to biofilms peng et al 2021 shows promise for enabling targeted delivery of phages to nascent biofilms accordingly we envision a system for encapsulating various phages which could be switched out and rotated as needed to ensure the phages are fit for purpose as coatings to selectively protect vulnerable surfaces and attack biofilms from the bottom up to circumvent poor penetration from the top this approach would serve as an alternative or supplement to chemical disinfectants which bluntly target bacteria in the bulk volume of water storage systems in this study we demonstrate an autonomous bottom up approach to mitigate nascent biofilms using an encapsulated phage coating a phage isolated from wastewater as previously described yu et al 2019 was used against the opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa a common biofilm forming bacterium prevalent in water distribution and storage systems chao et al 2015 tanner et al 2019 additionally pseudomonas spp are early colonizers that facilitate subsequent attachment by other bacterial species in chlorinated drinking water distribution systems douterelo et al 2014 liu et al 2016 and commonly harbor antibiotic resistance genes making them an important target for biocontrol haller et al 2018 mortimer et al 2018 phages were encapsulated in a responsive coating made of chitosan crosslinked with tri polyphosphate tpp and 3 glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane gptms we examined the long term stability and efficacy of the encapsulated phages to mitigate biofilm formation in tap water storage systems a facile coating process was developed to attach the encapsulated phages to surfaces where biofilm formation is most likely to occur e g bottom of water storage tanks that are commonly used by households in resource limited areas overall we offer proof of concept that autonomous release of bactericidal phages from their encapsulation triggered by the presence of bacteria acts as a preventative treatment against biofilm formation to mitigate bacterial reservoirs that could cause water borne infectious diseases 2 experimental methods 2 1 materials acetic acid sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl were purchased from sigma aldrich the chitosan used in this study was 85 deacetylated and purchased from thermo fisher sodium tri polyphosphate tpp 85 pure was from acros organics and 3 glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane gptms 97 pure was from tokyo chemical industry solutions were prepared in deionized water di for biofilm viability assays syto 9 5mm stock was from invitrogen and propidium iodide 20 mm was from sigma aldrich phosphate buffered solution pbs was made using pbs tablets from vwr life science snarf 4f 5 and 6 carboxylic acid was obtained from thermo fisher for biofilm ph measurements hunter and beveridge 2005 schlafer et al 2015 pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 atcc 15692 was cultured in tryptic soy broth tsb bd difco at 30 c the phage peb2 used in this study infecting p aeruginosa pao1 was isolated from wastewater as previously described and characterized to be around 86 nm yu et al 2019 phage stocks were suspended in sulfate magnesium sm buffer as previously described and stored at 4 c zuo et al 2021 double layer plaque assays were done using a base layer of dextrose bd difco plate count agar and a top layer of tryptic soy agar 0 3 wt vol agar 2 2 encapsulating phages in crosslinked chitosan nanospheres under continuous magnetic stirring at room temperature 5 mg ml of chitosan was dissolved into a 2 v v acetic acid aqueous solution then the ph was adjusted to 4 5 using naoh and phages were added to a final concentration of 109 plaque forming units ml pfu ml two aqueous solutions of 5 wt v tpp and 5 v v gptms were added together 1 ml each drop wise into 10 ml of the continuously stirred chitosan phage solution completing the encapsulation process the resulting suspension was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min to collect the encapsulated phages which were washed three times with ph 7 tap water and stored in 10 ml of ph 7 tap water at room temperature and shaken vigorously before use empty encapsulation suspension was made following the same steps but without addition of phages to control for the effect of the encapsulation itself synthesis of encapsulated phages is limited by concentration of encapsulating nanomaterials i e chitosan tpp and gtpms however when the chitosan concentration is about 10 mg ml twice the concentration used in this study the solution becomes too viscous and difficult to work with since it cannot be stirred magnetically with a stir bar thus viscosity of the chitosan solution limits the concentration of phages that can be encapsulated furthermore while the encapsulated phages are protected from the acidic ph of the chitosan solution ph 4 5 the unencapsulated free phages are continuously degraded by this acidic ph therefore the concentration of phages added during production 109 pfu ml is oversaturated to ensure maximum encapsulation however this results in around just 1 of phages used in production that can be released as viable phages 107 pfu ml from the encapsulation further optimization is still required to improve this low percentage though compared to encapsulating more expensive therapeutic drugs this is less consequential since the exponential self propagation of phages makes phage production fast and relatively inexpensive anam et al 2020 luong et al 2020 2 3 coating plasma treated surfaces with encapsulated phages high density polyethylene hdpe from nalgene was cut into discs 35 and 16 mm in diameter that could be fitted into individual wells of 6 and 24 well plates respectively the hdpe discs were wiped with ethanol to clean the surfaces as a pretreatment measure plasma treatment was then performed for 5 min using fischione model 1020 plasma cleaner with 25 oxygen 75 argon gas mix the plasma treated hdpe discs were dip coated into 1 ml suspension of either encapsulated phages or empty encapsulation which instantly formed a coating 2 4 biofilm biomass measurements the smaller 16 mm hdpe discs fitted for 24 well plates used for other experiments in this study did not form enough total biofilm biomass to facilitate quantification thus larger 35 mm hdpe discs were used these disks were coated with encapsulated phages or with empty encapsulations or left uncoated as controls and were taped to the bottom of each well in a 6 well plate then tap water 5 ml unfiltered and used as is amended with 200 mg l glucose and 250 μl of a p aeruginosa pao1 overnight culture 0 4 od600nm was added to each well and samples were collected after 3 days at 30 c to quantify total biofilm biomass the concentration of p aeruginosa and glucose used for biofilm experiments is relatively high for water systems but allowed us to work with sufficient biomass to more easily quantify the effect of phages and limit potential interactions between phages and non target bacterial species a modified crystal violet cv assay was used for biomass quantification cv is often used for colorimetric quantification of biofilm biomass azeredo et al 2017 but it binds to the chitosan coating as well as to the biofilm confounding results thus biofilms were first resuspended to separate them from the chitosan coating this procedure was used for all treatments and the biofilm biomass measurements are presented as percentages relative to the uncoated control briefly biofilms were resuspended into 1 ml pbs by sonication at 40 khz for 5min in a bath sonicator branson danbury ct mixed by pipetting up and down 10 times and transferred into a 1 5 ml centrifuge tube then 50 μl of the resuspended biofilm in pbs was set aside for enumeration using viable plate counts next 50 μl of a 1 wt vol cv aqueous solution was added to reach a concentration of 0 05 wt vol cv in the tubes after 15 min incubation in the dark at room temperature the tube was centrifuged at 13 000 g for 5 min to pellet the resuspended biofilm the pellet was washed 5 times with pbs to remove residual cv in the supernatant then 1 ml of 70 ethanol was added and the tube was incubated again for 15 min and inverted 10 times to release the cv in the biofilm pellet finally 200 μl from each tube was transferred into a clean 96 well plate and absorbance at 595 nm was measured using a tecan infinite 200 pro plate reader 2 5 live dead cells staining to assess biofilms via live dead staining biofilms were grown on 16 mm hdpe discs coated with empty encapsulation or encapsulated phages or uncoated controls these discs were taped into individual wells of a 24 well plate and submerged in 2 ml tap water ph 7 6 amended with 200 mg l glucose and inoculated with 100 μl of a p aeruginosa overnight culture 0 4 od600nm after 3 days at 30 c media and planktonic cells were pipetted out of each well and the remaining biofilm was washed by gently adding and removing 1 ml pbs to remove any remaining planktonic cells the staining solution 200 μl of 7 5 μm syto 9 and 30 μm propidium iodide in di was added to each well and the plate was incubated in the dark for 15 min to avoid the hdpe discs from interfering with measurements the biofilm was resuspended into the staining solution which was then transferred to a clean 96 well black walled plate using tecan infinite 200 pro plate reader with excitation wavelength at 485 nm fluorescence intensities at 535 nm syto 9 green emission for live cells and 635 nm propidium iodide red emission for dead cells were measured the ratio of live to dead cells within each individual biofilm on uncoated and coated surfaces was obtained by dividing the fluorescence intensity corresponding to green live cells by that of the red dead cells 2 6 biofilm visualization and ph measurement using confocal laser scanning microscopy biofilms were formed on 16 mm hdpe discs after 3 days at 30 c as described above the biofilms were then fixed onto the hdpe discs using methanol and carbon tape was used to attach the discs onto a glass slide next 100 μl of the live dead staining solution was added to the biofilm and incubated in the dark for 30 min and one drop of prolong gold antifade thermo fisher was added to the biofilm and covered with a no 1 5 cover slip the sample was observed using a 20x dry objective using nikon a1 rsi confocal laser scanning microscope clsm z stack image were collected and 3d images of the biofilm was generated using nikon nis element software images were acquired with excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength from 500 to 550 nm for viable live bacteria stained with syto 9 and excitation wavelength of 560 nm with emission wavelength from 570 to 620 nm for non viable dead bacteria stained with propidium iodide images were 512 by 512 pixels in size and pixel dwell time was 2 4 μs with 2x line averaging for ph measurements biofilms were formed as described above but not fixed with methanol and were stained with 100 μl of 20 μm snarf 4f in tap water amended with 200 mg l glucose instead calibration for ph was generated using 20 μm snarf 4f in ph adjusted tap water ranging from ph 5 to 8 fig s1 clsm images were acquired using 40x dry objective with 4x line averaging for higher resolution which is more relevant for discerning acidic microenvironments than image size the excitation wavelength was 488 nm and emission wavelengths were measured from 550 to 610 nm green and 610 to 670 nm red no autofluorescence was detected in unstained biofilms imagej software with ratio plus plugin https imagej nih gov ij plugins ratio plus html was used to generate images based on green red fluorescence ratio fulaz et al 2019 to approximate the trend of ph distributions within biofilms images were background subtracted and clipped to reduce noise mean and median filtered and false colored with a look up table modified based on ph scale calibrations fig s1 2 7 measuring release of encapsulated phages the number of phage particles was determined through double layer plaque assay to test the effect of ph on phage release 10 μl of encapsulated phage suspension was added to 1 ml tap water or adjusted to various ph 7 6 and 5 using hcl and incubated for 1 h at room temperature to test effect of salt concentration on phage release the same steps were taken but using 1 ml solutions of nacl 0 1 and 0 01 m and cacl2 0 01 and 0 001 m in tap water with an unadjusted ph of 7 6 instead afterwards the incubated phages were added along with 50 μl of a p aeruginosa pao1 overnight culture to 5 ml of 50 c tsb agar poured onto the base layer inverted after solidifying and incubated overnight at 30 c the experiment was repeated after encapsulated phages were stored for 1 month in ph 7 tap water at room temperature to determine longer term stability 2 8 scanning electron microscopy sem imaging and nanoparticle size measurement encapsulated phage suspension 10 μl was pipetted onto carbon tape on sem pin stubs from electron microscopy sciences and air dried samples were then sputter coated with 10 nm layer of gold using denton vacuum desk v samples were then visualized with a fei helios nanolab 660 sem fib operated at an accelerating voltage of 20 kv imagej software was used to measure 100 nanoparticles to determine average size and standard deviation 2 9 measuring phage release from surface coating flat hdpe and fiberglass squares 1 cm2 where plasma treated and coated with encapsulated phages as described in section 2 3 the hdpe and fiberglass squares were then incubated in 5 ml ph 7 6 and ph 5 tap water for 1 h at 30 c without shaking the number of phage particles released from the coating into the tap water was then determined by the double layer plaque assay 2 10 statistical analysis experiments were run as independent triplicates student s t test two tailed unpaired assuming equal variance was used to determine if differences in phage plaque forming units bacterial optical density and fluorescence intensity were significant at the 95 confidence level i e p 0 05 3 results discussion 3 1 pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 triggered and was subsequently controlled by release of encapsulated phages mitigating biofilm formation crystal violet staining showed that relative biofilm biomass was significantly lower for biofilms formed on hdpe plastic coated with encapsulated phages 6 7 0 2 than for the empty encapsulation coating 95 3 3 2 and uncoated controls 100 10 5 fig 1 a this was corroborated by viable count assays showing that encapsulated phage coating resulted in a much lower biofilm surface area coverage 4 8 0 2 log cfu mm2 compared to the empty encapsulation coating 6 8 0 3 log cfu mm2 and uncoated controls 6 6 0 2 log cfu mm2 fig 1a live dead viability assay was performed on the biofilms using syto 9 to stain viable live cells and propidium iodide to stain non viable dead cells for biofilms formed on hdpe plastic surfaces coated with encapsulated phages fluorescence intensity in arbitrary units a u corresponding to viable live cells 4 578 362 a u was lower than biofilms formed on empty encapsulation coating 23 545 1 716 a u and the uncoated controls 23 170 1 579 a u fig 1b conversely fluorescence intensity corresponding to non viable dead cells were 2 537 50 2 137 64 and 2 097 140 a u respectively for biofilms grown on hdpe plastic with encapsulated phages coating empty encapsulation coating and uncoated controls fig 1b thus biofilms formed on hdpe plastic with encapsulated phage coating had fluorescence intensities that were much lower for viable live cells and slightly higher for non viable dead cells resulting in a live dead fluorescence ratio of 1 80 this was lower than both the empty encapsulation coating live dead ratio of 11 02 and uncoated controls live dead ratio of 11 05 fig 1b mitigation of biofilms by encapsulated phage coating was visualized and confirmed by clsm which showed that biofilm formation on uncoated control and empty encapsulation coating was much greater than on hdpe surfaces with encapsulated phage coating fig 1c here phage release from encapsulation was autonomously triggered by the biofilm formed in tap water with a slightly basic bulk volume ph of 7 6 enabling phages to be released only as needed note that dissolved biocides do not target biofilm locations with precision possibly wasting some treatment capacity on side reactions over the entire bulk volume armbruster et al 2015 this coating process allows precise mitigation for the bottom surface of storage tanks where bacteria typically settle and attach phages are released from under the biofilm and target the inner layer of biofilms using a bottom up approach that avoids the challenge of limited penetration through the outer biofilm matrix the encapsulated phages would target the early stages of biofilm formation from the bottom surface i e a bottom up approach previous studies have shown enhanced efficacy of the bottom up approach to biofilm control compared to free phages which have limited penetration through the biofilm matrix and are diluted throughout the bulk volume instead of concentrated on the biofilm interface yu et al 2019 additionally targeting early colonizers like pseudomonas spp may also hinder or even prevent subsequent attachment by other species that do not initiate surface attachment douterelo et al 2014 liu et al 2016 in this study experiments were run for 3 days to obtain proof of concept of biofilm mitigation however further studies at larger temporal and spatial scales are needed to establish the feasibility of this promising approach a potential limitation would be bacteria developing resistant to phage infections this could be addressed in part by encapsulating a cocktail of broad host range phages or by rotating phages when the coating is replenished lewis and hill 2020 furthermore bacterial resistance to phages come with a fitness cost that slows host growth and increases susceptibility to disinfectants mangalea and duerkop 2020 yu et al 2017 another potential limitation is low temperatures since very few phages can infect and lyse bacteria at temperatures lower than 7 c jurczak kurek et al 2016 however biofouling would also be mitigated by low temperatures 3 2 encapsulated phages are stable for over 1 month in ph neutral tap water and phage release can be triggered by low ph release of encapsulated phages can be triggered by low ph this was demonstrated by incubating encapsulated phages for 1 h in room temperature tap water adjusted to various ph values 5 6 and 7 using hcl after 1 h of incubation in ph 5 and ph 6 tap water 7 60 0 03 and 4 65 0 01 log pfu ml of phages were respectively released from the stock suspension of encapsulated phages but in ph 7 tap water the normal storage condition there was only 2 94 0 25 log pfu ml of released phages fig 2 a this is attributed to unencapsulated phages that were not removed by the washing step and represents a negligible amount in the context of source depletion when phage release is not needed this experiment was repeated after encapsulated phages were left in ph 7 tap water at room temperature for 1 month to assess longer term viability after one month encapsulated phages incubated for 1 h in ph 7 6 and 5 tap water resulted in release of 3 29 0 10 4 19 0 21 and 7 22 0 08 log pfu ml of phages fig 2a this pattern suggests a slight leakage of phages from the encapsulation over time but the differences are minor and negligible on a log scale thus in the absence of bacteria the vast majority of the encapsulated phages would not be wastefully released or decay for at least 1 month when phage release is not needed chitosan crosslinked with gptms is known to be ph responsive at low ph proton solvation imparts positive charge to various functional groups e g carboxylate and amino groups leading to electrostatic repulsion between the now positively charged groups which causes swelling of the encapsulation and subsequent release of its cargo li et al 2020 this ph sensitivity is dependent on the gptms mass ratio i e higher ratios of gptms will increase ph sensitivity and vice versa wu and sailor 2009 thus this allows the ph responsiveness of the encapsulation to be adjusted and optimized for delivery and cargo release in different environments ratiometric ph indicator dye snarf 4f was used to measure ph ranges within p aeruginosa biofilms to determine whether phage release could be autonomously triggered biofilm ph colormaps were generated from clsm images and showed that acidic microenvironments were scattered throughout the biofilm with ph as low as 5 3 especially in the inner layers close to the biofouled surface which is acidic enough to trigger phage release and autonomously exert biofouling control fig 2b this result is supported by previous research which used the same ph indicator dye and reported ph as low as 5 6 which was their limit of detection within p aeruginosa biofilms hunter and beveridge 2005 additionally ph as low as 5 1 has also been found in pseudomonas fluorescens biofilm inner layers fulaz et al 2019 apparently limited oxygen penetration into biofilm inner layers create anoxic microenvironments leading to glycolysis and acidic fermentation by product e g lactic and acetic acid build up which in turn creates an acidic microenvironment hu et al 2019 these processes are not species specific so most biofilm inner layers have acidic ph and can be broadly targeted by ph responsive antimicrobial delivery systems chen et al 2018 incidentally previous biomedical studies have similarly exploited ph gradients to enhance selective treatment for example healthy tissues have slightly basic ph 7 4 were avoided in efforts to selectively target methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus biofilm infections ph 5 5 in rabbits by heat killing gold nanoparticles peng et al 2021 a similar approach also worked for targeting s aureus biofilm infections ph 5 0 rather than healthy tissues in mice ph 7 4 zhao et al 2019 additionally ph responsive nanoparticles have been used to deliver antimicrobial agents to oral biofilms ph 5 5 5 and avoid nonspecific release into healthy oral tissues ph 7 4 niaz et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 tap water generally has a slightly basic ph similar to the ph of healthy tissues avoided by ph responsive nanoparticles salehi et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 thus by using an encapsulation with similar ph responsiveness i e stable at neutral slightly basic ph and release at acidic ph we could protect the encapsulated phages from unintended release into sterile tap water and selectively target nascent biofilms 3 3 phage release could be inadvertently triggered by high salt concentrations but not by low salinity found in drinking water systems the ability of hydrogen ions at low ph to trigger phage release raises the concern that sodium and calcium cations which are common in tap water could unintentionally do the same thus we also examined how fluctuations in water chemistry can affect encapsulation stability phage release from encapsulations could be triggered by 5 840 mg l or 0 1 m nacl 7 03 0 20 log pfu ml and 1 110 mg l or 0 01 m cacl2 7 21 0 09 log pfu ml fig 3 however when lower concentrations were used i e 584 and 111 mg l or 0 01 or 0 001 m of nacl and cacl2 respectively the concentration of phages detected was only 3 51 0 09 and 2 96 0 20 log pfu ml respectively which is comparable to the number of phages passively released in unadjusted ph 7 6 tap water thus while phage release is less sensitive to sodium and calcium ions than to low ph high concentrations of sodium and calcium chloride i e 5 840 and 1 110 mg l or 0 1 and 0 01 m respectively can still trigger phage release comparable to ph 5 or 0 00001 m h at around 7 log pfu ml fig 3 however there is little concern with unintended phage release triggered by fluctuations in water chemistry and salinity because the ion concentrations required are above secondary drinking water standards of 500 mg l for total dissolved solids and 250 mg l for chloride usepa 1979 thus under most tap water conditions the encapsulated phages should remain stable we ruled out the possibility of phage release due to biodegradation of the encapsulating materials which is unlikely to provide nutrients and promote biofouling specifically we examined growth of p aeruginosa pao1 after one week incubation at 30 c in tap water unadjusted ph of 7 6 amended with 3 6 or 0 36 g l of either glucose or empty chitosan encapsulations when the carbon source was 3 6 or 0 36 g l glucose p aeruginosa pao1 reached an optical density of 0 54 0 02 and 0 17 0 01 od600nm respectively fig s2 however when glucose was replaced with empty chitosan encapsulations instead optical density after 1 week was only 0 008 0 013 and 0 004 0 0004 od600nm respectively indicating that no growth occurred fig s2 chitosan is known to be biodegradable but degradation rates are lower for chitosan with higher degrees of deacetylation 85 deacetylated chitosan used in this study which can take multiple months to biodegrade kurita 2006 ren et al 2005 since 5 ml of tap water was inoculated with 100 μl of p aeruginosa pao1 bacterial presence is much higher than normal conditions for this experiment but still no growth was detected while biodegradation may still be possible on a longer time scale the coating method greatly lowers chitosan concentration used for biofilm mitigation and that could be inadvertently biodegraded 3 4 encapsulated phages adhere to plasma treated plastic and fiberglass surfaces upon contact enabling an instant method of coating biofouling susceptible surfaces the chitosan encapsulation enabled this simple coating method which resulted in a visibly rougher texture after dip coating of plasma treated materials into the encapsulated phage suspension fig 4 a to determine whether efficacy of the encapsulated phage coating process is affected by different surface materials phage release patterns from hdpe and fiberglass both common materials used to make water storage tanks were examined plasma treated hdpe and fiberglass surfaces with encapsulated phage coating were able to release 3 75 0 05 and 3 58 0 12 log pfu cm2 of phages respectively when exposed to ph 5 tap water compared to the 1 40 0 14 and 1 55 0 43 log pfu cm2 of phages released in normal ph 7 6 tap water fig 4b thus low ph can trigger comparable phage release from coatings on both surface materials demonstrating that the coating process is equally effective for two of the most common materials used for water storage tanks previous studies have attributed this coating process to the formation hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl groups on the plasma treated plastic surface and hydroxyl or amino groups on the chitosan suganya et al 2018 since this hydrogen bonding occurs on the carbon chain and does not involve functional groups specific to different kinds of plastic the coating process is versatile and applicable to other plastics such as polyvinylchloride pvc and polystyrene as well additionally there are various other methods such as corona treatment that could replace plasma treatment to increase the free surface energy and facilitate coating of encapsulated phages munteanu et al 2014 in addition to facilitating this coating process the chitosan encapsulation has other advantageous properties worth noting most phages range from 20 to 200 nm sulcius et al 2011 in size and the phage used in this study is 86 nm yu et al 2019 in comparison the crosslinked chitosan with tpp and gtmps formed uniformly sized spheres 244 11 nm in diameter fig 4c this is much smaller than previously reported alginate based phage encapsulations including alginate chitosan encapsulations which usually had diameters in the micrometer range abdelsattar et al 2019 colom et al 2017 soto et al 2018 the smaller encapsulation size here is more in line with other chitosan based encapsulations and is conducive to higher surface area to volume ratios and thus more direct contact between the encapsulated phages and their bacterial targets xu et al 2019 additionally we previously found that smaller phage nanoparticle conjugates disperse phages more evenly than their larger counterparts and therefore cause greater disruption of biofilm inner layers and are more efficient at biofilm removal yu et al 2019 finally chitosan tpp and select phage products are all generally regarded as safe i e gras status by the u s food and drug administration while gptms is an indirect additive used in food contact substances garg et al 2019 silano et al 2017 wu et al 2017 thus unlike dbps that can be carcinogenic the phages encapsulated in chitosan tpp and gptms raise no concerns with regards to public health 4 conclusion the use of chemical disinfectants for biofilm eradication faces several drawbacks including low efficacy due to limited biofilm penetration and the generation of harmful dbps phages are self propagating green biocides that can provide a chemical free alternative to biofilm control encapsulating phages in crosslinked chitosan enabled autonomous release of the bactericidal phage cargo in response to biofilm formation but otherwise remains stable in room temperature tap water for at least one month the encapsulated phages could also be selectively coated onto surfaces to precisely mitigate biofouling where it is needed this method allows for increased precision for targeting where nascent biofilms form using a bottom ups approach that bypasses the problem of limited penetration through the biofilm matrix overall we present a simple technology for small scale point of use applications and to complement established water treatment methods to curtail chemical intensity for improving water safety declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no known competing financial interests or personal

15507,a shift from the acetoclastic to the hydrogenotrophic pathway in methanogenesis under ammonia inhibition is a common observation in anaerobic digestion however there are still considerable knowledge gaps concerning the differential ammonia tolerance of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens ams and hms their responses to different ammonia species nh4 nh3 and their recoverability after ammonia inhibition with the successful enrichment of mesophilic ams and hms cultures this study aimed at addressing the above knowledge gaps through batch inhibition recovery tests and kinetic modeling under varying total ammonia tan 0 2 10 g n l and ph 7 0 8 5 conditions the results showed that the tolerance level of hms to free ammonia fan ic50 1345 mg n l and nh4 ic50 6050 mg n l was nearly 11 times and 3 times those of ams nh3 ic50 123 mg n l nh4 ic50 2133 mg n l respectively consistent with general belief the ams were more impacted by fan however the hms were more adversely affected by nh4 when the ph was 8 0 a low tan 1 0 4 0 g n l could cause irreversible inhibition of the ams due to significant cell death whereas the activity of hms could be fully or even over recovered from severe ammonia stress fan 0 9 g n l or tan 10 g n l ph 8 0 the different tolerance responses of ams and hms might be associated with the cell morphology multiple energy converting

recovery through the production of biogas primarily methane the conversion of organic wastes into biogas in ad is achieved via four successive steps hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis which are catalyzed by distinct groups of microorganisms including hydrolytic bacteria fermentative bacteria acetogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea including acetoclastic methanogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens hu et al 2015 this complex bioprocess is prone to inhibition by certain chemical compounds among which ammoniacal nitrogen is one of the most significant inhibitors yenigün and demirel 2013 especially when treating nitrogen rich feedstock operating under high loading rates and applying dry ad processes capson tojo et al 2020 rajagopal et al 2013 wang et al 2021 in aqueous solutions ammoniacal nitrogen exists in two forms i e free ammonia nitrogen fan or nh3 and ammonium ions nh4 which are in a ph and temperature dependent equilibrium as shown in eq 1 wu et al 2009 fan is generally considered to be more responsible for the ammonia inhibition than nh4 and often treated as a key factor in many studies müller et al 2006 rajagopal et al 2013 1 n h 3 a q h 2 o l n h 4 a q o h a q ammonia inhibition may affect all the stages of ad but methanogens are particularly sensitive to ammonia stress capson tojo et al 2020 kalamaras et al 2020 consequently a decline in the methanogenic activity is often observed at high ammonia levels which causes a feedback inhibition loop and may eventually lead to ad failure another common observation under ammonia stress is the shift of the methanogenesis pathway from the acetoclastic pathway to the hydrogenotrophic pathway capson tojo et al 2020 for example hao et al 2017 found that the biodegradation of acetate gradually shifted from the acetoclastic methanogenesis to the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in mesophilic ad reactors when the total ammonia nitrogen tan was elevated from 0 14 to 7 g l tian et al 2018b indicated that syntrophic acetate oxidation coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis sao hm pathway was enhanced after the ammonia acclimation process up to 10 g nh4 n l in mesophilic reactors co digesting cattle slurry and microalgae as evidenced by the increase of the relative abundance of clostridium ultunense and methanoculleus similarly wang et al 2020 found that a manifest shifting from the acetoclastic pathway to the hydrogenotrophic pathway occurred in dry ad ts 20 of pig manure and food waste in which there was a high tan concentration of 5293 mg n l the shift of the methanogenesis pathway under ammonia stress has attracted considerable research interest due to its significance in understanding the tolerance response of methanogens to in situ ammonia stress gao et al 2015 developing mitigation strategies tian et al 2019 and exploring novel processes for bioconversion of carbon dioxide to methane wang et al 2016 zabranska and pokorna 2018 the consensus from different studies is that hydrogenotrophic methanogens hms are much more resistant to ammonia inhibition than acetoclastic methanogens ams capson tojo et al 2020 however there are still considerable knowledge gaps to be addressed for example in most studies the different tolerance of hm and am to ammonia inhibition was inferred from microbial community changes or metabolic shifts under ammonia stress hao et al 2017 tian et al 2018b wang et al 2020 while explicit comparative investigation on the ammonia tolerance levels of these two types of methanogens are surprisingly rare angelidaki and ahring 1993 tian et al 2018a in addition the impacts of nh4 and fan have rarely been distinguished especially for hms more specifically in almost all studies the inhibitory effects were investigated based on fan and tan while nh4 was overlooked capson tojo et al 2020 furthermore studies on the viability and recoverability of ams and hms after severe ammonia inhibition are also rare to address the above knowledge gaps this study systematically investigated the responses of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic cultures to ammonia inhibition at different tan and ph values under mesophilic conditions the specific objectives were 1 to quantitatively compare the ammonia tolerance levels of ams and hms 2 to distinguish the impacts of fan and nh4 on ams and hms 3 to investigate the viability and recoverability of hms and ams after acute ammonia inhibition and 4 to explore the possible mechanisms causing the different responses of ams and hms to ammonia inhibition it is expected that the findings in this study could contribute to a better understanding of the different responses of ams and hms to ammonia stress and provide useful information for developing tailored operating strategies to mitigate ammonia inhibition in practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 selective enrichment of ams and hms cultures two 2 l anaerobic sequencing batch reactors referred to as asbram and asbrhm were used as selective enrichment systems asbram was used to selectively enrich the culture of ams with 2000 mg cod l acetate as the sole carbon source while asbrhm was fed with 1000 mg cod l formate to enrich the culture of hms sun et al 2020 dewatered anaerobic sludge collected from a mesophilic digester at a local municipal wastewater treatment plant in galway ireland was used as the inoculum in both bioreactors the total solids ts and volatile solids vs of the raw anaerobic sludge were 20 0 and 12 8 respectively prior to incubation the raw sludge was diluted with the mineral medium to reach 4 5 ts content and filtered through a 1 10 mm sieve mesh to remove large particles the two bioreactors were incubated on an orbital platform shaker at a rotational speed of 150 rpm which was placed inside a chemostat incubator at 37 0 1 0 c the hydraulic retention time of the two bioreactors was 48 h and the reaction cycle was 24 h the typical operation cycle of the two asbrs consisted of four consecutive stages 5 min of feeding 23 h of anaerobic reaction 50 min of settlement and 5 min of discharge all these steps were operated anaerobically the ph of the influent for the two asbrs was adjusted to 7 0 by using either 2m hcl or 2m naoh solutions the mineral medium was modified from the study of wang et al 2018 and consisted of 500 mg l nh4cl 150 mg l cacl2 200 mg l mgso4 7h2o 1062 5 mg l k2hpo4 467 84 mg l nah2po4 3 g l nahco3 and 0 5 ml l trace element solution trace elements were composed of 2 g l fecl3 4h2o 2 g l cocl2 6h2o 0 5 g l mncl2 4h2o 30 mg l

tests under non inhibited conditions after over four months of successive incubation with the asbram and asbrhm preliminary batch experiments were conducted to test whether the targeted methanogenic cultures ams or hms were sufficiently enriched in each reactor in the experiments two carbon sources 2 0 g cod l acetate prepared with sodium acetate and h2 co2 80 20 v v gas mixture were used individually to determine the specific methanogenic activity sma of the anaerobic sludge enriched in each reactor and of the raw sludge without enrichment meanwhile 2 0 g anaerobic sludge was drawn from each reactor and the inoculum for the investigation of the microbial community structure 2 2 2 inhibition tests following successful enrichment of the two types of methanogenic cultures batch inhibition experiments were performed using 160 ml serum bottles considering the fact that chloride was less inhibitory than ammonium lay et al 1998 ammonium chloride rather than any other ammonium salts was used to generate the required levels of ammonium in the inhibition experiments the ph was adjusted to the desired level table 1 by using either 2m hcl or 2m naoh solutions the experimental conditions for the ammonia inhibition tests are summarized in table 1 all the experiments were conducted in triplicate for each condition before the commencement of the inhibition experiments the enriched sludge taken from each bioreactor was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 minutes hettich rotofix 32a andreas hettich gmbh co kg germany and then washed with phosphate buffer three times in the batch inhibition experiments with acetoclastic methanogens set a a certain amount of sludge pellets was resuspended with 50 ml of the prepared medium consisting of 2 0 g cod l acetate prepared with sodium acetate and different concentrations of ammonia table 1 in each serum bottle to obtain an initial biomass concentration of 3 g vss l the total na concentration introduced by the medium solution i e sodium acetate and naoh for ph adjustment was 1 88 g l which was much lower than the inhibition threshold of 3 5 g l rinzema et al 1988 chen et al 2003 therefore sodium toxicity to ams was considered negligible and no additional control was used assess the impacts of sodium ions in the batch inhibition experiments with hydrogenotrophic methanogens set b aliquots of sludge pellets were dispensed into the serum bottles with the prepared medium containing different concentrations of ammonia table 1 to form 30 ml mixed liquors at a biomass concentration of 3 g vss l subsequently all the serum bottles were made anaerobic by flushing with pure nitrogen gas and then immediately closed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimp seals additionally in set b experiments all the serum bottles were purged with h2 co2 80 20 gas mixture and pressurized to the required pressure partial hydrogen pressure p h 2 is 101 kpa in order to avoid the decrease of ph caused by the introduce of h2 co2 80 20 gas mixture 3 g nahco3 l 1062 5 mg l k2hpo4 and 467 84 mg l nah2po4 were used in the medium solution in each serum bottle afterwards all the serum bottles were placed on an orbital platform shaker at 150 rpm in an air bath incubator 37 0 1 0 c the headspace pressure in each bottle was periodically recorded and then 100 μl of biogas was taken with a gas syringe to determine biogas composition 2 2 3 batch recovery experiments in the recovery experiments set c and set d after the short term inhibition experiments lasting two days in set a and set b the mixed liquor in these serum bottles was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 minutes then the sludge pellets were washed three times with phosphate buffer and subsequently dispensed with the mineral medium into the serum bottles afterwards 0 18 g n l was added to each bottle as nitrogen source and the original ph in each bottle was maintained at 7 0 as shown in table 1 all the other conditions were the same as those used in the set a and set b inhibition experiments 2 3 determination of the specific methanogenic activity the specific acetoclastic methanogenic activity sama regueiro et al 2012 van loosdrecht et al 2016 and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity shma coates et al 1996 of the ams and hms cultures at different ammonia levels were determined based on the methane production rate with acetate 2 0 g cod l and h2 co2 80 20 as the sole carbon source respectively for the measurement of sama the initial food to microorganisms f m ratio was 2 3 g cod g vss the components of the medium were described in detail in van loosdrecht et al 2016 the methane production was measured based on the measurement of headspace pressure and methane content for the measurement of shma the methodology was based on the measurement of the headspace pressure according to the protocol proposed by coates et al 1996 in an enclosed ad system the inside pressure depletion is stoichiometrically correlated with methane production for the conversion of h2 co2 to methane according to eq 2 hence the methane yield δ n c h 4 mol generated from h2 co2 during a specific interval of time can be estimated based on the pressure change as shown in eq 3 ripoll et al 2020 where δ p is the pressure change within the headspace kpa v is the volume of the headspace l r is the ideal gas constant 8 314 l kpa k mol and t is

table 1 was monitored every 1 or 2 h on the completion of the test the sma sama or shma was estimated from the maximum rate of methane production which was determined from the slope s n ml h of the cumulative methane n ml produced against the reaction time h all the sma values were normalized to biomass vss g used and expressed as g cod ch4 g vss d according to eq 4 where f n ml g cod ch4 is the stoichiometric volume of methane in ml equivalent to 1 g cod at standard temperature and pressure stp 4 s m a s 24 f v s s 2 4 inhibition models assuming that the methanogenic activity is inhibited by

database the live dead baclighttm bacterial viability kit molecular probes l 7012 thermo fisher scientific composed of two nucleic acid binding stains green fluorescent syto 9 and red fluorescent propidium iodide pi was employed to assess the viability of the ams and hms cultures after different degrees of ammonia stress table 1 this method is based on the principle that the sytotm 9 stain selectively reacts to living cells to give green fluorescence whereas the pi stain selectively reacts to dead cells to give red fluorescence du et al 2020 hao et al 2009 images with red and green fluorescence were respectively photographed under a fluorescence microscope nikon 90i and then the red and green areas were quantified with image j software the ratio of green fluorescence to total

by one way analysis of variance anova with p values calculated at a 95 confidence level spearman correlation analysis was performed to determine the relationship between the activity of methanogens and the different factors by using spss 28 the inhibition modeling was conducted by non linear curve fit with originpro 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 activity and community structure of the enriched methanogenic cultures to ensure that the targeted ams and hms cultures were selectively and adequately enriched preliminary batch experiments were carried out to estimate the sama and shma of the methanogenic cultures in the asbram and asbrhm furthermore the enriched cultures and the raw sludge inoculum were analyzed by high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing the results are present in fig 1 the sama of the asbram culture increased from 0 162 0 004 to 0 757 0 004 g cod ch4 g vss d after incubation with acetate as the sole carbon source for 4 months fig 1a the shma of the hms culture reached 1 102 0 014 g cod ch4 g vss d which was roughly 3 1 times the raw sludge s shma 0 357 0 004 g cod ch4 g vss d both the sama for the asbram culture and the shma for the asbrhm culture were close to those values reported in former studies ripoll et al 2020 noteworthy the hms culture had no acetoclastic methanogenic activity sama 0 fig 1a indicating the hms culture did not consist of metabolically active ams however for ams culture hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity of 0 171 0 008 g cod ch4 g vss d was still measured which was about 22 6 of the culture s acetoclastic methanogenic activity sama there were three possible reasons for this phenomenon 1 some species in ams culture were capable of utilizing h2 co2 to produce ch4 or 2 the ams culture in asbram still contained some hms which were capable of utilizing h2 co2 to produce ch4 or 3 homoacetogenic organisms in the ams culture converted h2 co2 to acetate which was then utilized by the ams to produce ch4 this issue will be clarified in the following paragraphs after the selective enrichment the relative abundance of the archaeal population was significantly increased in both the ams and hms cultures reaching 27 6 and 58 5 respectively at the kingdom level from 1 6 in the raw sludge fig 1b the archaeal community structure fig 1d shows that acetoclastic genera methanothrix former methanosaeta in which species utilize acetate as their sole source of energy were the most dominant methanogens 92 4 in the ams culture followed by hydrogenotrophic genera methanobacterium 3 5 meanwhile no defined homoacetogenic bacteria were detected in both the ams and hms cultures fig 1c the above results indicate that the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity measured in the enriched ams culture fig 1a solely resulted from the hms nonetheless the presence of hms in the ams culture would not affect its representativeness in assessing the ammonia tolerance of ams because of the following reasons 1 the proportion 3 5 of the hms in the enriched ams culture was very small as compared with the ams 92 4 and 2 the hms could not contribute to the acetoclastic methanogenic activity due to the absence of homoacetogenic bacteria which may otherwise facilitate hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis via the sao hm pathway in the hms culture hydrogenotrophic genera methanobacterium accounted for 95 1 overwhelmingly dominated followed by hydrogenotrophic genera methanobrevibacter 4 1 the results show that most archaea 99 2 in the hms culture were hydrogenotrophic methanogens so the shma of the hms culture measured fig 1a practically represented the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity in summary the above results prove that the target ams and hms cultures were selectively and adequately enriched hence the enriched cultures could be suitably used to assess the tolerance responses of ams and hms to ammonia stress 3 2 tolerance of ams and hms to ammonia stress the inhibitory effects of different tan concentrations 0 2 10 g n l at varying ph 7 0 8 5 on the activity of ams sama and hms shma are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively the activities of ams and hms both decreased with the increase of tan concentrations at given ph conditions for instance at the ph of 7 0 the sama significantly decreased p 0 05 from 0 753 0 004 to 0 221 0 011 g cod ch4 g vss d when the tan concentration increased from 0 2 to 4 g n l similarly the shma declined from 1 100 0 019 to 0 217 0 010 g cod ch4 g vss d when the tan concentration rose from 0 2 to 10 0 g n l consistent with previous studies werner et al 2014 ams were much more sensitive to tan than hms under given ph conditions it should be noted that the sama slightly decreased when tan was still not greater than 1 0 g n l and ph was moderate e g 7 0 and 7 5 the results showed that ams were extremely sensitive to ammonia exposure even at low tan levels 1 0 g n l as depicted in fig 2a the sama decreased by more than 50 when the tan concentration exceeded 2 0 g n l regardless of the ph conditions furthermore almost complete inhibition of the sama occurred when the tan concentration exceeded 3 0 g n l under high ph conditions 8 0 8 5 conversely tan exerted no severe inhibition on the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity shma even at a high tan of 4 0 g n l under high ph stress 8 5 fig 2b which only resulted in around 32 9 inhibition moreover complete inhibition of shma only occurred when the tan rose to 10 0 g n l at ph 8 5 fig 2c and d illustrate the inhibition degree of sama and shma at different tan concentrations and ph values the ic50 values of tan for sama 50 inhibition ranged from 0 4 to 1 7 g n l whereas it was an order of magnitude higher 4 7 6 8 g n l for shma these observations further indicated that the hms were more resistant to tan in comparison with ams chen et al 2008 another important observation is that the inhibition of ams sama by tan was worsened significantly at higher ph while the inhibition of hms shma by tan was much less dependent on ph especially at tan levels 6 0 g n l fig 2c and d this implies that the hms were much less sensitive to fan inhibition as fan rises rapidly with increasing ph eq s 9 10 therefore the conventional strategy of alleviating ammonia inhibition by lowering ph rajagopal et al 2013 is less effective for hms to further clarify the responses of ams and hms to fan stress their activities under different fan levels are depicted in fig 2e and f the results show that the activity of ams decreased at higher fan levels and was completely inhibited at a fan concentration of around 500 mg n l fig 2e which agrees with previous findings that fan is the key inhibitor jiang et al 2019 in contrast the hms have a much higher tolerance to fan and their response to fan stress was much more dispersed although a decreasing trend of the shma with rising fan was still observed fig 2f more interestingly the inhibition degree of fan to the hms seemed to decrease with the rising ph levels these results suggest that compared with ams the hms were less sensitive to fan inhibition and could be affected by other factors besides fan consistent with previous findings yuan and zhu 2016 the above results indicate that the ammonia inhibition of methanogenesis was affected by several factors including tan fan nh4 and ph hence spearman s correlation between the methanogens activity and the different factors was analyzed the results table 2 show that the activity of acetoclastic methanogens sama was negatively correlated with tan fan and nh4 concentrations p 0 01 as well as ph values p 0 05 besides fan had the greatest impact on sama as indicated by the correlation coefficient rs which was in line with the above results and previous findings müller et al 2006 rajagopal et al 2013 similarly a negative correlation between shma and ammonia concentrations tan fan nh4 p 0 01 was also observed however there was no significant correlation between shma and ph contrary to the ams the hms were more impacted by nh4 than fan these results clearly show that hms had a different response to ammonia inhibition from ams in terms of both tolerance and ammonia species 3 3 inhibition modelling in this study the simple monod inhibition model eq 6 the modified monod inhibition model eq 7 and the sigmoidal inhibition model eq 8 were all employed to simulate the inhibitory effects of both fan and nh4 on ams and hms the modelling results table 3 figs s2 and s3 show that the modified monod inhibition model matched the experimental data from the experiments set a and set b best the simple monod inhibition model also satisfactorily described the experimental data however the fitting of the sigmoidal inhibition model was non convergent therefore the simple and modified monod inhibition models were selected for the modelling study and the modeled parameters are summarized in the results from the modified monod inhibition model demonstrate that a fan concentration of 122 9 14 3 mg n l or an nh4 concentration of 2132 6 196 0 mg n l led to 50 inhibition of the activity of the ams whereas these values increased to 1344 7 93 5 mg n l fan and 6049 9 223 5 mg n l nh4 for the hms the simple monod inhibition model yielded similar results the results show that tolerance of the hms to ammonia inhibition was much higher than the ams specifically the tolerance of the hms to fan inhibition was one order of magnitude higher than the ams and tolerance of the hms to nh4 inhibition was 3 times higher than the ams moreover the results show that the ams were much more sensitive to fan inhibition than nh4 inhibition as compared with the hms specifically the tolerance of the ams to fan inhibition was one order of magnitude lower than nh4 inhibition whereas the tolerance of the hms to fan and nh4 inhibition was in the same order although the hms were still more sensitive to fan inhibition in terms of ic50 k n h 3 and k n h 4 a new indicator the i n h 4 i n h 3 ratio was introduced to evaluate individual contributions of fan and nh4 to the ammonia inhibition if i n h 4 i n h 3 1 nh4 and nh3 would make the equal contributions to the inhibition i n h 4 i n h 3 1 means that nh3 would make more contributions to the inhibition i n h 4 i n h 3 1 means that nh4 would make more contributions to the inhibition the i n h 4 i n h 3 ratios for ams and hms with the increase of tan concentration under different ph conditions are depicted in fig 3 the results show that the ams were more impacted by fan specifically when the ph was above 8 0 the inhibition of the ams predominately resulted from fan when the ph was below 8 0 fan and nh4 had a similar contribution to the inhibition at tan 1 g n l while nh4 had more contribution than fan at tan 1 g n l on the contrary the hms were more impacted by nh4 despite the lower ic50 of fan than nh4 for the hms specifically when the ph was below 8 5 the inhibition of the hms predominately resulted from nh4 the contribution of fan exceeded nh4 only at the highest ph 8 5 all of these trends were exacerbated by increasing tan these results can explain why lowering ph was less effective in relieving ammonia inhibition for the hms fig 2d i e when relieving the fan impact by lowering ph the inhibition from nh4 increased these insights provide useful information for developing tailored mitigation strategies 3 4 recoverability of methanogenic activity after ammonia inhibition after the inhibition experiments ammonia in bioreactors was completely removed and then the recovery of sama and shma was evaluated under non inhibition conditions with fresh culture media table 1 the results are shown in fig 4 for ams the recovery of sama was very limited although a partial recovery of sama was observed with the biomass exposed to low degrees of ammonia stress fig 4a for example the samples exposed to 1 0 g l tan at ph 7 0 recovered their sama from 0 604 0 006 cod ch4 g vss d to 0 655 0 001 g cod ch4 g vss d after the inhibition was removed fig 4a which was still much lower than the maximum sama 0 757 0 004 g cod ch4 g vss d additionally the recovery value of sama showed a downtrend along with the increase of fan concentrations used in the inhibitory tests these results indicated that even a low tan concentration 1 0 4 0 g n l might have caused irreversible inhibition of the acetoclastic methanogenic activity during the short term inhibition process for hms their activity could completely recover after exposure to severe fan or tan stress fan 0 9 g n l or tan 10 g n l when the ph was below 8 0 fig 4b these results mean that the inhibitory effects of ammonia on hms under a certain level were reversible interestingly under certain conditions tan 6 0 g n l and ph 8 the recovery value of shma even exceeded the maximum shma measured before the ammonia stress for example the recovery value reached as high as 1 57 g cod ch4 g vss d for the hm culture exposed to 6 0 g n l tan at ph 7 5 which was approximately 40 above the maximum shma it could be speculated that the activity of hms was stimulated by the ammonia stress a similar hormetic response of microorganisms was found in a study of fan et al 2021 where soil microorganisms were exposed to different levels of heavy metals this phenomenon could be used to develop novel acclimation strategies the inhibitory effect became irreversible when the fan concentration exceeded 1 14 g n l which occurred at high tan and ph levels e g tan 10 0 g n l at ph 8 0 or tan 8 0 g n l at ph 8 5 in summary the above results show that a low degree of ammonia stress could cause irreversible inhibition to ams whereas hms could fully or even over recover their activity from severe ammonia stress this capability of hms along with their high tolerance to ammonia inhibition explains the common observation that the methanogenesis pathway shifts from the acetoclastic route to the hydrogenotrophic pathway under ammonia stress 3 5 possible mechanisms of ams and hms different tolerance responses to ammonia stress as evident from the above hms are much more robust to ammonia stress than ams another direct evidence that supports this conclusion is the much higher cell viability of hms than ams under ammonia stress figs 5 s4 and s5 the living cell proportion in ams culture was significantly decreased with rising ammonia concentrations with a 27 7 reduction at the tan of 4 g n l compared with the controlam fig 5 in contrast there was no significant change in the living cell proportion in hms culture with increasing ammonia concentrations below 8 g n l only a 15 2 reduction was observed for hms at much higher tan concentrations of 10 g n l relative to controlhm these results show that ammonia stress caused more severe death and destruction of the ams populations than of the hms populations which explains the poor recoverability of the ams after the ammonia inhibition although no solid conclusions have been reached regarding the exact mechanism of ammonia toxicity in methanogens several pathways for ammonia inhibition have been proposed based on the transmembrane electrical principle and ph gradients theory such as changes in intracellular ph ammonium ion accumulation and interference with biomethane synthesizing enzymes fig 6 jiang et al 2019 previous studies have proposed that the energy requirements for the potassium k efflux process for proton exchange by the k antiporter of the cell should increase to maintain intracellular ph levels sprott et al 1984 wittmann et al 1995 which could potentially cause inhibition of specific enzyme reactions yin et al 2020 when the k pump cannot work efficiently to compensate for the excessive consumption of intracellular protons by fan an intracellular ph imbalance occurs which then leads to cytotoxicity ling et al 2021 sprott and patel 1986 furthermore high nh4 concentrations inside cells were reported to affect the cytosolic biomethane synthesizing process and the uptake of essential trace elements such as ca2 mg2 required for cell function kadam and boone 1996 yin et al 2020 based on the above toxicity pathways several mechanisms may explain the different tolerance responses of ams and hms to ammonia stress first fan may more quickly diffuse into the ams cells compared with hms cells as shown in fig 6 the un dissociated ammonia molecules fan passively diffuse across cell membranes into the cytoplasm to maintain an equilibrium between the intracellular and extracellular fan concentrations after entering the archaeal cells fan can capture intracellular protons to form ammonium ions nh4 which causes the depletion of intracellular protons and the accumulation of nh4 ling et al 2021 a previous study suggested that the high sensitivity of ams e g methanothrix to ammonia stress was attributed to their cell morphology thin filaments liu et al 2016 the thin filaments of ams enlarge their surface as compared with hms growing as rods so that un dissociated nh3 can diffuse more quickly into the ams cells thereby making them more responsive to fan than the hms demirel and scherer 2008 ling et al 2021 the existence of multiple energy converting hydrogenases in hms such as the eha ehb and ech complexes could be another reason for the high resistance of hms to ammonia stress yan et al 2020 found that hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanothermobacter with the eha b and ech energy converting system had an extraordinary adaption ability to ammonia stress conditions compared to the acetoclastic methanogen methanothrix which did not have the eha b and ech complexes hence methanogens with multiple energy converting systems are more energy efficient to meet energy requirements for regulating proton balance and replenishing h when exposed to high ammonia levels besides the higher tolerance of hms to ammonia stress might be attributed to the higher energy gain gibbs free energy from substrate level phosphorylation fig 6 according to previous studies k uptake and the synthesis or transport of osmoprotectants are important for the microbial cells to overcome ammonia stress and maintain osmotic balance sprott et al 1984 martin et al 1999 thus more energy is required for cell maintenance under ammonia stress which can be obtained from substrate level phosphorylation during methanogenesis yan et al 2020 methanogenesis from h2 co2 δg 135 6 kj mol ch4 is far more exergonic than from acetate δg 31 0 kj mol ch4 yan et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 moreover the methane production capacity of the hms culture 1 102 0 014 g cod ch4 g vss d was much higher than that of the ams 0 757 0 004 g cod ch4 g vss d under non inhibited conditions fig 1a as a result hms may obtain more energy from methanogenesis for cell maintenance and overcoming bioenergetic barriers induced by high ammonia levels in summary the mechanism of ammonia toxicity in methanogens is attributed to changes in intracellular ph ammonium ion accumulation and interference with biomethane synthesizing enzymes the different tolerance responses of ams and hms to ammonia might be related to their different cell morphologies multiple energy converting systems and gibbs free energy from substrate level phosphorylation conclusions in this study the ammonia tolerance and recoverability of ams and hms were assessed under mesophilic conditions the results showed that hms were much more robust to ammonia stress than ams with a tolerance level to free ammonia ic50 1345 mg n l and nh4 ic50 6050 mg n l nearly 11 times and 3 times those of ams nh3 ic50 123 mg n l nh4 ic50 2133 mg n l respectively consistent with general belief the ams were more impacted by free ammonia however the hms were more impacted by nh4 when the ph was 8 0 a low tan 1 0 4 0 g n l could cause irreversible inhibition of the ams due to significant cell death while the activity of hms could be fully or even over recovered from severe ammonia stress fan 0 9 g n l or tan 10 g n l when the ph was 8 0 different tolerance of ams and hms to ammonia stress might be associated with the cell morphology multiple energy converting systems and gibbs free energy from substrate level phosphorylation these new insights can contribute to an in depth understanding of ammonia inhibition in methanogenesis and provide useful

15507,a shift from the acetoclastic to the hydrogenotrophic pathway in methanogenesis under ammonia inhibition is a common observation in anaerobic digestion however there are still considerable knowledge gaps concerning the differential ammonia tolerance of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens ams and hms their responses to different ammonia species nh4 nh3 and their recoverability after ammonia inhibition with the successful enrichment of mesophilic ams and hms cultures this study aimed at addressing the above knowledge gaps through batch inhibition recovery tests and kinetic modeling under varying total ammonia tan 0 2 10 g n l and ph 7 0 8 5 conditions the results showed that the tolerance level of hms to free ammonia fan ic50 1345 mg n l and nh4 ic50 6050 mg n l was nearly 11 times and 3 times those of ams nh3 ic50 123 mg n l nh4 ic50 2133 mg n l respectively consistent with general belief the ams were more impacted by fan however the hms were more adversely affected by nh4 when the ph was 8 0 a low tan 1 0 4 0 g n l could cause irreversible inhibition of the ams due to significant cell death whereas the activity of hms could be fully or even over recovered from severe ammonia stress fan 0 9 g n l or tan 10 g n l ph 8 0 the different tolerance responses of ams and hms might be associated with the cell morphology multiple energy converting

recovery through the production of biogas primarily methane the conversion of organic wastes into biogas in ad is achieved via four successive steps hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis which are catalyzed by distinct groups of microorganisms including hydrolytic bacteria fermentative bacteria acetogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea including acetoclastic methanogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens hu et al 2015 this complex bioprocess is prone to inhibition by certain chemical compounds among which ammoniacal nitrogen is one of the most significant inhibitors yenigün and demirel 2013 especially when treating nitrogen rich feedstock operating under high loading rates and applying dry ad processes capson tojo et al 2020 rajagopal et al 2013 wang et al 2021 in aqueous solutions ammoniacal nitrogen exists in two forms i e free ammonia nitrogen fan or nh3 and ammonium ions nh4 which are in a ph and temperature dependent equilibrium as shown in eq 1 wu et al 2009 fan is generally considered to be more responsible for the ammonia inhibition than nh4 and often treated as a key factor in many studies müller et al 2006 rajagopal et al 2013 1 n h 3 a q h 2 o l n h 4 a q o h a q ammonia inhibition may affect all the stages of ad but methanogens are particularly sensitive to ammonia stress capson tojo et al 2020 kalamaras et al 2020 consequently a decline in the methanogenic activity is often observed at high ammonia levels which causes a feedback inhibition loop and may eventually lead to ad failure another common observation under ammonia stress is the shift of the methanogenesis pathway from the acetoclastic pathway to the hydrogenotrophic pathway capson tojo et al 2020 for example hao et al 2017 found that the biodegradation of acetate gradually shifted from the acetoclastic methanogenesis to the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in mesophilic ad reactors when the total ammonia nitrogen tan was elevated from 0 14 to 7 g l tian et al 2018b indicated that syntrophic acetate oxidation coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis sao hm pathway was enhanced after the ammonia acclimation process up to 10 g nh4 n l in mesophilic reactors co digesting cattle slurry and microalgae as evidenced by the increase of the relative abundance of clostridium ultunense and methanoculleus similarly wang et al 2020 found that a manifest shifting from the acetoclastic pathway to the hydrogenotrophic pathway occurred in dry ad ts 20 of pig manure and food waste in which there was a high tan concentration of 5293 mg n l the shift of the methanogenesis pathway under ammonia stress has attracted considerable research interest due to its significance in understanding the tolerance response of methanogens to in situ ammonia stress gao et al 2015 developing mitigation strategies tian et al 2019 and exploring novel processes for bioconversion of carbon dioxide to methane wang et al 2016 zabranska and pokorna 2018 the consensus from different studies is that hydrogenotrophic methanogens hms are much more resistant to ammonia inhibition than acetoclastic methanogens ams capson tojo et al 2020 however there are still considerable knowledge gaps to be addressed for example in most studies the different tolerance of hm and am to ammonia inhibition was inferred from microbial community changes or metabolic shifts under ammonia stress hao et al 2017 tian et al 2018b wang et al 2020 while explicit comparative investigation on the ammonia tolerance levels of these two types of methanogens are surprisingly rare angelidaki and ahring 1993 tian et al 2018a in addition the impacts of nh4 and fan have rarely been distinguished especially for hms more specifically in almost all studies the inhibitory effects were investigated based on fan and tan while nh4 was overlooked capson tojo et al 2020 furthermore studies on the viability and recoverability of ams and hms after severe ammonia inhibition are also rare to address the above knowledge gaps this study systematically investigated the responses of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic cultures to ammonia inhibition at different tan and ph values under mesophilic conditions the specific objectives were 1 to quantitatively compare the ammonia tolerance levels of ams and hms 2 to distinguish the impacts of fan and nh4 on ams and hms 3 to investigate the viability and recoverability of hms and ams after acute ammonia inhibition and 4 to explore the possible mechanisms causing the different responses of ams and hms to ammonia inhibition it is expected that the findings in this study could contribute to a better understanding of the different responses of ams and hms to ammonia stress and provide useful information for developing tailored operating strategies to mitigate ammonia inhibition in practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 selective enrichment of ams and hms cultures two 2 l anaerobic sequencing batch reactors referred to as asbram and asbrhm were used as selective enrichment systems asbram was used to selectively enrich the culture of ams with 2000 mg cod l acetate as the sole carbon source while asbrhm was fed with 1000 mg cod l formate to enrich the culture of hms sun et al 2020 dewatered anaerobic sludge collected from a mesophilic digester at a local municipal wastewater treatment plant in galway ireland was used as the inoculum in both bioreactors the total solids ts and volatile solids vs of the raw anaerobic sludge were 20 0 and 12 8 respectively prior to incubation the raw sludge was diluted with the mineral medium to reach 4 5 ts content and filtered through a 1 10 mm sieve mesh to remove large particles the two bioreactors were incubated on an orbital platform shaker at a rotational speed of 150 rpm which was placed inside a chemostat incubator at 37 0 1 0 c the hydraulic retention time of the two bioreactors was 48 h and the reaction cycle was 24 h the typical operation cycle of the two asbrs consisted of four consecutive stages 5 min of feeding 23 h of anaerobic reaction 50 min of settlement and 5 min of discharge all these steps were operated anaerobically the ph of the influent for the two asbrs was adjusted to 7 0 by using either 2m hcl or 2m naoh solutions the mineral medium was modified from the study of wang et al 2018 and consisted of 500 mg l nh4cl 150 mg l cacl2 200 mg l mgso4 7h2o 1062 5 mg l k2hpo4 467 84 mg l nah2po4 3 g l nahco3 and 0 5 ml l trace element solution trace elements were composed of 2 g l fecl3 4h2o 2 g l cocl2 6h2o 0 5 g l mncl2 4h2o 30 mg l

tests under non inhibited conditions after over four months of successive incubation with the asbram and asbrhm preliminary batch experiments were conducted to test whether the targeted methanogenic cultures ams or hms were sufficiently enriched in each reactor in the experiments two carbon sources 2 0 g cod l acetate prepared with sodium acetate and h2 co2 80 20 v v gas mixture were used individually to determine the specific methanogenic activity sma of the anaerobic sludge enriched in each reactor and of the raw sludge without enrichment meanwhile 2 0 g anaerobic sludge was drawn from each reactor and the inoculum for the investigation of the microbial community structure 2 2 2 inhibition tests following successful enrichment of the two types of methanogenic cultures batch inhibition experiments were performed using 160 ml serum bottles considering the fact that chloride was less inhibitory than ammonium lay et al 1998 ammonium chloride rather than any other ammonium salts was used to generate the required levels of ammonium in the inhibition experiments the ph was adjusted to the desired level table 1 by using either 2m hcl or 2m naoh solutions the experimental conditions for the ammonia inhibition tests are summarized in table 1 all the experiments were conducted in triplicate for each condition before the commencement of the inhibition experiments the enriched sludge taken from each bioreactor was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 minutes hettich rotofix 32a andreas hettich gmbh co kg germany and then washed with phosphate buffer three times in the batch inhibition experiments with acetoclastic methanogens set a a certain amount of sludge pellets was resuspended with 50 ml of the prepared medium consisting of 2 0 g cod l acetate prepared with sodium acetate and different concentrations of ammonia table 1 in each serum bottle to obtain an initial biomass concentration of 3 g vss l the total na concentration introduced by the medium solution i e sodium acetate and naoh for ph adjustment was 1 88 g l which was much lower than the inhibition threshold of 3 5 g l rinzema et al 1988 chen et al 2003 therefore sodium toxicity to ams was considered negligible and no additional control was used assess the impacts of sodium ions in the batch inhibition experiments with hydrogenotrophic methanogens set b aliquots of sludge pellets were dispensed into the serum bottles with the prepared medium containing different concentrations of ammonia table 1 to form 30 ml mixed liquors at a biomass concentration of 3 g vss l subsequently all the serum bottles were made anaerobic by flushing with pure nitrogen gas and then immediately closed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimp seals additionally in set b experiments all the serum bottles were purged with h2 co2 80 20 gas mixture and pressurized to the required pressure partial hydrogen pressure p h 2 is 101 kpa in order to avoid the decrease of ph caused by the introduce of h2 co2 80 20 gas mixture 3 g nahco3 l 1062 5 mg l k2hpo4 and 467 84 mg l nah2po4 were used in the medium solution in each serum bottle afterwards all the serum bottles were placed on an orbital platform shaker at 150 rpm in an air bath incubator 37 0 1 0 c the headspace pressure in each bottle was periodically recorded and then 100 μl of biogas was taken with a gas syringe to determine biogas composition 2 2 3 batch recovery experiments in the recovery experiments set c and set d after the short term inhibition experiments lasting two days in set a and set b the mixed liquor in these serum bottles was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 minutes then the sludge pellets were washed three times with phosphate buffer and subsequently dispensed with the mineral medium into the serum bottles afterwards 0 18 g n l was added to each bottle as nitrogen source and the original ph in each bottle was maintained at 7 0 as shown in table 1 all the other conditions were the same as those used in the set a and set b inhibition experiments 2 3 determination of the specific methanogenic activity the specific acetoclastic methanogenic activity sama regueiro et al 2012 van loosdrecht et al 2016 and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity shma coates et al 1996 of the ams and hms cultures at different ammonia levels were determined based on the methane production rate with acetate 2 0 g cod l and h2 co2 80 20 as the sole carbon source respectively for the measurement of sama the initial food to microorganisms f m ratio was 2 3 g cod g vss the components of the medium were described in detail in van loosdrecht et al 2016 the methane production was measured based on the measurement of headspace pressure and methane content for the measurement of shma the methodology was based on the measurement of the headspace pressure according to the protocol proposed by coates et al 1996 in an enclosed ad system the inside pressure depletion is stoichiometrically correlated with methane production for the conversion of h2 co2 to methane according to eq 2 hence the methane yield δ n c h 4 mol generated from h2 co2 during a specific interval of time can be estimated based on the pressure change as shown in eq 3 ripoll et al 2020 where δ p is the pressure change within the headspace kpa v is the volume of the headspace l r is the ideal gas constant 8 314 l kpa k mol and t is

table 1 was monitored every 1 or 2 h on the completion of the test the sma sama or shma was estimated from the maximum rate of methane production which was determined from the slope s n ml h of the cumulative methane n ml produced against the reaction time h all the sma values were normalized to biomass vss g used and expressed as g cod ch4 g vss d according to eq 4 where f n ml g cod ch4 is the

database the live dead baclighttm bacterial viability kit molecular probes l 7012 thermo fisher scientific composed of two nucleic acid binding stains green fluorescent syto 9 and red fluorescent propidium iodide pi was employed to assess the viability of the ams and hms cultures after different degrees of ammonia stress table 1 this method is based on the principle that the sytotm 9 stain selectively reacts to living cells to give green fluorescence whereas the pi stain selectively reacts to dead cells to give red fluorescence du et al 2020 hao et al 2009 images with red and green fluorescence were respectively photographed under a fluorescence microscope nikon 90i and then the red and green areas were quantified with image j software the ratio of green fluorescence to total

enriched methanogenic cultures to ensure that the targeted ams and hms cultures were selectively and adequately enriched preliminary batch experiments were carried out to estimate the sama and shma of the methanogenic cultures in the asbram and asbrhm furthermore the enriched cultures and the raw sludge inoculum were analyzed by high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing the results are present in fig 1 the sama of the asbram culture increased from 0 162 0 004 to 0 757 0 004 g cod ch4 g vss d after incubation with acetate as the sole carbon source for 4 months fig 1a the shma of the hms culture reached 1 102 0 014 g cod ch4 g vss d which was roughly 3 1 times the raw sludge s shma 0 357 0 004 g cod ch4 g vss d both the sama for the asbram culture and the shma for the asbrhm culture were close to those values reported in former studies ripoll et al 2020 noteworthy the hms culture had no acetoclastic methanogenic activity sama 0 fig 1a indicating the hms culture did not consist of metabolically active ams however for ams culture hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity of 0 171 0 008 g cod ch4 g vss d was still measured which was about 22 6 of the culture s acetoclastic methanogenic activity sama there were three possible reasons for this phenomenon 1 some species in ams culture were capable of utilizing h2 co2 to produce ch4 or 2 the ams culture in asbram still contained some hms which were capable of utilizing h2 co2 to produce ch4 or 3 homoacetogenic organisms in the ams culture converted h2 co2 to acetate which was then utilized by the ams to produce ch4 this issue will be clarified in the following paragraphs after the selective enrichment the relative abundance of the archaeal population was significantly increased in both the ams and hms cultures reaching 27 6 and 58 5 respectively at the kingdom level from 1 6 in the raw sludge fig 1b the archaeal community structure fig 1d shows that acetoclastic genera methanothrix former methanosaeta in which species utilize acetate as their sole source of energy were the most dominant methanogens 92 4 in the ams culture followed by hydrogenotrophic genera methanobacterium 3 5 meanwhile no defined homoacetogenic bacteria were detected in both the ams and hms cultures fig 1c the above results indicate that the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity measured in the enriched ams culture fig 1a solely resulted from the hms nonetheless the presence of hms in the ams culture would not affect its representativeness in assessing the ammonia tolerance of ams because of the following reasons 1 the proportion 3 5 of the hms in the enriched ams culture was very small as compared with the ams 92 4 and 2 the hms could not contribute to the acetoclastic methanogenic activity due to the absence of homoacetogenic bacteria which may otherwise facilitate hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis via the sao hm pathway in the hms culture hydrogenotrophic genera methanobacterium accounted for 95 1 overwhelmingly dominated followed by hydrogenotrophic genera methanobrevibacter 4 1 the results show that most archaea 99 2 in the hms culture were hydrogenotrophic methanogens so the shma of the hms culture measured fig 1a practically represented the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity in summary the above results prove that the target ams and hms cultures were selectively and adequately enriched hence the enriched cultures could be suitably used to assess the tolerance responses of ams and hms to ammonia stress 3 2 tolerance of ams and hms to ammonia stress the inhibitory effects of different tan concentrations 0 2 10 g n l at varying ph 7 0 8 5 on the activity of ams sama and hms shma are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively the activities of ams and hms both decreased with the increase of tan concentrations at given ph conditions for instance at the ph of 7 0 the sama significantly decreased p 0 05 from 0 753 0 004 to 0 221 0 011 g cod ch4 g vss d when the tan concentration increased from 0 2 to 4 g n l similarly the shma declined from 1 100 0 019 to 0 217 0 010 g cod ch4 g vss d when the tan concentration rose from 0 2 to 10 0 g n l consistent with previous studies werner et al 2014 ams were much more sensitive to tan than hms under given ph conditions it should be noted that the sama slightly decreased when tan was still not greater than 1 0 g n l and ph was moderate e g 7 0 and 7 5 the results showed that ams were extremely sensitive to ammonia exposure even at low tan levels 1 0 g n l as depicted in fig 2a the sama decreased by more than 50 when the tan concentration exceeded 2 0 g n l regardless of the ph conditions furthermore almost complete inhibition of the sama occurred when the tan concentration exceeded 3 0 g n l under high ph conditions 8 0 8 5 conversely tan exerted no severe inhibition on the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity shma even at a high tan of 4 0 g n l under high ph stress 8 5 fig 2b which only resulted in around 32 9 inhibition moreover complete inhibition of shma only occurred when the tan rose to 10 0 g n l at ph 8 5 fig 2c and d illustrate the inhibition degree of sama and shma at different tan concentrations and ph values the ic50 values of tan for sama 50 inhibition ranged from 0 4 to 1 7 g n l whereas it was an order of magnitude higher 4 7 6 8 g n l for shma these observations further indicated that the hms were more resistant to tan in comparison with ams chen et al 2008 another important observation is that the inhibition of ams sama by tan was worsened significantly at higher ph while the inhibition of hms shma by tan was much less dependent on ph especially at tan levels 6 0 g n l fig 2c and d this implies that the hms were much less sensitive to fan inhibition as fan rises rapidly with increasing ph eq s 9 10 therefore the conventional strategy of alleviating ammonia inhibition by lowering ph rajagopal et al 2013 is less effective for hms to further clarify the responses of ams and hms to fan stress their activities under different fan levels are depicted in fig 2e and f the results show that the activity of ams decreased at higher fan levels and was completely inhibited at a fan concentration of around 500 mg n l fig 2e which agrees with previous findings that fan is the key inhibitor jiang et al 2019 in contrast the hms have a much higher tolerance to fan and their response to fan stress was much more dispersed although a decreasing trend of the shma with rising fan was still observed fig 2f more interestingly the inhibition degree of fan to the hms seemed to decrease with the rising ph levels these results suggest that compared with ams the hms were less sensitive to fan inhibition and could be affected by other factors besides fan consistent with previous findings yuan and zhu 2016 the above results indicate that the ammonia inhibition of methanogenesis was affected by several factors including tan fan nh4 and ph hence spearman s correlation between the methanogens activity and the different factors was analyzed the results table 2 show that the activity of acetoclastic methanogens sama was negatively correlated with tan fan and nh4 concentrations p 0 01 as well as ph values p 0 05 besides fan had the greatest impact on sama as indicated by the correlation coefficient rs which was in line with the above results and previous findings müller et al 2006 rajagopal et al 2013 similarly a negative correlation between shma and ammonia concentrations tan fan nh4 p 0 01 was also observed however there was no significant correlation between shma and ph contrary to the ams the hms were more impacted by nh4 than fan these results clearly show that hms had a different response to ammonia inhibition from ams in terms of both tolerance and ammonia species 3 3 inhibition modelling in this study the simple monod inhibition model eq 6 the modified monod inhibition model eq 7 and the sigmoidal inhibition model eq 8 were all employed to simulate the inhibitory effects of both fan and nh4 on ams and hms the modelling results table 3 figs s2 and s3 show that the modified monod inhibition model matched the experimental data from the experiments set a and set b best the simple monod inhibition model also satisfactorily described the experimental data however the fitting of the sigmoidal inhibition model was non convergent therefore the simple and modified monod inhibition models were selected for the modelling study and the modeled parameters are summarized in the results from the modified monod inhibition model demonstrate that a fan concentration of 122 9 14 3 mg n l or an nh4 concentration of 2132 6 196 0 mg n l led to 50 inhibition of the activity of the ams whereas these values increased to 1344 7 93 5 mg n l fan and 6049 9 223 5 mg n l nh4 for the hms the simple monod inhibition model yielded similar results the results show that tolerance of the hms to ammonia inhibition was much higher than the ams specifically the tolerance of the hms to fan inhibition was one order of magnitude higher than the ams and tolerance of the hms to nh4 inhibition was 3 times higher than the ams moreover the results show that the ams were much more sensitive to fan inhibition than nh4 inhibition as compared with the hms specifically the tolerance of the ams to fan inhibition was one order of magnitude lower than nh4 inhibition whereas the tolerance of the hms to fan and nh4 inhibition was in the same order although the hms were still more sensitive to fan inhibition in terms of ic50 k n h 3 and k n h 4 a new indicator the i n h 4 i n h 3 ratio was introduced to evaluate individual contributions of fan and nh4 to the ammonia inhibition if i n h 4 i n h 3 1 nh4 and nh3 would make the equal contributions to the inhibition i n h 4 i n h 3 1 means that nh3 would make more contributions to the inhibition i n h 4 i n h 3 1 means that nh4 would make more contributions to the inhibition the i n h 4 i n h 3 ratios for ams and hms with the increase of tan concentration under different ph conditions are depicted in fig 3 the results show that the ams were more impacted by fan specifically when the ph was above 8 0 the inhibition of the ams predominately resulted from fan when the ph was below 8 0 fan and nh4 had a similar contribution to the inhibition at tan 1 g n l while nh4 had more contribution than fan at tan 1 g n l on the contrary the hms were more impacted by nh4 despite the lower ic50 of fan than nh4 for the hms specifically when the ph was below 8 5 the inhibition of the hms predominately resulted from nh4 the contribution of fan exceeded nh4 only at the highest ph 8 5 all of these trends were exacerbated by increasing tan these results can explain why lowering ph was less effective in relieving ammonia inhibition for the hms fig 2d i e when relieving the fan impact by lowering ph the inhibition from nh4 increased these insights provide useful information for developing tailored mitigation strategies 3 4 recoverability of methanogenic activity after ammonia inhibition after the inhibition experiments ammonia in bioreactors was completely removed and then the recovery of sama and shma was evaluated under non inhibition conditions with fresh culture media table 1 the results are shown in fig 4 for ams the recovery of sama was very limited although a partial recovery of sama was observed with the biomass exposed to low degrees of ammonia stress fig 4a for example the samples exposed to 1 0 g l tan at ph 7 0 recovered their sama from 0 604 0 006 cod ch4 g vss d to 0 655 0 001 g cod ch4 g vss d after the inhibition was removed fig 4a which was still much lower than the maximum sama 0 757 0 004 g cod ch4 g vss d additionally the recovery value of sama showed a downtrend along with the increase of fan concentrations used in the inhibitory tests these results indicated that even a low tan concentration 1 0 4 0 g n l might have caused irreversible inhibition of the acetoclastic methanogenic activity during the short term inhibition process for hms their activity could completely recover after exposure to severe fan or tan stress fan 0 9 g n l or tan 10 g n l when the ph was below 8 0 fig 4b these results mean that the inhibitory effects of ammonia on hms under a certain level were reversible interestingly under certain conditions tan 6 0 g n l and ph 8 the recovery value of shma even exceeded the maximum shma measured before the ammonia stress for example the recovery value reached as high as 1 57 g cod ch4 g vss d for the hm culture exposed to 6 0 g n l tan at ph 7 5 which was approximately 40 above the maximum shma it could be speculated that the activity of hms was stimulated by the ammonia stress a similar hormetic response of microorganisms was found in a study of fan et al 2021 where soil microorganisms were exposed to different levels of heavy metals this phenomenon could be used to develop novel acclimation strategies the inhibitory effect became irreversible when the fan concentration exceeded 1 14 g n l which occurred at high tan and ph levels e g tan 10 0 g n l at ph 8 0 or tan 8 0 g n l at ph 8 5 in summary the above results show that a low degree of ammonia stress could cause irreversible inhibition to ams whereas hms could fully or even over recover their activity from severe ammonia stress this capability of hms along with their high tolerance to ammonia inhibition explains the common observation that the methanogenesis pathway shifts from the acetoclastic route to the hydrogenotrophic pathway under ammonia stress 3 5 possible mechanisms of ams and hms different tolerance responses to ammonia stress as evident from the above hms are much more robust to ammonia stress than ams another direct evidence that supports this conclusion is the much higher cell viability of hms than ams under ammonia stress figs 5 s4 and s5 the living cell proportion in ams culture was significantly decreased with rising ammonia concentrations with a 27 7 reduction at the tan of 4 g n l compared with the controlam fig 5 in contrast there was no significant change in the living cell proportion in hms culture with increasing ammonia concentrations below 8 g n l only a 15 2 reduction was observed for hms at much higher tan concentrations of 10 g n l relative to controlhm these results show that ammonia stress caused more severe death and destruction of the ams populations than of the hms populations which explains the poor recoverability of the ams after the ammonia inhibition although no solid conclusions have been reached regarding the exact mechanism of ammonia toxicity in methanogens several pathways for ammonia inhibition have been proposed based on the transmembrane electrical principle and ph gradients theory such as changes in intracellular ph ammonium ion accumulation and interference with biomethane synthesizing enzymes fig 6 jiang et al 2019 previous studies have proposed that the energy requirements for the potassium k efflux process for proton exchange by the k antiporter of the cell should increase to maintain intracellular ph levels sprott et al 1984 wittmann et al 1995 which could potentially cause inhibition of specific enzyme reactions yin et al 2020 when the k pump cannot work efficiently to compensate for the excessive consumption of intracellular protons by fan an intracellular ph imbalance occurs which then leads to cytotoxicity ling et al 2021 sprott and patel 1986 furthermore high nh4 concentrations inside cells were reported to affect the cytosolic biomethane synthesizing process and the uptake of essential trace elements such as ca2 mg2 required for cell function kadam and boone 1996 yin et al 2020 based on the above toxicity pathways several mechanisms may explain the different tolerance responses of ams and hms to ammonia stress first fan may more quickly diffuse into the ams cells compared with hms cells as shown in fig 6 the un dissociated ammonia molecules fan passively diffuse across cell membranes into the cytoplasm to maintain an equilibrium between the intracellular and extracellular fan concentrations after entering the archaeal cells fan can capture intracellular protons to form ammonium ions nh4 which causes the depletion of intracellular protons and the accumulation of nh4 ling et al 2021 a previous study suggested that the high sensitivity of ams e g methanothrix to ammonia stress was attributed to their cell morphology thin filaments liu et al 2016 the thin filaments of ams enlarge their surface as compared with hms growing as rods so that un dissociated nh3 can diffuse more quickly into the ams cells thereby making them more responsive to fan than the hms demirel and scherer 2008 ling et al 2021 the existence of multiple energy converting hydrogenases in hms such as the eha ehb and ech complexes could be another reason for the high resistance of hms to ammonia stress yan et al 2020 found that hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanothermobacter with the eha b and ech energy converting system had an extraordinary adaption ability to ammonia stress conditions compared to the acetoclastic methanogen methanothrix which did not have the eha b and ech complexes hence methanogens with multiple energy converting systems are more energy efficient to meet energy requirements for regulating proton balance and replenishing h when exposed to high ammonia levels besides the higher tolerance of hms to ammonia stress might be attributed to the higher energy gain gibbs free energy from substrate level phosphorylation fig 6 according to previous studies k uptake and the synthesis or transport of osmoprotectants are important for the microbial cells to overcome ammonia stress and maintain osmotic balance sprott et al 1984 martin et al 1999 thus more energy is required for cell maintenance under ammonia stress which can be obtained from substrate level phosphorylation during methanogenesis yan et al 2020 methanogenesis from h2 co2 δg 135 6 kj mol ch4 is far more exergonic than from acetate δg 31 0 kj mol ch4 yan et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 moreover the methane production capacity of the hms culture 1 102 0 014 g cod ch4 g vss d was much higher than that of the ams 0 757 0 004 g cod ch4 g vss d under non inhibited conditions fig 1a as a result hms may obtain more energy from methanogenesis for cell maintenance and overcoming bioenergetic barriers induced by high ammonia levels in summary the mechanism of ammonia toxicity in methanogens is attributed to changes in intracellular ph ammonium ion accumulation and interference with biomethane synthesizing enzymes the different tolerance responses of ams and hms to ammonia might be related to their different cell morphologies multiple energy converting systems and gibbs free energy from substrate level phosphorylation conclusions in this study the ammonia tolerance and recoverability of ams and hms were assessed under mesophilic conditions the results showed that hms were much more robust to ammonia stress than ams with a tolerance level to free ammonia ic50 1345 mg n l and nh4 ic50 6050 mg n l nearly 11 times and 3 times those of ams nh3 ic50 123 mg n l nh4 ic50 2133 mg n l respectively consistent with general belief the ams were more impacted by free ammonia however the hms were more impacted by nh4 when the ph was 8 0 a low tan 1 0 4 0 g n l could cause irreversible inhibition of the ams due to significant cell death while the activity of hms could be fully or even over recovered from severe ammonia stress fan 0 9 g n l or tan 10 g n l when the ph was 8 0 different tolerance of ams and hms to ammonia stress might be associated with the cell morphology multiple energy converting systems and gibbs free energy from substrate level phosphorylation these new insights can contribute to an in depth understanding of ammonia inhibition in methanogenesis and provide useful

15508,the development of high flux durable and completely self cleaning membranes is highly desired for separation of massive oil water mixtures herein differently crosslinked poly 2 methacryloyloxylethyl phosphorylcholine pmpc brush grafted stainless steel mesh ssm membranes ssm pmpcs were fabricated by integrating of mussel inspired universal adhesion and crosslinking chemistry with surface initiated activators regenerated by electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization si arget atrp the durability and self cleaning performance of the prepared ssm membranes were evaluated by separating sticky crude oil water mixtures in a continuous recycling dead end filtration device the water filtration flux driven by gravity reached 60 000 l m 2 h 1 with a separation efficiency of over 99 98 furthermore zero flux decline was observed during a 5 h continuous filtration when assisted by mechanical stirring more significantly such a completely self cleaning separation of the well crosslinked ssm pmpc2 membrane under optimized flux and stirring conditions had been operated cumulatively for 190 h in 30 days without any additional cleaning these significant advances are more promising for practical applications in crude oil contaminated water treatments and massive oil water mixture separation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antifouling membrane oil water separation zwitterionic polymer polydopamine self cleaning 1 introduction frequent oil spills and massive oil water mixtures produced from petroleum industry have resulted in severe water pollution and threatened water ecosystems lewis 2020 schrope 2011 peterson et al 2003 wang et al 2015 traditional methods for treating oil contaminated water such as oil skimming air flotation gravity separation adsorption coagulation and biological treatments are limited by low separation efficiency high cost secondary pollution or time consuming etc wang et al 2022 sutrisna et al 2022 zheng et al 2021 thus the development of a facile and more effective strategy for oil water separation is of utmost urgency membrane filtration is investigated as the most effective and promising oil water separation technique owing to its simplicity low cost and the applicability to separate various oily wastewaters without secondary contamination yu et al 2021 peng et al 2016 obaid et al 2017 tremendous efforts have been focused on membrane based oil water separation research kim et al 2022 li et al 2022a 2022b 2021a zhu et al 2021a 2021b there are two types of oil water separation membranes the hydrophobic membranes allow oil to pass through while the hydrophilic membranes selectively allow water to permeate zheng et al 2021 he et al 2015 the hydrophobic membranes are easily clogged by viscous oils and consequently lose their oil water separation function chu et al 2015 but the hydrophilic membranes repel all kinds of oils as long as they are weted with water therefore the hydrophilic membranes especially superhydrophilic ones are more advantageous in anti oil fouling due to their underwater superoleophobicity tang et al 2019 jiang et al 2022 liang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 liu et al 2018 2017 zhang et al 2018 gao et al 2018 meng et al 2022 however the potential application of superhydrophilic filtration membranes for treating massive high content oil water mixture is mainly impeded by the following difficulties i the membranes could still be fouled by oils resulting in decreased flux meng et al 2022 zheng et al 2021 yue et al 2019 tummons et al 2020 tanis kanbur et al 2018 although antifouling and self cleaning membranes were reported they could not prevent oil fouling or completely remove the adhered oils to maintain a constant and high filtration flux ii the low initial filtration flux 100 2000 l m 2 h 1 of most polymeric membranes and even some modified metal mesh membranes is unfavorable for massive oil water separations zhang et al 2022 liu et al 2022 xiong et al 2017 iii the instability of superhydrophilic membranes in practical application conditions is fatal to commercialization he et al 2015 liu et al 2022 xiong et al 2017 to address these three issues a more durable and strongly antifouling metal mesh membrane with extremely high filtration flux 30 000 l m 2 h 1 and separation efficiency is highly desired zheng et al 2021 he et al 2015 since the antifouling performance of a hydrophilic membrane is closely related to its superhydrophilicity strongly hydrophilic materials are preferable for the surface modification zwitterionic phosphorylcholine pc is reported as the strongest hydrophilic group morisaku et al 2008 xue et al 2017 which is the head group of phosphatidylcholine in cell outer membrane zwaal and schroit 1997 gong et al 2013 pc groups linked to surface can form a cell outer membrane mimetic structure in an aqueous environment gong and winnik 2012 gong et al 2011 the closely packed zwitterionic groups on a coating surface attract water molecules to form strongly associated hydration layer through zwitterion dipole interactions which can effectively resist biofouling he et al 2015 chen et al 2005 jiang and cao 2010 wang et al 2014 ma et al 2020 meng et al 2018 2022 the hydrophilicity of zwitterionic polymer coated surfaces can be so strong that the superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic membranes have been fabricated for oil water separation with the advantage of even not requiring the fabrication of surface roughness he et al 2015 yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 moreover the pc group density can be further concentrated on a ssm membrane surface by grafting pmpc brushes resulting in not only a self cleaning effect against oil fouling in a water wetted state but also that oil fouled on the dry pmpc surface could be cleaned up by water wetting he et al 2015 undoubtedly this exciting result makes the pmpc brush modified metal meshes will be more powerful to resist membrane fouling unfortunately such a pmpc brush grafted membrane is conventionally fabricated by surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization si atrp method which requires a specific surface to immobilize the initiator as well as complicated oxygen removing process and high content of environmentally unfriendly heavy metal as catalyst he et al 2015 li et al 2020 recently we developed a universal strategy for efficient fabrication of zwitterionic brushes via polydopamine assisted surface initiated activators regenerated by electron transfer atrp pda si arget atrp li et al 2020 the mussel adhesive protein inspired polydopamine pda strategy enables the atrp initiator immobilization on substrate independent surface moreover the arget atrp technique not only reduces the hazardous catalyst cubr concentration low to 3 6 ppm but also get rid of the repeated freeze thaw oxygen removing process in conventional atrp while such an environmentally friendly mussel adhesion mimicking strategy has drawn much attention for fabricating zwitterionic membranes meng et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 kirschner et al 2017 the possible instability of the pda intermediate layer must be improved before practical applications the small structure of pda oligomers and their noncovalent interaction with the substrate are attributed to the instability of pda coating hong et al 2012 belanger et al 2019 although some degree of chemical crosslinking was employed to stabilize zwitterionic polymers on membrane surfaces but the oil fouling was not completely removed and the flux decline 36 90 was still severe for successive oil water filtration separations li et al 2021b zhu et al 2017 in this report the pda assisted substrate independent atrp initiator coating was crosslinked by different crosslinkers to fabricate more stable pmpc brush coatings for enhanced antifouling and long term completely self cleaning performance as mussel inspired pda universal adhesion and cell membrane mimetic antifouling strategies were integrated in the fabrication of the crosslinked pmpc brush coatings the created membrane surface was termed as crosslinked biomimetic coating stainless steel meshes ssms with 6 13 μm apertures were selected as the original membranes to ensure high flux and separation efficiency the fabrication process and application of the pmpc brush grafted ssm membrane are schematically shown in fig 1 the antifouling performance and durability of the prepared ssm membranes were evaluated by more challenging filtration of adhesive crude oil water mixtures in an easily fouled dead end filtration model 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents dopamine da tris hydroxymethyl aminoethane tris triallylamine taa 3 methacryloxypropyltr imethoxysilane mpts 3 trimethoxysilyl propyl 2 bromo 2 methylpropionate sibr ethanol hydrochloric acid cubr2 bipyridyl bpy ascorbic acid and petroleum ether were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd 2 methacryloyloxylethyl phosphorylcholine mpc was supplied by nanjing joy nature science technology development institute china all the reagents were of analytical

1 mpa s at 20 c was industrially supplied by the petrochina changqing oilfield company 2 2 fabrication of zwitterionic brushes on ssms by pda si arget atrp pmpc brushes were grafted on stainless steel meshes ssms according to a previous procedure li et al 2020 but the atrp initiator coating fabrication is modified by introducing crosslinkers briefly the cleaned ssms were immersed in three kinds of solutions respectively to prepare differently crosslinked atrp initiator coatings marked as csibr 0 csibr 1 csibr 2 as shown in table 1 the reagents were dissolved in pbs ph 8 5 containing 50 v v ethanol to form the designed concentrations as listed in table 1 after shaking 90 rpm at 30 c for 22 h the atrp initiator coatings were rinsed thoroughly with pure water and then crosslinked at 100 c for 4 h the csibr coated ssms were finally immersed in aqueous solution of mpc monomer 20 mg ml 1 and catalyst to prepare the designed pmpc brushes shown in table 1 by arget atrp at 50 c the monomer and catalyst mixed solution contains 0 0036 mg ml 1 cubr2 0 0152 mg ml 1 bpy and 2 0 mg ml 1 ascorbic acid the si arget atrp was performed in a sealed glass vial without any oxygen removing process to prepare a thick brush the ssms were reacted for 12 h at 50 c pmpc brush grafted ssm ssm pmpc was immersed overnight in pbs solution to remove unbound components and then applied in characterization 2 3 instrumentation and characterization morphologies of the bare and coated ssms were observed by a field emission scanning electron microscope su 8010 hitachi japan the elemental composition of the bare and modified ssms was measured by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps with a phi5000 versaprobe iii spectrometer ulvac phi inc japan all the spectra were collected at an electron take off angle of 45 from the surface under vacuum water contact angle wca and underwater oil contact angle oca were observed with a dsa25 drop shape analyzer kruss germany by attaching a 2 μl droplet the oil adhesive force underwater was measured by using a high sensitivity micro electromechanical balance data physics dcat21 germany sliding angle sa was measured by adding 10 μl oil droplets on the membranes and turning the angle slowly until the droplet slid oil content in the separated filtrate was measured with an infrared oil measurement instrument jy oil480 the possible small oil droplets in the filtrate were tested by microscopy ti u nikon and dynamic light scattering malvern zetasizer nanozs90 2 4 oil water separation experiment to evaluate the antifouling performance and durability of the ssms for oil water mixture separation a continuously recycling dead end filtration device was constructed as shown in fig 2 crude oil and water were pumped separately into the upper column from the entrances at oppose directions after mixed in the column and controlling the oil and water flow rates the crude oil water mixture with designed concentration v v was formed immediately the water was filtrated down to the lower column driven by the gravity of the liquid mixture while the oil moved upward and was collected both the separated water and oil were recycled by pumps to achieve a continuous filtration a mechanic stirring was fixed above the membrane to assist removing of the adhered oil by the cross flow force the possible small oil droplets in the filtrate were tested by microscopy and dynamic light scattering oil content in the filtrate was measured with an infrared oil measurement instrument filtration flux f l m 2 h 1 and the oil separation efficiency e of the membrane were calculated by eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 f v a t 2 e 1 c f c 0 100 where a m2 is the effective area of the membrane v l is the volume of filtrated water in the time t h c 0 and c f are the oil concentrations before and after filtration respectively 2 5 membrane stability and durability the stability and durability of the ssm pmpc membranes were tested in a shaking artificial seawater containing 30 v v crude oil at 70 c wca was measured every day after washed with petroleum ether ethanol and water respectively the durability was evaluated by crude oil water mixture separation in a continuously recycling dead end filtration device as shown in fig 2 the filtration flux change with separation time was recorded 3 results and discussion 3 1 crosslinking of the atrp initiator coating and grafting of pmpc brush two crosslinking agents mpts and taa were added in the atrp initiator sibr and da mixed solution to fabricate self adhesive and differently crosslinked atrp initiator coatings csibr 0 csibr 1 and csibr 2 on the immersed ssm surfaces since the da molecules can be oxidized in aqueous solution at ph 8 8 5 by the dissolved o2 and form a mussel mimetic adhesive pda to attach on the immersed materials lee et al 2007 saiz poseu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the atrp initiator molecule sibr was immobilized to form the pda and sibr codeposited atrp initiator coating csibr 0 without additional crosslinker by condensation reactions between trimethoxysilyl groups of sibr and the pda hydroxyl and amino groups li et al 2020 knorr et al 2016 tran et al 2018 the addition of the bifunctional crosslinker mpts in the initiator coating fabrication solution formed a crosslinkable initiator coating csibr 1 since mpts can not only crosslink the sibr initiator by condensation between their trimethoxysilyl groups its methacryl group can also react with amine group of the pda unit by michael addition feng et al 2020 and or polymerize with other olefinic groups furthermore the addition of the other crosslinker taa into the csibr 1 fabrication solution further enhanced the crosslinking degree of the prepared sibr initiator coating csibr 2 by the three functional triallylamine via the possible michael addition with amine group of the pda and polymerization with all other neighboring vinyl groups from mpts and taa the csibr 2 coated ssm can be heated further at 100 120 c for several hours to achieve completely crosslinked structure the chemistry of the atrp initiator coating formation and possible crosslinking mechanisms were illustrated schematically in fig 3 pmpc brush grafting from the csibr coated ssm membranes was carried out conveniently by arget atrp li et al 2020 the arget atrp strategy enables the pmpc brush coating formation in a much low cubr2 catalyst concentration as well as without a complicated oxygen removing process the combination of the simplified fabrication of the pmpc brushes with the crosslinked atrp initiator coatings is advantageous for developing a more stable and highly effective membrane in low cost with less consumption according to the number of crosslinker kinds added in the solutions of the atrp initiator coating fabrication table 1 the grafted pmpc brushes were marked as pmpc0 pmpc1 and pmpc2 respectively 3 2 surface morphology composition and superhydrophilicity the csibr and pmpc coating formation and hydrophilicity improvement were characterized systemically as the color morphology and contact angle of the samples in the same csibr group csibr 0 csibr 1 and csibr 2 or pmpc brush group pmpc0 pmpc1 and pmpc2 had no much difference the following discussion use csibr and pmpc to represent all the two group samples firstly the color change of the ssm membranes after coating fabrication is an obvious evidence of the successful modification as shown in fig 4 a the silver gray color of the bare ssm changed to brown after the csibr and pmpc coating modification the formation and attachment of adhesive pda oligmers during the atrp coating fabrication resulted in the color change since pda is a melanin like material zhu and edmondson 2011 liu et al 2021 compared with the bare ssm and ssm csibr the ssm pmpc membrane showed improved water wetting ability as indicated by the enlarged appearance of the water droplet more significantly the ssm pmpc membrane became superhydrophilic as demonstrated by the extremely large weted area fig 4a secondly the improved wetting ability of ssm csibr and superhydrophilicity of ssm pmpc were quantitatively evaluated by their surface wcas as shown in fig 4b wca of ssm pmpc decreased to 0 from 110 2 and 93 1 of the bare ssm and ssm csibr respectively all the ssm pmpc membranes exhibit excellent super hydrophilicity by their 0 wcas compared to previously reported wcas 1 4 of similar pmpc brush grafted surfaces he et al 2015 kobayashi et al 2013 the superhydrophilicity of ssm pmpc membrane is superior since the 0 wca is reached in 80 ms as shown in fig 4c video s1 to the best of our knowledge such an extremely hydrophilic membrane has not been reported before thirdly and most importantly the csibr and pmpc coating formation on the ssm membrane was strongly supported by the changes of their surface morphologies and elemental compositions as shown in fig 4d the csibr and pmpc coating surfaces exhibit sub micrometer structured domains on the sem images meanwhile the xps analysis results shown in fig 4e and table 2 reveal that the of fe signal on the ssm csibr 2 and ssm pmpc2 membranes is completely screened due to the csibr 2 and pmpc coatings which are thicker than the xps detection limit of 10 nm for polymer coatings the xps surface element analysis indicates 3 78 of p on the ssm pmpc membrane surface table 2 suggesting a densely packed cell membrane mimetic pc zwitterion coating on the ssm membrane since the closely packed phosphatidylcholine c42h80no8p in the cell outer membrane contains only 1 9 of p element gong et al 2013 the densely packed pc zwitterions at the membrane interface can strongly attract more water molecules to form a immobilized hydration layer he et al 2015 leng et al 2015 resulting in the superiorhydrophilicity in addition to the surface chemical composition of densely packed pc zwitterion groups the rough surface morphology of the membrane also contributes to enhanced hydrophilicity feng et al 2002 su et al 2016 3 3 coating stability the stability of a coating modified filtration membrane is fundamental for durable applications a similarly prepared pmpc brush coating pmpc0 has been demonstrated stable in shaking acidic and alkaline ph 1 11 aqueous solutions li et al 2020 since the crosslinking modification dose not decrease the stability of ssm pmpcs in acid and alkaline environments the ssm pmpc membranes was tested differently by immersing in shaking artificial seawater containing 30 v v crude oil at 70 c which corresponds to the environment of oilfield produced fluids after washed with petroleum ether ethanol and water respectively the ssm pmpc membranes exhibited much different wcas as shown in fig 5 a as a low wca value can be attributed to its surface attached more hydrophilic groups molecules the increased wca suggests the detachment or dissolution of the pmpc brush molecules or the pc zwitterionic groups in the test solution the loss of the pc zwitterions on both of the pmpc0 and pmpc1 coating surfaces were strongly supported by the almost disappearance of the p element signals shown in fig 5 b and table 3 while the pmpc2 coating surface showed obvious p signals similar to that of untreated pmpc2 coating surface suggested in fig 4 e moreover the instability of pmpc1 and pmpc0 coatings are revealed more clearly from the sem images as shown in fig 5 c demonstrating the peeling of pmpc1 brush layer and the detachment of pmpc0 together with its adhered atrp initiator layer furthermore the disappearance mechanisms of the pc zwitterions are proposed by considering the results of fig 5 c and table 3 first the pc zwitterionic group could be removed slowly from the pmpc brush since the p element content reduced by 24 and without any detectable loss of the polymer chains on pmpc2 surface second the detachment of pmpc chains on the pmpc0 and pmpc1 surfaces aggravated the loss of pc zwitterions third the uncrosslinked pmpc0 coating was peeled off together with its adhered atrp initiator layer therefore three amazing results can be derived from fig 5 and table 3 i the unstable structure of the pmpc0 brush coating was disclosed unexpectedly since we previously demonstrated that a similarly prepared pmpc brush coating pmpc0 could withstand shaking in ph 1 11 aqueous solutions as well as organic solvents such as ethanol dmso hexane and toluene li et al 2020 ii extremely stable pmpc2 brush was fabricated by the crosslinking reactions of both the mpts and taa crosslinkers if compared to the slightly improved stability of mpts crosslinked coating pmpc1 iii the crude oil was a much stronger destroyer to the prepared pmpc brush coatings since the other media without the crude oil did not increase wca of pmpc0 grafted surface li et al 2020 for understanding the mechanism of the much different stability the fabrication and possible crosslinked structures of the atrp initiator coatings were shown in fig 3 the instability of pmpc0 brush can be ascribed to the instability of the csibr 0 initiator coating since the mussel inspired adhesive pda primer is mainly oligomers and adheres on a surface with noncovalent interactions hong et al 2012 belanger et al 2019 although the initiator sibr showed some weak crosslinking effect in the codeposited csibr 0 coating and enabled the prepared pmpc0 brush could withstand shaking in ph 1 11 aqueous solutions and organic solvents such as ethanol dmso hexane and toluene li et al 2020 the dissolving or removing force of crude oil water mixture to the pmpc0 brush in the heated and shaking crude oil seawater mixture seems stronger than the adhesion force of the brush linked pda oligomer the significant loss of the pda bonded atrp initiator coating csibr 0 was supported by the appearance of the ssm substrate fe and cr element signals shown in fig 5 b since the pristine atrp initiator coating was thick and screened off the substrate signals shown in fig 4 e and table 3 when the crosslinker mpts was added to fabricate the crosslinked initiator coating csibr 1 the individually linked sibr in csibr 0 could be crosslinked by the additional trimethoxysilane groups resulting in an enhanced stability shown by the smaller wca increase in the case of csibr 2 both the mpts and taa could crosslink the initiator coating by different chemistries including condensation michael addition and polymerization forming a doubly and fully crosslinked coating this highly crosslinked atrp initiator coating could envelope the metal filament of ssm and resulted in the most stable pmpc2 brushes regardless the stability of the pristine pda adhesive primer it should be noticed that the crosslinked structures illustrated in fig 3 are only the possible explanations the exact mechanisms of the crosslinked structures are still need more systematic and deep investigations 3 4 underwater superoleophobicity and self cleaning property it is well known that the superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity of filtration membranes are crucially important for resisting oil fouling in practical applications gao et al 2016 xue et al 2011 shi et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 the excellent superhydrophilicity of the ssm pmpc2 membrane is strongly supported by the wca change to 0 in 80 ms which is much better than most reported superhydrophilic membranes with a wca of 2 8 or change to 0 in more than 10 s cheng et al 2018 liu et al 2014 the much better superhydrophilicity of ssm pmpc membrane is attributed to the surface chemical composition of densely packed pc zwitterion groups as well as the rough surface morphology of the zwitterionic polymer coating the strongly associated hydration layer on the ssm pmpc membrane may repel oil droplet approach and thus results in underwater superoleophobicity oca 150 as demonstrated in fig 6 all the tested oil droplets exhibited underwater ocas of 156 170 indicating that the ssm pmpc membrane can efficiently repel oil and show excellent antifouling property huang et al 2018 the excellent superhydrophilicity and stability of ssm pmpc2 endow the membrane strong underwater superoleophobicity at elevated temperature and salt concentration fig s1 which is extremely important for a practical self cleaning membrane separation in most oil water filtrations the antifouling and self cleaning nature of ssm pmpc2 membrane was firstly demonstrated by dropping crude oil on both the bare and pmpc brush grafted ssm membrane surfaces when they were immersed simultaneously into water the adhered crude oil on ssm pmpc2 aggregated to a drop and left the surface in 1 s fig 7 a video s2 while that on the bare ssm remained moveless such a rapid crude oil cleaning removing performance of ssm pmpc2 membrane has not been report before and can be attributed to the strong hygroscopic property of the pc zwitterions lewis et al 2008 choi et al 2017 which makes the surface wetted slightly in the air underwater crude oil cleaning removing ability of different ssm membranes was further evaluated by measuring the oil adhesion forces as shown in fig 7b the adhesion force on the bare and csrbr coated ssm membranes are 30 and 13 μn respectively while that on the ssm pmpc2 membrane is only about 1 μn such a small oil adhesion force on the pmpc2 surface makes the adhered oil can easily be removed by a small disturbing force exerted by simple mechanic stirring or tilting the contact surface as demonstrated in fig 7c using crude oil droplet as an example the underwater sliding angle sa on ssm pmpc membrane is low to 1 2 much smaller than that of 2 5 6 2 for most reported superhydrophilic membranes liu et al 2021 qing et al 2020 the sa indicates that the adhered oil droplet can be removed easily by tilting the membrane surface or by other minor disturbing forces in the view of this point the excellent self cleaning membrane may enable a zero flux decline filtration for oil water separation if assisted by a simple mechanic stirring therefore the ssm pmpc2 membrane can be employed to develop a completely self cleaning oil water filtration device 3 5 self cleaning filtration in order to demonstrate the self cleaning and durable performances of ssm pmpc membranes for oil water separation we designed a continuously recycling dead end filtration device fig 2 and 30 v v crude oil water mixture was chosen for separation as shown in fig 8 a the significant flux decline in the dead end filtration device could be reduced and even inhibited by increasing the stirring rate a super high filtration flux 60 000 l m 2 h 1 video s3 with high separation efficiency 99 98 was recorded continuously in 300 min without detectable flux decline suggesting that the membrane fouling by the 30 v v crude oil water mixture was removed completely by increasing the stirring rate to 120 rpm such a completely self cleaning separation of high content crude oil water mixture with super high filtration flux has not been reported the filtrated water was so clear that no oil droplets 0 2 μm was detected by microscopy and dynamic light scattering as demonstrated in fig s2 the oil content of the filtrated water was as low as 10 ppm which meets the required standards of most countries it should be noted that this encouraging results were measured with super high flux in a dead end filtration model which generally resulting in more severe fouling and rapid flux decline for examples similar crude oil water mixture filtration fluxes decreased by 40 in 60 min with pc polymer anchored superhydrophilic pvdf membrane meng et al 2018 and more than 90 with poly sulfobetaine methacrylate psbma grafted copper mesh flux decline from 80 000 l m 2 h 1 for kerosene water mixture to 2300 l m 2 h 1 for crude oil water mixture he et al 2019 the super high filtration flux and zero flux decline shown in fig 8a are impressive and seems impossible for the adhesive crude oil water mixture separation in the dead end filtration device the separated water volume of this completely self cleaning high flux oil water filtration in 300 min equals to 1350 times of separation by a 200 ml cup type filter to the best of our knowledge these attractive results have not been reported before therefore the result of zero flux decline during 5 hours membrane filtration separation for the sticky crude oil water mixture has great practical significance in developing a continuous and completely self cleaning filtration device system to verify the potential application performance of the pmpc brush coated membranes the above filtration process was extended successively with a small aperture 6 μm ssm pmpc membranes at relatively small water flux 31 500 l m 2 h 1 since the oil repulsive force is increased with the decreased pore diameter while the penetrating force of the dynamic filtration is reduced with decreased flux the small aperture and reduced flux make the crude oil water filtration operated under a safer driving force much smaller than the theoretical intrusion pressure of the membrane calculated by the young laplace equation xue et al 2011 to maintain an excellent separation efficiency 99 98 as shown in fig 8b the roughly zero flux decline filtration separation of 30 v v crude oil water mixture was achieved with all the three ssm pmpc membranes but only the ssm pmpc2 was operated cumulatively for more than 190 h in 30 days without detectable oil fouling more importantly all the successive 6 h per day separations of ssm pmpc2 performed smoothly by optimizing the self cleaning system including antifouling membrane antifouling device and operation condition the excellent antifouling and self cleaning property as well as durability of ssm pmpc2 membrane were strongly supported by the high and roughly constant flux during such a long period 190 h of successive filtration separations and continuously contacting of the 30 v v crude oil water mixture for more than 30 days it is important to emphasize that these excellent results were obtained with high content of adhesive crude oil which is a much stronger contaminant than light and pure hydrocarbon oils zhang et al 2018 furthermore the completely self cleaning separation was performed in the dead end filtration device which generally resulting in more severe fouling and rapid flux decline meng et al 2018 li et al 2021b he et al 2019 the mechanism of this long term completely self cleaning filtration could be explained as follows first the excellent antifouling nature of the ssm pmpc2 membrane provides the basis of complete removal of the oil droplets by enhanced capillary repulsion second the mechanic agitation assists the membrane to remove the settled particles by the strong cross flow force as shown in fig 9 a i e converting the dead end filtration into cross flow filtration mode third the doubly crosslinked superhydrophilic coating endows the membrane durable antifouling property for sustainable separation force analysis of oil droplet on the membrane during the crude oil water filtration was shown in fig 9b the buoyancy of the oil droplet and the capillary repulsive force of the superhydrophilic underwater superoleophobic membrane mainly contribute to the oil removing force since the underwater crude oil adhesion force on ssm pmpc2 membrane 1 μn fig 7b and the filtration pressure at controlled flux 60 000 l m 2 h 1 are small the capillary repulsive force and the oil buoyancy are large the resultant force is usually repelling the oil adhesion moreover the additional mechanic stirring acts as impulsive force to assist the removal of the possibly adhered oil droplets therefore the combination strategy of an excellent antifouling membrane with the assistance of mechanic stirring can overcome the membrane fouling challenge in the oil water filtration separation applications even for high content and adhesive crude oil water mixture can perform completely self cleaning separation in the dead end filtration device compared to the low flux and or severe flux decline of reported superhydrophilic self cleaning membranes and their oil water separation efficiencies listed in table 4 the results of 31 500 60 000 l m 2 h 1 super high flux roughly zero flux decline for 190 h and over 99 98 oil water separation efficiency in this work are the most significant advances to approach practical applications thus the potential applications of the as prepared excellent antifouling ssm pmpc2 membrane and the developed completely self cleaning oil water filtration separation technique are promising in various oil contaminated water treatments on the other hand membrane fouling is a nature tendency in principle although the crude oil fouling demonstrated on the ssm pmpc2 membrane could be removed by the combination of the membrane excellent underwater superoleophobicity and the assistant force of cross flow stirring other contaminants such as various colloid particles and readily adsorbed organic molecules may also fouling the membrane and result in decreased filtration performance in long term application therefore the real application performance of the excellent antifouling ssm pmpc2 membrane needs further evaluation 4 conclusions durable zwitterionic polymer brush was grafted on stainless steel mesh ssm membranes by a two step biomimetic fabrication strategy the atrp initiator layer was firstly created on the ssm via mussel inspired adhesion and stabilized simultaneously by crosslinking chemistry cell outer membrane mimetic antifouling mpc polymer brushes were then grafted from the atrp initiator coatings via a surface initiated activators regenerated by electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization si arget atrp the well crosslinked ssm pmpc2 membrane was extremely stable superhydrophilic and strongly antifouling water filtration flux driven by gravity in a dead end filtration device reached as high as 60 000 l m 2 h 1 with a separation efficiency of over 99 98 for 30 v v crude oil water mixture importantly the excellent self cleaning nature of the membrane enabled a zero flux decline separation when assisted by simple mechanical stirring more significantly such a completely self cleaning dead end filtration under optimized conditions has been operated cumulatively for 190 h in 30 days without any additional cleaning these significant advances paved the way for practical application of membrane filtration in massive oil water mixture

15508,the development of high flux durable and completely self cleaning membranes is highly desired for separation of massive oil water mixtures herein differently crosslinked poly 2 methacryloyloxylethyl phosphorylcholine pmpc brush grafted stainless steel mesh ssm membranes ssm pmpcs were fabricated by integrating of mussel inspired universal adhesion and crosslinking chemistry with surface initiated activators regenerated by electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization si arget atrp the durability and self cleaning performance of the prepared ssm membranes were evaluated by separating sticky crude oil water mixtures in a continuous recycling dead end filtration device the water filtration flux driven by gravity reached 60 000 l m 2 h 1 with a separation efficiency of over 99 98 furthermore zero flux decline was observed during a 5 h continuous filtration when assisted by mechanical stirring more significantly such a completely self cleaning separation of the well crosslinked ssm pmpc2 membrane under optimized flux and stirring conditions had been operated cumulatively for 190 h in 30 days without any additional cleaning these significant advances are more promising for practical applications in crude oil contaminated water treatments and massive oil water mixture separation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antifouling membrane oil water separation zwitterionic polymer polydopamine self cleaning 1 introduction frequent oil spills and massive oil water mixtures produced from petroleum industry have resulted in severe water pollution and threatened water ecosystems lewis 2020 schrope 2011 peterson et al 2003 wang et al 2015 traditional methods for treating oil contaminated water such as oil skimming air flotation gravity separation adsorption coagulation and biological treatments are limited by low separation efficiency high cost secondary pollution or time consuming etc wang et al 2022 sutrisna et al 2022 zheng et al 2021 thus the development of a facile and more effective strategy for oil water separation is of utmost urgency membrane filtration is investigated as the most effective and promising oil water separation technique owing to its simplicity low cost and the applicability to separate various oily wastewaters without secondary contamination yu et al 2021 peng et al 2016 obaid et al 2017 tremendous efforts have been focused on membrane based oil water separation research kim et al 2022 li et al 2022a 2022b 2021a zhu et al 2021a 2021b there are two types of oil water separation membranes the hydrophobic membranes allow oil to pass through while the hydrophilic membranes selectively allow water to permeate zheng et al 2021 he et al 2015 the hydrophobic membranes are easily clogged by viscous oils and consequently lose their oil water separation function chu et al 2015 but the hydrophilic membranes repel all kinds of oils as long as they are weted with water therefore the hydrophilic membranes especially superhydrophilic ones are more advantageous in anti oil fouling due to their underwater superoleophobicity tang et al 2019 jiang et al 2022 liang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 liu et al 2018 2017 zhang et al 2018 gao et al 2018 meng et al 2022 however the potential application of superhydrophilic filtration membranes for treating massive high content oil water mixture is mainly impeded by the following difficulties i the membranes could still be fouled by oils resulting in decreased flux meng et al 2022 zheng et al 2021 yue et al 2019 tummons et al 2020 tanis kanbur et al 2018 although antifouling and self cleaning membranes were reported they could not prevent oil fouling or completely remove the adhered oils to maintain a constant and high filtration flux ii the low initial filtration flux 100 2000 l m 2 h 1 of most polymeric membranes and even some modified metal mesh membranes is unfavorable for massive oil water separations zhang et al 2022 liu et al 2022 xiong et al 2017 iii the instability of superhydrophilic membranes in practical application conditions is fatal to commercialization he et al 2015 liu et al 2022 xiong et al 2017 to address these three issues a more durable and strongly antifouling metal mesh membrane with extremely high filtration flux 30 000 l m 2 h 1 and separation efficiency is highly desired zheng et al 2021 he et al 2015 since the antifouling performance of a hydrophilic membrane is closely related to its superhydrophilicity strongly hydrophilic materials are preferable for the surface modification zwitterionic phosphorylcholine pc is reported as the strongest hydrophilic group morisaku et al 2008 xue et al 2017 which is the head group of phosphatidylcholine in cell outer membrane zwaal and schroit 1997 gong et al 2013 pc groups linked to surface can form a cell outer membrane mimetic structure in an aqueous environment gong and winnik 2012 gong et al 2011 the closely packed zwitterionic groups on a coating surface attract water molecules to form strongly associated hydration layer through zwitterion dipole interactions which can effectively resist biofouling he et al 2015 chen et al 2005 jiang and cao 2010 wang et al 2014 ma et al 2020 meng et al 2018 2022 the hydrophilicity of zwitterionic polymer coated surfaces can be so strong that the superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic membranes have been fabricated for oil water separation with the advantage of even not requiring the fabrication of surface roughness he et al 2015 yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 moreover the pc group density can be further concentrated on a ssm membrane surface by grafting pmpc brushes resulting in not only a self cleaning effect against oil fouling in a water wetted state but also that oil fouled on the dry pmpc surface could be cleaned up by water wetting he et al 2015 undoubtedly this exciting result makes the pmpc brush modified metal meshes will be more powerful to resist membrane fouling unfortunately such a pmpc brush grafted membrane is conventionally fabricated by surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization si atrp method which requires a specific surface to immobilize the initiator as well as complicated oxygen removing process and high content of environmentally unfriendly heavy metal as catalyst he et al 2015 li et al 2020 recently we developed a universal strategy for efficient fabrication of zwitterionic brushes via polydopamine assisted surface initiated activators regenerated by electron transfer atrp pda si arget atrp li et al 2020 the mussel adhesive protein inspired polydopamine pda strategy enables the atrp initiator immobilization on substrate independent surface moreover the arget atrp technique not only reduces the hazardous catalyst cubr concentration low to 3 6 ppm but also get rid of the repeated freeze thaw oxygen removing process in conventional atrp while such an environmentally friendly mussel adhesion mimicking strategy has drawn much attention for fabricating zwitterionic membranes meng et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 kirschner et al 2017 the possible instability of the pda intermediate layer must be improved before practical applications the small structure of pda oligomers and their noncovalent interaction with the substrate are attributed to the instability of pda coating hong et al 2012 belanger et al 2019 although some degree of chemical crosslinking was employed to stabilize zwitterionic polymers on membrane surfaces but the oil fouling was not completely removed and the flux decline 36 90 was still severe for successive oil water filtration separations li et al 2021b zhu et al 2017 in this report the pda assisted substrate independent atrp initiator coating was crosslinked by different crosslinkers to fabricate more stable pmpc brush coatings for enhanced antifouling and long term completely self cleaning performance as mussel inspired pda universal adhesion and cell membrane mimetic antifouling strategies were integrated in the fabrication of the crosslinked pmpc brush coatings the created membrane surface was termed as crosslinked biomimetic coating stainless steel meshes ssms with 6 13 μm apertures were selected as the original membranes to ensure high flux and separation efficiency the fabrication process and application of the pmpc brush grafted ssm membrane are schematically shown in fig 1 the antifouling performance and durability of the prepared ssm membranes were evaluated by more challenging filtration of adhesive crude oil water mixtures in an easily fouled dead end filtration model 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents dopamine da tris hydroxymethyl aminoethane tris triallylamine taa 3 methacryloxypropyltr imethoxysilane mpts 3 trimethoxysilyl propyl 2 bromo 2 methylpropionate sibr ethanol hydrochloric acid cubr2 bipyridyl bpy ascorbic acid and petroleum ether were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd 2 methacryloyloxylethyl phosphorylcholine mpc was supplied by nanjing joy nature science technology development institute china all the reagents were of analytical

1 mpa s at 20 c was industrially supplied by the petrochina changqing oilfield company 2 2 fabrication of zwitterionic brushes on ssms by pda si arget atrp pmpc brushes were grafted on stainless steel meshes ssms according to a previous procedure li et al 2020 but the atrp initiator coating fabrication is modified by introducing crosslinkers briefly the cleaned ssms were immersed in three kinds of solutions respectively to prepare differently crosslinked atrp initiator coatings marked as csibr 0 csibr 1 csibr 2 as shown in table 1 the reagents were dissolved in pbs ph 8 5 containing 50 v v ethanol to form the designed concentrations as listed in table 1 after shaking 90 rpm at 30 c for 22 h the atrp initiator coatings were rinsed thoroughly with pure water and then crosslinked at 100 c for 4 h the csibr coated ssms were finally immersed in aqueous solution of mpc monomer 20 mg ml 1 and catalyst to prepare the designed pmpc brushes shown in table 1 by arget atrp at 50 c the monomer and catalyst mixed solution contains 0 0036 mg ml 1 cubr2 0 0152 mg ml 1 bpy and 2 0 mg ml 1 ascorbic acid the si arget atrp was performed in a sealed glass vial without any oxygen removing process to prepare a thick brush the ssms were reacted for 12 h at 50 c pmpc brush grafted ssm ssm pmpc was immersed overnight in pbs solution to remove unbound components and then applied in characterization 2 3 instrumentation and characterization morphologies of the bare and coated ssms were observed by a field emission scanning electron microscope su 8010 hitachi japan the elemental composition of the bare and modified ssms was measured by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps with a phi5000 versaprobe iii spectrometer ulvac phi inc japan all the spectra were collected at an electron take off angle of 45 from the surface under vacuum water contact angle wca and underwater oil contact angle oca were observed with a dsa25 drop shape analyzer kruss germany by attaching a 2 μl droplet the oil adhesive force underwater was measured by using a high sensitivity micro electromechanical balance data physics dcat21 germany sliding angle sa was measured by adding 10 μl oil droplets on the membranes and turning the angle slowly until the droplet slid oil content in the separated filtrate was measured with an infrared oil measurement instrument jy oil480 the possible small oil droplets in the filtrate were tested by microscopy ti u nikon and dynamic light scattering malvern zetasizer nanozs90 2 4 oil water separation experiment to evaluate the antifouling performance and durability of the ssms for oil water mixture separation a continuously recycling dead end filtration device was constructed as shown in fig 2 crude oil and water were pumped separately into the upper column from the entrances at oppose directions after mixed in the column and controlling the oil and water flow rates the crude oil water mixture with designed concentration v v was formed immediately the water was filtrated down to the lower column driven by the gravity of the liquid mixture while the oil moved upward and was collected both the separated water and oil were recycled by pumps to achieve a continuous filtration a mechanic stirring was fixed above the membrane to assist removing of the adhered oil by the cross flow force the possible small oil droplets in the filtrate were tested by microscopy and dynamic light scattering oil content in the filtrate was measured with an infrared oil measurement instrument filtration flux f l m 2 h 1 and the oil separation efficiency e of the membrane were calculated by eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 f v a t 2 e 1 c f c 0 100 where a m2 is the effective area of the membrane v l is the volume of filtrated water in the time t h c 0 and c f are the oil concentrations before and after filtration respectively 2 5 membrane stability and durability the stability and durability of the ssm pmpc membranes were tested in a shaking artificial seawater containing 30 v v crude oil at 70 c wca was measured every day after washed with petroleum ether ethanol and water respectively the durability was evaluated by crude oil water mixture separation in a continuously recycling dead end filtration device as shown in fig 2 the filtration flux change with separation time was recorded 3 results and discussion 3 1 crosslinking of the atrp initiator coating and grafting of pmpc brush two crosslinking agents mpts and taa were added in the atrp initiator sibr and da mixed solution to fabricate self adhesive and differently crosslinked atrp initiator coatings csibr 0 csibr 1 and csibr 2 on the immersed ssm surfaces since the da molecules can be oxidized in aqueous solution at ph 8 8 5 by the dissolved o2 and form a mussel mimetic adhesive pda to attach on the immersed materials lee et al 2007 saiz poseu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the atrp initiator molecule sibr was immobilized to form the pda and sibr codeposited atrp initiator coating csibr 0 without additional crosslinker by condensation reactions between trimethoxysilyl groups of sibr and the pda hydroxyl and amino groups li et al 2020 knorr et al 2016 tran et al 2018 the addition of the bifunctional crosslinker mpts in the initiator coating fabrication solution formed a crosslinkable initiator coating csibr 1 since mpts can not only crosslink the sibr initiator by condensation between their trimethoxysilyl groups its methacryl group can also react with amine group of the pda unit by michael addition feng et al 2020 and or polymerize with other olefinic groups furthermore the addition of the other crosslinker taa into the csibr 1 fabrication solution further enhanced the crosslinking degree of the prepared sibr initiator coating csibr 2 by the three functional triallylamine via the possible michael addition with amine group of the pda and polymerization with all other neighboring vinyl groups from mpts and taa the csibr 2 coated ssm can be heated further at 100 120 c for several hours to achieve completely crosslinked structure the chemistry of the atrp initiator coating formation and possible crosslinking mechanisms were illustrated schematically in fig 3 pmpc brush grafting from the csibr coated ssm membranes was carried out conveniently by arget atrp li et al 2020 the arget atrp strategy enables the pmpc brush coating formation in a much low cubr2 catalyst concentration as well as without a complicated oxygen removing process the combination of the simplified fabrication of the pmpc brushes with the crosslinked atrp initiator coatings is advantageous for developing a more stable and highly effective membrane in low cost with less consumption according to the number of crosslinker kinds added in the solutions of the atrp initiator coating fabrication table 1 the grafted pmpc brushes were marked as pmpc0 pmpc1 and pmpc2 respectively 3 2 surface morphology composition and superhydrophilicity the csibr and pmpc coating formation and hydrophilicity improvement were characterized systemically as the color morphology and contact angle of the samples in the same csibr group csibr 0 csibr 1 and csibr 2 or pmpc brush group pmpc0 pmpc1 and pmpc2 had no much difference the following discussion use csibr and pmpc to represent all the two group samples firstly the color change of the ssm membranes after coating fabrication is an obvious evidence of the successful modification as shown in fig 4 a the silver gray color of the bare ssm changed to brown after the csibr and pmpc coating modification the formation and attachment of adhesive pda oligmers during the atrp coating fabrication resulted in the color change since pda is a melanin like material zhu and edmondson 2011 liu et al 2021 compared with the bare ssm and ssm csibr the ssm pmpc membrane showed improved water wetting ability as indicated by the enlarged appearance of the water droplet more significantly the ssm pmpc membrane became superhydrophilic as demonstrated by the extremely large weted area fig 4a secondly the improved wetting ability of ssm csibr and superhydrophilicity of ssm pmpc were quantitatively evaluated by their surface wcas as shown in fig 4b wca of ssm pmpc decreased to 0 from 110 2 and 93 1 of the bare ssm and ssm csibr respectively all the ssm pmpc membranes exhibit excellent super hydrophilicity by their 0 wcas compared to previously reported wcas 1 4 of similar pmpc brush grafted surfaces he et al 2015 kobayashi et al 2013 the superhydrophilicity of ssm pmpc membrane is superior since the 0 wca is reached in 80 ms as shown in fig 4c video s1 to the best of our knowledge such an extremely hydrophilic membrane has not been reported before thirdly and most importantly the csibr and pmpc coating formation on the ssm membrane was strongly supported by the changes of their surface morphologies and elemental compositions as shown in fig 4d the csibr and pmpc coating surfaces exhibit sub micrometer structured domains on the sem images meanwhile the xps analysis results shown in fig 4e and table 2 reveal that the of fe signal on the ssm csibr 2 and ssm pmpc2 membranes is completely screened due to the csibr 2 and pmpc coatings which are thicker than the xps detection limit of 10 nm for polymer coatings the xps surface element analysis indicates 3 78 of p on the ssm pmpc membrane surface table 2 suggesting a densely packed cell membrane mimetic pc zwitterion coating on the ssm membrane since the closely packed phosphatidylcholine c42h80no8p in the cell outer membrane contains only 1 9 of p element gong et al 2013 the densely packed pc zwitterions at the membrane interface can strongly attract more water molecules to form a immobilized hydration layer he et al 2015 leng et al 2015 resulting in the superiorhydrophilicity in addition to the surface chemical composition of densely packed pc zwitterion groups the rough surface morphology of the membrane also contributes to enhanced hydrophilicity feng et al 2002 su et al 2016 3 3 coating stability the stability of a coating modified filtration membrane is fundamental for durable applications a similarly prepared pmpc brush coating pmpc0 has been demonstrated stable in shaking acidic and alkaline ph 1 11 aqueous solutions li et al 2020 since the crosslinking modification dose not decrease the stability of ssm pmpcs in acid and alkaline environments the ssm pmpc membranes was tested differently by immersing in shaking artificial seawater containing 30 v v crude oil at 70 c which corresponds to the environment of oilfield produced fluids after washed with petroleum ether ethanol and water respectively the ssm pmpc membranes exhibited much different wcas as shown in fig 5 a as a low wca value can be attributed to its surface attached more hydrophilic groups molecules the increased wca suggests the detachment or dissolution of the pmpc brush molecules or the pc zwitterionic groups in the test solution the loss of the pc zwitterions on both of the pmpc0 and pmpc1 coating surfaces were strongly supported by the almost disappearance of the p element signals shown in fig 5 b and table 3 while the pmpc2 coating surface showed obvious p signals similar to that of untreated pmpc2 coating surface suggested in fig 4 e moreover the instability of pmpc1 and pmpc0 coatings are revealed more clearly from the sem images as shown in fig 5 c demonstrating the peeling of pmpc1 brush layer and the detachment of pmpc0 together with its adhered atrp initiator layer furthermore the disappearance mechanisms of the pc zwitterions are proposed by considering the results of fig 5 c and table 3 first the pc zwitterionic group could be removed slowly from the pmpc brush since the p element content reduced by 24 and without any detectable loss of the polymer chains on pmpc2 surface second the detachment of pmpc chains on the pmpc0 and pmpc1 surfaces aggravated the loss of pc zwitterions third the uncrosslinked pmpc0 coating was peeled off together with its adhered atrp initiator layer therefore three amazing results can be derived from fig 5 and table 3 i the unstable structure of the pmpc0 brush coating was disclosed unexpectedly since we previously demonstrated that a similarly prepared pmpc brush coating pmpc0 could withstand shaking in ph 1 11 aqueous solutions as well as organic solvents such as ethanol dmso hexane and toluene li et al 2020 ii extremely stable pmpc2 brush was fabricated by the crosslinking reactions of both the mpts and taa crosslinkers if compared to the slightly improved stability of mpts crosslinked coating pmpc1 iii the crude oil was a much stronger destroyer to the prepared pmpc brush coatings since the other media without the crude oil did not increase wca of pmpc0 grafted surface li et al 2020 for understanding the mechanism of the much different stability the fabrication and possible crosslinked structures of the atrp initiator coatings were shown in fig 3 the instability of pmpc0 brush can be ascribed to the instability of the csibr 0 initiator coating since the mussel inspired adhesive pda primer is mainly oligomers and adheres on a surface with noncovalent interactions hong et al 2012 belanger et al 2019 although the initiator sibr showed some weak crosslinking effect in the codeposited csibr 0 coating and enabled the prepared pmpc0 brush could withstand shaking in ph 1 11 aqueous solutions and organic solvents such as ethanol dmso hexane and toluene li et al 2020 the dissolving or removing force of crude oil water mixture to the pmpc0 brush in the heated and shaking crude oil seawater mixture seems stronger than the adhesion force of the brush linked pda oligomer the significant loss of the pda bonded atrp initiator coating csibr 0 was supported by the appearance of the ssm substrate fe and cr element signals shown in fig 5 b since the pristine atrp initiator coating was thick and screened off the substrate signals shown in fig 4 e and table 3 when the crosslinker mpts was added to fabricate the crosslinked initiator coating csibr 1 the individually linked sibr in csibr 0 could be crosslinked by the additional trimethoxysilane groups resulting in an enhanced stability shown by the smaller wca increase in the case of csibr 2 both the mpts and taa could crosslink the initiator coating by different chemistries including condensation michael addition and polymerization forming a doubly and fully crosslinked coating this highly crosslinked atrp initiator coating could envelope the metal filament of ssm and resulted in the most stable pmpc2 brushes regardless the stability of the pristine pda adhesive primer it should be noticed that the crosslinked structures illustrated in fig 3 are only the possible explanations the exact mechanisms of the crosslinked structures are still need more systematic and deep investigations 3 4 underwater superoleophobicity and self cleaning property it is well known that the superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity of filtration membranes are crucially important for resisting oil fouling in practical applications gao et al 2016 xue et al 2011 shi et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 the excellent superhydrophilicity of the ssm pmpc2 membrane is strongly supported by the wca change to 0 in 80 ms which is much better than most reported superhydrophilic membranes with a wca of 2 8 or change to 0 in more than 10 s cheng et al 2018 liu et al 2014 the much better superhydrophilicity of ssm pmpc membrane is attributed to the surface chemical composition of densely packed pc zwitterion groups as well as the rough surface morphology of the zwitterionic polymer coating the strongly associated hydration layer on the ssm pmpc membrane may repel oil droplet approach and thus results in underwater superoleophobicity oca 150 as demonstrated in fig 6 all the tested oil droplets exhibited underwater ocas of 156 170 indicating that the ssm pmpc membrane can efficiently repel oil and show excellent antifouling property huang et al 2018 the excellent superhydrophilicity and stability of ssm pmpc2 endow the membrane strong underwater superoleophobicity at elevated temperature and salt concentration fig s1 which is extremely important for a practical self cleaning membrane separation in most oil water filtrations the antifouling and self cleaning nature of ssm pmpc2 membrane was firstly demonstrated by dropping crude oil on both the bare and pmpc brush grafted ssm membrane surfaces when they were immersed simultaneously into water the adhered crude oil on ssm pmpc2 aggregated to a drop and left the surface in 1 s fig 7 a video s2 while that on the bare ssm remained moveless such a rapid crude oil cleaning removing performance of ssm pmpc2 membrane has not been report before and can be attributed to the strong hygroscopic property of the pc zwitterions lewis et al 2008 choi et al 2017 which makes the surface wetted slightly in the air underwater crude oil cleaning removing ability of different ssm membranes was further evaluated by measuring the oil adhesion forces as shown in fig 7b the adhesion force on the bare and csrbr coated ssm membranes are 30 and 13 μn respectively while that on the ssm pmpc2 membrane is only about 1 μn such a small oil adhesion force on the pmpc2 surface makes the adhered oil can easily be removed by a small disturbing force exerted by simple mechanic stirring or tilting the contact surface as demonstrated in fig 7c using crude oil droplet as an example the underwater sliding angle sa on ssm pmpc membrane is low to 1 2 much smaller than that of 2 5 6 2 for most reported superhydrophilic membranes liu et al 2021 qing et al 2020 the sa indicates that the adhered oil droplet can be removed easily by tilting the membrane surface or by other minor disturbing forces in the view of this point the excellent self cleaning membrane may enable a zero flux decline filtration for oil water separation if assisted by a simple mechanic stirring therefore the ssm pmpc2 membrane can be employed to develop a completely self cleaning oil water filtration device 3 5 self cleaning filtration in order to demonstrate the self cleaning and durable performances of ssm pmpc membranes for oil water separation we designed a continuously recycling dead end filtration device fig 2 and 30 v v crude oil water mixture was chosen for separation as shown in fig 8 a the significant flux decline in the dead end filtration device could be reduced and even inhibited by increasing the stirring rate a super high filtration flux 60 000 l m 2 h 1 video s3 with high separation efficiency 99 98 was recorded continuously in 300 min without detectable flux decline suggesting that the membrane fouling by the 30 v v crude oil water mixture was removed completely by increasing the stirring rate to 120 rpm such a completely self cleaning separation of high content crude oil water mixture with super high filtration flux has not been reported the filtrated water was so clear that no oil droplets 0 2 μm was detected by microscopy and dynamic light scattering as demonstrated in fig s2 the oil content of the filtrated water was as low as 10 ppm which meets the required standards of most countries it should be noted that this encouraging results were measured with super high flux in a dead end filtration model which generally resulting in more severe fouling and rapid flux decline for examples similar crude oil water mixture filtration fluxes decreased by 40 in 60 min with pc polymer anchored superhydrophilic pvdf membrane meng et al 2018 and more than 90 with poly sulfobetaine methacrylate psbma grafted copper mesh flux decline from 80 000 l m 2 h 1 for kerosene water mixture to 2300 l m 2 h 1 for crude oil water mixture he et al 2019 the super high filtration flux and zero flux decline shown in fig 8a are impressive and seems impossible for the adhesive crude oil water mixture separation in the dead end filtration device the separated water volume of this completely self cleaning high flux oil water filtration in 300 min equals to 1350 times of separation by a 200 ml cup type filter to the best of our knowledge these attractive results have not been reported before therefore the result of zero flux decline during 5 hours membrane filtration separation for the sticky crude oil water mixture has great practical significance in developing a continuous and completely self cleaning filtration device system to verify the potential application performance of the pmpc brush coated membranes the above filtration process was extended successively with a small aperture 6 μm ssm pmpc membranes at relatively small water flux 31 500 l m 2 h 1 since the oil repulsive force is increased with the decreased pore diameter while the penetrating force of the dynamic filtration is reduced with decreased flux the small aperture and reduced flux make the crude oil water filtration operated under a safer driving force much smaller than the theoretical intrusion pressure of the membrane calculated by the young laplace equation xue et al 2011 to maintain an excellent separation efficiency 99 98 as shown in fig 8b the roughly zero flux decline filtration separation of 30 v v crude oil water mixture was achieved with all the three ssm pmpc membranes but only the ssm pmpc2 was operated cumulatively for more than 190 h in 30 days without detectable oil fouling more importantly all the successive 6 h per day separations of ssm pmpc2 performed smoothly by optimizing the self cleaning system including antifouling membrane antifouling device and operation condition the excellent antifouling and self cleaning property as well as durability of ssm pmpc2 membrane were strongly supported by the high and roughly constant flux during such a long period 190 h of successive filtration separations and continuously contacting of the 30 v v crude oil water mixture for more than 30 days it is important to emphasize that these excellent results were obtained with high content of adhesive crude oil which is a much stronger contaminant than light and pure hydrocarbon oils zhang et al 2018 furthermore the completely self cleaning separation was performed in the dead end filtration device which generally resulting in more severe fouling and rapid flux decline meng et al 2018 li et al 2021b he et al 2019 the mechanism of this long term completely self cleaning filtration could be explained as follows first the excellent antifouling nature of the ssm pmpc2 membrane provides the basis of complete removal of the oil droplets by enhanced capillary repulsion second the mechanic agitation assists the membrane to remove the settled particles by the strong cross flow force as shown in fig 9 a i e converting the dead end filtration into cross flow filtration mode third the doubly crosslinked superhydrophilic coating endows the membrane durable antifouling property for sustainable separation force analysis of oil droplet on the membrane during the crude oil water filtration was shown in fig 9b the buoyancy of the oil droplet and the capillary repulsive force of the superhydrophilic underwater superoleophobic membrane mainly contribute to the oil removing force since the underwater crude oil adhesion force on ssm pmpc2 membrane 1 μn fig 7b and the filtration pressure at controlled flux 60 000 l m 2 h 1 are small the capillary repulsive force and the oil buoyancy are large the resultant force is usually repelling the oil adhesion moreover the additional mechanic stirring acts as impulsive force to assist the removal of the possibly adhered oil droplets therefore the combination strategy of an excellent antifouling membrane with the assistance of mechanic stirring can overcome the membrane fouling challenge in the oil water filtration separation applications even for high content and adhesive crude oil water mixture can perform completely self cleaning separation in the dead end filtration device compared to the low flux and or severe flux decline of reported superhydrophilic self cleaning membranes and their oil water separation efficiencies listed in table 4 the results of 31 500 60 000 l m 2 h 1 super high flux roughly zero flux decline for 190 h and over 99 98 oil water separation efficiency in this work are the most significant advances to approach practical applications thus the potential applications of the as prepared excellent antifouling ssm pmpc2 membrane and the developed completely self cleaning oil water filtration separation technique are promising in various oil contaminated water treatments on the other hand membrane fouling is a nature tendency in principle although the crude oil fouling demonstrated on the ssm pmpc2 membrane could be removed by the combination of the membrane excellent underwater superoleophobicity and the assistant force of cross flow stirring other contaminants such as various colloid particles and readily adsorbed organic molecules may also fouling the membrane and result in decreased filtration performance in long term application therefore the real application performance of the excellent antifouling ssm pmpc2 membrane needs further evaluation 4 conclusions durable zwitterionic polymer brush was grafted on stainless steel mesh ssm membranes by a two step biomimetic fabrication strategy the atrp initiator layer was firstly created on the ssm via mussel inspired adhesion and stabilized simultaneously by crosslinking chemistry cell outer membrane mimetic antifouling mpc polymer brushes were then grafted from the atrp initiator coatings via a surface initiated activators regenerated by electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization si arget atrp the well crosslinked ssm pmpc2 membrane was extremely stable superhydrophilic and strongly antifouling water filtration flux driven by gravity in a dead end filtration device reached as high as 60 000 l m 2 h 1 with a separation efficiency of over 99 98 for 30 v v crude oil water mixture importantly the excellent self cleaning nature of the membrane enabled a zero flux decline separation when assisted by simple mechanical stirring more significantly such a completely self cleaning dead end filtration under optimized conditions has been operated cumulatively for 190 h in 30 days without any additional cleaning these significant advances paved the way for practical application of membrane filtration in massive oil water mixture

15509,sulfidation of silver nanoparticles agnps to generate silver sulfide nanoparticles ag2s nps significantly influences their fate and toxicity in natural environments however the correlational research in this field was limited by the lack of methods for speciation analysis of ag2s nps to address this challenge a novel protocol for the selective ag2s np extraction from real waters was developed using protein corona induced extraction coupled to fenton oxidation of agnps with fe3 h2o2 reagents the ability of various concentrations of fe3 h2o2 to selectively dissociate agnps into ions was first evaluated then selective separation and preconcentration of the remaining ag2s nps was established by optimizing the parameters that may affect the protein corona induced extraction efficiency followed by quantification with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms enabling an ultrahigh enrichment factor of 10 000 and extremely low detection limit lod of 1 8 ng l the presence of humic acid ha inorganic salts and particles at the environmentally relevant levels had limited effects on ag2s np extraction as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy tem analysis and single particle icp ms spicp ms the sizes shapes and compositions of ag2s nps extracted with the proposed method remain in intact good recoveries of 83 7 105 were achieved for the ag2s nps spiked in four natural waters at the level of 97 8 ng l due to the high yields and applicability to ag2s nps at environmentally relevant concentrations this proposed method is particularly suitable to track the generation and transformation of ag2s nps in various scenarios graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords silver sulfide nanoparticles silver nanoparticles protein corona induced extraction fenton oxidation environmental waters data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as silver nanoparticles agnps have wide applications in personal care products and pharmaceutical industry for their high and broad spectrum antimicrobial activity the potential risks of agnps and their transformation products on environmental systems are currently being paid increasing attention by the government regulatory agencies and research scientists banu et al 2021 cervantes avilés et al 2019a hicks and temizel sekeryan 2021 in the process of environmental risk assessment analysis of nanoparticles nps is particularly challenging timerbaev et al 2021 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 which is due to their highly dynamic property in the environment for example chemical transformations including oxidative dissolution yu et al 2014 reductive generation hao et al 2021 sulfidation li et al 2016a cervantes avilés et al 2019b liu et al 2022 are inevitable resulting in the coexistence of silver based nps i e silver sulfide nanoparticles ag2s nps agnps and their corresponding ionic counterparts referred to as dissolved ag in the environment commonly agnps and dissolved ag are considered to be biologically active species while ag2s nps are less bioavailable and toxic to organisms ward et al 2019 gao et al 2021 wang et al 2022 however ag2s nps are the predominant species of ag based nps in the real environment for instance in the urban wastewater system such as sewers and wastewater treatment plants wwtps about 80 of ag was present as ag2s nps kaegi et al 2013 abdulsada et al 2021 this is due to the high concentration of biosulfide in real environment and the very low solubility of ag2s ksp 6 3 10 50 li et al 2017 it is believed that sulfidation was a natural detoxification process of silver because ag2s is stable enough against the release of ionic silver levard et al 2013 liu et al 2018 unfortunately many studies reported that the dissolution of ag2s nps in the natural environment may be overlooked indeed ag2s nps would undergo dissolution especially when they are present with strong oxidants including hypochlorite and ozone li et al 2017 a study performed by li et al 2016b found that both release of ag and generation of agnps would occur for ag2s nps in irradiated natural waters containing fe iii due to the formation of hydroxyl radicals thus accurate assessment of the latent biological toxicity of silver based nps are strongly dependent on their speciation though ag2s nps are the predominant transformation products of ag and agnps it is still a large obstacle for selective determination of ag2s nps in complex environmental matrices currently a variety of approaches including ultrafiltration cloud point extraction cpe chao et al 2011 liu et al 2009 wimmer et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 solid phase extraction spe zhao et al 2018 zhou et al 2017a and ion exchange resin method ier hadioui et al 2013 are available for the selective extraction of silver based nps from aqueous samples followed by quantification with mass spectrometry based techniques i e inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms furthermore to obtain size separation of nps size exclusion chromatography sec liu et al 2017 zhou et al 2017b 2014 flow field fraction fff mudalige et al 2015 tan et al 2017 capillary electrophoresis ce men et al 2021 and hydrodynamic chromatography hdc jimenez et al 2021 roman et al 2016 coupled with icp ms have been established additionally single particle icp ms spicp ms is also emerging as a prospective technique that is capable of both sizing and counting silver based nps in aquatic environment azimzada et al 2021 jimenez et al 2021 moreno martin et al 2022 rujido santos et al 2019 unfortunately all the above mentioned techniques are unable to distinguish silver based nps with different compositions such as ag2s nps coexisting with agnps although x ray adsorption near edge spectroscopy xanes is a well documented methodology for analysis of different silver based np species its application is highly hindered by the low sensitivity high expense and particularly the insufficient quantity of the instrument lombi et al 2014 wang et al 2015 using cpe off line hyphenated with liquid chromatography coupled with icp ms lc icp ms speciation of metal sulfide nps i e ag2s nps and zns nps was carried out successfully zhou et al 2020 it should be noted that however it is an indirect method for mass quantification of ag2s nps so direct determination of ag2s nps in environmental samples is still a big challenge protein corona induced extraction based on the formation of protein corona by adding protein i e bovine serum albumin bsa into np dispersion and the temperature induced phase separation of protein corona is an excellent alternative for the recovery of different nps from various environmental water gao et al 2022 zhou et al 2021 compared with traditional extraction techniques such as cpe this method exhibits higher selectivity enrichment factor and controllability and stronger anti disturbance capability shedding light on the speciation analysis of various silver based nps however its application in selective extraction of ag2s nps in aquatic environment has not been implanted as agnps could be coextracted with ag2s nps herein the aim of this study was to establish an efficient and robust method for the selective determination of ag2s nps from natural waters on the basis of protein corona induced extraction fe3 h2o2 degradation was used for the dissociation of agnps into ag first and then ag2s nps were selectively extracted with protein corona induced extraction with addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt edta followed by icp ms quantification thus parameters that influenced the selective dissolution of agnps including h2o2 concentration and dissolution time were first investigated then the protein corona induced extraction processes were optimized furthermore potential interferences from ionic silver humic acid ha and particles were valued extraction efficiencies of ag2s nps and recoveries in real natural waters were studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials in our study agno3 nano3 naoh h2o2 na2s2o3 and edta were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china sulfur polyvinylpyrrolidone k30 pvp k30 citrate coated agnp dispersion with nominal sizes of 60 nm and bsa were from sigma aldrich st louis mo ferric chloride fecl3 was from macklin shanghai china suwannee river ha was purchased from international humic substances society ihss st paul mn nitric acid hno3 65 was purchased from merck darmstadt germany the ag standard solution 1000 mg l in 5 hno3 was obtained from the national institute of metrology beijing china the glass microfibre filter membranes with pore size of 1 μm were obtained from whatman maidstone england ultrapure water produced by milli q millipore billerica ma with a resistivity of 18 2 mω cm was used in the whole experiments ag2s nps were synthesized following previous literature with minor modifications and the detailed information is provided in the supplementary materials 2 2 selective dissolution of agnps preliminary experiments were performed to establish a robust method for the selective dissolution of agnps specifically into a centrifuge tube containing agnps and or ag2s nps 10 μg l 40 ml 20 μl of fe3 2 mmol l and 2 ml of h2o2 30 m m were added then the solution was horizontally shaken 300 rpm 5 min to determine the dissolution of agnps a subsample 10 ml was taken out and the ag was separated from silver based nps with ultrafiltration tube amico ultra 15 30 kd millipore ma after centrifugation at 6000 rpm 2858 g for 10 min the filtrate was collected for icp ms quantification of the dissolved ag agilent 7900 icp ms palo alto ca the instrumental parameters of icp ms were shown in table s1 the dissolution efficiency dissolution of silver based nps was calculated by eq 1 1 d i s s o l u t i o n c i c n 100 where c i µg l is the ag content detected in the filtrate while c n µg l is the spiked content of silver based nps in the sample before ultrafiltration 2 3 protein corona induced extraction of ag2s nps as indicated in scheme 1 silver based np dispersion 40 ml was added into 20 μl of fecl3 2 mmol l and 2 ml of h2o2 and shaken at 300 rpm for 5 min to selectively dissociate agnps into ag at ambient temperature then the solution was adjusted to ph 9 2 with diluted naoh to facilitate the decomposition of the residual h2o2 after that 1 ml of 200 mmol l edta was added to complex with ag subsequently the mixture was adjusted to ph 4 0 with hno3 added with 0 2 ml of 20 g l bsa solution and shaken at 300 rpm for 5 min at room temperature afterward 1 2 g of nano3 was spiked into the system and incubated at 70 c for 5 min during which the solution changed murky finally the solution was centrifuged at 8000 rpm 4866 g for 10 min to completely separate the protein corona of ag2s nps the obtained protein with the concentrated ag2s nps was collected for following icp ms analysis each experiment was conducted in triplicate 2 4 determination of ag2s nps after extraction for quantification of ag2s nps after extraction the above obtained proteins were digested according to our previous literature with minor modification gao et al 2022 specifically into the proteins were added 1 ml of hno3 65 m m and heated at 100 c for 0 5 h then the samples were diluted with ultrapure water and filtered with 0 22 μm polyethersulfone pes filter followed by icp ms quantification the details of which were listed in table s1 during icp ms determination rhodium rh standard solution 200 μg l was selected as internal standards for each batch containing about 15 samples one blank sample and one mid point calibration solution were detected to ensure that there is no cross contamination and instrumental shift for ag2s nps spiked in the ultrapure water during method optimization the apparent extraction efficiency extraction was calculated by eq 2 2 e x t r a c t i o n c d c s 100 where c d µg l is the content of silver determined with icp ms and c s µg l is the spiked level of ag2s nps for silver based nps spiked in environmental water the recovery of ag2s nps was obtained with eq 3 3 r e c o v e r y c d c 0 c s 100 where c d µg l is the content of silver determined with icp ms in the spiked samples while c 0 µg l is the indigenous ag concentration detected in the samples and c s µg l is the spiked content of ag2s nps 2 5 sample collection four real water samples namely river lake and influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plant wwtp were manually collected the sampling information and their characterization were detailed in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of silver based nps since silver based nps with various sizes and shapes were expected in the environment two common nps were used as models transmission electron microscope tem images in fig 1 indicated that the prepared ag2s nps were elliptical with average diameters of 37 7 5 0 nm and lengths about 66 2 5 5 nm by counting over 200 particles energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx mapping showed that the ag and s elements were uniformly distributed in the nps and the integrated intensity was 2 03 agreeing well with 2 0 that is expected for ag2s the high resolution tem hrtem images indicated that the lattice fringes of the extracted nps were 2 6 å spacings corresponding to the 121 lattice planes of metallic ag2s xiong et al 2013 dynamic light scattering dls measurements indicated that the zeta potential of ag2s nps was 27 7 2 2 mv in ultrapure water when ph was 5 12 besides the hydrodynamic diameter was 71 7 7 5 nm with a polydispersivity index pdi of 0 252 showing the good monodispersity of ag2s nps meanwhile we characterized the particle size of ag2s nps by spicp ms and the instrumental parameters of spicp ms were shown in table s1 results showed the size distribution of ag2s nps was 47 3 4 9 nm which was somewhat different from that obtained with tem this is because the size distribution obtained by spicp ms were calculated on the basis of the assumption that the particles were spherical cai et al 2022 the commercially obtained citrate coated agnps were in spherical in ultrapure water and their primary diameters were 58 3 6 2 nm fig s1 well close to the value of 61 9 5 2 nm obtained with spicp ms also the agnps were negatively charged with their zeta potential of 44 7 0 8 mv and their hydrodynamic diameters were 63 3 5 9 nm with pdi of 0 185 in ultrapure water 3 2 optimization of parameters for agnp dissociation as reported previously nps with various compositions including zero valent metallic nps metallic sulfide nps and nanoplastics could be coextracted with protein corona induced extraction exhibiting no selectivity to specific nps gao et al 2022 similar conclusions were achieved in our study and the respective extraction efficiencies of agnps and ag2s nps were 93 3 2 7 and 96 5 0 8 thus we first focused on the selective dissolution of agnps into ag with subsequent extraction of ag2s nps to accomplish the discrimination of ag2s nps from agnps due to their medium oxidation reduction potential φθ ag ag0 0 80 v agnps can easily be oxidized in the presence of strong oxidant to promote the release of ag yu et al 2014 considering their strong oxidative capability fe3 induced fenton reaction was used for the dissociation of agnps which is cheaper easier to obtain and more stable than fe2 induced traditional fenton reaction zheng et al 2022 thus the h2o2 concentration and shaking time were investigated by determining ag content via ultrafiltration fig 2 showed that the dissolution of agnps increased first in the range of 0 6 1 5 m m h2o2 and then leveled off up to 3 m m with the dissolution rate of 95 4 with 1 5 h2o2 while no significant ag release from ag2s nps occurred with the dissolution rate below 4 8 meanwhile the dissolution rate of agnps reached maximum value within 5 min suggesting agnps can be rapidly oxidized to release ag besides results indicated that the dissolution of ag2s nps increased slightly with the increasing shaking time and the dissolution rate of 16 9 for ag2s nps after treatment with 1 5 m m h2o2 for 120 min was obtained thus to avoid the dissolution of ag2s nps 1 5 m m h2o2 with shaking for 5 min was adopted for the selective dissociation of agnps in the following experiments 3 3 preconcentration of ag2s nps with protein corona induced extraction according to our previous studies gao et al 2022 zhou et al 2021 extractant concentration ph inorganic salt content and incubation temperature are the critical parameters affecting protein corona induced extraction of nps to achieve the highest extraction of ag2s nps these parameters were investigated using 10 μg l ag2s np aqueous solution bsa was used as extractant in our study because of its low cost low biohazard and high affinity with nps the amount of bsa is critical for quantitative extraction of nps therefore the bsa concentration was studied ranging from 20 to 300 mg l results in fig s2a showed that the extraction efficiency of ag2s nps increased with bsa concentration up to 100 mg l and then kept constant up to 300 mg l it should be noted that though the bsa concentration is very low the extraction efficiency of ag2s nps can be high up to 95 5 since ph plays a great role in the formation of protein corona lee et al 2020 the effects of sample ph values in the range of 2 5 5 0 was studied with bsa concentration of 100 mg l it should be noted that there was no protein precipitation when ph was higher than 5 0 results in fig s2b showed that the extraction efficiency of ag2s nps increased obviously when the sample ph rose from 2 5 to 4 0 and then levelled off this is because the isoelectric point of bsa was 4 7 noskov et al 2010 facilitating the phase separation inorganic salts and incubation temperature have great influences on the structures and properties of protein corona which can promote protein denaturation lee et al 2020 therefore the concentration of nano3 and the temperature of the solution were adjusted to 1 6 m v and 40 90 c respectively as indicated in figs s2c and 2d the extraction efficiency of ag2s nps increased with the increasing nano3 concentration from 1 to 3 m v and solution temperature from 40 to 70 c and then levelled off taking all of these into consideration a bsa concentration of 100 mg l a sample ph of 4 0 a nano3 concentration of 3 and an extraction temperature of 70 c for 5 min were adopted in the subsequent experiments 3 4 potential interferences results shown in fig 3 indicated that agnps were selectively dissociated to release ag however according to our previous study the coexisting ag could be partially extracted together with nanoparticles resulting in a positive bias to the icp ms quantification of ag2s nps as the coexisting ag would be mistaken as ag2s nps gao et al 2022 to this end aqueous solutions of ag and agnps about 10 μg l were extracted with the above optimized conditions respectively as shown in fig 3a 10 6 of ag and 16 4 of agnps treated with fe3 h2o2 fenton degradation were transferred from the aqueous phase into the protein precipitates during extraction indicating the non negligible coextraction of ag and agnps to prohibit the coextraction of ag na2s2o3 has been used as masking agent during protein corona induced extraction due to the strong association of s2o3 2 with ag which could even prevent the coextraction of ag adsorbed on the natural particles gao et al 2022 it is noteworthy that however the extraction efficiencies of both ag and agnps treated with fe3 h2o2 fenton degradation increased with addition of na2s2o3 fig 3a this may be attributed to the generation of ag2so4 particles in the presence of residual h2o2 which facilitated the coextraction of ag thus edta another chelating reagent of ag was expected to complex with ag to inhibit its coextraction in our study the role of edta was investigated in the extraction of ag agnps and ag2s nps respectively results in fig 3b showed that the extraction efficiencies of ag and agnps decreased significantly with addition of edta and only very small amounts of ag and agnps less than 5 0 were extracted into the protein precipitates with edta concentrations from 2 to 20 mm however the presence of edta has limited effects on the extraction of ag2s nps extraction efficiencies higher than 93 2 were obtained in the range of 0 to 10 mm edta thus selective extraction of ag2s nps could be assured using edta as complexant inhibiting the coextraction of ag and 5 mm edta was adopted to eliminate the interference from ag and agnps in the following experiments in environmental samples the stability of ag2s nps would be changed by their interaction with natural matters including natural organic matter nom and other particles levard et al 2012 in this respect the presence of nom and particles i e sio2 nps might be important to the developed extraction of ag2s nps thus the potential effects of nom and other nps on the ag2s np extraction were investigated ha and sio2 nps were exemplarily selected as indicated in fig s3 with the presence of ha 0 30 mg l doc or sio2 nps 0 50 mg l extraction efficiencies of ag2s nps were all higher than 88 6 indicating the limited interference of nom and other particles on the selective extraction of ag2s nps 3 5 size shape and composition preservation of ag2s nps besides selective and effective preconcentration of ag2s nps the issue of the greatest importance for the extraction is their size shape and composition preservation thus extractions were conducted with the solutions of the individual ag2s nps or the mixture of ag2s nps and agnps followed by analysis with tem as shown in fig s4 there was no aggregation or shape changes after extraction moreover for the mixture of ag2s nps and agnps mainly elliptical particles the shape of ag2s nps but no spherical nps the shape of agnps were observed fig s4c meanwhile the extracted nps showed lattice fringes of 2 6 å consistent with that of ag2s nps fig 1d s4b and s4d this result excluded the interference of drying artifacts caused by the tem preparation process additionally spicp ms characterization in fig 4 showed that the signal intensities in the high frequency regions for both the individual ag2s nps and the mixture of ag2s nps and agnps after extraction fig 4b and 4e were similar to that obtained with ag2s np suspension without extraction fig 1j the size distributions were 47 4 5 0 nm and 46 0 4 8 nm for the individual ag2s nps and the mixture of ag2s nps and agnps after extraction respectively close to the value of 47 3 4 9 nm in fig 1k these results further demonstrated the selective extraction of the developed protocol and that no size shape composition changes of ag2s nps occurred during the extraction according to our previous study gao et al 2022 the developed protein corona induced extraction method was applicable to nps with different particle sizes and coatings therefore it was infered that the proposed method should be able to extract ag2s nps with various surface coatings and sizes 3 6 method performance and application the analytical performance including linearity detection limit lod quantification limit loq reproducibility and enrichment factor were studied systematically as detailed in table s3 determination coefficient r2 of 0 9999 was achieved in a wide range of 0 50 μg l suggesting the good linearity the relative standard deviations rsds of 3 repeated tests repeatability by extracting aqueous samples by spiking with 0 5 50 μg l ag2s nps were 0 9 7 2 the lod and loq defined as 3 and 10 times the baseline noise s n were 1 8 and 6 0 ng l respectively these values were much lower than the predicted concentrations of silver based nps in environmental samples ranging from hundreds of pg l to tens of μg l gottschalk et al 2013 compared with xanes which was used for semiquantitative speciation analysis of silver based nanoparticles our method has higher sensitivity lower cost and wider application meanwhile with comparison to the coupling of cpe with lc icp ms for ag2s np quantification an ultrahigh theoretical enrichment factor calculated by the ratio of sample mass 40 g to eluent mass 4 mg was 10 000 in table s3 which is far higher than that obtained by the coupling of cpe with lc icp ms moreover the developed method directly detected ag2s nps exhibiting a more superior performance than cpe coupled with lc icp ms in which the content of ag2s nps was indirectly calculated by subtracting the agnp concentration from the total nanoscale silver zhou et al 2020 the applicability of the developed protocol for ag2s np determination in natural waters was evaluated by spiking individual ag2s np or the mixture of ag2s np agnps and ag into four different water samples at levels of 97 8 114 ng l the four real waters were river water lake water and influent and effluent of a wwtp the primary characteristics of these samples were provided in table s3 which present weak alkalinity with ph in the range of 7 04 8 10 and contained considerable concentrations of common cations 2 3 58 7 mg l na mg2 k and ca2 and dom 2 67 10 9 mg l doc the results were presented in table 1 no ag2s nps were found in river water while the concentrations of ag2s nps in lake water influent and effluent of wwtp were determined to be 84 7 128 and 64 1 ng l the spiked recoveries ranged from 83 7 to 105 and their corresponding rsd values were in the range of 1 9 10 5 suggesting the good performance of the proposed protocol for the analysis of ag2s nps in natural waters 4 conclusions in summary a novel strategy was developed for the selective extraction of ag2s nps at trace concentrations in real environmental scenarios without changing their sizes shapes and compositions the agnps were first dissociated into ag with fe3 h2o2 fenton degradation then using edta as a chelating agent to avoid the coextraction of ag into the protein precipitates the ag2s nps were selectively enriched through protein corona induced extraction with an ultrahigh enrichment factor of 10 000 and could be quantified by icp ms with lod of 1 8 ng l the presence of nom and other particles namely ha and sio2 nps did not interfere with the selective extraction of ag2s nps successful application of the established protocol in four real environmental samples demonstrated its great potential for the analysis of ag2s nps in real scenario compared with cpe coupled with lc icp ms this method provided a direct way for ag2s np quantification which will improve understanding of the sulfidation of agnps and the behaviors of ag2s nps in the environment credit authorship contribution statement yingjie li methodology data curation writing original draft yan gao methodology data curation writing

15509,sulfidation of silver nanoparticles agnps to generate silver sulfide nanoparticles ag2s nps significantly influences their fate and toxicity in natural environments however the correlational research in this field was limited by the lack of methods for speciation analysis of ag2s nps to address this challenge a novel protocol for the selective ag2s np extraction from real waters was developed using protein corona induced extraction coupled to fenton oxidation of agnps with fe3 h2o2 reagents the ability of various concentrations of fe3 h2o2 to selectively dissociate agnps into ions was first evaluated then selective separation and preconcentration of the remaining ag2s nps was established by optimizing the parameters that may affect the protein corona induced extraction efficiency followed by quantification with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms enabling an ultrahigh enrichment factor of 10 000 and extremely low detection limit lod of 1 8 ng l the presence of humic acid ha inorganic salts and particles at the environmentally relevant levels had limited effects on ag2s np extraction as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy tem analysis and single particle icp ms spicp ms the sizes shapes and compositions of ag2s nps extracted with the proposed method remain in intact good recoveries of 83 7 105 were achieved for the ag2s nps spiked in four natural waters at the level of 97 8 ng l due to the high yields and applicability to ag2s nps at environmentally relevant concentrations this proposed method is particularly suitable to track the generation and transformation of ag2s nps in various scenarios graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords silver sulfide nanoparticles silver nanoparticles protein corona induced extraction fenton oxidation environmental waters data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as silver nanoparticles agnps have wide applications in personal care products and pharmaceutical industry for their high and broad spectrum antimicrobial activity the potential risks of agnps and their transformation products on environmental systems are currently being paid increasing attention by the government regulatory agencies and research scientists banu et al 2021 cervantes avilés et al 2019a hicks and temizel sekeryan 2021 in the process of environmental risk assessment analysis of nanoparticles nps is particularly challenging timerbaev et al 2021 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 which is due to their highly dynamic property in the environment for example chemical transformations including oxidative dissolution yu et al 2014 reductive generation hao et al 2021 sulfidation li et al 2016a cervantes avilés et al 2019b liu et al 2022 are inevitable resulting in the coexistence of silver based nps i e silver sulfide nanoparticles ag2s nps agnps and their corresponding ionic counterparts referred to as dissolved ag in the environment commonly agnps and dissolved ag are considered to be biologically active species while ag2s nps are less bioavailable and toxic to organisms ward et al 2019 gao et al 2021 wang et al 2022 however ag2s nps are the predominant species of ag based nps in the real environment for instance in the urban wastewater system such as sewers and wastewater treatment plants wwtps about 80 of ag was present as ag2s nps kaegi et al 2013 abdulsada et al 2021 this is due to the high concentration of biosulfide in real environment and the very low solubility of ag2s ksp 6 3 10 50 li et al 2017 it is believed that sulfidation was a natural detoxification process of silver because ag2s is stable enough against the release of ionic silver levard et al 2013 liu et al 2018 unfortunately many studies reported that the dissolution of ag2s nps in the natural environment may be overlooked indeed ag2s nps would undergo dissolution especially when they are present with strong oxidants including hypochlorite and ozone li et al 2017 a study performed by li et al 2016b found that both release of ag and generation of agnps would occur for ag2s nps in irradiated natural waters containing fe iii due to the formation of hydroxyl radicals thus accurate assessment of the latent biological toxicity of silver based nps are strongly dependent on their speciation though ag2s nps are the predominant transformation products of ag and agnps it is still a large obstacle for selective determination of ag2s nps in complex environmental matrices currently a variety of approaches including ultrafiltration cloud point extraction cpe chao et al 2011 liu et al 2009 wimmer et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 solid phase extraction spe zhao et al 2018 zhou et al 2017a and ion exchange resin method ier hadioui et al 2013 are available for the selective extraction of silver based nps from aqueous samples followed by quantification with mass spectrometry based techniques i e inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms furthermore to obtain size separation of nps size exclusion chromatography sec liu et al 2017 zhou et al 2017b 2014 flow field fraction fff mudalige et al 2015 tan et al 2017 capillary electrophoresis ce men et al 2021 and hydrodynamic chromatography hdc jimenez et al 2021 roman et al 2016 coupled with icp ms have been established additionally single particle icp ms spicp ms is also emerging as a prospective technique that is capable of both sizing and counting silver based nps in aquatic environment azimzada et al 2021 jimenez et al 2021 moreno martin et al 2022 rujido santos et al 2019 unfortunately all the above mentioned techniques are unable to distinguish silver based nps with different compositions such as ag2s nps coexisting with agnps although x ray adsorption near edge spectroscopy xanes is a well documented methodology for analysis of different silver based np species its application is highly hindered by the low sensitivity high expense and particularly the insufficient quantity of the instrument lombi et al 2014 wang et al 2015 using cpe off line hyphenated with liquid chromatography coupled with icp ms lc icp ms speciation of metal sulfide nps i e ag2s nps and zns nps was carried out successfully zhou et al 2020 it should be noted that however it is an indirect method for mass quantification of ag2s nps so direct determination of ag2s nps in environmental samples is still a big challenge protein corona induced extraction based on the formation of protein corona by adding protein i e bovine serum albumin bsa into np dispersion and the temperature induced phase separation of protein corona is an excellent alternative for the recovery of different nps from various environmental water gao et al 2022 zhou et al 2021 compared with traditional extraction techniques such as cpe this method exhibits higher selectivity enrichment factor and controllability and stronger anti disturbance capability shedding light on the speciation analysis of various silver based nps however its application in selective extraction of ag2s nps in aquatic environment has not been implanted as agnps could be coextracted with ag2s nps herein the aim of this study was to establish an efficient and robust method for the selective determination of ag2s nps from natural waters on the basis of protein corona induced extraction fe3 h2o2 degradation was used for the dissociation of agnps into ag first and then ag2s nps were selectively extracted with protein corona induced extraction with addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt edta followed by icp ms quantification thus parameters that influenced the selective dissolution of agnps including h2o2 concentration and dissolution time were first investigated then the protein corona induced extraction processes were optimized furthermore potential interferences from ionic silver humic acid ha and particles were valued extraction efficiencies of ag2s nps and recoveries in real natural waters were studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials in our study agno3 nano3 naoh h2o2 na2s2o3 and edta were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china sulfur polyvinylpyrrolidone k30 pvp k30 citrate coated agnp dispersion with nominal sizes of 60 nm and bsa were from sigma aldrich st louis mo ferric chloride fecl3 was from macklin shanghai china suwannee river ha was purchased from international humic substances society ihss st paul mn nitric acid hno3 65 was purchased from merck darmstadt germany the ag standard solution 1000 mg l in 5 hno3 was obtained from the national institute of metrology beijing china the glass microfibre filter membranes with pore size of 1 μm were obtained from whatman maidstone england ultrapure water produced by milli q millipore billerica ma with a resistivity of 18 2 mω cm was used in the whole experiments ag2s nps were synthesized following previous literature with minor modifications and the detailed information is provided in the supplementary materials 2 2 selective dissolution of agnps preliminary experiments were performed to establish a robust method for the selective dissolution of agnps specifically into a centrifuge tube containing agnps and or ag2s nps 10 μg l 40 ml 20 μl of fe3 2 mmol l and 2 ml of h2o2 30 m m were added then the solution was horizontally shaken 300 rpm 5 min to determine the dissolution of agnps a subsample 10 ml was taken out and the ag was separated from silver based nps with ultrafiltration tube amico ultra 15 30 kd millipore ma after centrifugation at 6000 rpm 2858 g for 10 min the filtrate was collected for icp ms quantification of the dissolved ag agilent 7900 icp ms palo alto ca the instrumental parameters of icp ms were shown in table s1 the dissolution efficiency dissolution of silver based nps was calculated by eq 1 1 d i s s o l u t i o n c i c n 100 where c i µg l is the ag content detected in the filtrate while c n µg l is the spiked content of silver based nps in the sample before ultrafiltration 2 3 protein corona induced extraction of ag2s nps as indicated in scheme 1 silver based np dispersion 40 ml was added into 20 μl of fecl3 2 mmol l and 2 ml of h2o2 and shaken at 300 rpm for 5 min to selectively dissociate agnps into ag at ambient temperature then the solution was adjusted to ph 9 2 with diluted naoh to facilitate the decomposition of the residual h2o2 after that 1 ml of 200 mmol l edta was added to complex with ag subsequently the mixture was adjusted to ph 4 0 with hno3 added with 0 2 ml of 20 g l bsa solution and shaken at 300 rpm for 5 min at room temperature afterward 1 2 g of nano3 was spiked into the system and incubated at 70 c for 5 min during which the solution changed murky finally the solution was centrifuged at 8000 rpm 4866 g for 10 min to completely separate the protein corona of ag2s nps the obtained protein with the concentrated ag2s nps was collected for following icp ms analysis each experiment was conducted in triplicate 2 4 determination of ag2s nps after extraction for quantification of ag2s nps after extraction the above obtained proteins were digested according to our previous literature with minor modification gao et al 2022 specifically into the proteins were added 1 ml of hno3 65 m m and heated at 100 c for 0 5 h then the samples were diluted with ultrapure water and filtered with 0 22 μm polyethersulfone pes filter followed by icp ms quantification the details of which were listed in table s1 during icp ms determination rhodium rh standard solution 200 μg l was selected as internal standards for each batch containing about 15 samples one blank sample and one mid point calibration solution were detected to ensure that there is no cross contamination and instrumental shift for ag2s nps spiked in the ultrapure water during method optimization the apparent extraction efficiency extraction was calculated by eq 2 2 e x t r a c t i o n c d c s 100 where c d µg l is the content of silver determined with icp ms and c s µg l is the spiked level of ag2s nps for silver based nps spiked in environmental water the recovery of ag2s nps was obtained with eq 3 3 r e c o v e r y c d c 0 c s 100 where c d µg l is the content of silver determined with icp ms in the spiked samples while c 0 µg l is the indigenous ag concentration detected in the samples and c s µg l is the spiked content of ag2s nps 2 5 sample collection four real water samples namely river lake and influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plant wwtp were manually collected the sampling information and their characterization were detailed in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of silver based nps since silver based nps with various sizes and shapes were expected in the environment two common nps were used as models transmission electron microscope tem images in fig 1 indicated that the prepared ag2s nps were elliptical with average diameters of 37 7 5 0 nm and lengths about 66 2 5 5 nm by counting over 200 particles energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx mapping showed that the ag and s elements were uniformly distributed in the nps and the integrated intensity was 2 03 agreeing well with 2 0 that is expected for ag2s the high resolution tem hrtem images indicated that the lattice fringes of the extracted nps were 2 6 å spacings corresponding to the 121 lattice planes of metallic ag2s xiong et al 2013 dynamic light scattering dls measurements indicated that the zeta potential of ag2s nps was 27 7 2 2 mv in ultrapure water when ph was 5 12 besides the hydrodynamic diameter was 71 7 7 5 nm with a polydispersivity index pdi of 0 252 showing the good monodispersity of ag2s nps meanwhile we characterized the particle size of ag2s nps by spicp ms and the instrumental parameters of spicp ms were shown in table s1 results showed the size distribution of ag2s nps was 47 3 4 9 nm which was somewhat different from that obtained with tem this is because the size distribution obtained by spicp ms were calculated on the basis of the assumption that the particles were spherical cai et al 2022 the commercially obtained citrate coated agnps were in spherical in ultrapure water and their primary diameters were 58 3 6 2 nm fig s1 well close to the value of 61 9 5 2 nm obtained with spicp ms also the agnps were negatively charged with their zeta potential of 44 7 0 8 mv and their hydrodynamic diameters were 63 3 5 9 nm with pdi of 0 185 in ultrapure water 3 2 optimization of parameters for agnp dissociation as reported previously nps with various compositions including zero valent metallic nps metallic sulfide nps and nanoplastics could be coextracted with protein corona induced extraction exhibiting no selectivity to specific nps gao et al 2022 similar conclusions were achieved in our study and the respective extraction efficiencies of agnps and ag2s nps were 93 3 2 7 and 96 5 0 8 thus we first focused on the selective dissolution of agnps into ag with subsequent extraction of ag2s nps to accomplish the discrimination of ag2s nps from agnps due to their medium oxidation reduction potential φθ ag ag0 0 80 v agnps can easily be oxidized in the presence of strong oxidant to promote the release of ag yu et al 2014 considering their strong oxidative capability fe3 induced fenton reaction was used for the dissociation of agnps which is cheaper easier to obtain and more stable than fe2 induced traditional fenton reaction zheng et al 2022 thus the h2o2 concentration and shaking time were investigated by determining ag content via ultrafiltration fig 2 showed that the dissolution of agnps increased first in the range of 0 6 1 5 m m h2o2 and then leveled off up to 3 m m with the dissolution rate of 95 4 with 1 5 h2o2 while no significant ag release from ag2s nps occurred with the dissolution rate below 4 8 meanwhile the dissolution rate of agnps reached maximum value within 5 min suggesting agnps can be rapidly oxidized to release ag besides results indicated that the dissolution of ag2s nps increased slightly with the increasing shaking time and the dissolution rate of 16 9 for ag2s nps after treatment with 1 5 m m h2o2 for 120 min was obtained thus to avoid the dissolution of ag2s nps 1 5 m m h2o2 with shaking for 5 min was adopted for the selective dissociation of agnps in the following experiments 3 3 preconcentration of ag2s nps with protein corona induced extraction according to our previous studies gao et al 2022 zhou et al 2021 extractant concentration ph inorganic salt content and incubation temperature are the critical parameters affecting protein corona induced extraction of nps to achieve the highest extraction of ag2s nps these parameters were investigated using 10 μg l ag2s np aqueous solution bsa was used as extractant in our study because of its low cost low biohazard and high affinity with nps the amount of bsa is critical for quantitative extraction of nps therefore the bsa concentration was studied ranging from 20 to 300 mg l results in fig s2a showed that the extraction efficiency of ag2s nps increased with bsa concentration up to 100 mg l and then kept constant up to 300 mg l it should be noted that though the bsa concentration is very low the extraction efficiency of ag2s nps can be high up to 95 5 since ph plays a great role in the formation of protein corona lee et al 2020 the effects of sample ph values in the range of 2 5 5 0 was studied with bsa concentration of 100 mg l it should be noted that there was no protein precipitation when ph was higher than 5 0 results in fig s2b showed that the extraction efficiency of ag2s nps increased obviously when the sample ph rose from 2 5 to 4 0 and then levelled off this is because the isoelectric point of bsa was 4 7 noskov et al 2010 facilitating the phase separation inorganic salts and incubation temperature have great influences on the structures and properties of protein corona which can promote protein denaturation lee et al 2020 therefore the concentration of nano3 and the temperature of the solution were adjusted to 1 6 m v and 40 90 c respectively as indicated in figs s2c and 2d the extraction efficiency of ag2s nps increased with the increasing nano3 concentration from 1 to 3 m v and solution temperature from 40 to 70 c and then levelled off taking all of these into consideration a bsa concentration of 100 mg l a sample ph of 4 0 a nano3 concentration of 3 and an extraction temperature of 70 c for 5 min were adopted in the subsequent experiments 3 4 potential interferences results shown in fig 3 indicated that agnps were selectively dissociated to release ag however according to our previous study the coexisting ag could be partially extracted together with nanoparticles resulting in a positive bias to the icp ms quantification of ag2s nps as the coexisting ag would be mistaken as ag2s nps gao et al 2022 to this end aqueous solutions of ag and agnps about 10 μg l were extracted with the above optimized conditions respectively as shown in fig 3a 10 6 of ag and 16 4 of agnps treated with fe3 h2o2 fenton degradation were transferred from the aqueous phase into the protein precipitates during extraction indicating the non negligible coextraction of ag and agnps to prohibit the coextraction of ag na2s2o3 has been used as masking agent during protein corona induced extraction due to the strong association of s2o3 2 with ag which could even prevent the coextraction of ag adsorbed on the natural particles gao et al 2022 it is noteworthy that however the extraction efficiencies of both ag and agnps treated with fe3 h2o2 fenton degradation increased with addition of na2s2o3 fig 3a this may be attributed to the generation of ag2so4 particles in the presence of residual h2o2 which facilitated the coextraction of ag thus edta another chelating reagent of ag was expected to complex with ag to inhibit its coextraction in our study the role of edta was investigated in the extraction of ag agnps and ag2s nps respectively results in fig 3b showed that the extraction efficiencies of ag and agnps decreased significantly with addition of edta and only very small amounts of ag and agnps less than 5 0 were extracted into the protein precipitates with edta concentrations from 2 to 20 mm however the presence of edta has limited effects on the extraction of ag2s nps extraction efficiencies higher than 93 2 were obtained in the range of 0 to 10 mm edta thus selective extraction of ag2s nps could be assured using edta as complexant inhibiting the coextraction of ag and 5 mm edta was adopted to eliminate the interference from ag and agnps in the following experiments in environmental samples the stability of ag2s nps would be changed by their interaction with natural matters including natural organic matter nom and other particles levard et al 2012 in this respect the presence of nom and particles i e sio2 nps might be important to the developed extraction of ag2s nps thus the potential effects of nom and other nps on the ag2s np extraction were investigated ha and sio2 nps were exemplarily selected as indicated in fig s3 with the presence of ha 0 30 mg l doc or sio2 nps 0 50 mg l extraction efficiencies of ag2s nps were all higher than 88 6 indicating the limited interference of nom and other particles on the selective extraction of ag2s nps 3 5 size shape and composition preservation of ag2s nps besides selective and effective preconcentration of ag2s nps the issue of the greatest importance for the extraction is their size shape and composition preservation thus extractions were conducted with the solutions of the individual ag2s nps or the mixture of ag2s nps and agnps followed by analysis with tem as shown in fig s4 there was no aggregation or shape changes after extraction moreover for the mixture of ag2s nps and agnps mainly elliptical particles the shape of ag2s nps but no spherical nps the shape of agnps were observed fig s4c meanwhile the extracted nps showed lattice fringes of 2 6 å consistent with that of ag2s nps fig 1d s4b and s4d this result excluded the interference of drying artifacts caused by the tem preparation process additionally spicp ms characterization in fig 4 showed that the signal intensities in the high frequency regions for both the individual ag2s nps and the mixture of ag2s nps and agnps after extraction fig 4b and 4e were similar to that obtained with ag2s np suspension without extraction fig 1j the size distributions were 47 4 5 0 nm and 46 0 4 8 nm for the individual ag2s nps and the mixture of ag2s nps and agnps after extraction respectively close to the value of 47 3 4 9 nm in fig 1k these results further demonstrated the selective extraction of the developed protocol and that no size shape composition changes of ag2s nps occurred during the extraction according to our previous study gao et al 2022 the developed protein corona induced extraction method was applicable to nps with different particle sizes and coatings therefore it was infered that the proposed method should be able to extract ag2s nps with various surface coatings and sizes 3 6 method performance and application the analytical performance including linearity detection limit lod quantification limit loq reproducibility and enrichment factor were studied systematically as detailed in table s3 determination coefficient r2 of 0 9999 was achieved in a wide range of 0 50 μg l suggesting the good linearity the relative standard deviations rsds of 3 repeated tests repeatability by extracting aqueous samples by spiking with 0 5 50 μg l ag2s nps were 0 9 7 2 the lod and loq defined as 3 and 10 times the baseline noise s n were 1 8 and 6 0 ng l respectively these values were much lower than the predicted concentrations of silver based nps in environmental samples ranging from hundreds of pg l to tens of μg l gottschalk et al 2013 compared with xanes which was used for semiquantitative speciation analysis of silver based nanoparticles our method has higher sensitivity lower cost and wider application meanwhile with comparison to the coupling of cpe with lc icp ms for ag2s np quantification an ultrahigh theoretical enrichment factor calculated by the ratio of sample mass 40 g to eluent mass 4 mg was 10 000 in table s3 which is far higher than that obtained by the coupling of cpe with lc icp ms moreover the developed method directly detected ag2s nps exhibiting a more superior performance than cpe coupled with lc icp ms in which the content of ag2s nps was indirectly calculated by subtracting the agnp concentration from the total nanoscale silver zhou et al 2020 the applicability of the developed protocol for ag2s np determination in natural waters was evaluated by spiking individual ag2s np or the mixture of ag2s np agnps and ag into four different water samples at levels of 97 8 114 ng l the four real waters were river water lake water and influent and effluent of a wwtp the primary characteristics of these samples were provided in table s3 which present weak alkalinity with ph in the range of 7 04 8 10 and contained considerable concentrations of common cations 2 3 58 7 mg l na mg2 k and ca2 and dom 2 67 10 9 mg l doc the results were presented in table 1 no ag2s nps were found in river water while the concentrations of ag2s nps in lake water influent and effluent of wwtp were determined to be 84 7 128 and 64 1 ng l the spiked recoveries ranged from 83 7 to 105 and their corresponding rsd values were in the range of 1 9 10 5 suggesting the good performance of the proposed protocol for the analysis of ag2s nps in natural waters 4 conclusions in summary a novel strategy was developed for the selective extraction of ag2s nps at trace concentrations in real environmental scenarios without changing their sizes shapes and compositions the agnps were first dissociated into ag with fe3 h2o2 fenton degradation then using edta as a chelating agent to avoid the coextraction of ag into the protein precipitates the ag2s nps were selectively enriched through protein corona induced extraction with an ultrahigh enrichment factor of 10 000 and could be quantified by icp ms with lod of 1 8 ng l the presence of nom and other particles namely ha and sio2 nps did not interfere with the selective extraction of ag2s nps successful application of the established protocol in four real environmental samples demonstrated its great potential for the analysis of ag2s nps in real scenario compared with cpe coupled with lc icp ms this method provided a direct way for ag2s np quantification which will improve understanding of the sulfidation of agnps and the behaviors of ag2s nps in the environment credit authorship contribution statement yingjie li methodology data curation writing original draft yan gao methodology data curation writing
