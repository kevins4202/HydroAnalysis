5435,wetlands are often acknowledged as a nature based solution for improving flood resilience in a large river basin however the effects of wetlands on floods have not been assessed as extensively within a large river basin as previous studies have mainly focused on assessing the effect on peak flows of a certain given return period in this study a distributed hydrological modeling platform was used to i quantify the effect of wetlands on floods with respect to event hydrographs and ii investigate how flood regulation services can occur on the rising and falling limbs of an event hydrograph further we hypothesized that flood resilience depends on the distribution and location of wetlands in the basin the hydrological modeling study was conducted on a 297 000 km2 large river basin in northeast china where wetlands are abundant covering approximately 12 of the basin area our modeling study show that wetlands can reduce peak and mean flows event duration and flow volume i e runoff volume by respectively 24 12 14 mm 12 4 37 mm 4 1 day and 17 18 108 m3 in this large river basin the attenuation efficiency of these wetlands varied with their location and size in the basin especially apparent on peak flow mean flow and flow volume on the rising limb of a flood event these findings highlight flood regulation services and attest that wetlands can exhibit different effects that sometimes they may amplify flood conditions thus wetlands are an important land cover for enhancing resilience to flood events within large river basins and wetland protection and restoration ought to be important conservation measures keywords flood mitigation flood risk wetland services wetland area wetland location nenjiang river basin 1 introduction floods are among the most common and costly types of natural disasters in the world severely impacting residential areas agricultural and industrial businesses infrastructures and tourism stine 1994 hallegatte et al 2013 globally floods affected 2 billion people during the period of 1998 2017 wallemarq et al 2018 and caused considerable economic losses accounting for the majority of natural disaster damages wmo 2013 over the last century flood frequencies have increased in many regions of the world and are projected to follow this trend due to climate and land use changes rind et al 1992 ipcc 2014 donat et al 2016 for given climate conditions basin characteristics such as topography soil infiltration land use and land cover lulc and internal storage capacity play important roles in flood generation frequency and duration among these characteristics the effect of lulc on flooding has been intensively investigated studies investigating the effects of basin characteristics on flooding were initiated over 100 years ago first in switzerland stähli et al 2011 two small watersheds and later in the united states see van haveren 1988 the wagon wheel gap watershed in colorado since then numerous studies have been conducted some of them looked into ways of mitigating floods including the development of nature based solutions which have gained increasing attention e g large scale restoration of wetlands zedler and kercher 2005 schanze 2017 thorslund et al 2017 and these mitigation measures are meant to improve flood resilience defined as the ability of a river basin to absorb change and maintain or rapidly return to its functionality see creed et al 2014 wetlands have great potential to be used as a nature based solution for improving the flood resilience of a river basin to flood risk e g albert et al 2017 ameli and creed 2019 chen et al 2019 the natural hydrological regulation services provided by wetlands can also support downstream runoff control structures mitsch et al 1977 thorslund et al 2017 in a changing climate wetland flood attenuation becomes more critical for flood control gulbin et al 2019 based on empirical and modeling studies recently reported in the literature it is generally accepted that wetlands mitigate floods i e provide flood regulation services by reducing peak and mean flows duration and flow volume bullock and acreman 2003 acreman and holden 2013 kadykalo and findlay 2016 for example ahmed 2014 estimated that the combined effect of all wetlands approximately 15 of the studied basin area could achieve a 10 reduction in flood peak in the rideau river watershed however despite the flood mitigation potential there has been a continued and rapid decline in wetland areas in asia europe and north america davidson 2014 hu et al 2017 mainly caused by agricultural extension urban sprawl and other human activities mitsch and gosselink 2007 for instance global inland and marine coastal wetlands both declined by approximately 35 from 1970 to 2015 ramsar convention on wetlands 2018 this decline undermined the hydrological regulation services provided by wetlands increasing flood risk ahmed 2014 evenson et al 2018 ameli and creed 2019 intensifying downstream flow variability lee et al 2018 and decreasing groundwater recharge and baseflow evenson et al 2015 yeo et al 2019 quantifying the hydrological services of wetlands especially those of flood mitigation services represents an essential step towards solidifying the importance of wetlands and restoring and conserving them in river basins although some studies have focused on flow regulation services provided by wetlands uncertainties still exist as to whether and or to what extent wetlands can mitigate floods some studies reported wetlands ability to reduce floods but others showed no significant impact bengtson and padmanabhan 1999a b ehsanzadeh et al 2012 a few studies even reported that wetlands could even increase floods bullock and acreman 2003 as well as increase flood peaks under certain conditions ogawa and male 1986 bullock and acreman 2003 acreman and holden 2013 kadykalo and findlay 2016 in general there exists a knowledge gap of how to quantify wetland regulation services on floods and addressing this question using a robust framework remains important for advancing our scientific understandings of the basin scale impacts of floods and their implications on human welfare and well being this lack of consensus hinders our ability to unilaterally restore and conserve wetlands to improve the flood resilience of river basin in a very recent study conducted in a medium size watershed in canada ameli and creed 2019 reported that wetland locations in a river basin could play a role in flood regulation services however they mainly focused on estimating flow regulation services of wetlands located at different distances from the mainstream network in the studied 8861 km2 and relatively homogeneous river basin e g low slope topography and mild hydrometeorological characteristics although their study provides insights into flood regulation services of wetlands more detail analyses of the effect of wetland distribution and location are needed to test whether their services are transferable to large river basins especially those with steep headwaters and widespread flat floodplains in this study we hypothesized that wetland distribution and location in a river basin affect flood resilience to test the hypothesis we carried out a hydrological modelling study on a large river basin the nenjiang river basin in northeast china specifically our objectives were to i determine the effects of wetlands on flood magnitude by highlighting changes in the rising and falling limbs of hydrographs ii quantify how these effects can further characterize the hydrological services provided by wetlands and iii highlight the role of wetland location in the study river basin and on how it can affect flood resilience the nejinang river basin was selected as a case study here because it has abundant wetlands diverse terrain features and has undergone intensive anthropogenic activities in the past half century particularly in the conversion of wetlands to agricultural and other land uses findings gained from this study could support the development of effective wetland management and restoration strategies for mitigating floods 2 methodology 2 1 study area the nenjiang river basin nrb is located in northeast china the river is the largest tributary of the songhua river fig 1 a the nenjiang river drains a total area of 297 100 km2 with an elevation ranging from 117 to 1 741 m above mean sea level feng et al 2011 li et al 2014a climate in the region can be characterized by strong seasonality feng et al 2011 li et al 2014b wu et al 2018 the monthly temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration varied from 19 5 to 19 9 from 6 to 113 mm and from 11 to 133 mm respectively fig 2 the mean annual total precipitation and mean temperature for the 1961 2016 period within the basin varied from 323 to 537 mm and from 4 6 to 6 4 c respectively whereas the mean annual flow was 589 m3 s at the basin outlet that the dalai hydrological station fig 1a the bulk of the annual precipitation mainly occurs during the months of june to september accounting for 82 of the annual total li et al 2019 over the last few decades the nenjiang river basin experienced severe flood events resulting in substantial damages and subsequent economic losses feng et al 2011 li et al 2012 understanding the flood mitigation services of wetlands in this river basin is not only important but also challenging because of the basin s large size and diverse terrain conditions based on climate elevation and topographical conditions the nrb can be divided into three distinct areas the upper shihuiyao drainage basin middle from shihuiyao to fulaerji and lower from fualerji to dalai sub basins fig 1a the areas of these sub basins are respectively 17 164 km2 107 343 km2 and 126 149 km2 the nrb lulc characteristics are in terms of percentage of the total basin area 27 6 agriculture 28 0 forest 12 1 grassland 1 5 developed urban land 13 6 bare land and 12 1 wetlands fig 1c li et al 2019 there were generally more agricultural lands in the lower nrb and more forested land and wetlands in the upstream including a ramsar site and a large nature reserve fig 1b in the lower nrb we have a large area of lakes and swamps distributed around the lower reaches of the uyu er tao er and huolin rivers which are considered as important regulators of natural water storage and regional water balance meng et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 several internationally and nationally important wetland nature reserves are located within the nrb including the zhalong xianghai and momoge wetlands which could be more vulnerable than other ecosystems to future climate change li et al 2019 however due to agricultural development and river regulation approximately 109 000 km2 of wetlands accounting for 23 7 of the wetlands area in 1978 were lost between 1978 and 2000 feng et al 2013 in particular in the downstream portion of the nrb 2 2 hydrological model 2 2 1 model description in this study the physitel hydrotel distributed hydrological modelling platform was used to simulate hydrological processes and to quantify hydrological services provided by wetlands in the nrb more specifically physitel is a specialized gis and hydrotel is a continuous semi distributed physically based hydrological model fortin et al 2001 turcotte et al 2003 2007 bouda et al 2012 bouda et al 2014 this platform has been used by fossey and rousseau 2016a b fossey and rousseau 2016a b blanchette et al 2019 and wu et al 2019 for quantifying the hydrological services provided by wetlands hydrotel is built around seven computational modules performing various tasks and calculations in successive steps i e i weather data interpolation ii accumulation and melt of snowpack iii potential evapotranspiration calculation iv vertical water budget determination v terrestrial flow generation vi river flow routing and vii wetlands water budget please refer to fortin et al 2001 and turcotte et al 2003 2007 for more details about hydrotel as mentioned before physitel is a specialized geographic information system gis interface that was developed to support the implementation of distributed hydrological models turcotte et al 2001 rousseau et al 2011 noël et al 2014 using gridded and vector based datasets digital elevation model dem a hydrographic network a soil type map and a land cover map physitel determines the slope and flow direction of each cell d8 ltd algorithm orlandini et al 2003 given the cells corresponding to the outlet of a watershed such a watershed can be then delineated into relatively homogeneous hydrological units rhhus namely hillslopes or elementary sub watersheds that are the computational spatial units of the vertical water budget using the algorithm developed by noel et al 2014 which performs the following steps i determination of headwater hillslope i e the area drained by the first pixel of the headwater river segment defining two lateral hillslopes two rhhus one on each side of the river segment ii scanning of the flow direction matrix and determination of two lateral rhhus all the cells draining the hillslopes into the left and right banks of the river segment for each headwater river segment iii building of the hillslope matrix and delineation of all lateral rhhus for all the other river segments all the way to the watershed outlet it is noteworthy the degree of details user s choice determined by the selected headwater drainage area threshold to initiate the river network governs the total number of rhhus the idea behind selecting a threshold for the headwater drainage area is to obtain a reasonable number of rhhus with respect to the anticipated computational time and to have a fairly detailed watershed discretization fossey et al 2015 for this study the basin was subdivided using physitel into 3 868 rhhus for an average area of 75 km2 and 1 551 river segments for a mean length of 9 627 m simultaneously the total area of wetlands obtained from physitel for the upper middle and lower sub basins of the nrb were 2 332 km2 12 164 km2 and 12 951 km2 respectively information on sub basin areas wetlands and their contributing areas is summarized in table 1 the contributing area of a wetland is processed using the flow accumulation matrix in physitel fossey et al 2015 and refers to the wetland drainage area the percentage refers to the ratio of wetland or contributing area to the size of a sub basin moreover physitel can explicitly account for isolated iws and riparian wetlands rws fossey et al 2015 using the hydrologically equivalent wetland hew concept liu et al 2008 wang et al 2008 fig 3 this concept postulates that characteristics e g contributing area and wetland surface area of one hew i e isolated wetland or riparian wetland represent those in each wetland type within a rhhu few conditions apply to this concept i only one isolated and or riparian hew per rhhu ii one hew must be fully integrated within an rhhu iii numerical integration of isolated hew parameters and iv numerical and spatial i e specific location on the river segment integration of riparian hew parameters considering these conditions two parameters i the maximum surface area of each wetland estimated from the wetland map and ii the area containing the wetland surface and the wetland drainage area liu et al 2008 are automatically determined by physitel after importing the physiographic database prepared by physitel hydrotel can integrate the isolated riparian wetland modules at the rhhu level the isolated wetland module is conceptualized as a control volume within the water balance of an rhhu vertical water budget a k a bv3c sub model of hydrotel fortin et al 2001 with a terrestrial flow connection while the riparian wetland module is partially integrated in the water balance with a direct connection to the river routing model kinematic wave equation inflows to isolated riparian wetlands are calculated by prorating the outputs of the rhhu s vertical water budget namely surface lateral and base flows with respect to the wetland parameters wetland outflows are determined from a secondary water balance calculation at the hew scale described subsequently and then routed to the river segment directly in the case of riparian wetland or through the terrestrial flow in the case of isolated wetland fossey et al 2015 2 2 2 datasets and model calibration hydrotel requires meteorological data daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures as inputs and observed hydrometric data daily flows for calibration purposes daily precipitation and temperatures spanning 1961 2016 were obtained from 39 weather stations operated by the china meteorological administration www cmads org including 19 stations within the basin and another 20 stations nearby the daily river flow data from 1961 to 2016 were collected for three gauges stations fig 1a located on the mainstream of the nenjiang river digital elevation model dem data the land cover map of 2000 including wetlands soil map and river network were obtained from the chinese resource and environment data cloud platform http www resdc cn hydrotel was calibrated with observed daily discharge at three gauge stations over the period from 1995 10 01 to 2016 09 30 the model was validated using discharge records collected from 1964 10 01 to 1995 09 30 after a 1 year warm up period 1994 10 01 1995 09 30 a global sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the model sensitivity to 18 key parameters as proposed by foulon and rousseau 2018 using the safe toolbox developed by pinaosi et al 2015 a total of 13 most sensitive parameters were chosen for calibration and validation of the model for the nrb the remaining parameters were determined following the guidelines provided by foulon and rousseau 2019 the dynamically dimensioned search algorithm dds tolson and shoemaker 2007 was used to calibrate the 13 most sensitive parameters of the model automatic calibration was performed based on the maximization of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse defined by nash and sutcliffe 1970 using 10 optimization trials 250 sets of parameters per trail then the best set of parameter values out of those of the 10 trials were selected for this study calibration performance was also evaluated using the root mean square error rmse and the percent bias pbias following recommendations of moriasi et al 2007 2015 to capture the best parameters of hydrotel for the nrb 2 3 wetland scenarios five wetland scenarios were prepared in light of their location upper middle and lower sub basin wetlands to examine the effect of wetlands on flood risks as compared with a baseline scenario wetlands from the 2000 lulc scenario 1 represented the effect of upstream wetlands on flood risks at the outlets of the upper middle and lower sub basins of the nrb scenario 2 represented the effect of midstream wetlands on flood risks at the outlets of the middle and lower portion of the nrb scenario 3 represented the combined effect of midstream and downstream wetlands on flood risks at the outlets of the middle and lower sub basins of the nrb scenario 4 was prepared to investigate wetland mitigation function on the outlets of the nrb finally scenario 5 represented an extreme wetland loss scenario i e removal of all wetlands from the nrb to discern potential extreme flood risk if all exiting wetlands in the basin were converted into agricultural land the outlets of the three sub basins are shihuiyao flaerji and dalai referred to as upper middle and lower sub basins respectively fig 1 the spatial distribution and detailed information of the baseline and wetland removal scenarios are presented in fig 4 and table 2 the wetland removal scenarios are defined as follows when the wetland modules are turned off wetland areas are not removed but they are treated as the land cover of saturated soils and thus their explicit storage properties and dynamics are not accounted for in the modeling wu et al 2020 this is a basic assumption and it has been used in several studies using models such as swat liu et al 2008 wang et al 2008 evenson et al 2015 mike 11 ahmed 2014 and hydrotel fossey et al 2016 fossey and rousseau 2016a b wu et al 2019 2020 to quantify the hydrological services streamflow regulation services provided by wetlands 2 4 assessment of flood regulation services of wetlands to quantify flood regulation services of wetlands we first analyzed how they can affect flood risks in terms of four indicators namely peak flow mean flow duration and flow volume of flood events then we quantitatively assessed the effects during the rising and falling limbs of the event hydrographs to identify whether or not the services were altered finally we determined the regulation efficiency to detect how much and to what extent wetlands could affect floods at different locations of the nrb the aforementioned indicators were determined using meteorological data of the 1964 2016 period in shihuiyao fualaerji and dalai simulated under the 2000 lulc a 2 year return flood threshold was used in all indices because it has been used as a proxy to bankfull discharge and threshold for flood events in past studies cheng et al 2013 xu et al 2017 hence a frequency analysis was used to determine the stream flow having a 2 year return period for each simulation year if the daily flow was higher than or equal to the 2 year return flow 1964 2016 it was considered as a flood event starting when flows exceeded the threshold ending when flows recessed below the threshold fig 5 a flood duration was defined as the number of consecutive days of flooding in an event peak flow was defined as the maximum flow during an event mean flow was defined as the average daily flow during an event rising limb and falling limbs referred to the increase and fall in flows during a flood event respectively wolff and burges 1994 to clarify the flood risks we extracted only one flood event each year according to i including annual maximum peak flow and ii a minimum of five day duration fig 5b simultaneously the mean flow duration and flow volume for the rising and falling limbs of the hydrographs were determined fig 5c finally the difference in an indicator value between baseline and wetland removal scenarios were calculated to quantify changes in flood risks caused by wetlands as well as their effects during the rising and falling limbs of the event hydrograph the analysis of variance anova was used with a significance level of 5 to determine whether there were significant differences in the indicators between baseline and wetland removal scenarios for each flood event we computed the wetland specific impact wsi adapted from fossey et al 2016 to determine the regulation efficiency of wetlands this index for wetland removal scenario i and flood indicator j can be expressed as follows 1 ws i ij i wj i re i j a w where iwj and ireij are flood indicators obtained from simulated daily flow series with wetlands and wetland removal scenarios respectively see 2 3 a is the considered wetland area km2 in this study we calculated the wsi value for peak flow wsipeak mm km2 flow volume wsivolume m3 km2 mean flow wsimean flow mm km2 and duration wsiduraion day km2 of each flood event for the upper middle upper middle lower sub basins and the whole study area to comparatively illustrate how flood regulation efficiency depends on their geographical location a negative value for wsi indicates wetlands provide positive flood mitigation services while conversely a positive value for wsi indicates flood mitigation disservices i e flood augmentation anova and fisher s least significant difference lsd tests were performed to determine whether there were significant differences in regulation efficiency among the five wetland removal scenarios 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation simulations replicated the flow patterns satisfactorily for both the calibration period and the validation period fig 6 nse values ranged from 0 60 to 0 74 for shihuiyao fulaerji and dalai gauge stations which is deemed a good match between observed and simulated high flows the rmse and pbias values varied from 7 6 to 13 6 m3 s and from 7 3 to 11 5 respectively both indicating a good representation of the flow processes moriasi et al 2007 2015 it should be noted that the simulation results were slightly inferior during the validation period than those of the calibration period for nse rmse and pbias nonetheless for both periods the simulated flow results exceeded the acceptable performance criteria nse 0 5 and pbias 15 suggested by moriasi et al 2007 2015 furthermore the lower rmse values indicated an overall good model fit moriasi et al 2007 2015 these results demonstrate that the calibrated model succeeded in depicting flow under the time invariant land cover of the 2001 2015 period under different climate conditions moriasi et al 2007 arnold et al 2012 3 2 overall wetland flood regulation services flow duration curves higher than or equal to the 2 year return flow for wetland removal scenarios and baselines are presented in fig 7 they clearly show that stream flows were sensitive to the removal of wetlands in the river basin generally removing wetlands led to higher flows at the three stations which was more apparent when the exceedance probability was 0 02 however the degree of divergence varied with different wetland removal scenarios in fulaerji fig 7b and dalai fig 7c specifically the increased mean flows following removal of wetlands were 1 7 mm shihuiyaous in shihuiyao 1 2 mm fulaerjius 4 8 mm fulaerjims and 4 4 mm fulaerjius ms in fulaerji and 0 5 mm dalaius 3 7 mm dalaums 1 6 mm dalaids and 4 9 mm dalaius ms ds in dalai therefore wetlands considerably reduced flows in the nrb however the mitigation capacity depended on their location and surface area in the river basin wetlands significantly p 0 05 reduced peak flow mean flow and flow volume by respectively 3 2 mm 1 4 mm and 1 6 108 m3 in the upstream fig 8 and table 3 4 generally upstream wetlands mitigated downstream i e fulaerji and dalai peak flow and mean flow while leading to a marginal flow volume increase in fulaerji 0 7 108 m3 for midstream and downstream wetlands mitigated flood by decreasing peak flow mean flow and flow volume in addition midstream and up midstream wetlands considerably attenuated floods by significantly reducing peak flow mean flow and flow volume however upstream and downstream wetlands considerably exacerbated flooding by increasing peak flow mean flow and flow volume under certain conditions as illustrated fig 4 and in table 4 the latter introducing the relative occurrence rate of increasing or decreasing the aforementioned hydrograph characteristics for the entire nrb i e dalaius ms ds as reported in table 3 wetlands significantly reduced peak flow mean flow flow volume and slightly extended duration by 12 1 mm 4 4 mm 18 4 108 m3 and 1 day respectively in terms of the data reported in table 4 for the entire nrb this means that 100 of the values were negative as wetlands induced an attenuation effect in the aforementioned hydrograph characteristics it can be observed that upstream and midstream wetlands extended the duration in shihuiyao 1 day and fulaerji 1 day while wetlands in the upper upper middle and lower sub basins showed little effect on the duration in dalai in addition wetlands generally induced an amplification effect positive values on duration except for the dalai station where the median duration was 1 day table 3 although 46 3 of the values indicated a longer duration as indicated in table 4 that being said overall wetlands significantly decreased peak flow mean flow and flow volume and slightly extended duration of the flood in the nrb furthermore these results also indicate that the hydrological effects of wetlands were associated with their geographical location 3 3 flow regulation services of wetlands on the rising and falling limbs effects of wetlands on duration mean flow and flow volume on the rising and falling limbs in the nrb are presented in fig 9 and tables 3 and 4 it can be observed that wetlands slightly reduced the duration of the rising limb and considerably extended the duration of the recession limb p 0 5 for midstream downstream and the entire nrb wetlands excluding a continuous reduction effect of up midstream wetlands wetlands consistently decreased mean flow of both the rising and falling limbs in the nrb with very high occurrence rate see table 4 for the percentage of negative values i e the second number in between parentheses however flow volume largely reduced initially on the rising limb while increasing to some extent on the falling limb specifically upstream wetlands increased the flow volume by 2 2 108 m3 and 1 6 108 m3 in the midstream and downstream on the falling limb respectively similarly midstream and downstream wetlands augmented the flow volume with values of 1 2 108 m3 and 0 7 108 m3 in the downstream respectively additionally wetlands tend to have greater mitigation effect on mean flow and flow volume on the rising limb than those of the falling limb however under certain conditions the relative occurrence rate of amplification effects on peak flow mean flow and flow volume illustrated that wetlands do exacerbate flood on the rising limb see table 4 for the percentage of positive values i e the first number in between parentheses the comparison of duration mean flow and flow volume between the rising and falling limbs suggests that wetlands exerted opposite effects attenuation or amplification and different mitigation capacity on the rising and falling limbs as described in the previous paragraph flood regulation services depend on geographical location variation of wetlands a difference is the converse effect on the falling limb between upstream wetlands and mid downstream wetlands fig 9 in addition the sub basins all have similar percentages of wetlands refer to table 1 however each one of them presented different effects fig 8 and table 3 for instance the percentages of wetlands were 11 33 and 11 88 in the midstream and downstream basins however wetlands had a larger reduction effect on peak flow mean flow and flow volume at the outlet of the middle sub basin than the outlet of the lower sub basin furthermore the flood regulation services amplified with an increase in wetlands area fig 8 and table 3 it can be observed that the whole basin wetlands showed the largest mitigation effects on peak flow mean flow and flow volume followed by up midstream wetlands while upstream wetlands had a minimum mitigation effect however for midstream and downstream wetlands following the increase in area no amplification effect on peak flow mean flow and flow volume was observed for dalai station see tables 3 and 4 to further investigate whether wetland location can alter their flood regulation services we calculated regulation efficiency with respect to peak flow duration flow volume and mean flow for per unit area of wetland i e wsi in upstream midstream and downstream portions of the nrb given the similar percentages of wetlands the regulation efficiency showed significant differences p 0 05 associated with location fig 9 upstream wetlands had the highest regulation efficiency on peak flow and mean flow with median values of 1 4 10 3 mm km2 and 0 6 10 3 mm km2 followed by the midstream wetlands with the median values of 0 9 10 3 mm km2 and 0 4 10 3mm km2 respectively fig 10 a and 10b however in terms of duration upstream and midstream wetlands had higher extension efficiency median value of wsiduration was 0 4 10 3 day km2 than downstream wetlands smaller than or equal to zero fig 10c additionally upstream wetlands showed a higher amplification effect on flow volume in fulaerji median value of wsivolume was 4 105 m3 km2 and an occasional amplification effect on flow volume in dalai wsivolume ranged from 2 1 105 to 1 3 105 m3 km2 however midstream and downstream wetlands overall displayed a reduced effect on flow volume among which midstream and up midstream wetlands presented a high reduction efficiency with the wsivolume values of 0 9 105 and 1 1 105 m3 km2 respectively fig 10d also it can be observed that regulation efficiency on peak flow mean flow and duration between upstream wetlands and the other four scenarios showed significant differences indicating that wetlands with different locations played unequal roles in attenuating flood risks in this large basin these results further suggest that the flow regulation efficiency of wetlands largely depended on their geographical location 4 discussion 4 1 flood attenuation services of wetlands previous research efforts have assessed and discussed the flow mitigation services provided by wetlands whether and to what extent wetlands can affect floods ogawa and male 1986 bengtson and padmanabhan 1999a bullock and acreman 2003 acreman and holden 2013 kadykalo and findlay 2016 in this study we quantitatively assessed the effects of wetlands on peak and mean flows duration and flow volume of flood events in terms of their geographical location overall we found that wetlands mitigated floods by reducing peak flow flow volume and mean flow and extended duration to some extent in the nrb the geographical location affected mitigation efficiency of wetlands namely the direction of change attenuation or amplification and regulation efficiency high or low varied with their geographical location and area these findings indicate that i wetlands can modify flood during both the rising limb and the falling limb fig 11 and ii wetlands located in different regions within a large basin can induce different effects i e attenuation or amplification significantly or not on flood events the main contribution of our results is to elucidate how and to what extent wetlands regulate flood in a large basin providing a general assessment framework to advance quantification of flood regulation services provided by wetlands basins with similar percentages of wetlands had different flood regulation services i e attenuation or amplification significant effects or not see figs 8 10 the differences can be attributed to wetland types and watershed landscape attributes since different wetlands such as riparian isolated wetlands or upland rain fed floodplain river fed wetlands have distinct water storage capacity and water transport processes their roles in controlling hydrological processes can have different or even opposite characteristics ogawa et al 1986 demissie and khan 1993 acreman and holden 2013 lee et al 2018 another important aspect of this distinction is wetland drainage area table 1 indeed the wetland drainage area can largely influence how much water wetlands can intercept in a region and local landscape conditions may promote or limit their regulation efficiency specifically their hydrological services depend on the inherent combined effect of wetland location and type as well as landscape attributes such as hydrological connectivity land use types and river networks fossey et al 2016 yeo et al 2019 therefore an area or a basin with the same percentage of wetlands can exhibit different hydrological services indicating that wetlands area may not always govern their regulation on flow or flood events however the overall effect of wetlands on floods can be amplified with increase in area we found that upstream wetlands played a particular role in regulating floods in the nrb because they i considerably decreased downstream peak flow mean flow and flow volume with a higher reduction efficiency and ii amplified downstream duration and flow volume on the falling limb this second result partially confirms what acreman and holden 2013 reported that is upland wetlands generally tend to be flood generating areas while floodplain wetlands have a greater potential to reduce floods our findings further demonstrate that this flow amplification process mainly occur on the falling limb in addition the ability of many upland upstream wetlands to store incoming fresh rainwater has been reported to be limited mccartney 2000 guan et al 2010 this suggests that the upstream wetlands can inadequately release water to amplify flow volume on the falling limb of an upstream sub basin fig 9 however upstream wetlands performed higher regulation efficiencies on peak flow duration and mean flow fig 8 and can increase flood and peak travel time enhancing downstream runoff on the falling limb thomas and nisbet 2007 overall although wetlands mitigate flood risks in the nrb wetlands can augment floods to some extent as shown by the positive values depicted in figs 8 10 and the relative occurrence rates introduced in table 4 namely i exceptionally amplify peak flows and mean flows ii mostly increased flow volumes at the fulaerji and dalai stations and iii generally extended flood duration in the three river sections figs 8 10 this opposite effects might be attributed to the differences in initial conditions and total water storage capacity lee et al 2018 geographical locations fossey et al 2016 and spatial distribution patterns yeo et al 2019 of wetlands by way of illustration even those wetlands that generally attenuate peak flows may conversely amplify flows under frozen conditions with higher saturation and lower hydraulic conductivity ahmed 2016 or permanently saturated soils with little or no storage capacity morris and hess 2005 furthermore we found that the direction of change attenuation or amplification and regulation efficiency high or low as well as the variability of wetland effects had different degrees associated with the change in area and geographical location figs 8 10 in a similar case in the bécancour basin eastern canada fossey et al 2016 found that both isolated wetlands located upstream and riparian wetlands located downstream contributed to the mitigation of high flows however ogawa et al 1986 and ameli and creed 2019 reported that downstream wetlands were more effective in reducing downstream flooding than upstream upland wetlands in addition regulation efficiency of wetlands on flood may be modified by the flood coming from tributaries and overwhelmed by processes operating elsewhere in the basin acreman and holden 2013 therefore as found by demissie and khan 1993 acreman and holden 2013 fossey et al 2016 and wu et al 2019 and explained earlier the flow regulation services of wetlands have spatiotemporal variability owing to their intrinsic characteristics e g surface area topography antecedent wetness conditions soil and plant properties and extrinsic factors e g location in the watershed landscape and seasonality precipitation and runoff pathways however in general wetlands mainly store floodwaters and release them slowly and consequently mitigate flood risks and severity in a basin 4 2 implication and limitation we found that wetlands reduced flood risk at three locations shihuiyao fulaerji and dalai confirming the importance of their flood mitigation services in the nenjiang river basin from 1978 to 2000 23 69 of wetlands in the river basin were lost due to agricultural development and river regulation meng et al 2019 many studies have established that wetland loss removal or conversion into other land covers can undermine the flood resilience of a basin evenson et al 2018 lee at al 2018 while wetland restoration can achieve considerable peak flow reductions mitsch and day 2006 yang et al 2010 babbar sebens et al 2013 gómez baggethun et al 2019 acreman et al 2003 suggested that rehabilitation of floodplain wetlands in terms of embankment removal or returning the channel to pre engineered dimensions could be a valuable component of a flood management strategy gulbin et al 2019 concluded that although wetland restoration does not prevent acceleration of flood risks caused by climate change it provides a good complementary measure reducing the negative influences of other flood management strategies this study also found that the regulation services enhanced with wetland area even though wetlands can amplify flood volume to some extent on the falling period tables 2 4 as described previously over the past decade in the nrb wetlands 11 8 percentage of watershed area in 2000 generally contributed to attenuating peak flow mean flow duration and flow volume by 24 3 12 1 mm 12 5 4 4 mm 3 7 1 day and 16 8 18 4 108 m3 respectively table 3 if previous wetland areas could be restored to the level of 1978 with a 15 9 percentage of watershed area li et al 2014a more flood regulation services could be provided to further improve the flood resilience in the study basin moreover we found that upstream and midstream wetlands played an irreplaceable role in improving flood resilience of the lower nrb particularly they have a higher regulation efficiency on peak flow and flow volume fig 9 however wetlands area showed a decreasing trend for the past few decades in these regions dong et al 2014 hence for maximum flood regulation services in the nrb even though downstream wetlands suffered most ongoing wetland restoration projects should be pursued at the basin scale rather than only focusing on downstream wetlands the hydrological model used in this study provides a quantitative approach to simulate the water exchange between river channels and wetlands as well as the flooding process the degree of flood attenuation is largely determined by several characteristics of the river channel including the wetted area size of the channel the bed roughness and sinuosity of the river rameshwaran 1999 and the connectivity between isolated wetlands and river channel acreman and holden 2013 however hydrodynamic modeling should be used for simulating of specific river sections of large and complex river systems bengtson and padmanabhan 1999b fleischmann et al 2018 hence our future work will focus on the hydrodynamic interactions between river channel and riparian wetlands focusing on both floodplain channels hydrodynamics storage bifurcations and lateral connections and vertical hydrological processes floodplain water infiltration into soil column evapotranspiration from soil and vegetation and evaporation of open water this work should prove to be useful for improving the ability of wetland manager to make scientifically rigorous decisions on the better use of environmental water for the restoration and conservation of wetlands kadykalo and findlay 2016 found that hydrological modeling studies tend to indicate larger effects of wetlands on flood endpoints than empirical studies thus a potential limitation or bias of our work to mention is that our results may potentially be over estimating the flood regulation services of wetlands 5 conclusion this study investigated the attenuation efficiency of wetlands on flood generation and magnitude in a large river basin a hydrological modeling approach was employed to discern how flood attenuation efficiency of wetlands can be achieved under several scenarios including full or partial removal of baseline wetlands at different locations within the study river basin our modeling results indicate that wetlands can exhibit different flood regulation behaviors within a large river basin attenuation and amplification effects we also found the attenuation efficiency of wetlands varied with their location and size in the basin especially apparent on peak flow and mean flow and volume on the rising limb of a flood event the study demonstrates that wetland restoration can contribute to improving hydrological resilience to flood risks within a river basin the modeling assessment framework used in this study is also applicable to other large river basins which can help examine management policies focusing on wetland restoration when considering spatial optimization at basin scale declaration of competing

5435,wetlands are often acknowledged as a nature based solution for improving flood resilience in a large river basin however the effects of wetlands on floods have not been assessed as extensively within a large river basin as previous studies have mainly focused on assessing the effect on peak flows of a certain given return period in this study a distributed hydrological modeling platform was used to i quantify the effect of wetlands on floods with respect to event hydrographs and ii investigate how flood regulation services can occur on the rising and falling limbs of an event hydrograph further we hypothesized that flood resilience depends on the distribution and location of wetlands in the basin the hydrological modeling study was conducted on a 297 000 km2 large river basin in northeast china where wetlands are abundant covering approximately 12 of the basin area our modeling study show that wetlands can reduce peak and mean flows event duration and flow volume i e runoff volume by respectively 24 12 14 mm 12 4 37 mm 4 1 day and 17 18 108 m3 in this large river basin the attenuation efficiency of these wetlands varied with their location and size in the basin especially apparent on peak flow mean flow and flow volume on the rising limb of a flood event these findings highlight flood regulation services and attest that wetlands can exhibit different effects that sometimes they may amplify flood conditions thus wetlands are an important land cover for enhancing resilience to flood events within large river basins and wetland protection and restoration ought to be important conservation measures keywords flood mitigation flood risk wetland services wetland area wetland location nenjiang river basin 1 introduction floods are among the most common and costly types of natural disasters in the world severely impacting residential areas agricultural and industrial businesses infrastructures and tourism stine 1994 hallegatte et al 2013 globally floods affected 2 billion people during the period of 1998 2017 wallemarq et al 2018 and caused considerable economic losses accounting for the majority of natural disaster damages wmo 2013 over the last century flood frequencies have increased in many regions of the world and are projected to follow this trend due to climate and land use changes rind et al 1992 ipcc 2014 donat et al 2016 for given climate conditions basin characteristics such as topography soil infiltration land use and land cover lulc and internal storage capacity play important roles in flood generation frequency and duration among these characteristics the effect of lulc on flooding has been intensively investigated studies investigating the effects of basin characteristics on flooding were initiated over 100 years ago first in switzerland stähli et al 2011 two small watersheds and later in the united states see van haveren 1988 the wagon wheel gap watershed in colorado since then numerous studies have been conducted some of them looked into ways of mitigating floods including the development of nature based solutions which have gained increasing attention e g large scale restoration of wetlands zedler and kercher 2005 schanze 2017 thorslund et al 2017 and these mitigation measures are meant to improve flood resilience defined as the ability of a river basin to absorb change and maintain or rapidly return to its functionality see creed et al 2014 wetlands have great potential to be used as a nature based solution for improving the flood resilience of a river basin to flood risk e g albert et al 2017 ameli and creed 2019 chen et al 2019 the natural hydrological regulation services provided by wetlands can also support downstream runoff control structures mitsch et al 1977 thorslund et al 2017 in a changing climate wetland flood attenuation becomes more critical for flood control gulbin et al 2019 based on empirical and modeling studies recently reported in the literature it is generally accepted that wetlands mitigate floods i e provide flood regulation services by reducing peak and mean flows duration and flow volume bullock and acreman 2003 acreman and holden 2013 kadykalo and findlay 2016 for example ahmed 2014 estimated that the combined effect of all wetlands approximately 15 of the studied basin area could achieve a 10 reduction in flood peak in the rideau river watershed however despite the flood mitigation potential there has been a continued and rapid decline in wetland areas in asia europe and north america davidson 2014 hu et al 2017 mainly caused by agricultural extension urban sprawl and other human activities mitsch and gosselink 2007 for instance global inland and marine coastal wetlands both declined by approximately 35 from 1970 to 2015 ramsar convention on wetlands 2018 this decline undermined the hydrological regulation services provided by wetlands increasing flood risk ahmed 2014 evenson et al 2018 ameli and creed 2019 intensifying downstream flow variability lee et al 2018 and decreasing groundwater recharge and baseflow evenson et al 2015 yeo et al 2019 quantifying the hydrological services of wetlands especially those of flood mitigation services represents an essential step towards solidifying the importance of wetlands and restoring and conserving them in river basins although some studies have focused on flow regulation services provided by wetlands uncertainties still exist as to whether and or to what extent wetlands can mitigate floods some studies reported wetlands ability to reduce floods but others showed no significant impact bengtson and padmanabhan 1999a b ehsanzadeh et al 2012 a few studies even reported that wetlands could even increase floods bullock and acreman 2003 as well as increase flood peaks under certain conditions ogawa and male 1986 bullock and acreman 2003 acreman and holden 2013 kadykalo and findlay 2016 in general there exists a knowledge gap of how to quantify wetland regulation services on floods and addressing this question using a robust framework remains important for advancing our scientific understandings of the basin scale impacts of floods and their implications on human welfare and well being this lack of consensus hinders our ability to unilaterally restore and conserve wetlands to improve the flood resilience of river basin in a very recent study conducted in a medium size watershed in canada ameli and creed 2019 reported that wetland locations in a river basin could play a role in flood regulation services however they mainly focused on estimating flow regulation services of wetlands located at different distances from the mainstream network in the studied 8861 km2 and relatively homogeneous river basin e g low slope topography and mild hydrometeorological characteristics although their study provides insights into flood regulation services of wetlands more detail analyses of the effect of wetland distribution and location are needed to test whether their services are transferable to large river basins especially those with steep headwaters and widespread flat floodplains in this study we hypothesized that wetland distribution and location in a river basin affect flood resilience to test the hypothesis we carried out a hydrological modelling study on a large river basin the nenjiang river basin in northeast china specifically our objectives were to i determine the effects of wetlands on flood magnitude by highlighting changes in the rising and falling limbs of hydrographs ii quantify how these effects can further characterize the hydrological services provided by wetlands and iii highlight the role of wetland location in the study river basin and on how it can affect flood resilience the nejinang river basin was selected as a case study here because it has abundant wetlands diverse terrain features and has undergone intensive anthropogenic activities in the past half century particularly in the conversion of wetlands to agricultural and other land uses findings gained from this study could support the development of effective wetland management and restoration strategies for mitigating floods 2 methodology 2 1 study area the nenjiang river basin nrb is located in northeast china the river is the largest tributary of the songhua river fig 1 a the nenjiang river drains a total area of 297 100 km2 with an elevation ranging from 117 to 1 741 m above mean sea level feng et al 2011 li et al 2014a climate in the region can be characterized by strong seasonality feng et al 2011 li et al 2014b wu et al 2018 the monthly temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration varied from 19 5 to 19 9 from 6 to 113 mm and from 11 to 133 mm respectively fig 2 the mean annual total precipitation and mean temperature for the 1961 2016 period within the basin varied from 323 to 537 mm and from 4 6 to 6 4 c respectively whereas the mean annual flow was 589 m3 s at the basin outlet that the dalai hydrological station fig 1a the bulk of the annual precipitation mainly occurs during the months of june to september accounting for 82 of the annual total li et al 2019 over the last few decades the nenjiang river basin experienced severe flood events resulting in substantial damages and subsequent economic losses feng et al 2011 li et al 2012 understanding the flood mitigation services of wetlands in this river basin is not only important but also challenging because of the basin s large size and diverse terrain conditions based on climate elevation and topographical conditions the nrb can be divided into three distinct areas the upper shihuiyao drainage basin middle from shihuiyao to fulaerji and lower from fualerji to dalai sub basins fig 1a the areas of these sub basins are respectively 17 164 km2 107 343 km2 and 126 149 km2 the nrb lulc characteristics are in terms of percentage of the total basin area 27 6 agriculture 28 0 forest 12 1 grassland 1 5 developed urban land 13 6 bare land and 12 1 wetlands fig 1c li et al 2019 there were generally more agricultural lands in the lower nrb and more forested land and wetlands in the upstream including a ramsar site and a large nature reserve fig 1b in the lower nrb we have a large area of lakes and swamps distributed around the lower reaches of the uyu er tao er and huolin rivers which are considered as important regulators of natural water storage and regional water balance meng et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 several internationally and nationally important wetland nature reserves are located within the nrb including the zhalong xianghai and momoge wetlands which could be more vulnerable than other ecosystems to future climate change li et al 2019 however due to agricultural development and river regulation approximately 109 000 km2 of wetlands accounting for 23 7 of the wetlands area in 1978 were lost between 1978 and 2000 feng et al 2013 in particular in the downstream portion of the nrb 2 2 hydrological model 2 2 1 model description in this study the physitel hydrotel distributed hydrological modelling platform was used to simulate hydrological processes and to quantify hydrological services provided by wetlands in the nrb more specifically physitel is a specialized gis and hydrotel is a continuous semi distributed physically based hydrological model fortin et al 2001 turcotte et al 2003 2007 bouda et al 2012 bouda et al 2014 this platform has been used by fossey and rousseau 2016a b fossey and rousseau 2016a b blanchette et al 2019 and wu et al 2019 for quantifying the hydrological services provided by wetlands hydrotel is built around seven computational modules performing various tasks and calculations in successive steps i e i weather data interpolation ii accumulation and melt of snowpack iii potential evapotranspiration calculation iv vertical water budget determination v terrestrial flow generation vi river flow routing and vii wetlands water budget please refer to fortin et al 2001 and turcotte et al 2003 2007 for more details about hydrotel as mentioned before physitel is a specialized geographic information system gis interface that was developed to support the implementation of distributed hydrological models turcotte et al 2001 rousseau et al 2011 noël et al 2014 using gridded and vector based datasets digital elevation model dem a hydrographic network a soil type map and a land cover map physitel determines the slope and flow direction of each cell d8 ltd algorithm orlandini et al 2003 given the cells corresponding to the outlet of a watershed such a watershed can be then delineated into relatively homogeneous hydrological units rhhus namely hillslopes or elementary sub watersheds that are the computational spatial units of the vertical water budget using the algorithm developed by noel et al 2014 which performs the following steps i determination of headwater hillslope i e the area drained by the first pixel of the headwater river segment defining two lateral hillslopes two rhhus one on each side of the river segment ii scanning of the flow direction matrix and determination of two lateral rhhus all the cells draining the hillslopes into the left and right banks of the river segment for each headwater river segment iii building of the hillslope matrix and delineation of all lateral rhhus for all the other river segments all the way to the watershed outlet it is noteworthy the degree of details user s choice determined by the selected headwater drainage area threshold to initiate the river network governs the total number of rhhus the idea behind selecting a threshold for the headwater drainage area is to obtain a reasonable number of rhhus with respect to the anticipated computational time and to have a fairly detailed watershed discretization fossey et al 2015 for this study the basin was subdivided using physitel into 3 868 rhhus for an average area of 75 km2 and 1 551 river segments for a mean length of 9 627 m simultaneously the total area of wetlands obtained from physitel for the upper middle and lower sub basins of the nrb were 2 332 km2 12 164 km2 and 12 951 km2 respectively information on sub basin areas wetlands and their contributing areas is summarized in table 1 the contributing area of a wetland is processed using the flow accumulation matrix in physitel fossey et al 2015 and refers to the wetland drainage area the percentage refers to the ratio of wetland or contributing area to the size of a sub basin moreover physitel can explicitly account for isolated iws and riparian wetlands rws fossey et al 2015 using the hydrologically equivalent wetland hew concept liu et al 2008 wang et al 2008 fig 3 this concept postulates that characteristics e g contributing area and wetland surface area of one hew i e isolated wetland or riparian wetland represent those in each wetland type within a rhhu few conditions apply to this concept i only one isolated and or riparian hew per rhhu ii one hew must be fully integrated within an rhhu iii numerical integration of isolated hew parameters and iv numerical and spatial i e specific location on the river segment integration of riparian hew parameters considering these conditions two parameters i the maximum surface area of each wetland estimated from the wetland map and ii the area containing the wetland surface and the wetland drainage area liu et al 2008 are automatically determined by physitel after importing the physiographic database prepared by physitel hydrotel can integrate the isolated riparian wetland modules at the rhhu level the isolated wetland module is conceptualized as a control volume within the water balance of an rhhu vertical water budget a k a bv3c sub model of hydrotel fortin et al 2001 with a terrestrial flow connection while the riparian wetland module is partially integrated in the water balance with a direct connection to the river routing model kinematic wave equation inflows to isolated riparian wetlands are calculated by prorating the outputs of the rhhu s vertical water budget namely surface lateral and base flows with respect to the wetland parameters wetland outflows are determined from a secondary water balance calculation at the hew scale described subsequently and then routed to the river segment directly in the case of riparian wetland or through the terrestrial flow in the case of isolated wetland fossey et al 2015 2 2 2 datasets and model calibration hydrotel requires meteorological data daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures as inputs and observed hydrometric data daily flows for calibration purposes daily precipitation and temperatures spanning 1961 2016 were obtained from 39 weather stations operated by the china meteorological administration www cmads org including 19 stations within the basin and another 20 stations nearby the daily river flow data from 1961 to 2016 were collected for three gauges stations fig 1a located on the mainstream of the nenjiang river digital elevation model dem data the land cover map of 2000 including wetlands soil map and river network were obtained from the chinese resource and environment data cloud platform http www resdc cn hydrotel was calibrated with observed daily discharge at three gauge stations over the period from 1995 10 01 to 2016 09 30 the model was validated using discharge records collected from 1964 10 01 to 1995 09 30 after a 1 year warm up period 1994 10 01 1995 09 30 a global sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the model sensitivity to 18 key parameters as proposed by foulon and rousseau 2018 using the safe toolbox developed by pinaosi et al 2015 a total of 13 most sensitive parameters were chosen for calibration and validation of the model for the nrb the remaining parameters were determined following the guidelines provided by foulon and rousseau 2019 the dynamically dimensioned search algorithm dds tolson and shoemaker 2007 was used to calibrate the 13 most sensitive parameters of the model automatic calibration was performed based on the maximization of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse defined by nash and sutcliffe 1970 using 10 optimization trials 250 sets of parameters per trail then the best set of parameter values out of those of the 10 trials were selected for this study calibration performance was also evaluated using the root mean square error rmse and the percent bias pbias following recommendations of moriasi et al 2007 2015 to capture the best parameters of hydrotel for the nrb 2 3 wetland scenarios five wetland scenarios were prepared in light of their location upper middle and lower sub basin wetlands to examine the effect of wetlands on flood risks as compared with a baseline scenario wetlands from the 2000 lulc scenario 1 represented the effect of upstream wetlands on flood risks at the outlets of the upper middle and lower sub basins of the nrb scenario 2 represented the effect of midstream wetlands on flood risks at the outlets of the middle and lower portion of the nrb scenario 3 represented the combined effect of midstream and downstream wetlands on flood risks at the outlets of the middle and lower sub basins of the nrb scenario 4 was prepared to investigate wetland mitigation function on the outlets of the nrb finally scenario 5 represented an extreme wetland loss scenario i e removal of all wetlands from the nrb to discern potential extreme flood risk if all exiting wetlands in the basin were converted into agricultural land the outlets of the three sub basins are shihuiyao flaerji and dalai referred to as upper middle and lower sub basins respectively fig 1 the spatial distribution and detailed information of the baseline and wetland removal scenarios are presented in fig 4 and table 2 the wetland removal scenarios are defined as follows when the wetland modules are turned off wetland areas are not removed but they are treated as the land cover of saturated soils and thus their explicit storage properties and dynamics are not accounted for in the modeling wu et al 2020 this is a basic assumption and it has been used in several studies using models such as swat liu et al 2008 wang et al 2008 evenson et al 2015 mike 11 ahmed 2014 and hydrotel fossey et al 2016 fossey and rousseau 2016a b wu et al 2019 2020 to quantify the hydrological services streamflow regulation services provided by wetlands 2 4 assessment of flood regulation services of wetlands to quantify flood regulation services of wetlands we first analyzed how they can affect flood risks in terms of four indicators namely peak flow mean flow duration and flow volume of flood events then we quantitatively assessed the effects during the rising and falling limbs of the event hydrographs to identify whether or not the services were altered finally we determined the regulation efficiency to detect how much and to what extent wetlands could affect floods at different locations of the nrb the aforementioned indicators were determined using meteorological data of the 1964 2016 period in shihuiyao fualaerji and dalai simulated under the 2000 lulc a 2 year return flood threshold was used in all indices because it has been used as a proxy to bankfull discharge and threshold for flood events in past studies cheng et al 2013 xu et al 2017 hence a frequency analysis was used to determine the stream flow having a 2 year return period for each simulation year if the daily flow was higher than or equal to the 2 year return flow 1964 2016 it was considered as a flood event starting when flows exceeded the threshold ending when flows recessed below the threshold fig 5 a flood duration was defined as the number of consecutive days of flooding in an event peak flow was defined as the maximum flow during an event mean flow was defined as the average daily flow during an event rising limb and falling limbs referred to the increase and fall in flows during a flood event respectively wolff and burges 1994 to clarify the flood risks we extracted only one flood event each year according to i including annual maximum peak flow and ii a minimum of five day duration fig 5b simultaneously the mean flow duration and flow volume for the rising and falling limbs of the hydrographs were determined fig 5c finally the difference in an indicator value between baseline and wetland removal scenarios were calculated to quantify changes in flood risks caused by wetlands as well as their effects during the rising and falling limbs of the event hydrograph the analysis of variance anova was used with a significance level of 5 to determine whether there were significant differences in the indicators between baseline and wetland removal scenarios for each flood event we computed the wetland specific impact wsi adapted from fossey et al 2016 to determine the regulation efficiency of wetlands this index for wetland removal scenario i and flood indicator j can be expressed as follows 1 ws i ij i wj i re i j a w where iwj and ireij are flood indicators obtained from simulated daily flow series with wetlands and wetland removal scenarios respectively see 2 3 a is the considered wetland area km2 in this study we calculated the wsi value for peak flow wsipeak mm km2 flow volume wsivolume m3 km2 mean flow wsimean flow mm km2 and duration wsiduraion day km2 of each flood event for the upper middle upper middle lower sub basins and the whole study area to comparatively illustrate how flood regulation efficiency depends on their geographical location a negative value for wsi indicates wetlands provide positive flood mitigation services while conversely a positive value for wsi indicates flood mitigation disservices i e flood augmentation anova and fisher s least significant difference lsd tests were performed to determine whether there were significant differences in regulation efficiency among the five wetland removal scenarios 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation simulations replicated the flow patterns satisfactorily for both the calibration period and the validation period fig 6 nse values ranged from 0 60 to 0 74 for shihuiyao fulaerji and dalai gauge stations which is deemed a good match between observed and simulated high flows the rmse and pbias values varied from 7 6 to 13 6 m3 s and from 7 3 to 11 5 respectively both indicating a good representation of the flow processes moriasi et al 2007 2015 it should be noted that the simulation results were slightly inferior during the validation period than those of the calibration period for nse rmse and pbias nonetheless for both periods the simulated flow results exceeded the acceptable performance criteria nse 0 5 and pbias 15 suggested by moriasi et al 2007 2015 furthermore the lower rmse values indicated an overall good model fit moriasi et al 2007 2015 these results demonstrate that the calibrated model succeeded in depicting flow under the time invariant land cover of the 2001 2015 period under different climate conditions moriasi et al 2007 arnold et al 2012 3 2 overall wetland flood regulation services flow duration curves higher than or equal to the 2 year return flow for wetland removal scenarios and baselines are presented in fig 7 they clearly show that stream flows were sensitive to the removal of wetlands in the river basin generally removing wetlands led to higher flows at the three stations which was more apparent when the exceedance probability was 0 02 however the degree of divergence varied with different wetland removal scenarios in fulaerji fig 7b and dalai fig 7c specifically the increased mean flows following removal of wetlands were 1 7 mm shihuiyaous in shihuiyao 1 2 mm fulaerjius 4 8 mm fulaerjims and 4 4 mm fulaerjius ms in fulaerji and 0 5 mm dalaius 3 7 mm dalaums 1 6 mm dalaids and 4 9 mm dalaius ms ds in dalai therefore wetlands considerably reduced flows in the nrb however the mitigation capacity depended on their location and surface area in the river basin wetlands significantly p 0 05 reduced peak flow mean flow and flow volume by respectively 3 2 mm 1 4 mm and 1 6 108 m3 in the upstream fig 8 and table 3 4 generally upstream wetlands mitigated downstream i e fulaerji and dalai peak flow and mean flow while leading to a marginal flow volume increase in fulaerji 0 7 108 m3 for midstream and downstream wetlands mitigated flood by decreasing peak flow mean flow and flow volume in addition midstream and up midstream wetlands considerably attenuated floods by significantly reducing peak flow mean flow and flow volume however upstream and downstream wetlands considerably exacerbated flooding by increasing peak flow mean flow and flow volume under certain conditions as illustrated fig 4 and in table 4 the latter introducing the relative occurrence rate of increasing or decreasing the aforementioned hydrograph characteristics for the entire nrb i e dalaius ms ds as reported in table 3 wetlands significantly reduced peak flow mean flow flow volume and slightly extended duration by 12 1 mm 4 4 mm 18 4 108 m3 and 1 day respectively in terms of the data reported in table 4 for the entire nrb this means that 100 of the values were negative as wetlands induced an attenuation effect in the aforementioned hydrograph characteristics it can be observed that upstream and midstream wetlands extended the duration in shihuiyao 1 day and fulaerji 1 day while wetlands in the upper upper middle and lower sub basins showed little effect on the duration in dalai in addition wetlands generally induced an amplification effect positive values on duration except for the dalai station where the median duration was 1 day table 3 although 46 3 of the values indicated a longer duration as indicated in table 4 that being said overall wetlands significantly decreased peak flow mean flow and flow volume and slightly extended duration of the flood in the nrb furthermore these results also indicate that the hydrological effects of wetlands were associated with their geographical location 3 3 flow regulation services of wetlands on the rising and falling limbs effects of wetlands on duration mean flow and flow volume on the rising and falling limbs in the nrb are presented in fig 9 and tables 3 and 4 it can be observed that wetlands slightly reduced the duration of the rising limb and considerably extended the duration of the recession limb p 0 5 for midstream downstream and the entire nrb wetlands excluding a continuous reduction effect of up midstream wetlands wetlands consistently decreased mean flow of both the rising and falling limbs in the nrb with very high occurrence rate see table 4 for the percentage of negative values i e the second number in between parentheses however flow volume largely reduced initially on the rising limb while increasing to some extent on the falling limb specifically upstream wetlands increased the flow volume by 2 2 108 m3 and 1 6 108 m3 in the midstream and downstream on the falling limb respectively similarly midstream and downstream wetlands augmented the flow volume with values of 1 2 108 m3 and 0 7 108 m3 in the downstream respectively additionally wetlands tend to have greater mitigation effect on mean flow and flow volume on the rising limb than those of the falling limb however under certain conditions the relative occurrence rate of amplification effects on peak flow mean flow and flow volume illustrated that wetlands do exacerbate flood on the rising limb see table 4 for the percentage of positive values i e the first number in between parentheses the comparison of duration mean flow and flow volume between the rising and falling limbs suggests that wetlands exerted opposite effects attenuation or amplification and different mitigation capacity on the rising and falling limbs as described in the previous paragraph flood regulation services depend on geographical location variation of wetlands a difference is the converse effect on the falling limb between upstream wetlands and mid downstream wetlands fig 9 in addition the sub basins all have similar percentages of wetlands refer to table 1 however each one of them presented different effects fig 8 and table 3 for instance the percentages of wetlands were 11 33 and 11 88 in the midstream and downstream basins however wetlands had a larger reduction effect on peak flow mean flow and flow volume at the outlet of the middle sub basin than the outlet of the lower sub basin furthermore the flood regulation services amplified with an increase in wetlands area fig 8 and table 3 it can be observed that the whole basin wetlands showed the largest mitigation effects on peak flow mean flow and flow volume followed by up midstream wetlands while upstream wetlands had a minimum mitigation effect however for midstream and downstream wetlands following the increase in area no amplification effect on peak flow mean flow and flow volume was observed for dalai station see tables 3 and 4 to further investigate whether wetland location can alter their flood regulation services we calculated regulation efficiency with respect to peak flow duration flow volume and mean flow for per unit area of wetland i e wsi in upstream midstream and downstream portions of the nrb given the similar percentages of wetlands the regulation efficiency showed significant differences p 0 05 associated with location fig 9 upstream wetlands had the highest regulation efficiency on peak flow and mean flow with median values of 1 4 10 3 mm km2 and 0 6 10 3 mm km2 followed by the midstream wetlands with the median values of 0 9 10 3 mm km2 and 0 4 10 3mm km2 respectively fig 10 a and 10b however in terms of duration upstream and midstream wetlands had higher extension efficiency median value of wsiduration was 0 4 10 3 day km2 than downstream wetlands smaller than or equal to zero fig 10c additionally upstream wetlands showed a higher amplification effect on flow volume in fulaerji median value of wsivolume was 4 105 m3 km2 and an occasional amplification effect on flow volume in dalai wsivolume ranged from 2 1 105 to 1 3 105 m3 km2 however midstream and downstream wetlands overall displayed a reduced effect on flow volume among which midstream and up midstream wetlands presented a high reduction efficiency with the wsivolume values of 0 9 105 and 1 1 105 m3 km2 respectively fig 10d also it can be observed that regulation efficiency on peak flow mean flow and duration between upstream wetlands and the other four scenarios showed significant differences indicating that wetlands with different locations played unequal roles in attenuating flood risks in this large basin these results further suggest that the flow regulation efficiency of wetlands largely depended on their geographical location 4 discussion 4 1 flood attenuation services of wetlands previous research efforts have assessed and discussed the flow mitigation services provided by wetlands whether and to what extent wetlands can affect floods ogawa and male 1986 bengtson and padmanabhan 1999a bullock and acreman 2003 acreman and holden 2013 kadykalo and findlay 2016 in this study we quantitatively assessed the effects of wetlands on peak and mean flows duration and flow volume of flood events in terms of their geographical location overall we found that wetlands mitigated floods by reducing peak flow flow volume and mean flow and extended duration to some extent in the nrb the geographical location affected mitigation efficiency of wetlands namely the direction of change attenuation or amplification and regulation efficiency high or low varied with their geographical location and area these findings indicate that i wetlands can modify flood during both the rising limb and the falling limb fig 11 and ii wetlands located in different regions within a large basin can induce different effects i e attenuation or amplification significantly or not on flood events the main contribution of our results is to elucidate how and to what extent wetlands regulate flood in a large basin providing a general assessment framework to advance quantification of flood regulation services provided by wetlands basins with similar percentages of wetlands had different flood regulation services i e attenuation or amplification significant effects or not see figs 8 10 the differences can be attributed to wetland types and watershed landscape attributes since different wetlands such as riparian isolated wetlands or upland rain fed floodplain river fed wetlands have distinct water storage capacity and water transport processes their roles in controlling hydrological processes can have different or even opposite characteristics ogawa et al 1986 demissie and khan 1993 acreman and holden 2013 lee et al 2018 another important aspect of this distinction is wetland drainage area table 1 indeed the wetland drainage area can largely influence how much water wetlands can intercept in a region and local landscape conditions may promote or limit their regulation efficiency specifically their hydrological services depend on the inherent combined effect of wetland location and type as well as landscape attributes such as hydrological connectivity land use types and river networks fossey et al 2016 yeo et al 2019 therefore an area or a basin with the same percentage of wetlands can exhibit different hydrological services indicating that wetlands area may not always govern their regulation on flow or flood events however the overall effect of wetlands on floods can be amplified with increase in area we found that upstream wetlands played a particular role in regulating floods in the nrb because they i considerably decreased downstream peak flow mean flow and flow volume with a higher reduction efficiency and ii amplified downstream duration and flow volume on the falling limb this second result partially confirms what acreman and holden 2013 reported that is upland wetlands generally tend to be flood generating areas while floodplain wetlands have a greater potential to reduce floods our findings further demonstrate that this flow amplification process mainly occur on the falling limb in addition the ability of many upland upstream wetlands to store incoming fresh rainwater has been reported to be limited mccartney 2000 guan et al 2010 this suggests that the upstream wetlands can inadequately release water to amplify flow volume on the falling limb of an upstream sub basin fig 9 however upstream wetlands performed higher regulation efficiencies on peak flow duration and mean flow fig 8 and can increase flood and peak travel time enhancing downstream runoff on the falling limb thomas and nisbet 2007 overall although wetlands mitigate flood risks in the nrb wetlands can augment floods to some extent as shown by the positive values depicted in figs 8 10 and the relative occurrence rates introduced in table 4 namely i exceptionally amplify peak flows and mean flows ii mostly increased flow volumes at the fulaerji and dalai stations and iii generally extended flood duration in the three river sections figs 8 10 this opposite effects might be attributed to the differences in initial conditions and total water storage capacity lee et al 2018 geographical locations fossey et al 2016 and spatial distribution patterns yeo et al 2019 of wetlands by way of illustration even those wetlands that generally attenuate peak flows may conversely amplify flows under frozen conditions with higher saturation and lower hydraulic conductivity ahmed 2016 or permanently saturated soils with little or no storage capacity morris and hess 2005 furthermore we found that the direction of change attenuation or amplification and regulation efficiency high or low as well as the variability of wetland effects had different degrees associated with the change in area and geographical location figs 8 10 in a similar case in the bécancour basin eastern canada fossey et al 2016 found that both isolated wetlands located upstream and riparian wetlands located downstream contributed to the mitigation of high flows however ogawa et al 1986 and ameli and creed 2019 reported that downstream wetlands were more effective in reducing downstream flooding than upstream upland wetlands in addition regulation efficiency of wetlands on flood may be modified by the flood coming from tributaries and overwhelmed by processes operating elsewhere in the basin acreman and holden 2013 therefore as found by demissie and khan 1993 acreman and holden 2013 fossey et al 2016 and wu et al 2019 and explained earlier the flow regulation services of wetlands have spatiotemporal variability owing to their intrinsic characteristics e g surface area topography antecedent wetness conditions soil and plant properties and extrinsic factors e g location in the watershed landscape and seasonality precipitation and runoff pathways however in general wetlands mainly store floodwaters and release them slowly and consequently mitigate flood risks and severity in a basin 4 2 implication and limitation we found that wetlands reduced flood risk at three locations shihuiyao fulaerji and dalai confirming the importance of their flood mitigation services in the nenjiang river basin from 1978 to 2000 23 69 of wetlands in the river basin were lost due to agricultural development and river regulation meng et al 2019 many studies have established that wetland loss removal or conversion into other land covers can undermine the flood resilience of a basin evenson et al 2018 lee at al 2018 while wetland restoration can achieve considerable peak flow reductions mitsch and day 2006 yang et al 2010 babbar sebens et al 2013 gómez baggethun et al 2019 acreman et al 2003 suggested that rehabilitation of floodplain wetlands in terms of embankment removal or returning the channel to pre engineered dimensions could be a valuable component of a flood management strategy gulbin et al 2019 concluded that although wetland restoration does not prevent acceleration of flood risks caused by climate change it provides a good complementary measure reducing the negative influences of other flood management strategies this study also found that the regulation services enhanced with wetland area even though wetlands can amplify flood volume to some extent on the falling period tables 2 4 as described previously over the past decade in the nrb wetlands 11 8 percentage of watershed area in 2000 generally contributed to attenuating peak flow mean flow duration and flow volume by 24 3 12 1 mm 12 5 4 4 mm 3 7 1 day and 16 8 18 4 108 m3 respectively table 3 if previous wetland areas could be restored to the level of 1978 with a 15 9 percentage of watershed area li et al 2014a more flood regulation services could be provided to further improve the flood resilience in the study basin moreover we found that upstream and midstream wetlands played an irreplaceable role in improving flood resilience of the lower nrb particularly they have a higher regulation efficiency on peak flow and flow volume fig 9 however wetlands area showed a decreasing trend for the past few decades in these regions dong et al 2014 hence for maximum flood regulation services in the nrb even though downstream wetlands suffered most ongoing wetland restoration projects should be pursued at the basin scale rather than only focusing on downstream wetlands the hydrological model used in this study provides a quantitative approach to simulate the water exchange between river channels and wetlands as well as the flooding process the degree of flood attenuation is largely determined by several characteristics of the river channel including the wetted area size of the channel the bed roughness and sinuosity of the river rameshwaran 1999 and the connectivity between isolated wetlands and river channel acreman and holden 2013 however hydrodynamic modeling should be used for simulating of specific river sections of large and complex river systems bengtson and padmanabhan 1999b fleischmann et al 2018 hence our future work will focus on the hydrodynamic interactions between river channel and riparian wetlands focusing on both floodplain channels hydrodynamics storage bifurcations and lateral connections and vertical hydrological processes floodplain water infiltration into soil column evapotranspiration from soil and vegetation and evaporation of open water this work should prove to be useful for improving the ability of wetland manager to make scientifically rigorous decisions on the better use of environmental water for the restoration and conservation of wetlands kadykalo and findlay 2016 found that hydrological modeling studies tend to indicate larger effects of wetlands on flood endpoints than empirical studies thus a potential limitation or bias of our work to mention is that our results may potentially be over estimating the flood regulation services of wetlands 5 conclusion this study investigated the attenuation efficiency of wetlands on flood generation and magnitude in a large river basin a hydrological modeling approach was employed to discern how flood attenuation efficiency of wetlands can be achieved under several scenarios including full or partial removal of baseline wetlands at different locations within the study river basin our modeling results indicate that wetlands can exhibit different flood regulation behaviors within a large river basin attenuation and amplification effects we also found the attenuation efficiency of wetlands varied with their location and size in the basin especially apparent on peak flow and mean flow and volume on the rising limb of a flood event the study demonstrates that wetland restoration can contribute to improving hydrological resilience to flood risks within a river basin the modeling assessment framework used in this study is also applicable to other large river basins which can help examine management policies focusing on wetland restoration when considering spatial optimization at basin scale declaration of competing

5436,hydraulic characterization of a contaminated aquifer is an important step in depollution processes because its hydraulic parameters control the choice and efficiency of the depollution protocol to be adopted the characterization presented in this article uses a 3d electrical resistivity imagery to identify the spatial heterogeneities of a contaminated aquifer under tidal influence indeed we use a 3d resistivity model as a source of information to parameterize the reconstruction of the hydraulic conductivity in 3d by inverting a set of hydraulic data acquired on the 13 monitored wells in response to two pumping tests this parameterization relies on the identification of the main electro facies in the resistivity model in the saturated zone which will then be exploited in the hydraulic characterization to find their corresponding hydraulic conductivity values this strategy of parameterization permits to reduce the number of the hydraulic conductivity parameters to be identified to eight hydro facies with a stochastic algorithm called the adaptive metropolis algorithm the hydraulic responses associated with the pumping tests are obtained once the natural effect of the tide is removed the hydraulic conductivity model has permitted to highlight the main heterogeneities in the aquifer in which the hydraulic conductivity is ranging between 10 4 6 10 2 8 m s this range of variability reveals the permeable and smooth character of the aquifer in which the presence of coarse sand and flint blocks enhances its transmissivity these permeable zones are electrically identified by resistive anomalies in the 3d electrical resistivity imaging keywords electrical resistivity tomogram hydraulic tomography hydrogeophysics inversion inverse problem stochastic inversion 1 introduction the strong industrialization of the last century has led to an increase of contaminated sites that currently represent a real threat to the health of the population and the quality of the ecosystem air water soil flora and fauna to address these environmental issues several remediation technologies have been developed in order to remove contaminants or to reduce their spread in water resources among them we cite natural attenuation in situ thermal desorption in situ chemical oxidation or reduction hydraulic containment and pump and treat yeung 2010 zhang et al 2017 ossai et al 2020 however their applicability and effectiveness still strongly depend on the dynamic of the aquifer in other terms to the hydraulic conductivity of soils the groundwater flow and the migration of contaminant plumes are conditioned by the spatial heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity which can be sharply ranged even on a small scale and within the same geological formations in addition the brownfields hydraulic conductivity field may be affected by the presence of concrete foundations buried in the shallow aquifers in general the characterization of the hydraulic conductivity is performed by means of traditional pumping tests in which the analytical formulations of the groundwater flow equations either in the transient or steady states are used to interpret the piezometric responses to water extraction in order to derive an average value of the hydraulic transmissivity theis 1935 hantush 1961 the permeabilities can be progressively estimated with a permeameter test carried out on soils sampled during drilling operations however both approaches neglect the heterogeneity of the hydraulic properties in the aquifer which leads to an inaccurate and incomplete understanding of contaminants transport during the remediation process the hydraulic tomography tool appears as an interesting and relevant option to deals with the heterogeneous aquifers through a conjoint interpretation of a piezometric dataset associated with multiple pumping tests conducted successively at various wells yeh et al 1996 kitanidis 1997 le borgne et al 2004 li et al 2008 the tomogram of the hydraulic conductivity field provided from a hydraulic tomography technique is the result of an optimization algorithm also called inverse algorithm in which this field was chosen thanks to its ability to match the observed drawdown data inversion algorithms can be deterministic or stochastic they both rely on an iterative process in which the groundwater flow equations forward problem are solved numerically at each iteration in order to evaluate the mismatch between the observed and predicted hydraulic drawdown huang et al 2004 however these inverse algorithms do not guarantee to get a unique solution for the following reasons i the limited number of the hydraulic data to capture overall unknown parameters zhou et al 2016 ii the strong sensitivity of the solution to the data noise ramos et al 2017 iii the numerical uncertainty of mathematical models that cannot describe all the physical mechanisms involved in the experiment to which it adds the numerical imperfections related to the numerical tool e g finite difference and finite element used to solve the groundwater equation berg and illman 2015 hochstetler et al 2016 over the last few decades several efforts have been made to deal with the ill posedness and the uncertainties of the inverse problem via the incorporation of complementary information on the unknown parameters in order to generate a realistic model zhou et al 2014 this additional information is referred as soft data or a priori model and can be deduced from various ways such as geological characterization e g lithostratigraphic logs grain size analyses on the soil cores jardani et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 hydrogeological investigation e g permeameter test on the soil cores tracer and slug experiments sanchez león et al 2016 and geophysical prospections e g electrical resistivity tomography ert electromagnetic very low frequency vlf georadar and seismic methods hyndman et al 1994 jardani et al 2012 among these attempts soueid ahmed et al 2015 used the geometry of the geological structures identified by geophysical tomography as a priori information in the inversion of pumping test data to image hydraulic parameters bohling et al 2007 applied cross well georadar tomography to delineate the shape of the main hydro facies in which hydraulic conductivity values were then determined by analyzing pumping test data gpr velocity tomograms were used to support tracer test data for the prediction of hydraulic properties dafflon and barrash 2012 jardani et al 2013 combined the ert self potential and salt concentration data acquired during a salt tracer test to map the hydraulic conductivity field pollock and cirpka 2010 coupled hydrogeophysical inversion to synthetic salt tracer experiments doetsch et al 2010 proposed cross gradient joint inversion of crosshole seismic ert and radar to retrieve the main geological units of a fluvial aquifer and their petrophysical parameters as porosity gernez et al 2019 linked the anisotropic patterns of the inverted electrical resistivity to the spatial distribution of the hydraulic conductivity in an alluvial aquifer in this paper we apply the zonation inversion methodology to image the spatial variability of the hydraulic conductivity field this approach consists of two steps first we delineate in 3d the main geological structures of a contaminated aquifer by using ert in the second step we predict the hydraulic conductivity of these structures by inverting the pumping tests data recorded in 13 wells with a markov chain monte carlo based algorithm 2 description of the experimental study site in this manuscript a hydrodynamic characterization is performed on an experimental site located in a former refinery within a shallow alluvial aquifer contaminated by hydrocarbons the industrial activities on the site have begun in 1929 and have been stopped in april 2013 the set up of this experimental site aims to understand the degree of heterogeneity in the soil of the former refinery and the nature of the contaminants in order to experiment various remediation protocols for that reason 13 piezometers were implanted on a small area 60 m 60 m to record the hydraulic fluctuations and to identify the degree and type of contamination in the aquifer fig 1 the site is mostly covered by an anthropogenic layer of gravel and in some places of asphalt and concrete this layer covers an alluvial formation composed mainly of fine sand 0 2 mm and medium sand 1 mm from 1 to 5 m depth and medium 1 mm to gravel sands 2 mm between 5 and 8 m depth preliminary geological investigations conducted on the site revealed highly heterogeneous materials constituting the aquifer the laboratory analysis performed on three core samples indicate a quite constant porosity from 28 9 to 24 6 between 7 2 and 10 5 m a hydraulic conductivity varying between 2 31 10 5 to 6 87 10 4 m s and a low quantity of clay this alluvial terrace relies on an altered chalk formation below 8 5 m and both aquifers are hydraulically connected to the seine river which is under tidal influence jardani et al 2012 consequently the water table in the alluvial aquifer oscillates with time varying amplitude the vertical geochemical profiles conducted on 12 wells with spacing measurement of 0 25 m show that the water temperature is around 12 to 13 c with a vertical gradient of 0 13 c m from 6 to 9 m the ph of the water is quite homogeneous between 6 and 7 5 the redox potential fluctuates between 60 and 180 mv which are high values the absence of oxygen in groundwater is confirming the anaerobic conditions of the medium which is also an index of intense process of hydrocarbon biodegradation sinke et al 1998 abbas et al 2018 the electrical conductivity of the water is quite homogeneous in the wells with values between 70 and 90 ms m all of these water measurements were realized in wells without floating lnapl light non aqueous phase liquid layer and broadly indicate that the area is polluted with hydrocarbons and ongoing biodegradation processes that are boosted by the tide fluctuations mercer and cohen 1990 sims et al 1993 lee et al 2001 yadav and hassanizadeh 2011 the chromatographic analysis of lnapl indicates a partial degradation of gasoline diesel mixture moreover the contaminant is approximately composed of 50 of light compounds 10 carbon atoms and the tph total petroleum hydrocarbon analyses confirm that the aliphatic fraction represents 80 of the total mass their dynamic viscosity is around 5 mm2 s while their density is varying between 820 and 830 kg m3 3 geoelectrical investigations for the geophysical characterization we performed 12 electrical resistivity profiles to get an idea on the main heterogeneity in the shallow aquifer theses 2d profiles have been made with a syscal pro resistivity meter and electrodes placed according to the wenner schema with two meters as inter electrodes distance the stack values were fixed between 4 and 8 with a vab maximum of 800 mv and an injection time of 500 ms the distance between the profiles is about 10 m with 5 profiles oriented north south and 7 profiles into east west direction fig 1 the north south profile were 46 to 64 m long and the east west profiles were 66 to 70 m long for a total of 1811 quadrupoles inverted the processing of the apparent electrical resistivity has been done in 3d using ert lab64 software developed by multi phase technologies and geostudi astier this software relies on a quasi newton inversion algorithm with a smoothness constraint and a forward problem solved by finite elements technique with a 0 5 m mesh for a total of 1 909 476 elements labrecque et al 1996 for the boundary conditions we used an insulating condition at the air ground interface and zero potential on the rest of the boundaries the noisy data have been processed with a robust weighting algorithm based on data variance iterative reweighting labrecque et al 1996 morelli and labrecque 1996 most of these noises are due to the bad contacts between soil and electrodes in some places covered by a 20 cm concrete layer to improve the contact we placed the electrodes in 30 cm hammer drilled holes the results of the 3d inversion of the 12 ert profiles are obtained after 7 iterations with a final rmse of 0 67 ω m we only present the distribution of the resistivity in the saturated and capillary zones of the alluvial layer from 5 to 10 m depth which will be used in a second step as a guide to predict the hydraulic conductivity field as shown on the figs 2 and 3 this spatial distribution of the resistivity is ranging from 5 to 180 ω m on the 3d model we can distinguish three anomalies with high relative resistivity 35 ω m and two anomalies with quite low resistivity 15 ω m the 2d profile presented in fig 3 highlight these heterogeneities by crossing most of the heterogeneities if we compare the 3d model and one oip optical image profiler profiles they are in the same range of value fig 3 this is because the 3d model integrates larger volumes of soil while the oip profiles are very local with pores scale resistivity measurements indeed those investigations methods are quite different both graphs show an increasing trend with depth from 6 to 8 m and then a higher value above 8 m in link to the altered chalk thus we can say that the 3d model confirms and completes the very local information from oip profiles and water electrical conductivity of the wells we suspect that this slight heterogeneity in electrical resistivity may be associated with the three dimensional distribution of the flint blocks that have centimeter sizes that affects the hydrodynamic features of the aquifer in the oip profiles the presence of flints is also at the origin of the increase in local resistivity fig 4 4 hydrogeological investigations we dedicate this section to the hydraulic tomography of the alluvial aquifer which is considered here as a semi confined aquifer under tide influence this characterization is based on a joint inversion of the hydraulic responses recorded in 13 wells during two quasi static pumping tests conducted on the wells p16 12 m3 h and p13 11 25 m3 h these hydraulic responses are also impacted with tide fluctuations and therefore require a separation of the natural and anthropogenic responses to keep only the pumping responses for the tridimensional reconstruction of the spatial heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity field the approach used for such processing is developed in the next section 4 1 data processing in this study we will have to remove the tidal component because it has a significant impact on the hydraulic head variations in comparison to the pumping effect in fact daily tides have an amplitude of about 20 cm while the drawdown response is under the centimeter scale to facilitate the removal of this impact we decided to start the pumping test during the less curved part of the tide at its mid period of 6h10 for a pumping duration of 3 h such a configuration makes it easier to process hydraulic data compared to a pumping at high or low tide momentum the data processing relies on the reconstruction of the natural tide signature by fitting the data recorded before the pumping and after the recovery by predicting the coefficients of the general fourier function with 5 terms which has following form 1 f t 0 n a n cos n t w b n sin n t w with n indicating the number of terms of the general function set here as n 5 this equation is formulated as a sum of cosines and sines functions with 5 coefficients that will be determined by fitting the hydraulic data to illustrate the effectiveness of the technique we applied it on a theoretical case in which the groundwater flow equation was solved in a comsol multiphysics model with a 20 cm oscillatory tidal signal with a period of 12 h20 imposed on the boundary condition and a pumping test defined as a punctual source term for a duration of 3 h the model has a homogenous hydraulic conductivity of 10 4 m s and the same size as the study zone the curve fitting technique allows to distinguish the 21 mm drawdown of the hydraulic level successfully as it is shown in the fig 5 a and b in order to extract a steady state drawdown value for the inversion dataset we calculate the drawdown mean values in the last 5 min before cutting off the power of the pump the inversion will be made with these mean values 4 2 inversion process we devoted this section to the introduction of the inverse theory used to interpret the hydraulic data related to the pumping tests for inferring the hydraulic conductivity field in 3d the wells are fully screened in the alluvial aquifer thus it does not provide three dimensional information on hydraulic head variations especially on the z axis which remains an integrative data on the entire thickness of the aquifer to fill the gap in vertical data we used the ert as a source of information to delineate the main heterogeneity of the field which could correspond to variations in the hydraulic parameters the values for the selections of the 8 electro facies are calculated on the basis of 7 quantiles so that each electro facies have the same size table 1 in other words we assume that the number and shape of electro facies recovered in ert remain the same in hydro facies so that there is a correlation between the contrast gradient of electrical reactivity and hydraulic conductivity this hypothesis is based on the fact that the electrical conductivity of the water in the study site is almost homogeneous this strategy permits to guide the inversion to avoid the non unicity of the solution and to reduce the number of parameters to estimate the limited number of unknown parameters pushed us to opt for a stochastic inversion by using a mcmc algorithm the inverse problem is formulated in a bayesian framework in which the posteriori probability function π m d is defined as a combination of the drawdown data of the pumping test and a priori information on the hydraulic conductivity model to be predicted during the inverse process tarantola 2005 π m p h obs m p 0 m with p h obs m 1 2 π n det γ h 1 2 exp 1 2 f m h obs t γ h 1 f m h obs 2 p 0 m 1 2 π m det γ m 1 2 exp 1 2 m m prior t γ m 1 m m prior where p 0 m denotes the prior probability function used as a complementary information to constrain the parameter m in the prediction process of the model γ m is the covariance matrix representing the degrees of confidence to the prior values m prior p h obs m denotes the likelihood function in which a forward operator f m is solved numerically to compute the effectiveness of the proposed model m to fit the hydraulic data h obs γ h is a diagonal covariance matrix to include uncertainties on the observed data this inversion operator is based on a numerical resolution of the diffusion equation with darcy groundwater flow in porous media 3 1 0 m h q in 3d h 0 m at γ d where h denotes the hydraulic head in meter q is the hydraulic flux m3 s and m is the vector that contains the logarithms of the hydraulic conductivity k in m s we solve the diffusion equation on a pyramidal finite element mesh with comsol multiphysics the meshing is defined as extremely fine with an automatic refinement around the boreholes dirichlet boundary conditions were imposed on the boundaries which were placed at 500 m from the investigated zone the investigation zone is 60 by 60 m with the hydraulic conductivity of the buffer fixed to 10 2 1 m s the stochastic inversion was led with a large constraint on the hydraulic conductivity in which the interval of sampling was fixed between 10 8 and 1 to seek the best model that can reconstruct the hydraulic data and satisfy the constraints imposed by the prior information we applied a stochastic approach which is based on a mcmc algorithm this algorithm consists in a generation of an important number of random models using a proposal function it then tests their efficiency in terms of data matching and toward the prior models by computing the posterior probability function the models tested with high probabilities are selected otherwise they are rejected the implementation of such approach does not imply any derivative computation of the forward problem as it is the case in deterministic algorithms which facilitates the implementation of such algorithm however their efficiency depends on the choice of the proposal density function that controls the random walk from one last selected model to the generation of another new one in this paper we used adaptive metropolis am algorithm in which the covariance of gaussian proposal function is iteratively adapted from the previous models in order to improve the strategy of the sampling as following haario et al 2001 4 c i s d c o v x 0 x 1 x i 1 s d ε i where sd 2 4 2 d is a scaling coefficient with d the size of the unknown parameter to estimate ɛ is a small positive number and i is the identity matrix the model proposed with the proposal function will be accepted or rejected according to this following probability 5 α m i 1 m p m i n 1 π m p π m i 1 where π x is the unscaled density m p is the tested candidate when the i 1 previous candidate has already been tested in the end these acceptance criteria guarantee the selection of models that present high quality in the fitting of the piezometric data in our case 10 000 iterations were carried out and the inverse result is the mean of the last 25 selected models 5 results the result is presented as a 3d model in terms of logarithm values of hydraulic conductivity k in m s in fig 6 the inversion has been made on the mean drawdown value determined during the last 5 min of pumping the means minimum and maximum value of these last 5 min of pumping are shown on the fig 7 the root mean square error rmse of the inversion between all the measured and simulated drawdown is 5 23 mm the coefficient of determination is almost perfect as the weight of the pumping well drawdown is much more important compared to the small drawdown in the observation wells and the slope of the linear regression is near one a 0 9995 these values have a weaker fit if we focused on the observation wells drawdowns but it can be related to the greater uncertainty about the actual value of the smallest drawdown indeed if we only focused on the observation wells drawdown the r2 is about 0 73 with a slope near 0 9 a 0 908 the rsme becomes a bit bigger 5 37 mm the small drawdowns are related to the low hydraulic connectivity the large distance between observation and pumped wells and the possibility that the pumped water is mainly coming from the underlying aquifer in the altered chalk the 3d model reveals a smooth spatial heterogeneity with a variation of only 2 orders of magnitude the inverted values of hydraulic conductivity range between 10 3 and 10 5 m s as detailed in the table 2 are realist and in agreement with the laboratory results range between 4 76 10 4 to 2 31 10 5 m s there is an order of magnitude of difference between the lab result and our model this can be linked to the size of the lab sample which tends to decrease the measured value geotechnical frontiers et al 2017 overall the aquifer can be considered as a permeable formation linked to the presence of the gravels and flint blocks that have been revealed by their resistive signature in the electrical resistivity survey as it is confirmed by the results of the comparisons between the high electro facies 5 8 that have relative higher hydraulic conductivities see table 2 table 3 in order to discuss further 3d hydraulic model obtained by stochastic inversion from the 3d electrical resistivity model it was decided to perform trials of stepwise pumping in different wells in the study area these pumping have been realized with an electric variable speed drive and a small pump this device allows for stepwise pumping by varying the frequency i e the flow rate of the pump from 0 6 to 6 1 m3 h every pumping lasted about 30 min and 2 to 4 flow rates were tested depending on the observed drawdown in the pumped well the drawdown data have been treated as presented in data processing section in order to

5436,hydraulic characterization of a contaminated aquifer is an important step in depollution processes because its hydraulic parameters control the choice and efficiency of the depollution protocol to be adopted the characterization presented in this article uses a 3d electrical resistivity imagery to identify the spatial heterogeneities of a contaminated aquifer under tidal influence indeed we use a 3d resistivity model as a source of information to parameterize the reconstruction of the hydraulic conductivity in 3d by inverting a set of hydraulic data acquired on the 13 monitored wells in response to two pumping tests this parameterization relies on the identification of the main electro facies in the resistivity model in the saturated zone which will then be exploited in the hydraulic characterization to find their corresponding hydraulic conductivity values this strategy of parameterization permits to reduce the number of the hydraulic conductivity parameters to be identified to eight hydro facies with a stochastic algorithm called the adaptive metropolis algorithm the hydraulic responses associated with the pumping tests are obtained once the natural effect of the tide is removed the hydraulic conductivity model has permitted to highlight the main heterogeneities in the aquifer in which the hydraulic conductivity is ranging between 10 4 6 10 2 8 m s this range of variability reveals the permeable and smooth character of the aquifer in which the presence of coarse sand and flint blocks enhances its transmissivity these permeable zones are electrically identified by resistive anomalies in the 3d electrical resistivity imaging keywords electrical resistivity tomogram hydraulic tomography hydrogeophysics inversion inverse problem stochastic inversion 1 introduction the strong industrialization of the last century has led to an increase of contaminated sites that currently represent a real threat to the health of the population and the quality of the ecosystem air water soil flora and fauna to address these environmental issues several remediation technologies have been developed in order to remove contaminants or to reduce their spread in water resources among them we cite natural attenuation in situ thermal desorption in situ chemical oxidation or reduction hydraulic containment and pump and treat yeung 2010 zhang et al 2017 ossai et al 2020 however their applicability and effectiveness still strongly depend on the dynamic of the aquifer in other terms to the hydraulic conductivity of soils the groundwater flow and the migration of contaminant plumes are conditioned by the spatial heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity which can be sharply ranged even on a small scale and within the same geological formations in addition the brownfields hydraulic conductivity field may be affected by the presence of concrete foundations buried in the shallow aquifers in general the characterization of the hydraulic conductivity is performed by means of traditional pumping tests in which the analytical formulations of the groundwater flow equations either in the transient or steady states are used to interpret the piezometric responses to water extraction in order to derive an average value of the hydraulic transmissivity theis 1935 hantush 1961 the permeabilities can be progressively estimated with a permeameter test carried out on soils sampled during drilling operations however both approaches neglect the heterogeneity of the hydraulic properties in the aquifer which leads to an inaccurate and incomplete understanding of contaminants transport during the remediation process the hydraulic tomography tool appears as an interesting and relevant option to deals with the heterogeneous aquifers through a conjoint interpretation of a piezometric dataset associated with multiple pumping tests conducted successively at various wells yeh et al 1996 kitanidis 1997 le borgne et al 2004 li et al 2008 the tomogram of the hydraulic conductivity field provided from a hydraulic tomography technique is the result of an optimization algorithm also called inverse algorithm in which this field was chosen thanks to its ability to match the observed drawdown data inversion algorithms can be deterministic or stochastic they both rely on an iterative process in which the groundwater flow equations forward problem are solved numerically at each iteration in order to evaluate the mismatch between the observed and predicted hydraulic drawdown huang et al 2004 however these inverse algorithms do not guarantee to get a unique solution for the following reasons i the limited number of the hydraulic data to capture overall unknown parameters zhou et al 2016 ii the strong sensitivity of the solution to the data noise ramos et al 2017 iii the numerical uncertainty of mathematical models that cannot describe all the physical mechanisms involved in the experiment to which it adds the numerical imperfections related to the numerical tool e g finite difference and finite element used to solve the groundwater equation berg and illman 2015 hochstetler et al 2016 over the last few decades several efforts have been made to deal with the ill posedness and the uncertainties of the inverse problem via the incorporation of complementary information on the unknown parameters in order to generate a realistic model zhou et al 2014 this additional information is referred as soft data or a priori model and can be deduced from various ways such as geological characterization e g

hydraulic parameters bohling et al 2007 applied cross well georadar tomography to delineate the shape of the main hydro facies in which hydraulic conductivity values were then determined by analyzing pumping test data gpr velocity tomograms were used to support tracer test data for the prediction of hydraulic properties dafflon and barrash 2012 jardani et al 2013 combined the ert self potential and salt concentration data acquired during a salt tracer test to map the hydraulic conductivity field pollock and cirpka 2010 coupled hydrogeophysical inversion to synthetic salt tracer experiments doetsch et al 2010 proposed cross gradient joint inversion of crosshole seismic ert and radar to retrieve the main geological units of a fluvial aquifer and their petrophysical parameters as porosity gernez et al 2019 linked the anisotropic patterns of the inverted electrical resistivity to the spatial distribution of the hydraulic conductivity in an alluvial aquifer in this paper we apply the zonation inversion methodology to image the spatial variability of the hydraulic conductivity field this approach consists of two steps first we delineate in 3d the main geological structures of a contaminated aquifer by using ert in the second step we predict the hydraulic conductivity of these structures by inverting the pumping tests data recorded in 13 wells with a markov chain monte carlo based algorithm 2 description of the experimental study site in this manuscript a hydrodynamic characterization is performed on an experimental site located in a former refinery within a shallow alluvial aquifer contaminated by hydrocarbons the industrial activities on the site have begun in 1929 and have been stopped in april 2013 the set up of this experimental site aims to understand the degree of heterogeneity in the soil of the former refinery and the nature of the contaminants in order to experiment various remediation protocols for that reason 13 piezometers were implanted on a small area 60 m 60 m to record the hydraulic fluctuations and to identify the degree and type of contamination in the aquifer fig 1 the site is mostly covered by an anthropogenic layer of gravel and in some places of asphalt and concrete this layer covers an alluvial formation composed mainly of fine sand 0 2 mm and medium sand 1 mm from 1 to 5 m depth and medium 1 mm to gravel sands 2 mm between 5 and 8 m depth preliminary geological investigations conducted on the site revealed highly heterogeneous materials constituting the aquifer the laboratory analysis performed on three core samples indicate a quite constant porosity from 28 9 to 24 6 between 7 2 and 10 5 m a hydraulic conductivity varying between 2 31 10 5 to 6 87 10 4 m s and a low quantity of clay this alluvial terrace relies on an altered chalk formation below 8 5 m and both aquifers are hydraulically connected to the seine river which is under tidal influence jardani et al 2012 consequently the water table in the alluvial aquifer oscillates with time varying amplitude the vertical geochemical profiles conducted on 12 wells with spacing measurement of 0 25 m show that the water temperature is around 12 to 13 c with a vertical gradient of 0 13 c m from 6 to 9 m the ph of the water is quite homogeneous between 6 and 7 5 the redox potential fluctuates between 60 and 180 mv which are high values the absence of oxygen in groundwater is confirming the anaerobic conditions of the medium which is also an index of intense process of hydrocarbon biodegradation sinke et al 1998 abbas et al 2018 the electrical conductivity of the water is quite homogeneous in the wells with values between 70 and 90 ms m all of these water measurements were realized in wells without floating lnapl light non aqueous phase liquid layer and broadly indicate that the area is polluted with hydrocarbons and ongoing biodegradation processes that are boosted by the tide fluctuations mercer and cohen 1990 sims et al 1993 lee et al 2001 yadav and hassanizadeh 2011 the chromatographic analysis of lnapl indicates a partial degradation of gasoline diesel mixture moreover the contaminant is approximately composed of 50 of light compounds 10 carbon atoms and the tph total petroleum hydrocarbon analyses confirm that the aliphatic fraction represents 80 of the total mass their dynamic viscosity is around 5 mm2 s while their density is varying between 820 and 830 kg m3 3 geoelectrical investigations for the geophysical characterization we performed 12 electrical resistivity profiles to get an idea on the main heterogeneity in the shallow aquifer theses 2d profiles have been made with a syscal pro resistivity meter and electrodes placed according to the wenner schema with two meters as inter electrodes distance the stack values were fixed between 4 and 8 with a vab maximum of 800 mv and an injection time of 500 ms the distance between the profiles is about 10 m with 5 profiles oriented north south and 7 profiles into east west direction fig 1 the north south profile were 46 to 64 m long and the east west profiles were 66 to 70 m long for a total of 1811 quadrupoles inverted the processing of the apparent electrical resistivity has been done in 3d using ert lab64 software developed by multi phase technologies and geostudi astier this software relies on a quasi newton inversion algorithm with a smoothness constraint and a forward problem solved by finite elements technique with a 0 5 m mesh for a total of 1 909 476 elements labrecque et al 1996 for the boundary conditions we used an insulating condition at the air ground interface and zero potential on the rest of the boundaries the noisy data have been processed with a robust weighting algorithm based on data variance iterative reweighting labrecque et al 1996 morelli and labrecque 1996 most of these noises are due to the bad contacts between soil and electrodes in some places covered by a 20 cm concrete layer to improve the contact we placed the electrodes in 30 cm hammer drilled holes the results of the 3d inversion of the 12 ert profiles are obtained after 7 iterations with a final rmse of 0 67 ω m we only present the distribution of the resistivity in the saturated and capillary zones of the alluvial layer from 5 to 10 m depth which will be used in a second step as a guide to predict the hydraulic conductivity field as shown on the figs 2 and 3 this spatial distribution of the resistivity is ranging from 5 to 180 ω m on the 3d model we can distinguish three anomalies with high relative resistivity 35 ω m and two anomalies with quite low resistivity 15 ω m the 2d profile presented in fig 3 highlight these heterogeneities by crossing most of the heterogeneities if we compare the 3d model and one oip optical image profiler profiles they are in the same range of value fig 3 this is because the 3d model integrates larger volumes of soil while the oip profiles are very local with pores scale resistivity measurements indeed those investigations methods are quite different both graphs show an increasing trend with depth from 6 to 8 m and then a higher value above 8 m in link to the altered chalk thus we can say that the 3d model confirms and completes the very local information from oip profiles and water electrical conductivity of the wells we suspect that this slight heterogeneity in electrical resistivity may be associated with the three dimensional distribution of the flint blocks that have centimeter sizes that affects the hydrodynamic features of the aquifer in the oip profiles the presence of flints is also at the origin of the increase in local resistivity fig 4 4 hydrogeological investigations we dedicate this section to the hydraulic tomography of the alluvial aquifer which is considered here as a semi confined aquifer under tide influence this characterization is based on a joint inversion of the hydraulic responses recorded in 13 wells during two quasi static pumping tests conducted on the wells p16 12 m3 h and p13 11 25 m3 h these hydraulic responses are also impacted with tide fluctuations and therefore require a separation of the natural and anthropogenic responses to keep only the pumping responses for the tridimensional reconstruction of the spatial heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity field the approach used for such processing is developed in the next section 4 1 data processing in this study we will have to remove the tidal component because it has a significant impact on the hydraulic head variations in comparison to the pumping effect in fact daily tides have an amplitude of about 20 cm while the drawdown response is under the centimeter scale to facilitate the removal of this impact we decided to start the pumping test during the less curved part of the tide at its mid period of 6h10 for a pumping duration of 3 h such a configuration makes it easier to process hydraulic data compared to a pumping at high or low tide momentum the data processing relies on the reconstruction of the natural tide signature by fitting the data recorded before the pumping and after the recovery by predicting the coefficients of the general fourier function with 5 terms which has following form 1 f t 0 n a n cos n t w b n sin n t w with n indicating the number of terms of the general function set here as n 5 this equation is formulated as a sum of cosines and sines functions with 5 coefficients that will be determined by fitting the hydraulic data to illustrate the effectiveness of the technique we applied it on a theoretical case in which the groundwater flow equation was solved in a comsol multiphysics model with a 20 cm oscillatory tidal signal with a period of 12 h20 imposed on the boundary condition and a pumping test defined as a punctual source term for a duration of 3 h the model has a homogenous hydraulic conductivity of 10 4 m s and the same size as the study zone the curve fitting technique allows to distinguish the 21 mm drawdown of the hydraulic level successfully as it is shown in the fig 5 a and b in order to extract a steady state drawdown value for the inversion dataset we calculate the drawdown mean values in the last 5 min before cutting off the power of the pump the inversion will be made with these mean values 4 2 inversion process we devoted this section to the introduction of the inverse theory used to interpret the hydraulic data related to the pumping tests for inferring the hydraulic conductivity field in 3d the wells are fully screened in the alluvial aquifer thus it does not provide three dimensional information on hydraulic head variations especially on the z axis which remains an integrative data on the entire thickness of the aquifer to fill the gap in vertical data we used the ert as a source of information to delineate the main heterogeneity of the field which could correspond to variations in the hydraulic parameters the values for the selections of the 8 electro facies are calculated on the basis of 7 quantiles so that each electro facies have the same size table 1 in other words we assume that the number and shape of electro facies recovered in ert remain the same in hydro facies so that there is a correlation between the contrast gradient of electrical reactivity and hydraulic conductivity this hypothesis is based on the fact that the electrical conductivity of the water in the study site is almost homogeneous this strategy permits to guide the inversion to avoid the non unicity of the solution and to reduce the number of parameters to estimate the limited number of unknown parameters pushed us to opt for a stochastic inversion by using a mcmc algorithm the inverse problem is formulated in a bayesian framework in which the posteriori probability function π m d is defined as a combination of the drawdown data of the pumping test and a priori information on the hydraulic conductivity model to be predicted during the inverse process tarantola 2005 π m p h obs m p 0 m with p h obs m 1 2 π n det γ h 1 2 exp 1 2 f m h obs t γ h 1 f m h obs 2 p 0 m 1 2 π m det γ m 1 2 exp 1 2 m m prior t γ m 1 m m prior where p 0 m denotes the prior probability function used as a complementary information to constrain the parameter m in the prediction process of the model γ m is the covariance matrix representing the degrees of confidence to the prior values m prior p h obs m denotes the likelihood function in which a forward operator f m is solved numerically to compute the effectiveness of the proposed model m to fit the hydraulic data h obs γ h is a diagonal covariance matrix to include uncertainties on the observed data this inversion operator is based on a numerical resolution of the diffusion equation with darcy groundwater flow in porous media 3 1 0 m h q in 3d h 0 m at γ d where h denotes the hydraulic head in meter q is the hydraulic flux m3 s and m is the vector that contains the logarithms of the hydraulic conductivity k in m s we solve the diffusion equation on a pyramidal finite element mesh with comsol multiphysics the meshing is defined as extremely fine with an automatic refinement around the boreholes dirichlet boundary conditions were imposed on the boundaries which were placed at 500 m from the investigated zone the investigation zone is 60 by 60 m with the hydraulic conductivity of the buffer fixed to 10 2 1 m s the stochastic inversion was led with a large constraint on the hydraulic conductivity in which the interval of sampling was fixed between 10 8 and 1 to seek the best model that can reconstruct the hydraulic data and satisfy the constraints imposed by the prior information we applied a stochastic approach which is based on a mcmc algorithm this algorithm consists in a generation of an important number of random models using a proposal function it then tests their efficiency in terms of data matching and toward the prior models by computing the posterior probability function the models tested with high probabilities are selected otherwise they are rejected the implementation of such approach does not imply any derivative computation of the forward problem as it is the case in deterministic algorithms which facilitates the implementation of such algorithm however their efficiency depends on the choice of the proposal density function that controls the random walk from one last selected model to the generation of another new one in this paper we used adaptive metropolis am algorithm in which the covariance of gaussian proposal function is iteratively adapted from the previous models in order to improve the strategy of the sampling as following haario et al 2001 4 c i s d c o v x 0 x 1 x i 1 s d ε i where sd 2 4 2 d is a scaling coefficient with d the size of the unknown parameter to estimate ɛ is a small positive number and i is the identity matrix the model proposed with the proposal function will be accepted or rejected according to this following probability 5 α m i 1 m p m i n 1 π m p π m i 1 where π x is the unscaled density m p is the tested candidate when the i 1 previous candidate has already been tested in the end these acceptance criteria guarantee the selection of models that present high quality in the fitting of the piezometric data in our case 10 000 iterations were carried out and the inverse result is the mean of the last 25 selected models 5 results the result is presented as a 3d model in terms of logarithm values of hydraulic conductivity k in m s in fig 6 the inversion has been made on the mean drawdown value determined during the last 5 min of pumping the means minimum and maximum value of these last 5 min of pumping are shown on the fig 7 the root mean square error rmse of the inversion between all the measured and simulated drawdown is 5 23 mm the coefficient of determination is almost perfect as the weight of the pumping well drawdown is much more important compared to the small drawdown in the observation wells and the slope of the linear regression is near one a 0 9995 these values have a weaker fit if we focused on the observation wells drawdowns but it can be related to the greater uncertainty about the actual value of the smallest drawdown indeed if we only focused on the observation wells drawdown the r2 is about 0 73 with a slope near 0 9 a 0 908 the rsme becomes a bit bigger 5 37 mm the small drawdowns are related to the low hydraulic connectivity the large distance between observation and pumped wells and the possibility that the pumped water is mainly coming from the underlying aquifer in the altered chalk the 3d model reveals a smooth spatial heterogeneity with a variation of only 2 orders of magnitude the inverted values of hydraulic conductivity range between 10 3 and 10 5 m s as detailed in the table 2 are realist and in agreement with the laboratory results range between 4 76 10 4 to 2 31 10 5 m s there is an order of magnitude of difference between the lab result and our model this can be linked to the size of the lab sample which tends to decrease the measured value geotechnical frontiers et al 2017 overall the aquifer can be considered as a permeable formation linked to the presence of the gravels and flint blocks that have been revealed by their resistive signature in the electrical resistivity survey as it is confirmed by the results of the comparisons between the high electro facies 5 8 that have relative higher hydraulic conductivities see table 2 table 3 in order to discuss further 3d hydraulic model obtained by stochastic inversion from the 3d electrical resistivity model it was decided to perform trials of stepwise pumping in different wells in the study area these pumping have been realized with an electric variable speed drive and a small pump this device allows for stepwise pumping by varying the frequency i e the flow rate of the pump from 0 6 to 6 1 m3 h every pumping lasted about 30 min and 2 to 4 flow rates were tested depending on the observed drawdown in the pumped well the drawdown data have been treated as presented in data processing section in order to subtract the tide signal and then implemented in a software to treat stepwise pumping ouaip created by the french institution bureau des ressources géologiques et minières brgm we use the theis function to simulate the pumping and the software provides an estimation of the transmissivity t m2 s and storativity required to fit the stepwise pumping drawdowns there is an adjustment coefficient

integration of the different hydraulic conductivity k of the 3d model on the thickness of the aquifer to get a transmissivity value at the localization of the different wells if the p11 transmissivity from the pumping is one order of magnitude smaller compared to the value found in the model the three other values are convergent and validate the 3d stochastic inversion of the hydraulic model 6

5437,nonaqueous phase liquids napls usually move through the vadose zone not in a homogeneous spread manner but in the form of disconnected blobs and they remain in the pores of porous media a major challenge in remediating an napl contaminated site is to detect and delineate the distribution of napls geophysical technologies could act as investigating methods for sites with limited resources and time constraints based on the principle of magnetometric resistivity mmr method in this study we applied an electric current flow pattern and its resulting magnetic field to develop a new application for contaminated site investigation the physical phenomena about the magnetic distribution the flow pattern of electric current and the influence of different media in packed sand were observed via sandbox experiments a field test was performed at a light napl lnapl contaminated site by combining the magnetic field survey and a soil sample analysis two potential contaminated zones were determined according to the specific characteristics of the contour image plotted according to the magnetic field intensity collected on the ground the quantitative results of the total petroleum hydrocarbons tphs of 18 soil samples were used to verify the results of the magnetic field survey the comparison results revealed that we obtained a high accuracy of 92 9 in the field test which indicated that this technology could be used to investigate lnapl contaminated sites moreover two phenomena the scale effect led to poor resolution and the behavior of flow pattern disturbance distorted the survey images were observed in both the sandbox experiment and the field test keywords noninvasive survey technology current density magnetic intensity lnapls sandbox experiment field test 1 introduction contamination of groundwater and soil by nonaqueous phase liquids napls happens frequently li et al 2018 sheng et al 2018 which has been of great concern for environmental preservation napls are generally divided into two classes based on their densities light nonaqueous phase liquids lnapls and dense nonaqueous phase liquids dnapls lnapls are hydrophobic liquid organic chemicals that are immiscible with water such as crude oil and most refined products gasoline benzene toluene and xylene when lnapls are spilled they infiltrate the groundwater and remain on top of the water table which may potentially affect receptors humans flora and fauna abbas et al 2017 baawain et al 2018 caetano et al 2017 gainer et al 2018 mohanakrishna et al 2018 when an aquifer is contaminated by lnapls the most urgent and important thing to do is to remove these contaminants from the aquifer as soon as possible a major challenge in remediating subsurface contamination by lnapls is to detect and delineate their distribution a typical investigation method is to utilize point sampling with soil cores or monitoring wells cost is the primary disadvantage of the point sampling method because of the expenses associated with drilling sampling quantitative analysis and well installation in addition this method may miss contaminants in areas where the well data are not available or it may create new contaminant pathways cohen and mercer 1993 hunkeler et al 1997 newell and ross 1992 pankow and cherry 1996 moreover groundwater wells are not consistent in sampling separate phase liquids because of well degradation and capillary effects which may prevent napls from entering a well farr et al 1990 lenhard and parker 1990 newell et al 1995 in addition to the traditional sampling method in situ penetration tests have been widely used by the geotechnical community for site investigation penetration tests common to u s practice include the standard penetration test spt and cone penetration test cpt both tests are normally carried out in boreholes and usually consist of techniques that use a direct push apparatus to deliver the sensor probes and sampling and analytical devices to the depths of interest it is a rapid and cost effective method for site investigation however most push in devices are not suitable for a wide range of ground conditions hence this penetration method cannot be used in gravel or highly consolidated soils kram et al 2001 usda 2012 further data are unreliable in unsaturated conditions particularly in clayey soils usda 2012 the soil gas survey method provides valuable information on the extent of napl source zones in unsaturated zones and it is usually used as a screening method because of its convenience and low cost wilson 1997 however this method is limited in dealing with volatile napl only sites schubert et al 2005 in addition it does not enable napl quantification in the source zone höhener and surbeck 2004 to overcome such technical problems several innovative tracer based methods have been introduced and evaluated under laboratory and field conditions in the last two decades partitioning and interfacial tracers have been assessed to evaluate their ability to estimate both the location and the amount and distribution of napls in the vadose zone annable et al 1998 brusseau et al 2003 deeds et al 1999 jin et al 1995 mariner et al 1999 werner 2002 werner and höhener 2002 however this method requires the injection of synthetic chemicals as tracers which often incur high costs and are associated with additional environmental concerns therefore several authors have suggested the use of radon 222rn as an environmental tracer for the localization and assessment of residual napl contamination in both soil höhener and surbeck 2004 schubert et al 2002 2005 and aquifers davis et al 2002 davis et al 2005 hunkeler et al 1997 semprini et al 2000 some studies have reported the migration of 222rn in the vadose zone kristensen et al 2010 minkin 2002 minkin and shapovalov 2016 richon et al 2011 wang et al 2019 yakovleva and parovik 2010 and 222rn partitioning coefficients between air water and napls in closed systems schubert et al 2007a moreover some reports showed that the 222rn tracer method was effective for delineating napl contaminated source zones after conducting field tests in lnapl contaminated sites barbosa et al 2014 garcía gonzález et al 2008 schubert et al 2007b still its application is not without restrictions problems may occur due to mineralogical heterogeneity of the aquifer matrix preferential flow paths bypassing the napl source zone and napl aging thus altering the partition coefficient between napl and water or soil gas schubert 2015 the methods of site investigation mentioned above have mainly relied on a sparse network of intrusive drilling and sampling approaches which can only provide limited spatial and temporal resolution griffin and watson 2002 peter et al 2008 also sampling of contaminant concentration from heterogeneous soil will not provide an accurate means of assessing the total contaminant mass retained in the soil matrix shapiro et al 2019 for this reason a variety of noninvasive geophysical methods have been proposed for the detection of napls in the shallow subsurface for example it was reported that ground penetrating radar gpr can survey the napl leakage distribution cassidy 2007 lopes de castro and branco 2003 but some researchers also warned that lnapl contaminant detection using gpr is difficult and often unrealistic in a low humidity environment bertolla et al 2014 golebiowski et al 2010 frequency domain electromagnetic fdem analysis initially produces a primary electromagnetic field and this primary field induces a current in the aquifer the induced current produces a secondary electromagnetic field and the receiver coil records the intensity of the secondary electromagnetic field to determine the conductivity of the materials in the aquifer fdem is sensitive to metal but not to napls and so it has shown its usefulness in investigating saline intrusion goebel et al 2019 and the actual coverage of a landfill wang et al 2015 but only a few works have reported on the investigation of napl contaminated sites nobes et al 2000 pettersson and nobes 2003 nuclear magnetic resonance nmr is classified as a tool of site characterization but it is not a site survey tool simpson et al 2018 it is widely used as a robust tool for characterizing components in complex mixtures in general nmr is intrinsically quantitative and nonbiased toward different compound classes and it provides intrinsic structural information on the components of contaminated soil fallaise et al 2019 among the geophysical methods low frequency geoelectrical methods are most widely used and include mainly self potential resistivity and induced polarization techniques revil et al 2012 the self potential sp method is a passive geophysical method in which the electrical potential distribution is mapped using a set of nonpolarizing electrodes the sp value is directly sensitive to the chemistry of both the pore water and the pore water mineral interface it has been applied to monitoring contaminant plumes atekwana et al 2004 giampaolo et al 2014 minsley et al 2007 naudet and revil 2005 werkema et al 2003 żogała et al 2012 however contaminant plumes rich in organic matter do not always show large sp anomalies because of their lack of redox processes revil et al 2012 electrical resistivity tomography ert is a popular geophysical subsurface imaging technique because of its sensitivity to relative changes in the saturation of the water phase binley and kemna 2005 and its wettability revil et al 2011 ert has been applied to monitoring soil water content lehikoinen et al 2009 saline water intrusion de franco et al 2009 and for tracer tests perri et al 2012 moreover ert has been used extensively in mapping and monitoring the contaminants in the subsurface because it can assess the spatial and temporal geoelectrical changes induced by this pollutant karaoulis et al 2011 niaounakis and halvadakis 2006 power et al 2015 slater et al 2000 soupios et al 2007a b c nevertheless the application of ert is mainly limited owing to the following three issues the first is the difficulty of static detection of the complex electrical target presented by an intricate unknown dnapl distribution in a heterogeneous unknown permeability field power et al 2013 which can produce resistivity variations that are sometimes stronger than those associated with the presence of the napls deng et al 2017 the second issue impeding ert usage on sites is the reliability of the interpretation loke et al 2013 due to the independent time lapse inversion images contaminated by the inversion artifacts karaoulis et al 2014 the third issue is that the age and degradation status of the contaminants change the groundwater chemistry the release of ions during biodegradation or mineral weathering and dissolution caused by organic acids released by bacteria can cause increased groundwater conductivity atekwana and atekwana 2010 atekwana and slater 2009 moreover some reports present that the ert have used cross borehole surveys which are not only invasive but expensive because typical borehole spacing must be on the order of a few meters coverage of a significant area can be challenging power et al 2014 induced polarization ip is a geophysical method that uses low frequency polarization mechanisms in earth materials associated with the reversible storage of electrical charges free phase napl presence in an unconfined aquifer have resulted in decreased chargeability flores orozco et al 2012 whereas in another field study high chargeability was interpreted as an indicator of lnapls in clayey sand deceuster and kaufmann 2012 however some reports have suggested that the presence of napls in water saturated soil samples generally reduces the magnitude of the ip effect chambers et al 2004 martinho et al 2006 revil et al 2011 schmutz et al 2010 but others indicated the opposite cassiani et al 2009 schmutz et al 2010 2012 titov et al 2004 thus the results of previous field and laboratory studies vary and sometimes point in opposite directions the possible reason is that biodegradation may have led to electrochemical and membrane polarization mechanisms altering the experimental results johansson et al 2015 geophysical techniques such as sp ert and ip require the installation of electrodes at the soil surface and they must be in good contact with the soil therefore invasive drilling processes are usually conducted on site because most lnapl contaminated sites have concrete paving over a soil surface if the concrete surface of a contaminated site cannot be drilled application of these geophysical methods will be limited moreover these three methods show a two dimensional 2d image of the vertical profile of the survey line although they can certainly present a three dimensional 3d image by conducting multiple survey lines this will increase the cost hence the development of some novel and effective geophysical technologies that can carry out a noninvasive survey and present an image in a different form e g a horizontal profile will be helpful in site investigations the aim of this study was to develop a new application of noninvasive technology for site investigations on the basis of the huge contrast of electrical resistivity between napls and porous media in this paper we present a method referring to the principle of magnetometric resistivity mmr with mmr a low frequency electrical current frequency 1 khz is injected in the ground between two electrodes and the resulting magnetic field is measured this method was initially proposed by jakosky jakosky 1933 then was refined by some researchers nabighian 1991a b stefanescu and nabighian 1962 with the purpose of determining the electrical conductivity of the earth edwards 1974 because mmr method is sensitive to the current that is concentrated within a conductive body mmr was usually used to explore mineral resources and abnormal structure identify preferential groundwater flow paths and detect the reservoir leakage passage edwards and howel 1976 jessop et al 2018 trevino and edwards 1979 zou et al 2019 most works were focus on the mathematical aspects of this method chen et al 2002 edwards 1974 edwards et al 1978 oppliger 1984 sripanya 2016 trevino and edwards 1979 yang et al 2018b and just few works were related to the field application edwards and howel 1976 jessop et al 2018 street 1989 in environmental field except for the computational hydro geophysical modeling of conductive solute plume kulessa et al 2002 labreque et al 2003 zhu and yang 2008 none of the studies applied mmr in a real site to investigate its contamination in this study a series of sandbox experiments were conducted first to study the flow behaviors of current in porous media and the relationship between the current and its resulting magnetic field and to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method then a field test was performed at a lnapl contaminated site to compare the results of the magnetic field survey with the soil sample analysis the main contribution of this study however lies in the comparison of the magnetic field survey results with the sample analysis data which provides an excellent basis for assessing the actual application of the electrical current and its resulting magnetic field survey for contaminated site investigations 2 fundamental conception groundwater is generally a good subsurface electrical conductor however the electrical resistivity of an aquifer is not constant it varies from 10 to 10 000 ω m normally samouëlian et al 2005 natural materials with an electrical resistivity of 0 1 106 ω m constitute groundwater systems and their surroundings the apparent resistivity of an aquifer is a function of the groundwater quality the host materials present and the hydrogeological structure when a site is contaminated by organic solvents solvents with high electrical resistivity 1010 1013 ω m in the porous media seriously influence the hydrogeological characteristics of the site and form some obviously high electrical resistivity zones according to ohm s law eq 1 the electric current i is proportional to the voltage v and inversely proportional to the resistance r it is well known that the higher the conductivity the greater the electrical current that will flow when an electric field is present this phenomenon reveals that the electric current always follows the path of least resistance 1 i v r in the case of contaminated aquifers only a little current can flow through high electrical resistivity zones because of the accumulation of solvents on the basis of this principle if we establish an electric field in the contaminated aquifer and obtain the distribution of the electric current we can probably estimate the contaminated zone of the solvents hence how to obtain the invisible distribution of the electric current in an invisible subsurface is the most important key to successfully applying this electrical physical property to the investigation of a contaminated site in physics the biot savart law is an equation describing the magnetic field generated by a constant electric current if the conductor has some thickness e g aquifer at the observation point p r position of the magnetometer as shown in fig 1 the magnetic field can be decomposed as edwards et al 1978 jessop et al 2018 2 b r μ 0 4 π σ e r r r r 3 d τ where r is the position of the observation point p r is the position of the integration point around the source point and d τ is a volume element around the source point σ e is the current density and μ 0 4 π 10 7 t m a is the permeability of the free space in the special case of a uniform constant current i the magnetic field b is 3 b r μ 0 i 4 π r r r r 3 d τ suppose two electrodes are installed at a depth d in a uniform earth and a distance l between two electrodes a magnetic field due to current flow in the ground can be measured at p x y 0 as shown in fig 1 hence the theoretical magnetic field intensity b at the observation point p x y 0 can be expressed as follows 4 b x x y 0 μ 0 i 4 π s l l 2 2 s 2 where s is the shortest distance from point p to the current line according to the relation between the magnetic field intensity and the electric current eq 4 the magnetic field intensity should be proportional to the current strength if the distance s is fixed furthermore it should be feasible to establish an electric field in a contaminated aquifer and measure the magnetic field intensity on the ground to estimate the range of the potential contaminated zone by using the distribution of the magnetic field intensity 3 laboratory test methods 3 1 sandbox setup a current flowing through a saturated porous medium is a 3d phenomenon experiments were performed in a glass sandbox to study the new noninvasive technology for surveying a contaminated site the sandbox was constructed from 1 cm thick glass and had the following internal dimensions 45 cm thickness 90 cm width 60 cm height as depicted in fig 2 we set the side of 45 cm as the x axis and the side of 90 cm as the y axis coordinates as shown in fig 2 two stainless steel electrodes with diameters of 1 5 cm and heights of 2 0 cm were installed at preset locations on both sides y 0 and 90 cm of the sandbox with electric cables connected to the power source because silica sand is widely used in sandbox tests deng et al 2017 kang et al 2018 power et al 2014 tsai and lin 2004 zhou and cardiff 2017 clean silica sand obtained from chin ching silica sand co ltd taiwan was used as porous media it was packed randomly in the sandbox to a height of 30 cm the silica sand consisted of grains with particle sizes ranging from 0 5 to 2 8 mm the grain size distribution was obtained by using mechanical sieve analysis as shown in fig 3 the average median grain size d 50 was 1 60 mm the coefficient of uniformity c u and the coefficient of curvature cc are the grading characteristics of the soil in this study the coefficient of uniformity cu of packed sand is found to be 1 93 by using the following equation al khafaji and andersland 1992 5 c u d 60 d 10 where d 10 is the effective size and represents grain diameters corresponding to 10 passing d 60 is the grain diameter corresponding to 60 passing the coefficient of curvature c c was found to be 1 04 by using the following equation 6 c c d 30 2 d 10 d 60 where d 30 is the grain diameter corresponding to 30 passing the physical properties of the silica sand are provided in table 1 a 0 004 m na2so4 solution with a conductivity of approximately 830 μs cm was injected slowly by peristaltic pump mfu 01 major science at a rate of approximately 200 ml min from the bottom of the sandbox to saturate the whole packed silica sand a low injection rate was used to minimize both the residual gas in the packed sand and the interference of gas which is highly electrically resistant the saturating procedure was stopped when the water surface reached the top surface of the packed sand to measure the distribution of the magnetic field above the sandbox a glass plate with 162 grids 5 cm 5 cm was placed on the top of the sandbox the value of the magnetic field intensity in every grid was measured and recorded carefully during each sandbox experiment 3 2 power source for sandbox a programmable ac power source 6605 extech electronics co was connected to two electrodes to provide a highly stable electric current with a specific frequency for the experimental sandbox before the experimental procedure the frequency of the output ac current was determined magnetic fields with frequency ranges of 1 1000 hz could be detected and were captured by the measurement system by way of a blank scan the best frequency with the lowest background signal was selected for use in our experiments to avoid the possible interference from the other ac currents or electric motors 3 3 measurement system the measurement system was designed to measure the magnetic field intensity generated by the ac electric current of the set frequency flowing in the sandbox system hence this system included a three axis magnetic field sensor em 2 elisha technology co a data acquisition device ni 9230 national instruments and a tablet with data calculation and analysis software ngst elisha technology co the noise of the magnetic field sensor used in the study was less than 0 0002 mg and an analog signal was exported to the data acquisition device by a connecting cable the analog signal was converted into a digital signal and transferred to the tablet to perform the analysis the method detection limit mdl and limit of quantitation loq of this measurement system were 0 0003 mg and 0 0012 mg respectively accordingly the loq value was used as the reasonably discerned limit to evaluate the value of the magnetic field intensity obtained from the measurement system 3 4 experimental procedures 3 4 1 relationship between electric current and magnetic field to understand the relationship between the flow field of a subsurface electric current and the spatial distribution of magnetic field one blank sandbox experiment without a polyvinyl chloride pvc obstacle and three sandbox experiments with different locations of a pvc obstacle were performed the pvc obstacle was a hollow pvc tube with a diameter of 30 cm and a height of 35 cm to minimize the disturbance to the packed sand the pvc tube was pushed directly to the bottom of the sandbox after the blank survey to create an obstacle to the electric current the axis coordinates of the pvc obstacle were set at 22 5 22 5 22 5 45 and 22 5 67 5 respectively in the three experiments fig 4 a c two electrodes were installed at the bottom of the sandbox to create a flow field of electric current the frequency of the magnetic field was selected to be 447 hz because its magnetic field background value was usually less than the mdl of the measurement system 0 0003 mg hence the output current was set to be 447 hz and it was controlled at a stable value of 0 04 a during the experiments the value of the magnetic field intensity in every grid was measured and recorded carefully 3 4 2 obstacles at the water surface lnapls usually spread laterally on top of the water table but they may migrate below the water table because of fluid head gradients or variations of groundwater level in this experiment we installed a glass container with a diameter of 30 cm and a height of 15 cm in packed sand after the blank survey fig 4 d a bucket of soil was put in this container to keep the empty container from floating the center of the glass container was located at 23 50 and its bottom was 10 cm under the water sand surface the two electrodes were installed 5 cm under the water sand surface the output current was set to a frequency of 447 hz and it was controlled at a stable value of 0 04 a during this experiment the value of the magnetic field intensity in every grid was measured and recorded carefully 3 4 3 packed sand with clay or gravel it was reported that the electrical resistivity of soil exhibits a large range of values giao et al 2003 samouëlian et al 2005 among all the unconsolidated sediments the electrical resistivity of clay is lower and in the range of 1 12 ω m whereas the electrical resistivity of gravel is higher near 10 000 ω m to understand the effect of different porous media on the distribution of electric current we filled clay or gravel in the packed silica sand both the dry clay wyo ben inc and gravel limestone with grain size range of 20 40 mm were soaked with a 0 004 m na2so4 solution for more than 24 h the pvc tube of 30 cm in diameter was used to push into the packed sand approximately 10 cm in depth after the blank survey the silica sand inside the pvc tube was removed and replaced completely with clay mass the pvc tube was then removed fig 4 e after finishing the survey procedure of the sandbox with clay mass the clay mass was removed and then filled the gravel the silica sand also used to fill the voids of the packed gravel fig 4 f the center points of the packed clay and gravel were all at 27 48 the output current was set to a frequency of 447 hz and it was controlled at a stable value of 0 04 a during both the clay and the gravel experiments the value of the magnetic field intensity in every grid was measured and recorded carefully during each experiment 3 4 4 lnapl in packed sand to simplify this experiment and control the contaminated zone in this experiment we used dry silica sand which was the same as the packed sand in the sandbox and we saturated the sand with motor oil cpc 9000sm cpc corporation taiwan with a density of 0 86 g cm3 moreover this motor oil was low viscosity and insoluble in water after the blank survey the pvc tube of 30 cm in diameter was used to push into the packed sand approximately 10 cm in depth and the sand was removed from inside the tube then the oil saturated sand was poured into this space filling it completely fig 4 g the center point of the contaminated sand was at 17 32 the output current was set to a frequency of 447 hz and it was controlled at a stable value of 0 04 a during this experiment the value of the magnetic field intensity in every grid was measured and recorded carefully 4 field test 4 1 site description conducting our field test at a relatively simple site helped in the development of this new technology because different types of contaminants present very complicated and different behaviors in porous media an lnapl contaminated site was the best selection owing to its high resistivity and the limited contaminated depth accordingly the field test was performed at a gas station in operation located in northern taiwan encompassing an area of approximately 973 m2 this site included six underground petrol storage tanks five gasoline diesel fueling islands and one business office fig 5 the main underground structure at this site was a concrete secondary containment of underground storage tanks the bottom of this structure was at a depth of approximately 3 5 m fig 5 also shows the soil profiles of this site from the monitoring well installation and soil drilling process the main soil type was silt and fine sand above the depth of 5 m and shallow soil above the depth of 1 m containing gravel the groundwater table was approximately 3 m below the ground surface during the field test 4 2 design of field test because the contaminants of this site were lnapls gasoline or diesel and the groundwater table was at a depth of approximately 3 m two stainless steel electrodes were placed at a depth of 4 m in monitoring wells m 01 and m 02 the frequency of magnetic field was selected to be 441 hz because its magnetic field background value was usually less than the mdl hence the output current was set to a frequency of 441 hz and it was controlled at a stable value of 0 4 a during this field test the output voltage of the ac power source was around 250 v to describe the distribution of the magnetic field intensity the survey and the data acquisition were conducted on the ground surface fig 6 shows the survey area and the data acquisition grid the number of data acquisition points was 157 in this test and the spacing between data acquisition points varied between 2 0 and 2 8 m the magnetic field sensor of the measurement system surveyed every grid point at the ground level and the values were recorded carefully 4 3 soil sampling and screening soil sampling was conducted after the magnetic field survey and the investigation was completed the sampling locations were determined according to the results of the magnetic field survey the planned sampling depth was 7 m at each sampling location the direct push method was used to provide a continuous soil sample for the screening and the detailed laboratory analysis and the geoprobe 7822dt soil probing equipment and sampling system were used soil samples were collected by a 1 5 m long sample sheath o d 76 mm with a hydrocarbon resistant pvc liner every soil sample core was immediately divided into 0 1 0 m 1 0 2 0 m 2 0 3 0 m 3 0 4 0 m 4 0 5 0 m 5 0 6 0 m and 6 0 7 0 m segments to evaluate the soil contamination situations at different depths the soil screening procedure involved selecting some potential or high concentration contaminated samples from the soil core segments for the laboratory analysis at least one sample segment was selected for the laboratory analysis of every sampling location because of its high sensitivity uniform response to hydrocarbons and broad linear range tong and karasek 1984 jorgensen et al 1990 freedman 1982 denahan et al 1990 nyquist et al 1990 the field flame ionization detector fid instrument thermo tva 1000b was used as the screening tool data were collected by the field fid instrument to analyze the contaminant concentrations in the soil headspace pursuant to the equilibrium headspace analysis specified by the taiwan environmental protection administration taiwan epa 2016 4 4 quantitative analysis headspace gas chromatography with fid fitted with a 30 m db 624 column i d 0 53 mm with a film thickness of 3 0 µm agilent j w ca usa was used to analyze the selected soil samples these soil samples were analyzed for total petroleum hydrocarbons tphs according to taiwan epa method niea 703 62b taiwan epa 2013 the chromatographic results were quantified using previously established calibration files to determine the amounts of tphs in the samples 5 results and discussion 5 1 sandbox experiments 5 1 1 the relationship between electric current and magnetic field fig 7 shows the contour images of the magnetic field b of the three sandbox experiments fig 7 a c present the results of the pvc obstacle set at 22 5 22 5 22 5 45 and 22 5 67 5 respectively a large magnetic field strength was observed at the locations of the electrodes and the maximum value was approximately 0 2 mg this result indicated that the electric current was concentrated at both the electrodes and the areas near the electrodes were all affected the blue dotted circles in fig 7 denote the location of the pvc obstacle the magnetic field distributions changed with the movement of the pvc obstacle although fig 7 shows minor reduction around the blue circle and some differences among the three images it is difficult to clearly present the actual influence zone of the pvc obstacle in this sandbox experiment the change in the magnetic field intensity δ b can be obtained by blank correction which is the process of deducting the values of the blank experiment fig 8 presents the distributions of δ b for the three sandbox experiments fig 8 shows a significant change around the pvc obstacle area and indicates that the pvc obstacle changed the electric current flow pattern and altered the distribution of the magnetic field intensity the maximum reduction values of the magnetic field intensity were all inside the blue circles and were 0 0085 0 0091 and 0 087 mg for fig 8 a c respectively the loq of this measurement system was 0 0012 mg as mentioned above and so the acceptable value should be less than 0 0012 mg therefore the results of reduction in magnetic field around the pvc obstacle were acceptable in these three experiments 5 1 2 the change in magnetic field intensity for an obstacle in the upper packed sand fig 9 a shows the distribution of the change in the magnetic field intensity for an obstacle in the upper packed sand which was overlaid on the photo of this sandbox experiment a significant reduction of magnetic field was located around the obstacle the maximum reduction value was 0 0042 mg at 27 5 47 5 near the center point of the obstacle 23 50 this maximum reduction value was less than 0 0012 mg and the contour line of 0 002 mg was around the obstacle area the reduction values of the magnetic field around the obstacle were acceptable for this experiment these results mean that an obstacle that enters only part of the water surface such as lnapls in aquifers can change the flow pattern of the electric current however its maximum reduction value was less than that shown in fig 8 because only part of the electric current was blocked by the obstacle the electric current could still flow through the saturated silica sand under the obstacle 5 1 3 the change in magnetic field intensity for a clay mass in packed sand fig 9 b shows the distribution of change in the magnetic field intensity overlaid on the photo of the sandbox experiment for a clay mass in the upper packed sand because the colors of both the sand and clay were similar fig 9 b cannot show a clear image of the clay in sandbox the real area of the clay is shown by the blue circle moreover fig 9 b shows a really different result compared to fig 9 a a significant increase in magnetic field was observed around the clay mass the maximum increase was 0 0090 mg at 32 5 47 5 the increasing values of magnetic field around the clay mass were acceptable for this experiment too this result of increasing magnetic field may have been because the electrical resistivity of clay is lower than that of packed sand and thus the clay mass in the upper of packed sand attracted the electric current lines and let the current density increase in the clay hence an increase in magnetic field was observed in this experiment also fig 9 b shows that the current flow pattern moved slightly to the boundary of x 45 this may have been because that the clay mass of lower electrical resistivity was installed near the boundary of x 45 and so the current lines were slightly shifted to this side 5 1 4 the change in magnetic field intensity for the gravel in packed sand fig 9 c shows a contour image overlaid on the photo of the sandbox experiment which shows the distribution of change in the magnetic field intensity for the gravel in the upper packed sand fig 9 c shows that the magnetic field did not change according to the shape of the packed gravel these results mean that the packed gravel did not effectively affect the current flow pattern in this sandbox experiment moreover fig 9 c shows that the current flow pattern moved slightly to the boundary of x 45 this phenomenon was similar to that shown in fig 9 b the maximum increase was 0 0069 mg at 42 5 2 5 and the maximum decrease was 0 0028 mg at 7 5 52 5 although the increasing and decreasing values of the magnetic field were acceptable in this experiment this change should not be related to the packed gravel because this experiment was conducted after the sandbox experiment of clay mass the clay mass was removed and then gravel filled the space and this round space its center point was at 27 48 was near the boundary of x 45 therefore the possible reason may be that the clay and gravel packing procedure slightly disturbed the structure of the packed sand and affected the flow pattern of the electric current 5 1 5 the change in magnetic field intensity for napl in packed sand fig 10 a shows a contour image of the change in the magnetic field intensity for lnapl saturated sand in the sandbox the blue circle is the area that the lnapl saturated sand packed a significant reduction of magnetic field is observed around the blue circle the maximum reduction value was 0 0043 mg at 17 5 32 5 in this experiment these results mean that the lnapl in sand changed the flow pattern of electric current in this sandbox experiment by comparing the reduction value with that of a glass obstacle in sand fig 9 a it was found that the maximum reduction values were almost the same 0 0043 mg and 0 0042 mg for lnapl and the obstacle experiment respectively but they showed obviously different shapes of reduction zone the reduction zones are elliptical and triangular in figs 9 a and 10 a respectively the shapes of the reduction zones were elliptical for the solid cylindrical obstacles in the sandbox experiments although the motor oil density 0 86 g cm3 saturated sand completely filled the space of the short cylinder some motor oil was observed floating out to the water surface during the filling procedure as shown in fig 10 b it was revealed that the na2so4 solution entered part of the outer void of packed sand and pushed out the oil this phenomenon may have changed the solid shape of the motor oil in sand and thus altered the electric current flow pattern around the obstacle thus showing different results compared to the solid cylindrical obstacle 5 1 6 discussion about the different media in sand the use of insulators such as pvc glass and motor oil in the sandbox resulted in significant decreases in the magnetic field as shown in figs 8 9 a and 10 a because of the great contrast in electrical resistivity between the insulators and the packed silica sand the gravel should be higher in electrical resistivity than the silica sand samouëlian et al 2005 however fig 9 c does not show any effect on the distribution of the magnetic field for the gravel in packed sand the possible reason may have been because the gravel and silica sand used in this study were not different enough in electrical resistivity to cause a change in the magnetic field greater than the loq of the measurement system 0 0012 mg however for the clay in packed sand where the clay was lower in electrical resistivity than the silica sand a significant increase in the magnetic field was observed the value of the increase was even greater than that of the decrease in the obstacle experiment the electrical resistivities of clay sand gravel and pvc are about 10 103 104 and 1013 ω m respectively hunt 2005 mohamed 2016 samouëlian et al 2005 according to these values of electrical resistivity the difference between sand and pvc is much greater than that between sand and clay but the decreasing and increasing values were 0 0042 mg and 0 0090 mg for both the pvc obstacle and clay experiments respectively as shown in fig 9 a and b respectively to understand this phenomenon the relationship between the magnetic field intensity and the electrical resistivity should be discussed first according to eq 1 the electric current i is proportional to the voltage v and inversely proportional to the resistance r eq 4 relates magnetic fields b to their source currents i eq 7 is generated by combining eqs 1 and 4 as follows 7 b μ 0 v r 4 π s l l 2 2 s 2 μ 0 v 4 π s l l 2 2 s 2 1 r k 1 r where μ 0 and l are constants if the input voltage v and distance s are constants too the magnetic field intensity b is inversely proportional to the electrical resistivity r based on this inversely proportional relationship if the electrical resistivity is decreased to be 0 1r the magnetic field intensity will be 10b and the difference in magnetic field intensity will be 9b but if the electrical resistivity is increased to be 10r the magnetic field intensity will be 0 1b and the difference in magnetic field intensity will be only 0 9b hence the magnetic field is more sensitive to the decrease in electrical resistivity this relationship can explain why the clay experiment showed a greater change in the magnetic field than the pvc obstacle experiment 5 1 7 discussion about the differences in shape between the obstacles and the images obtained from surveying the images of figs 8 a c and 9 a obtained from the surveying are roughly elliptical in shape with the major axis along the direction of the two electrode connection rather than circular even though the obstacles installed into the packed sand were cylindrical the variation of shape seems to reveal that the current did not flow completely along the surface when the flow passed a cylindrical obstacle gurevich et al 2000 gurevich and friesen 2000 applied a hodograph technique to calculate analytically the 2d distributions of the electric field and the transport current density they showed the current streamlines around a planar obstacle as illustrated in fig 11 a the results of these previous studies validate the observations of this study this phenomenon was also observed when the fluid flows passed a cylindrical obstacle shair et al 1963 nishioka and sato 1974 votyakov and kassinos 2009 zaks and nepomnyashchy 2019 votyakov and kassinos 2009 presented an image fig 11 b and described the flow behavior and flow pattern changes when the fluid flows passed a cylindrical solid obstacle based on these previous studies and the physical principle the current streamlines could separate in front of an insulated obstacle when the current is flowing but not flow to the insulated obstacle accordingly it is reasonable that the current would form an elliptical zone of low current density when the current flow passed a cylindrical obstacle in this sandbox experiment porous media of low electrical resistivity also showed a similar image as shown in fig 9 b because the electric current lines flowed smoothly and concentrated around the clay the flow pattern of electric current did not form a circular image of increasing magnetic field intensity the images of magnetic field obtained from numerical simulations the magnetic field increasing due to a lower resistivity block showed a same result chen et al 2002 yang et al 2018a the extension in shape was obvious and parallel to the direction of current flow 5 1 8 discussion about the scale effect in the sandbox experiment the results of sandbox experiments indicated that the obstacle in packed sand changed the flow pattern of the electric current and altered the distribution of the magnetic field above the sandbox however the results of the sandbox experiments also revealed that it is not easy to clearly show the location and the area of the cylindrical obstacle by using the distribution of the magnetic field intensity such as in fig 7 directly according to the relation between the magnetic field intensity and the electric current eq 4 the magnetic field intensity should be presented theoretically as zero inside the blue circles in fig 7 a c even though the pvc tube was not completely sealed on the bottom of sandbox the measured magnetic field should not have decreased by only about 5 in this sandbox experiment there should therefore be some effects that affected the magnetic field sensor in the sandbox experiments lin et al 2005 reported that when using a sandbox to simulate field activities it is essential to thoroughly understand the scale effect and its consequences so as to ensure an adequate model with the representative simulation results previous studies have reported data distortion under the influence of the scale effect the possible influence of the scale effect in the current study should therefore be discussed the dimensions of the sandbox and the magnetic sensor were 45 cm 60 cm 90 cm and 3 2 cm 3 2 cm 12 2 cm respectively and the grid spacing of survey was 5 cm compared with the sandbox and the grid spacing the sensor was large enough to lead to the scale effect in sandbox experiment for example not only the magnetic signal directly below this sensor but also surrounding signals entered this sensor illustrated as sensor 1 in fig 12 fig 12 shows that the sensor above an obstacle sensor 2 in fig 12 received some magnetic signals generated by the current nearby this phenomenon led to poor resolution when this technology was used in the sandbox scale experiment silliman and simpson 1987 indicated that the observation of laboratory scale phenomena can lead to the development of new theoretical approaches to the basic problem due to the scale effect the laboratory scale results cannot represent a real field situation wang et al 2013 reported that the scale effect is produced when the similarity law is not fulfilled from the prototype to the model however it might be reduced to a minimum by running a test in a sufficiently large facility according to this inference the influence of the scale effect could be minimized when the proposed technology is used in a real field test 5 2 field test 5 2 1 magnetic field survey the data acquisition point in the northwest corner was set to coordinates 0 0 then the values of the magnetic field intensity b and the corresponding coordinates are presented as a distribution of the magnetic field intensity fig 13 fig 13 shows that the maximum value of the magnetic field was 0 85 mg at 39 2 3 it was affected by the electrode installed in monitoring well m 02 the west side of the 2 gasoline diesel fueling island also showed a high magnetic field zone and its maximum value was approximately 0 6 mg according to the findings of the sandbox experiments this zone could contain more clay and reveal a lower electrical resistivity in contrast the values of the magnetic field were less than 0 1 mg around the 3 4 and 5 gasoline diesel fueling islands the low magnetic field intensity might imply that the current density was low in this area as the electric current was input with an intensity of 0 4 a and as it flowed through the aquifer between monitoring wells m 01 and m 02 the low current densities around the 3 4 and 5 fueling islands might be attributed to an obstacle in the aquifer of this area the possible obstacle would be fuel from the gas station that leaked to the aquifer according to the behavior of the electric current flow passing through an obstacle shown in sandbox experiments the contaminated zone has to have a specific characteristic in the flow field of electric current a lower current density than its surrounding area in mmr method the mmr anomaly is a result by comparing the measured field value with the theoretical field value at the center of the survey line edwards et al 1978 besides the magnetic field is insensitive to the absolute conductivity of the subsurface so it is suggested that the variations in relative are important when mmr assessment is performed dentith and mudge 2014 according to the mentioned above and the results of the sandbox experiments there are two specific characteristics in the magnetic field that can be obtained from the measurement system 1 a zone with a lower magnetic field strength than the theoretical value 2 a zone with a lower magnetic field strength than its surrounding area the electric current was 0 4 a and the survey depth was 4 m in this field test thus the theoretical value of magnetic field intensity was found to be 0 2 mg by using eq 4 based on the two specific characteristics mentioned above there were two zones at this site that could possibly have been contaminated by the leaked fuel one was the area around the 3 4 and 5 fueling islands zone 1 in fig 14 because it exhibited the first and second specific characteristics the other was the area between the 1 and 2 fueling islands zone 2 in fig 14 because this zone was small narrow and had a higher magnetic field zone nearby it could have been affected by the zone of higher magnetic field west of it this phenomenon is called the scale effect which was found and discussed in our sandbox experiments hence this study ignored the first specific characteristic and extended the area to be a zone of less than 0 3 mg according to the second specific characteristic zone 1 was estimated to be the main contaminated zone with the maximum area of 243 m2 the boundary of zone 1 was approximately along the magnetic contour line of 0 2 mg theoretical value zone 2 was approximately 50 m2 in area and its boundary was approximately along the magnetic contour line of 0 3 mg moreover zone 2 looked like an extension of zone 1 in terms of shape location and relevance the underground structure of secondary containment did not significantly influence the results of the magnetic field survey even though its bottom was about 0 5 m below the groundwater surface these results may have been because the electrodes were placed about 1 0 m under the groundwater surface and thus they were also about 0 5 m below the bottom of structure which could have minimized the possible influence in this field test 5 2 2 soil sample screening and quantitative analysis the 18 considered soil sampling locations s1 s18 as shown in fig 14 were decided according to the survey results of the magnetic field at the test site soil samples s1 to s12 were used to verify the contamination condition of zone 1 and soil samples s13 to s18 were used to verify the contamination condition of zone 2 in addition to the s1 s2 s5 and s10 samples a 7 m deep soil core was obtained for all the sampling points based on the conditions of the field sampling procedure s1 s2 and s5 were located in the zone of concrete secondary containment they could have been blocked by the concrete structure therefore the lengths of the soil cores were 3 m 3 m and 4 m for s1 s2 and s5 respectively moreover the sampling work of s10 was terminated by an unknown hard object and we only obtained a 3 m deep soil core all the soil sample cores were measured for every 1 m segment by using a field fid instrument the selected segment samples for the laboratory analysis after the field fid screening are listed in table 2 moreover the analysis results of these 43 soil segment samples are presented in table 3 the soil tph concentrations in table 3 are listed according to their sample name and the corresponding depth table 3 shows that samples s6 s7 and s8 had higher tph concentrations 10 000 mg kg among the 18 soil sampling points the main contaminated soil was found at a depth between 4 m and 6 m it should relate to the fluctuation of the groundwater levels soil samples s3 s4 and s9 contained a high concentration of tphs approximately 3000 mg kg these six contaminated soil samples were located in zone 1 shown in fig 14 moreover soil sample s15 had a high tph concentration of 4892 mg kg in the depth range of 3 m to 4 m however this soil sample was located in zone 2 shown in fig 14 soil samples s5 and s12 were the other two soil samples in zone 1 but their tph concentrations were nd and 195 mg kg respectively the result of s12 revealed low contamination at this sample location the sampling work of s5 was terminated at the depth of 4 m by the concrete structure of the storage tank this implied that soil sample s5 might be isolated with the contaminated soil by this hard object thus we obtained the result of nd in the quantitative analysis soil samples s1 s2 s10 and s11 were outside but near zone 1 among them s1 and s2 showed low tph concentrations because the concrete construction of the storage tank isolated the soil samples with the soil under this construction s10 showed a low tph concentration of 153 mg kg but this result only indicated soil data from 3 m below the ground surface because of the incomplete sampling of s1 s2 and s10 the quantitative analysis results of these three soil samples could not indicate whether their locations were contaminated or not moreover soil sample s11 showed a low tph concentration of 79 5 mg kg which revealed a low contamination result at the s11 sampling location soil samples s13 s14 s16 s17 and s18 were outside but near zone 2 their tph concentrations were 101 mg kg 15 3 mg kg 88 9 mg kg 24 8 mg kg and 25 mg kg respectively their results indicated low contamination around zone 2 5 2 3 comparison of magnetic field survey and soil sampling analysis in this study we determined the potential contaminated zones zone 1 and zone 2 in the field test by the specific characteristics of the magnetic field distribution to evaluate both methods of the magnetic field survey and the soil sample analysis four samples s1 s2 s5 and s10 were initially ignored because of their incomplete sampling there were seven soil samples s3 s4 s6 s7 s8 s9 and s12 inside zone 1 and one soil sample s11 outside but near zone 1 the soil samples inside zone 1 except for s12 presented high tph concentrations ranging from 2638 to 14 362 mg kg they all exceeded the taiwan epa legislation limit of 1000 mg kg of tph for soil taiwan epa 2011 however soil sample s12 presented a very anomalous result this sampling point had a low magnetic field strength but its tph concentration was only 195 mg kg as shown in fig 14 s12 was located near the boundary of zone 1 and near the connection line of the two electrodes monitoring wells m 01 and m 02 based on the observations and the discussion of our sandbox experiments current streamlines could separate in front of an obstacle s12 seemed to be in the low current density zone where the current streamlines separated this physical behavior of the electric current could explain why s12 was low in terms of both the tph concentration and the magnetic field intensity moreover sampling point s11 was outside the potential contaminated zone zone 1 and it too revealed a low tph concentration of 79 5 mg kg in summary except for sampling point s12 which was affected by the flow behavior of the electric current the potential contaminated zone zone 1 obtained from the survey of this new technology was significantly correlated with the tph analysis of soil samples for the other potential contaminated zone zone 2 only one soil sampling point was included but five were outside the zone and nearby this study extended the area to be a zone of less than 0 3 mg according to the second specific characteristic and set sampling point s15 inside the zone at the point with a magnetic field intensity ranging between 0 2 and 0 3 mg the tph analysis revealed that the tph concentration of s15 exceeded the taiwan epa legislation limit for soil at 4892 mg kg moreover the other five soil samples outside zone 2 presented low tph concentrations of less than 101 mg kg this result indicated that this potential contaminated zone determined by following the second specific characteristic had a good fit with the tph analysis of the soil samples if zone 2 was determined according to the first specific characteristic only and we ignored the possible influence of the scale effect we might have incorrectly investigated soil sample s15 to sum up by comparing the potential contaminated zones determined by the specific characteristics with the soil samples analysis only soil sample s12 did not obtain a corresponding result among the 14 evaluated soil samples this revealed that the magnetic field survey method was 92 9 accurate in this field test 5 2 4 comparison of magnetic field survey technology to ert rosales et al 2014 applied both the 2d ert method and soil sampling at two different lnapl contaminated petrol stations campsa and petroner three ert profiles 70 m long and 15 m deep were obtained from each site three soil boreholes 10 m deep were designed according to the ert results at the campsa site and three boreholes related to anomalies in the ert profiles 8 m deep were designed at the petroner site the diesel range organics dros c10 c28 in the soil were analyzed quantitatively to compare with the ert survey the authors reported that the resistive anomaly zones could not be related to the contamination by dros in these layers of sedimentary materials the maximum concentration of dros about 5000 mg kg was at a zone with electrical resistivity values ranging from 30 to 50 ω m and the maximum electrical resistivity value about 2000 ω m was at a zone with a dro concentration of about 25 mg kg the authors also reported that the ert survey was affected by the underground storage tanks and the gravel layer some previous works also reported that underground structures rosales et al 2012 wang et al 2015 and gravel layers mohammed et al 2019 mostafa et al 2018 samouëlian et al 2005 wilkinson et al 2010 did show high resistivity areas on ert profiles the distribution of the magnetic field of the sandbox experiment fig 9 c did not show any abnormal effect by the packed gravel moreover the soil profiles of this test site indicated that the main soil type was fine sand and gravel under the groundwater surface at around the s04 soil drilling hole fig 5 the distribution of the magnetic field in the field test fig 13 did not show a low magnetic field zone in the corresponding area the zone west of the 2 fueling station caused by the high electrical resistivity media as mentioned in section 5 1 6 the lower sensitivity of the magnetic field survey technology for media of high electrical resistivity could be one of the possible reasons the other reason could because the fine sand soil and the fine sand and gravel soil at this site were not different enough in electrical resistivity to cause a change in the magnetic field greater than the loq of the measurement system 0 0012 mg however the huge difference in the electrical resistivity between the fine sand soil and the lnapl contaminated soil could cause a detectable change in the magnetic field intensity by our measurement system 5 2 5 discussion about the scale effect in field test to understand the relationship between the tph concentration and the magnetic field intensity in the field test the plots of the maximum tph concentration of every sample point versus the corresponding magnetic field intensity for the field test are presented in fig 15 the correlation coefficient between the tph concentration and the magnetic field intensity was not very good this proved that the tph concentration could not be well estimated by using the value of the magnetic field intensity however these data formed a strip shaped region which revealed the following trend the higher the tph concentration the lower the magnetic field intensity this result indicated that contaminants such as tph in the aquifer would surely influence the current flow pattern and alter the distribution of the magnetic field intensity on the ground furthermore we divided the 14 evaluated field sample data into two groups zone 1 and zone 2 both groups showed better correlation between the tph concentration and the magnetic field intensity however fig 15 shows that the magnetic field values of zone 2 were larger than those of zone 1 the possible reason for this difference might be related to the scale effect as compared to zone 1 zone 2 was long and narrow with a total size of approximately 50 m2 and next to it was a zone with a higher magnetic field thus the magnetic field value of every survey point in zone 2 might have included not only the signal value directly below this sampling point but also those of nearby signals hence zone 2 had a larger magnetic field value because of the mixing of some magnetic signals outside the contaminated zone based on these results the scale effect was observed not only in the sandbox scale experiment but also in the field test 5 2 6 discussion about the limitations of the magnetic field survey technology the magnetic field survey technology was successfully applied to the sandbox experiments and field test in this study no matter whether the porous media was sand fine sand clay or gravel because this technology is based on the current flow pattern in an aquifer it obtains the current density or distribution in the aquifer by measuring the corresponding distribution of the magnetic field hence obstacles and lnapl contaminated soil even clay can be investigated and delineated by this technology the results of this study also indicated that unconsolidated sediment of higher electrical resistivity such as gravel cannot be significantly presented on the contour image even so we should be careful when using the measured data of the magnetic field because the magnetic measurement will be affected by several factors to combine the findings of the sandbox experiments and the field test in this study the following three factors were considered 1 scale effect 2 flow pattern disturbance and 3 external interference the scale effect and the flow pattern disturbance are discussed above the external interference can be avoided basically by using a blank scan and selecting the best frequency of low noise the electrodes and the cables are the main source of external interference fig 14 shows that sampling point s18 was close to the electrode of m 02 and located in a zone with a strong magnetic field therefore the value of the magnetic field intensity was affected by the electrode of m 02 fig 15 shows that the magnetic field intensity of s18 was approximately 0 6 mg and it was far away from the trend curve of zone 2 accordingly the magnetic field intensity of s18 was evidently affected by the electrode and cable of m 02 the limitation of the magnetic field survey technology in terms of depth also is a matter of concern when applying this technology the electrodes are set in wells at the depths of interest a flow field of electric current is generated at around this corresponding depth the magnetic field intensity on the ground is measured according to eq 4 if the observation point p is at the connection line of the two electrodes where s d and the distance of electrodes is much greater than that of the depth l d the detected value of the resulting magnetic field is related to both the electric current and the depth of the electrode fig 16 which was plotted based on eq 4 gives the theoretical value of the magnetic field intensity according to the given output current and survey depth for example the electric current and survey depth were 0 4 a and 4 0 m respectively in the field test following the curve of current 0 4 a the corresponding value of the magnetic field is found to be 0 2 mg at a depth of 4 m however the limit of the magnetic field survey technology in terms of depth can also be estimated using fig 16 if the output electric current is 0 4 a then by following the curve of current 0 4 a the corresponding value of the magnetic field will be 0 02 mg and 0 01 mg at survey depths of 40 m and 80 m respectively because the mdl and loq of our measurement system were 0 0003 mg and 0 0012 mg respectively to obtain an acceptable resolution under the conditions of this test we determined the limit of the survey depth to be 80 m because the theoretical value of the corresponding magnetic field is almost ten times the loq when an electric current is injected in the groundwater by wells most of the electric current will flow in the saturated zone of high conductivity so this technology cannot be used to survey the residual napl in vadose zone where the current density is very low however this technology cannot be limited by the types of soil because the magnetic field survey is insensitive to the absolute conductivity of the subsurface but is sensitive to the variations of the conductivity dentith and mudge 2014 6 conclusions in this study we applied an electric current flow pattern and its resulting magnetic field to develop a new application for investigating contaminated sites sandbox experiments were conducted to observe the behaviors of the current flow pattern and the magnetic distribution a field test of an lnapl contaminated site was conducted by combining the magnetic field survey and the soil sample analysis in the sandbox experiments we created several different current flow patterns by changing the location and depth of the insulated obstacle we also installed clay mass gravel and lnapl saturated sand in the sandbox except for gravel the results of the magnetic field survey successfully showed corresponding images that described the location and the area of the obstacle gravel was the exception because the gravel and silica sand used in this study were not different enough in electrical resistivity to cause a change in magnetic field greater than the loq of the measurement system in the sandbox experiments the scale effect impacted the measurement of magnetic field and seriously reduced the resolution of our measurement system we also found that the physical behavior of the current flow disturbance could cause a distorted image relevant to the shape of the obstacle in the field test we created a flow field of electric current in the aquifer and collected 157 data items on the ground to plot the contour image of the magnetic field intensity instead of using the values of the magnetic field intensity two potential contaminated zones were determined according to the specific characteristics of the contour image furthermore 43 soil segment samples from the 18 soil sample points were analyzed quantitatively and used to verify the results of the magnetic field survey this field test exhibited a high accuracy of 92 9 which implied that the lnapl distribution of the contaminated site was successfully investigated by this new technology moreover a gravel mixture zone and underground structure did not appear on the contour image instead of the vertical image of electrical resistivity obtained from ert this technology showed a horizontal contour image of the magnetic field intensity with less interference by the unconsolidated sediments of higher electric resistivity the contour image obtained from this technology was a projection of the horizontal level such as in a medical x ray image and so it was difficult to accurately estimate the depth of the contaminant plume using the current instrument however the magnetic field survey technology offers some useful information for site investigation in a different view and form and it will be helpful in investigating contaminated sites credit authorship contribution

5437,nonaqueous phase liquids napls usually move through the vadose zone not in a homogeneous spread manner but in the form of disconnected blobs and they remain in the pores of porous media a major challenge in remediating an napl contaminated site is to detect and delineate the distribution of napls geophysical technologies could act as investigating methods for sites with limited resources and time constraints based on the principle of magnetometric resistivity mmr method in this study we applied an electric current flow pattern and its resulting magnetic field to develop a new application for contaminated site investigation the physical phenomena about the magnetic distribution the flow pattern of electric current and the influence of different media in packed sand were observed via sandbox experiments a field test was performed at a light napl lnapl contaminated site by combining the magnetic field survey and a soil sample analysis two potential contaminated zones were determined according to the specific characteristics of the contour image plotted according to the magnetic field intensity collected on the ground the quantitative results of the total petroleum hydrocarbons tphs of 18 soil samples were used to verify the results of the magnetic field survey the comparison results revealed that we obtained a high accuracy of 92 9 in the field test which indicated that this technology could be used to investigate lnapl contaminated sites moreover two phenomena the scale effect led to poor resolution and the behavior of flow pattern disturbance distorted the survey images were observed in both the sandbox experiment and the field test keywords noninvasive survey technology current density magnetic intensity lnapls sandbox experiment field test 1 introduction contamination of groundwater and soil by nonaqueous phase liquids napls happens frequently li et al 2018 sheng et al 2018 which has been of great concern for environmental preservation napls are generally divided into two classes based on their densities light nonaqueous phase liquids lnapls and dense nonaqueous phase liquids dnapls lnapls are hydrophobic liquid organic chemicals that are immiscible with water such as crude oil and most refined products gasoline benzene toluene and xylene when lnapls are spilled they infiltrate the groundwater and remain on top of the water table which may potentially affect receptors humans flora and fauna abbas et al 2017 baawain et al 2018 caetano et al 2017 gainer et al 2018 mohanakrishna et al 2018 when an aquifer is contaminated by lnapls the most urgent and important thing to do is to remove these contaminants from the aquifer as soon as possible a major challenge in remediating subsurface contamination by lnapls is to detect and delineate their distribution a typical investigation method is to utilize point sampling with soil cores or monitoring wells cost is the primary disadvantage of the point sampling method because of the expenses associated with drilling sampling quantitative analysis and well installation in addition this method may miss contaminants in areas where the well data are not available or it may create new contaminant pathways cohen and mercer 1993 hunkeler et al 1997 newell and ross 1992 pankow and cherry 1996 moreover groundwater wells are not consistent in sampling separate phase liquids because of well degradation and capillary effects which may prevent napls from entering a well farr et al 1990 lenhard and parker 1990 newell et al 1995 in addition to the traditional sampling method in situ penetration tests have been widely used by the geotechnical community for site investigation penetration tests common to u s practice include the standard penetration test spt and cone penetration test cpt both tests are normally carried out in boreholes and usually consist of techniques that use a direct push apparatus to deliver the sensor probes and sampling and analytical devices to the depths of interest it is a rapid and cost effective method for site investigation however most push in devices are not suitable for a wide range of ground conditions hence this penetration method cannot be used in gravel or highly consolidated soils kram et al 2001 usda 2012 further data are unreliable in unsaturated conditions particularly in clayey soils usda 2012 the soil gas survey method provides valuable information on the extent of napl source zones in unsaturated zones and it is usually used as a screening method because of its convenience and low cost wilson 1997 however this method is limited in dealing with volatile napl only sites schubert et al 2005 in addition it does not enable napl quantification in the source zone höhener and surbeck 2004 to overcome such technical problems several innovative tracer based methods have been introduced and evaluated under laboratory and field conditions in the last two decades partitioning and interfacial tracers have been assessed to evaluate their ability to estimate both the location and the amount and distribution of napls in the vadose zone annable et al 1998 brusseau et al 2003 deeds et al 1999 jin et al 1995 mariner et al 1999 werner 2002 werner and höhener 2002 however this method requires the injection of synthetic chemicals as tracers which often incur high costs and are associated with additional environmental concerns therefore several authors have suggested the use of radon 222rn as an environmental tracer for the localization and assessment of residual napl contamination in both soil höhener and surbeck 2004 schubert et al 2002 2005 and aquifers davis et al 2002 davis et al 2005 hunkeler et al 1997 semprini et al 2000 some studies have reported the migration of 222rn in the vadose zone kristensen et al 2010 minkin 2002 minkin and shapovalov 2016 richon et al 2011 wang et al 2019 yakovleva and parovik 2010 and 222rn partitioning coefficients between air water and napls in closed systems schubert et al 2007a moreover some reports showed that the 222rn tracer method was effective for delineating napl contaminated source zones after conducting field tests in lnapl contaminated sites barbosa et al 2014 garcía gonzález et al 2008 schubert et al 2007b still its application is not without restrictions problems may occur due to mineralogical heterogeneity of the aquifer matrix preferential flow paths bypassing the napl source zone and napl aging thus altering the partition coefficient between napl and water or soil gas schubert 2015 the methods of site investigation mentioned above have mainly relied on a sparse network of intrusive drilling and sampling approaches which can only provide limited spatial and temporal resolution griffin and watson 2002 peter et al 2008 also sampling of contaminant concentration from heterogeneous soil will not provide an accurate means of assessing the total contaminant mass retained in the soil matrix shapiro et al 2019 for this reason a variety of noninvasive geophysical methods have been proposed for the detection of napls in the shallow subsurface for example it was reported that ground penetrating radar gpr can survey the napl leakage distribution cassidy 2007 lopes de castro and branco 2003 but some researchers also warned that lnapl contaminant detection using gpr is difficult and often unrealistic in a low humidity environment bertolla et al 2014 golebiowski et al 2010 frequency domain electromagnetic fdem analysis initially produces a primary electromagnetic field and this primary field induces a current in the aquifer the induced current produces a secondary electromagnetic field and the receiver coil records the intensity of the secondary electromagnetic field to determine the conductivity of the materials in the aquifer fdem is sensitive to metal but not to napls and so it has shown its usefulness in investigating saline intrusion goebel et al 2019 and the actual coverage of a landfill wang et al 2015 but only a few works have reported on the investigation of napl contaminated sites nobes et al 2000 pettersson and nobes 2003 nuclear magnetic resonance nmr is classified as a tool of site characterization but it is not a site survey tool simpson et al 2018 it is widely used as a robust tool for characterizing components in complex mixtures in general nmr is intrinsically quantitative and nonbiased toward different compound classes and it provides intrinsic structural information on the components of contaminated soil fallaise et al 2019 among the geophysical methods low frequency geoelectrical methods are most widely used and include mainly self potential resistivity and induced polarization techniques revil et al 2012 the self potential sp method is a passive geophysical method in which the electrical potential distribution is mapped using a set of nonpolarizing electrodes the sp value is directly sensitive to the chemistry of both the pore water and the pore water mineral interface it has been applied to monitoring contaminant plumes atekwana et al 2004 giampaolo et al 2014 minsley et al 2007 naudet and revil 2005 werkema et al 2003 żogała et al 2012 however contaminant plumes rich in organic matter do not always show large sp anomalies because of their lack of redox processes revil et al 2012 electrical resistivity tomography ert is a popular geophysical subsurface imaging technique because of its sensitivity to relative changes in the saturation of the water phase binley and kemna 2005 and its wettability revil et al 2011 ert has been applied to monitoring soil water content lehikoinen et al 2009 saline water intrusion de franco et al 2009 and for tracer tests perri et al 2012 moreover ert has been used extensively in mapping and monitoring the contaminants in the subsurface because it can assess the spatial and temporal geoelectrical changes induced by this pollutant karaoulis et al 2011 niaounakis and halvadakis 2006 power et al 2015 slater et al 2000 soupios et al 2007a b c nevertheless the application of ert is mainly limited owing to the following three issues the first is the difficulty of static detection of the complex electrical target presented by an intricate unknown dnapl distribution in a heterogeneous unknown permeability field power et al 2013 which can produce resistivity variations that are sometimes stronger than those associated with the presence of the napls deng et al 2017 the second issue impeding ert usage on sites is the reliability of the interpretation loke et al 2013 due to the independent time lapse inversion images contaminated by the inversion artifacts karaoulis et al 2014 the third issue is that the age and degradation status of the contaminants change the groundwater chemistry the release of ions during biodegradation or mineral weathering and dissolution caused by organic acids released by bacteria can cause increased groundwater conductivity atekwana and atekwana 2010 atekwana and slater 2009 moreover some reports present that the ert have used cross borehole surveys which are not only invasive but expensive because typical borehole spacing must be on the order of a few meters coverage of a significant area can be challenging power et al 2014 induced polarization ip is a geophysical method that uses low frequency polarization mechanisms in earth materials associated with the reversible storage of electrical charges free phase napl presence in an unconfined aquifer have resulted in decreased chargeability flores orozco et al 2012 whereas in another field study high chargeability was interpreted as an indicator of lnapls in clayey sand deceuster and kaufmann 2012 however some reports have suggested that the presence of napls in water saturated soil samples generally reduces the magnitude of the ip effect chambers et al 2004 martinho et al 2006 revil et al 2011 schmutz et al 2010 but others indicated the opposite cassiani et al 2009 schmutz et al 2010 2012 titov et al 2004 thus the results of previous field and laboratory studies vary and sometimes point in opposite directions the possible reason is that biodegradation may have led to electrochemical and membrane polarization mechanisms altering the experimental results johansson et al 2015 geophysical techniques such as sp ert and ip require the installation of electrodes at the soil surface and they must be in good contact with the soil therefore invasive drilling processes are usually conducted on site because most lnapl contaminated sites have concrete paving over a soil surface if the concrete surface of a contaminated site cannot be drilled application of these geophysical methods will be limited moreover these three methods show a two dimensional 2d image of the vertical profile of the survey line although they can certainly present a three dimensional 3d image by conducting multiple survey lines this will increase the cost hence the development of some novel and effective geophysical technologies that can carry out a noninvasive survey and present an image in a different form e g a horizontal profile will be helpful in site investigations the aim of this study was to develop a new application of noninvasive technology for site investigations on the basis of the huge contrast of electrical resistivity between napls and porous media in this paper we present a method referring to the principle of magnetometric resistivity mmr with mmr a low frequency electrical current frequency 1 khz is injected in the ground between two electrodes and the resulting magnetic field is measured this method was initially proposed by jakosky jakosky 1933 then was refined by some researchers nabighian 1991a b stefanescu and nabighian 1962 with the purpose of determining the electrical conductivity of the earth edwards 1974 because mmr method is sensitive to the current that is concentrated within a conductive body mmr was usually used to explore mineral resources and abnormal structure identify preferential groundwater flow paths and detect the reservoir leakage passage edwards and howel 1976 jessop et al 2018 trevino and edwards 1979 zou et al 2019 most works were focus on the mathematical aspects of this method chen et al 2002 edwards 1974 edwards et al 1978 oppliger 1984 sripanya 2016 trevino and edwards 1979 yang et al 2018b and just few works were related to the field application edwards and howel 1976 jessop et al 2018 street 1989 in environmental field except for the computational hydro geophysical modeling of conductive solute plume kulessa et al 2002 labreque et al 2003 zhu and yang 2008 none of the studies applied mmr in a real site to investigate its contamination in this study a series of sandbox experiments were conducted first to study the flow behaviors of current in porous media and the relationship between the current and its resulting magnetic field and to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method then a field test was performed at a lnapl contaminated site to compare the results of the magnetic field survey with the soil sample analysis the main contribution of this study however lies in the comparison of the magnetic field survey results with the sample analysis data which provides an excellent basis for assessing the actual application of the electrical current and its resulting magnetic field survey for contaminated site investigations 2 fundamental conception groundwater is generally a good subsurface electrical conductor however the electrical resistivity of an aquifer is not constant it varies from 10 to 10 000 ω m normally samouëlian et al 2005 natural materials with an electrical resistivity of 0 1 106 ω m constitute groundwater systems and their surroundings the apparent resistivity of an aquifer is a function of the groundwater quality the host materials present and the hydrogeological structure when a site is contaminated by organic solvents solvents with high electrical resistivity 1010 1013 ω m in the porous media seriously influence the hydrogeological characteristics of the site and form some obviously high electrical resistivity zones according to ohm s law eq 1 the electric current i is proportional to the voltage v and inversely proportional to the resistance r it is well known that the higher the conductivity the greater the electrical current that will flow when an electric field is present this phenomenon reveals that the electric current always follows the path of least resistance 1 i v r in the case of contaminated aquifers only a little current can flow through high electrical resistivity zones because of the accumulation of solvents on the basis of this principle if we establish an electric field in the contaminated aquifer and obtain the distribution of the electric current we can probably estimate the contaminated zone of the solvents hence how to obtain the invisible distribution of the electric current in an invisible subsurface is the most important key to successfully applying this electrical physical property to the investigation of a contaminated site in physics the biot savart law is an equation describing the magnetic field generated by a constant electric current if the conductor has some thickness e g aquifer at the observation point p r position of the magnetometer as shown in fig 1 the magnetic field can be decomposed as edwards et al 1978 jessop et al 2018 2 b r μ 0 4 π σ e r r r r 3 d τ where r is the position of the observation point p r is the position of the integration point around the source point and d τ is a volume element around the source point σ e is the current density and μ 0 4 π 10 7 t m a is the permeability of the free space in the special case of a uniform constant current i the magnetic field b is 3 b r μ 0 i 4 π r r r r 3 d τ suppose two electrodes are installed at a depth d in a uniform earth and a distance l between two electrodes a magnetic field due to current flow in the ground can be measured at p x y 0 as shown in fig 1 hence the theoretical magnetic field intensity b at the observation point p x y 0 can be expressed as follows 4 b x x y 0 μ 0 i 4 π s l l 2 2 s 2 where s is the shortest distance from point p to the current line according to the relation between the magnetic field intensity and the electric current eq 4 the magnetic field intensity should be proportional to the current strength if the distance s is fixed furthermore it should be feasible to establish an electric field in a contaminated aquifer and measure the magnetic field intensity on the ground to estimate the range of the potential contaminated zone by using the distribution of the magnetic field intensity 3 laboratory test methods 3 1 sandbox setup a current flowing through a saturated porous medium is a 3d phenomenon experiments were performed in a glass sandbox to study the new noninvasive technology for surveying a contaminated site the sandbox was constructed from 1 cm thick glass and had the following internal dimensions 45 cm thickness 90 cm width 60 cm height as depicted in fig 2 we set the side of 45 cm as the x axis and the side of 90 cm as the y axis coordinates as shown in fig 2 two stainless steel electrodes with diameters of 1 5 cm and heights of 2 0 cm were installed at preset locations on both sides y 0 and 90 cm of the sandbox with electric cables connected to the power source because silica sand is widely used in sandbox tests deng et al 2017 kang et al 2018 power et al 2014 tsai and lin 2004 zhou and cardiff 2017 clean silica sand obtained from chin ching silica sand co ltd taiwan was used as porous media it was packed randomly in the sandbox to a height of 30 cm the silica sand consisted of grains with particle sizes ranging from 0 5 to 2 8 mm the grain size distribution was obtained by using mechanical sieve analysis as shown in fig 3 the average median grain size d 50 was 1 60 mm the coefficient of uniformity c u and the coefficient of curvature cc are the grading characteristics of the soil in this study the coefficient of uniformity cu of packed sand is found to be 1 93 by using the following equation al khafaji and andersland 1992 5 c u d 60 d 10 where d 10 is the effective size and represents grain diameters corresponding to 10 passing d 60 is the grain diameter corresponding to 60 passing the coefficient of curvature c c was found to be 1 04 by using the following equation 6 c c d 30 2 d 10 d 60 where d 30 is the grain diameter corresponding to 30 passing the physical properties of the silica sand are provided in table 1 a 0 004 m na2so4 solution with a conductivity of approximately 830 μs cm was injected slowly by peristaltic pump mfu 01 major science at a rate of approximately 200 ml min from the bottom of the sandbox to saturate the whole packed silica sand a low injection rate was used to minimize both the residual gas in the packed sand and the interference of gas which is highly electrically resistant the saturating procedure was stopped when the water surface reached the top surface of the packed sand to measure the distribution of the magnetic field above the sandbox a glass plate with 162 grids 5 cm 5 cm was placed on the top of the sandbox the value of the magnetic field intensity in every grid was measured and recorded carefully during each sandbox experiment 3 2 power source for sandbox a programmable ac power source 6605 extech electronics co was connected to two electrodes to provide a highly stable electric current with a specific frequency for the experimental sandbox before the experimental procedure the frequency of the output ac current was determined magnetic fields with frequency ranges of 1 1000 hz could be detected and were captured by the measurement system by way of a blank scan the best frequency with the lowest background signal was selected for use in our experiments to avoid the possible interference from the other ac currents or electric motors 3 3 measurement system the measurement system was designed to measure the magnetic field intensity generated by the ac electric current of the set frequency flowing in the sandbox system hence this system included a three axis magnetic field sensor em 2 elisha technology co a data acquisition device ni 9230 national instruments and a tablet with data calculation and analysis software ngst elisha technology co the noise of the magnetic field sensor used in the study was less than 0 0002 mg and an analog signal was exported to the data acquisition device by a connecting cable the analog signal was converted into a digital signal and transferred to the tablet to perform the analysis the method detection limit mdl and limit of quantitation loq of this measurement system were 0 0003 mg and 0 0012 mg respectively accordingly the loq value was used as the reasonably discerned limit to evaluate the value of the magnetic field intensity obtained from the measurement system 3 4 experimental procedures 3 4 1 relationship between electric current and magnetic field to understand the relationship between the flow field of a subsurface electric current and the spatial distribution of magnetic field one blank sandbox experiment without a polyvinyl chloride pvc obstacle and three sandbox experiments with different locations of a pvc obstacle were performed the pvc obstacle was a hollow pvc tube with a diameter of 30 cm and a height of 35 cm to minimize the disturbance to the packed sand the pvc tube was pushed directly to the bottom of the sandbox after the blank survey to create an obstacle to the electric current the axis coordinates of the pvc obstacle were set at 22 5 22 5 22 5 45 and 22 5 67 5 respectively in the three experiments fig 4 a c two electrodes were installed at the bottom of the sandbox to create a flow field of electric current the frequency of the magnetic field was selected to be 447 hz because its magnetic field background value was usually less than the mdl of the measurement system 0 0003 mg hence the output current was set to be 447 hz and it was controlled at a stable value of 0 04 a during the experiments the value of the magnetic field intensity in every grid was measured and recorded carefully 3 4 2 obstacles at the water surface lnapls usually spread laterally on top of the water table but they may migrate below the water table because of fluid head gradients or variations of groundwater level in this experiment we installed a glass container with a diameter of 30 cm and a height of 15 cm in packed sand after the blank survey fig 4 d a bucket of soil was put in this container to keep the empty container from floating the center of the glass container was located at 23 50 and its bottom was 10 cm under the water sand surface the two electrodes were installed 5 cm under the water sand surface the output current was set to a frequency of 447 hz and it was controlled at a stable value of 0 04 a during this experiment the value of the magnetic field intensity in every grid was measured and recorded carefully 3 4 3 packed sand with clay or gravel it was reported that the electrical resistivity of soil exhibits a large range of values giao et al 2003 samouëlian et al 2005 among all the unconsolidated sediments the electrical resistivity of clay is lower and in the range of 1 12 ω m whereas the electrical resistivity of gravel is higher near 10 000 ω m to understand the effect of different porous media on the distribution of electric current we filled clay or gravel in the packed silica sand both the dry clay wyo ben inc and gravel limestone with grain size range of 20 40 mm were soaked with a 0 004 m na2so4 solution for more than 24 h the pvc tube of 30 cm in diameter was used to push into the packed sand approximately 10 cm in depth after the blank survey the silica sand inside the pvc tube was removed and replaced completely with clay mass the pvc tube was then removed fig 4 e after finishing the survey procedure of the sandbox with clay mass the clay mass was removed and then filled the gravel the silica sand also used to fill the voids of the packed gravel fig 4 f the center points of the packed clay and gravel were all at 27 48 the output current was set to a frequency of 447 hz and it was controlled at a stable value of 0 04 a during both the clay and the gravel experiments the value of the magnetic field intensity in every grid was measured and recorded carefully during each experiment 3 4 4 lnapl in packed sand to simplify this experiment and control the contaminated zone in this experiment we used dry silica sand which was the same as the packed sand in the sandbox and we saturated the sand with motor oil cpc 9000sm cpc corporation taiwan with a density of 0 86 g cm3 moreover this motor oil was low viscosity and insoluble in water after the blank survey the pvc tube of 30 cm in diameter was used to push into the packed sand approximately 10 cm in depth and the sand was removed from inside the tube then the oil saturated sand was poured into this space filling it completely fig 4 g the center point of the contaminated sand was at 17 32 the output current was set to a frequency of 447 hz and it was controlled at a stable value of 0 04 a during this experiment the value of the magnetic field intensity in every grid was measured and recorded carefully 4 field test 4 1 site description conducting our field test at a relatively simple site helped in the development of this new technology because different types of contaminants present very complicated and different behaviors in porous media an lnapl contaminated site was the best selection owing to its high resistivity and the limited contaminated depth accordingly the field test was performed at a gas station in operation located in northern taiwan encompassing an area of approximately 973 m2 this site included six underground petrol storage tanks five gasoline diesel fueling islands and one business office fig 5 the main underground structure at this site was a concrete secondary containment of underground storage tanks the bottom of this structure was at a depth of approximately 3 5 m fig 5 also shows the soil profiles of this site from the monitoring well installation and soil drilling process the main soil type was silt and fine sand above the depth of 5 m and shallow soil above the depth of 1 m containing gravel the groundwater table was approximately 3 m below the ground surface during the field test 4 2 design of field test because the contaminants of this site were lnapls gasoline or diesel and the groundwater table was at a depth of approximately 3 m two stainless steel electrodes were placed at a depth of 4 m in monitoring wells m 01 and m 02 the frequency of magnetic field was selected to be 441 hz because its magnetic field background value was usually less than the mdl hence the output current was set to a frequency of 441 hz and it was controlled at a stable value of 0 4 a during this field test the output voltage of the ac power source was around 250 v to describe the distribution of the magnetic field intensity the survey and the data acquisition were conducted on the ground surface fig 6 shows the survey area and the data acquisition grid the number of data acquisition points was 157 in this test and the spacing between data acquisition points varied between 2 0 and 2 8 m the magnetic field sensor of the measurement system surveyed every grid point at the ground level and the values were recorded carefully 4 3 soil sampling and screening soil sampling was conducted after the magnetic field survey and the investigation was completed the sampling locations were determined according to the results of the magnetic field survey the planned sampling depth was 7 m at each sampling location the direct push method was used to provide a continuous soil sample for the screening and the detailed laboratory analysis and the geoprobe 7822dt soil probing equipment and sampling system were used soil samples were collected by a 1 5 m long sample sheath o d 76 mm with a hydrocarbon resistant pvc liner every soil sample core was immediately divided into 0 1 0 m 1 0 2 0 m 2 0 3 0 m 3 0 4 0 m 4 0 5 0 m 5 0 6 0 m and 6 0 7 0 m segments to evaluate the soil contamination situations at different depths the soil screening procedure involved selecting some potential or high concentration contaminated samples from the soil core segments for the laboratory analysis at least one sample segment was selected for the laboratory analysis of every sampling location because of its high sensitivity uniform response to hydrocarbons and broad linear range tong and karasek 1984 jorgensen et al 1990 freedman 1982 denahan et al 1990 nyquist et al 1990 the field flame ionization detector fid instrument thermo tva 1000b was used as the screening tool data were collected by the field fid instrument to analyze the contaminant concentrations in the soil headspace pursuant to the equilibrium headspace analysis specified by the taiwan environmental protection administration taiwan epa 2016 4 4 quantitative analysis headspace gas chromatography with fid fitted with a 30 m db 624 column i d 0 53 mm with a film thickness of 3 0 µm agilent j w ca usa was used to analyze the selected soil samples these soil samples were analyzed for total petroleum hydrocarbons tphs according to taiwan epa method niea 703 62b taiwan epa 2013 the chromatographic results were quantified using previously established calibration files to determine the amounts of tphs in the samples 5 results and discussion 5 1 sandbox experiments 5 1 1 the relationship between electric current and magnetic field fig 7 shows the contour images of the magnetic field b of the three sandbox experiments fig 7 a c present the results of the pvc obstacle set at 22 5 22 5 22 5 45 and 22 5 67 5 respectively a large magnetic field strength was observed at the locations of the electrodes and the maximum value was approximately 0 2 mg this result indicated that the electric current was concentrated at both the electrodes and the areas near the electrodes were all affected the blue dotted circles in fig 7 denote the location of the pvc obstacle the magnetic field distributions changed with the movement of the pvc obstacle although fig 7 shows minor reduction around the blue circle and some differences among the three images it is difficult to clearly present the actual influence zone of the pvc obstacle in this sandbox experiment the change in the magnetic field intensity δ b can be obtained by blank correction which is the process of deducting the values of the blank experiment fig 8 presents the distributions of δ b for the three sandbox experiments fig 8 shows a significant change around the pvc obstacle area and indicates that the pvc obstacle changed the electric current flow pattern and altered the distribution of the magnetic field intensity the maximum reduction values of the magnetic field intensity were all inside the blue circles and were 0 0085 0 0091 and 0 087 mg for fig 8 a c respectively the loq of this measurement system was 0 0012 mg as mentioned above and so the acceptable value should be less than 0 0012 mg therefore the results of reduction in magnetic field around the pvc obstacle were acceptable in these three experiments 5 1 2 the change in magnetic field intensity for an obstacle in the upper packed sand fig 9 a shows the distribution of the change in the magnetic field intensity for an obstacle in the upper packed sand which was overlaid on the photo of this sandbox experiment a significant reduction of magnetic field was located around the obstacle the maximum reduction value was 0 0042 mg at 27 5 47 5 near the center point of the obstacle 23 50 this maximum reduction value was less than 0 0012 mg and the contour line of 0 002 mg was around the obstacle area the reduction values of the magnetic field around the obstacle were acceptable for this experiment these results mean that an obstacle that enters only part of the water surface such as lnapls in aquifers can change the flow pattern of the electric current however its maximum reduction value was less than that shown in fig 8 because only part of the electric current was blocked by the obstacle the electric current could still flow through the saturated silica sand under the obstacle 5 1 3 the change in magnetic field intensity for a clay mass in packed sand fig 9 b shows the distribution of change in the magnetic field intensity overlaid on the photo of the sandbox experiment for a clay mass in the upper packed sand because the colors of both the sand and clay were similar fig 9 b cannot show a clear image of the clay in sandbox the real area of the clay is shown by the blue circle moreover fig 9 b shows a really different result compared to fig 9 a a significant increase in magnetic field was observed around the clay mass the maximum increase was 0 0090 mg at 32 5 47 5 the increasing values of magnetic field around the clay mass were acceptable for this experiment too this result of increasing magnetic field may have been because the electrical resistivity of clay is lower than that of packed sand and thus the clay mass in the upper of packed sand attracted the electric current lines and let the current density increase in the clay hence an increase in magnetic field was observed in this experiment also fig 9 b shows that the current flow pattern moved slightly to the boundary of x 45 this may have been because that the clay mass of lower electrical resistivity was installed near the boundary of x 45 and so the current lines were slightly shifted to this side 5 1 4 the change in magnetic field intensity for the gravel in packed sand fig 9 c shows a contour image overlaid on the photo of the sandbox experiment which shows the distribution of change in the magnetic field intensity for the gravel in the upper packed sand fig 9 c shows that the magnetic field did not change according to the shape of the packed gravel these results mean that the packed gravel did not effectively affect the current flow pattern in this sandbox experiment moreover fig 9 c shows that the current flow pattern moved slightly to the boundary of x 45 this phenomenon was similar to that shown in fig 9 b the maximum increase was 0 0069 mg at 42 5 2 5 and the maximum decrease was 0 0028 mg at 7 5 52 5 although the increasing and decreasing values of the magnetic field were acceptable in this experiment this change should not be related to the packed gravel because this experiment was conducted after the sandbox experiment of clay mass the clay mass was removed and then gravel filled the space and this round space its center point was at 27 48 was near the boundary of x 45 therefore the possible reason may be that the clay and gravel packing procedure slightly disturbed the structure of the packed sand and affected the flow pattern of the electric current 5 1 5 the change in magnetic field intensity for napl in packed sand fig 10 a shows a contour image of the change in the magnetic field intensity for lnapl saturated sand in the sandbox the blue circle is the area that the lnapl saturated sand packed a significant reduction of magnetic field is observed around the blue circle the maximum reduction value was 0 0043 mg at 17 5 32 5 in this experiment these results mean that the lnapl in sand changed the flow pattern of electric current in this sandbox experiment by comparing the reduction value with that of a glass obstacle in sand fig 9 a it was found that the maximum reduction values were almost the same 0 0043 mg and 0 0042 mg for lnapl and the obstacle experiment respectively but they showed obviously different shapes of reduction zone the reduction zones are elliptical and triangular in figs 9 a and 10 a respectively the shapes of the reduction zones were elliptical for the solid cylindrical obstacles in the sandbox experiments although the motor oil density 0 86 g cm3 saturated sand completely filled the space of the short cylinder some motor oil was observed floating out to the water surface during the filling procedure as shown in fig 10 b it was revealed that the na2so4 solution entered part of the outer void of packed sand and pushed out the oil this phenomenon may have changed the solid shape of the motor oil in sand and thus altered the electric current flow pattern around the obstacle thus showing different results compared to the solid cylindrical obstacle 5 1 6 discussion about the different media in sand the use of insulators such as pvc glass and motor oil in the sandbox resulted in significant decreases in the magnetic field as shown in figs 8 9 a and 10 a because of the great contrast in electrical resistivity between the insulators and the packed silica sand the gravel should be higher in electrical resistivity than the silica sand samouëlian et al 2005 however fig 9 c does not show any effect on the distribution of the magnetic field for the gravel in packed sand the possible reason may have been because the gravel and silica sand used in this study were not different enough in electrical resistivity to cause a change in the magnetic field greater than the loq of the measurement system 0 0012 mg however for the clay in packed sand where the clay was lower in electrical resistivity than the silica sand a significant increase in the magnetic field was observed the value of the increase was even greater than that of the decrease in the obstacle experiment the electrical resistivities of clay sand gravel and pvc are about 10 103 104 and 1013 ω m respectively hunt 2005 mohamed 2016 samouëlian et al 2005 according to these values of electrical resistivity the difference between sand and pvc is much greater than that between sand and clay but the decreasing and increasing values were 0 0042 mg and 0 0090 mg for both the pvc obstacle and clay experiments respectively as shown in fig 9 a and b respectively to understand this phenomenon the relationship between the magnetic field intensity and the electrical resistivity should be discussed first according to eq 1 the electric current i is proportional to the voltage v and inversely proportional to the resistance r eq 4 relates magnetic fields b to their source currents i eq 7 is generated by combining eqs 1 and 4 as follows 7 b μ 0 v r 4 π s l l 2 2 s 2 μ 0 v 4 π s l l 2 2 s 2 1 r k 1 r where μ 0 and l are constants if the input voltage v and distance s are constants too the magnetic field intensity b is inversely proportional to the electrical resistivity r based on this inversely proportional relationship if the electrical resistivity is decreased to be 0 1r the magnetic field intensity will be 10b and the difference in magnetic field intensity will be 9b but if the electrical resistivity is increased to be 10r the magnetic field intensity will be 0 1b and the difference in magnetic field intensity will be only 0 9b hence the magnetic field is more sensitive to the decrease in electrical resistivity this relationship can explain why the clay experiment showed a greater change in the magnetic field than the pvc obstacle experiment 5 1 7 discussion about the differences in shape between the obstacles and the images obtained from surveying the images of figs 8 a c and 9 a obtained from the surveying are roughly elliptical in shape with the major axis along the direction of the two electrode connection rather than circular even though the obstacles installed into the packed sand were cylindrical the variation of shape seems to reveal that the current did not flow completely along the surface when the flow passed a cylindrical obstacle gurevich et al 2000 gurevich and friesen 2000 applied a hodograph technique to calculate analytically the 2d distributions of the electric field and the transport current density they showed the current streamlines around a planar obstacle as illustrated in fig 11 a the results of these previous studies validate the observations of this study this phenomenon was also observed when the fluid flows passed a cylindrical obstacle shair et al 1963 nishioka and sato 1974 votyakov and kassinos 2009 zaks and nepomnyashchy 2019 votyakov and kassinos 2009 presented an image fig 11 b and described the flow behavior and flow pattern changes when the fluid flows passed a cylindrical solid obstacle based on these previous studies and the physical principle the current streamlines could separate in front of an insulated obstacle when the current is flowing but not flow to the insulated obstacle accordingly it is reasonable that the current would form an elliptical zone of low current density when the current flow passed a cylindrical obstacle in this sandbox experiment porous media of low electrical resistivity also showed a similar image as shown in fig 9 b because the electric current lines flowed smoothly and concentrated around the clay the flow pattern of electric current did not form a circular image of increasing magnetic field intensity the images of magnetic field obtained from numerical simulations the magnetic field increasing due to a lower resistivity block showed a same result chen et al 2002 yang et al 2018a the extension in shape was obvious and parallel to the direction of current flow 5 1 8 discussion about the scale effect in the sandbox experiment the results of sandbox experiments indicated that the obstacle in packed sand changed the flow pattern of the electric current and altered the distribution of the magnetic field above the sandbox however the results of the sandbox experiments also revealed that it is not easy to clearly show the location and the area of the cylindrical obstacle by using the distribution of the magnetic field intensity such as in fig 7 directly according to the relation between the magnetic field intensity and the electric current eq 4 the magnetic field intensity should be presented theoretically as zero inside the blue circles in fig 7 a c even though the pvc tube was not completely sealed on the bottom of sandbox the measured magnetic field should not have decreased by only about 5 in this sandbox experiment there should therefore be some effects that affected the magnetic field sensor in the sandbox experiments lin et al 2005 reported that when using a sandbox to simulate field activities it is essential to thoroughly understand the scale effect and its consequences so as to ensure an adequate model with the representative simulation results previous studies have reported data distortion under the influence of the scale effect the possible influence of the scale effect in the current study should therefore be discussed the dimensions of the sandbox and the magnetic sensor were 45 cm 60 cm 90 cm and 3 2 cm 3 2 cm 12 2 cm respectively and the grid spacing of survey was 5 cm compared with the sandbox and the grid spacing the sensor was large enough to lead to the scale effect in sandbox experiment for example not only the magnetic signal directly below this sensor but also surrounding signals entered this sensor illustrated as sensor 1 in fig 12 fig 12 shows that the sensor above an obstacle sensor 2 in fig 12 received some magnetic signals generated by the current nearby this phenomenon led to poor resolution when this technology was used in the sandbox scale experiment silliman and simpson 1987 indicated that the observation of laboratory scale phenomena can lead to the development of new theoretical approaches to the basic problem due to the scale effect the laboratory scale results cannot represent a real field situation wang et al 2013 reported that the scale effect is produced when the similarity law is not fulfilled from the prototype to the model however it might be reduced to a minimum by running a test in a sufficiently large facility according to this inference the influence of the scale effect could be minimized when the proposed technology is used in a real field test 5 2 field test 5 2 1 magnetic field survey the data acquisition point in the northwest corner was set to coordinates 0 0 then the values of the magnetic field intensity b and the corresponding coordinates are presented as a distribution of the magnetic field intensity fig 13 fig 13 shows that the maximum value of the magnetic field was 0 85 mg at 39 2 3 it was affected by the electrode installed in monitoring well m 02 the west side of the 2 gasoline diesel fueling island also showed a high magnetic field zone and its maximum value was approximately 0 6 mg according to the findings of the sandbox experiments this zone could contain more clay and reveal a lower electrical resistivity in contrast the values of the magnetic field were less than 0 1 mg around the 3 4 and 5 gasoline diesel fueling islands the low magnetic field intensity might imply that the current density was low in this area as the electric current was input with an intensity of 0 4 a and as it flowed through the aquifer between monitoring wells m 01 and m 02 the low current densities around the 3 4 and 5 fueling islands might be attributed to an obstacle in the aquifer of this area the possible obstacle would be fuel from the gas station that leaked to the aquifer according to the behavior of the electric current flow passing through an obstacle shown in sandbox experiments the contaminated zone has to have a specific characteristic in the flow field of electric current a lower current density than its surrounding area in mmr method the mmr anomaly is a result by comparing the measured field value with the theoretical field value at the center of the survey line edwards et al 1978 besides the magnetic field is insensitive to the absolute conductivity of the subsurface so it is suggested that the variations in relative are important when mmr assessment is performed dentith and mudge 2014 according to the mentioned above and the results of the sandbox experiments there are two specific characteristics in the magnetic field that can be obtained from the measurement system 1 a zone with a lower magnetic field strength than the theoretical value 2 a zone with a lower magnetic field strength than its surrounding area the electric current was 0 4 a and the survey depth was 4 m in this field test thus the theoretical value of magnetic field intensity was found to be 0 2 mg by using eq 4 based on the two specific characteristics mentioned above there were two zones at this site that could possibly have been contaminated by the leaked fuel one was the area around the 3 4 and 5 fueling islands zone 1 in fig 14 because it exhibited the first and second specific characteristics the other was the area between the 1 and 2 fueling islands zone 2 in fig 14 because this zone was small narrow and had a higher magnetic field zone nearby it could have been affected by the zone of higher magnetic field west of it this phenomenon is called the scale effect which was found and discussed in our sandbox experiments hence this study ignored the first specific characteristic and extended the area to be a zone of less than 0 3 mg according to the second specific characteristic zone 1 was estimated to be the main contaminated zone with the maximum area of 243 m2 the boundary of zone 1 was approximately along the magnetic contour line of 0 2 mg theoretical value zone 2 was approximately 50 m2 in area and its boundary was approximately along the magnetic contour line of 0 3 mg moreover zone 2 looked like an extension of zone 1 in terms of shape location and relevance the underground structure of secondary containment did not significantly influence the results of the magnetic field survey even though its bottom was about 0 5 m below the groundwater surface these results may have been because the electrodes were placed about 1 0 m under the groundwater surface and thus they were also about 0 5 m below the bottom of structure which could have minimized the possible influence in this field test 5 2 2 soil sample screening and quantitative analysis the 18 considered soil sampling locations s1 s18 as shown in fig 14 were decided according to the survey results of the magnetic field at the test site soil samples s1 to s12 were used to verify the contamination condition of zone 1 and soil samples s13 to s18 were used to verify the contamination condition of zone 2 in addition to the s1 s2 s5 and s10 samples a 7 m deep soil core was obtained for all the sampling points based on the conditions of the field sampling procedure s1 s2 and s5 were located in the zone of concrete secondary containment they could have been blocked by the concrete structure therefore the lengths of the soil cores were 3 m 3 m and 4 m for s1 s2 and s5 respectively moreover the sampling work of s10 was terminated by an unknown hard object and we only obtained a 3 m deep soil core all the soil sample cores were measured for every 1 m segment by using a field fid instrument the selected segment samples for the laboratory analysis after the field fid screening are listed in table 2 moreover the analysis results of these 43 soil segment samples are presented in table 3 the soil tph concentrations in table 3 are listed according to their sample name and the corresponding depth table 3 shows that samples s6 s7 and s8 had higher tph concentrations 10 000 mg kg among the 18 soil sampling points the main contaminated soil was found at a depth between 4 m and 6 m it should relate to the fluctuation of the groundwater levels soil samples s3 s4 and s9 contained a high concentration of tphs approximately 3000 mg kg these six contaminated soil samples were located in zone 1 shown in fig 14 moreover soil sample s15 had a high tph concentration of 4892 mg kg in the depth range of 3 m to 4 m however this soil sample was located in zone 2 shown in fig 14 soil samples s5 and s12 were the other two soil samples in zone 1 but their tph concentrations were nd and 195 mg kg respectively the result of s12 revealed low contamination at this sample location the sampling work of s5 was terminated at the depth of 4 m by the concrete structure of the storage tank this implied that soil sample s5 might be isolated with the contaminated soil by this hard object thus we obtained the result of nd in the quantitative analysis soil samples s1 s2 s10 and s11 were outside but near zone 1 among them s1 and s2 showed low tph concentrations because the concrete construction of the storage tank isolated the soil samples with the soil under this construction s10 showed a low tph concentration of 153 mg kg but this result only indicated soil data from 3 m below the ground surface because of the incomplete sampling of s1 s2 and s10 the quantitative analysis results of these three soil samples could not indicate whether their locations were contaminated or not moreover soil sample s11 showed a low tph concentration of 79 5 mg kg which revealed a low contamination result at the s11 sampling location soil samples s13 s14 s16 s17 and s18 were outside but near zone 2 their tph concentrations were 101 mg kg 15 3 mg kg 88 9 mg kg 24 8 mg kg and 25 mg kg respectively their results indicated low contamination around zone 2 5 2 3 comparison of magnetic field survey and soil sampling analysis in this study we determined the potential contaminated zones zone 1 and zone 2 in the field test by the specific characteristics of the magnetic field distribution to evaluate both methods of the magnetic field survey and the soil sample analysis four samples s1 s2 s5 and s10 were initially ignored because of their incomplete sampling there were seven soil samples s3 s4 s6 s7 s8 s9 and s12 inside zone 1 and one soil sample s11 outside but near zone 1 the soil samples inside zone 1 except for s12 presented high tph concentrations ranging from 2638 to 14 362 mg kg they all exceeded the taiwan epa legislation limit of 1000 mg kg of tph for soil taiwan epa 2011 however soil sample s12 presented a very anomalous result this sampling point had a low magnetic field strength but its tph concentration was only 195 mg kg as shown in fig 14 s12 was located near the boundary of zone 1 and near the connection line of the two electrodes monitoring wells m 01 and m 02 based on the observations and the discussion of our sandbox experiments current streamlines could separate in front of an obstacle s12 seemed to be in the low current density zone where the current streamlines separated this physical behavior of the electric current could explain why s12 was low in terms of both the tph concentration and the magnetic field intensity moreover sampling point s11 was outside the potential contaminated zone zone 1 and it too revealed a low tph concentration of 79 5 mg kg in summary except for sampling point s12 which was affected by the flow behavior of the electric current the potential contaminated zone zone 1 obtained from the survey of this new technology was significantly correlated with the tph analysis of soil samples for the other potential contaminated zone zone 2 only one soil sampling point was included but five were outside the zone and nearby this study extended the area to be a zone of less than 0 3 mg according to the second specific characteristic and set sampling point s15 inside the zone at the point with a magnetic field intensity ranging between 0 2 and 0 3 mg the tph analysis revealed that the tph concentration of s15 exceeded the taiwan epa legislation limit for soil at 4892 mg kg moreover the other five soil samples outside zone 2 presented low tph concentrations of less than 101 mg kg this result indicated that this potential contaminated zone determined by following the second specific characteristic had a good fit with the tph analysis of the soil samples if zone 2 was determined according to the first specific characteristic only and we ignored the possible influence of the scale effect we might have incorrectly investigated soil sample s15 to sum up by comparing the potential contaminated zones determined by the specific characteristics with the soil samples analysis only soil sample s12 did not obtain a corresponding result among the 14 evaluated soil samples this revealed that the magnetic field survey method was 92 9 accurate in this field test 5 2 4 comparison of magnetic field survey technology to ert rosales et al 2014 applied both the 2d ert method and soil sampling at two different lnapl contaminated petrol stations campsa and petroner three ert profiles 70 m long and 15 m deep were obtained from each site three soil boreholes 10 m deep were designed according to the ert results at the campsa site and three boreholes related to anomalies in the ert profiles 8 m deep were designed at the petroner site the diesel range organics dros c10 c28 in the soil were analyzed quantitatively to compare with the ert survey the authors reported that the resistive anomaly zones could not be related to the contamination by dros in these layers of sedimentary materials the maximum concentration of dros about 5000 mg kg was at a zone with electrical resistivity values ranging from 30 to 50 ω m and the maximum electrical resistivity value about 2000 ω m was at a zone with a dro concentration of about 25 mg kg the authors also reported that the ert survey was affected by the underground storage tanks and the gravel layer some previous works also reported that underground structures rosales et al 2012 wang et al 2015 and gravel layers mohammed et al 2019 mostafa et al 2018 samouëlian et al 2005 wilkinson et al 2010 did show high resistivity areas on ert profiles the distribution of the magnetic field of the sandbox experiment fig 9 c did not show any abnormal effect by the packed gravel moreover the soil profiles of this test site indicated that the main soil type was fine sand and gravel under the groundwater surface at around the s04 soil drilling hole fig 5 the distribution of the magnetic field in the field test fig 13 did not show a low magnetic field zone in the corresponding area the zone west of the 2 fueling station caused by the high electrical resistivity media as mentioned in section 5 1 6 the lower sensitivity of the magnetic field survey technology for media of high electrical resistivity could be one of the possible reasons the other reason could because the fine sand soil and the fine sand and gravel soil at this site were not different enough in electrical resistivity to cause a change in the magnetic field greater than the loq of the measurement system 0 0012 mg however the huge difference in the electrical resistivity between the fine sand soil and the lnapl contaminated soil could cause a detectable change in the magnetic field intensity by our measurement system 5 2 5 discussion about the scale effect in field test to understand the relationship between the tph concentration and the magnetic field intensity in the field test the plots of the maximum tph concentration of every sample point versus the corresponding magnetic field intensity for the field test are presented in fig 15 the correlation coefficient between the tph concentration and the magnetic field intensity was not very good this proved that the tph concentration could not be well estimated by using the value of the magnetic field intensity however these data formed a strip shaped region which revealed the following trend the higher the tph concentration the lower the magnetic field intensity this result indicated that contaminants such as tph in the aquifer would surely influence the current flow pattern and alter the distribution of the magnetic field intensity on the ground furthermore we divided the 14 evaluated field sample data into two groups zone 1 and zone 2 both groups showed better correlation between the tph concentration and the magnetic field intensity however fig 15 shows that the magnetic field values of zone 2 were larger than those of zone 1 the possible reason for this difference might be related to the scale effect as compared to zone 1 zone 2 was long and narrow with a total size of approximately 50 m2 and next to it was a zone with a higher magnetic field thus the magnetic field value of every survey point in zone 2 might have included not only the signal value directly below this sampling point but also those of nearby signals hence zone 2 had a larger magnetic field value because of the mixing of some magnetic signals outside the contaminated zone based on these results the scale effect was observed not only in the sandbox scale experiment but also in the field test 5 2 6 discussion about the limitations of the magnetic field survey technology the magnetic field survey technology was successfully applied to the sandbox experiments and field test in this study no matter whether the porous media was sand fine sand clay or gravel because this technology is based on the current flow pattern in an aquifer it obtains the current density or distribution in the aquifer by measuring the corresponding distribution of the magnetic field hence obstacles and lnapl contaminated soil even clay can be investigated and delineated by this technology the results of this study also indicated that unconsolidated sediment of higher electrical resistivity such as gravel cannot be significantly presented on the contour image even so we should be careful when using the measured data of the magnetic field because the magnetic measurement will be affected by several factors to combine the findings of the sandbox experiments and the field test in this study the following three factors were considered 1 scale effect 2 flow pattern disturbance and 3 external interference the scale effect and the flow pattern disturbance are discussed above the external interference can be avoided basically by using a blank scan and selecting the best frequency of low noise the electrodes and the cables are the main source of external interference fig 14 shows that sampling point s18 was close to the electrode of m 02 and located in a zone with a strong magnetic field therefore the value of the magnetic field intensity was affected by the electrode of m 02 fig 15 shows that the magnetic field intensity of s18 was approximately 0 6 mg and it was far away from the trend curve of zone 2 accordingly the magnetic field intensity of s18 was evidently affected by the electrode and cable of m 02 the limitation of the magnetic field survey technology in terms of depth also is a matter of concern when applying this technology the electrodes are set in wells at the depths of interest a flow field of electric current is generated at around this corresponding depth the magnetic field intensity on the ground is measured according to eq 4 if the observation point p is at the connection line of the two electrodes where s d and the distance of electrodes is much greater than that of the depth l d the detected value of the resulting magnetic field is related to both the electric current and the depth of the electrode fig 16 which was plotted based on eq 4 gives the theoretical value of the magnetic field intensity according to the given output current and survey depth for example the electric current and survey depth were 0 4 a and 4 0 m respectively in the field test following the curve of current 0 4 a the corresponding value of the magnetic field is found to be 0 2 mg at a depth of 4 m however the limit of the magnetic field survey technology in terms of depth can also be estimated using fig 16 if the output electric current is 0 4 a then by following the curve of current 0 4 a the corresponding value of the magnetic field will be 0 02 mg and 0 01 mg at survey depths of 40 m and 80 m respectively because the mdl and loq of our measurement system were 0 0003 mg and 0 0012 mg respectively to obtain an acceptable resolution under the conditions of this test we determined the limit of the survey depth to be 80 m because the theoretical value of the corresponding magnetic field is almost ten times the loq when an electric current is injected in the groundwater by wells most of the electric current will flow in the saturated zone of high conductivity so this technology cannot be used to survey the residual napl in vadose zone where the current density is very low however this technology cannot be limited by the types of soil because the magnetic field survey is insensitive to the absolute conductivity of the subsurface but is sensitive to the variations of the conductivity dentith and mudge 2014 6 conclusions in this study we applied an electric current flow pattern and its resulting magnetic field to develop a new application for investigating contaminated sites sandbox experiments were conducted to observe the behaviors of the current flow pattern and the magnetic distribution a field test of an lnapl contaminated site was conducted by combining the magnetic field survey and the soil sample analysis in the sandbox experiments we created several different current flow patterns by changing the location and depth of the insulated obstacle we also installed clay mass gravel and lnapl saturated sand in the sandbox except for gravel the results of the magnetic field survey successfully showed corresponding images that described the location and the area of the obstacle gravel was the exception because the gravel and silica sand used in this study were not different enough in electrical resistivity to cause a change in magnetic field greater than the loq of the measurement system in the sandbox experiments the scale effect impacted the measurement of magnetic field and seriously reduced the resolution of our measurement system we also found that the physical behavior of the current flow disturbance could cause a distorted image relevant to the shape of the obstacle in the field test we created a flow field of electric current in the aquifer and collected 157 data items on the ground to plot the contour image of the magnetic field intensity instead of using the values of the magnetic field intensity two potential contaminated zones were determined according to the specific characteristics of the contour image furthermore 43 soil segment samples from the 18 soil sample points were analyzed quantitatively and used to verify the results of the magnetic field survey this field test exhibited a high accuracy of 92 9 which implied that the lnapl distribution of the contaminated site was successfully investigated by this new technology moreover a gravel mixture zone and underground structure did not appear on the contour image instead of the vertical image of electrical resistivity obtained from ert this technology showed a horizontal contour image of the magnetic field intensity with less interference by the unconsolidated sediments of higher electric resistivity the contour image obtained from this technology was a projection of the horizontal level such as in a medical x ray image and so it was difficult to accurately estimate the depth of the contaminant plume using the current instrument however the magnetic field survey technology offers some useful information for site investigation in a different view and form and it will be helpful in investigating contaminated sites credit authorship contribution

5438,long term over exploitation and unsustainable practices have caused severe groundwater depletion and deterioration across many regions throughout the world this has triggered a series of negative impacts on human populations and the natural environment to understand groundwater related processes and explore ways to mitigate pertaining issues large numbers of groundwater related studies have been performed by the research community in this study all research papers published between 1978 and 2017 incorporating groundwater in the title keywords or abstract were retrieved from the web of science core collection wscc of these a total of 80 763 papers were identified as being groundwater related publications our analysis revealed that groundwater research output increased significantly during this period at average annual rate of 10 1 exceeding the general trend for the wscc 3 4 institutions based in developed countries have held predominance in publishing groundwater research however research output from developing countries such as china and india experienced much growth in recent years development trends were assessed among the research topics of groundwater depletion contamination remediation technology and sustainable management all of which experienced increased research output among sub topics groundwater depletion and sustainable management research have increased as a percentage of total groundwater studies while studies of arsenic chlorinated solvents btex bioremediation and natural attenuation have dropped off in recent years additionally as groundwater related research output has increased rapidly robust secondary analyses and meta analyses are called for in order to make sense of the rapidly expanding body of groundwater research literature moreover owing to the many complexities surround groundwater issues greater interdisciplinary collaboration is also called for keywords sustainable groundwater groundwater depletion groundwater contamination groundwater remediation bibliometric analysis 1 introduction groundwater is an essential natural resource it is estimated that a third of the world s total water consumption is provided by groundwater systems siebert et al 2010 it also serves as a vital supplier of irrigation water and replenishes surface water systems aeschbachhertig and gleeson 2012 famiglietti 2014 however in many areas especially arid and semi arid regions groundwater has been depleted because of long term groundwater overexploitation huang et al 2015 jamshidzadeh and mirbagheri 2011 alarmingly high depletion rates have been observed in north western india 40 mm year the high plains of the usa 27 6 mm year and the north china plain 22 0 mm year famiglietti 2014 feng et al 2013 matthew et al 2009 scanlon et al 2012 some of the detrimental consequences of groundwater depletion include increased water cost land subsidence and seawater intrusion erban et al 2013 galloway and burbey 2011 hakan 2013 lei and jiao 2014 likewise deterioration in quality is a major concern for groundwater systems burow et al 2010 foster and chilton 2003 jia et al 2019 nitrate pollution has become a pervasive problem worldwide gu et al 2013 gupta et al 2011 and arsenic contamination threatens public health in many regions rodriguez lado et al 2013 scott et al 2010 it is estimated that 19 6 million people in china and 35 77 million people in bangladesh could potentially be affected by arsenic in groundwater edmunds et al 2015 rodriguez lado et al 2013 in addition to the direct health risks associated with contaminated drinking water food safety is also affected by land irrigation with contaminated groundwater chang et al 2010 rahman et al 2014 over the past decades large numbers of research studies have been carried out to address groundwater related issues niu et al 2014 as the numbers of published research articles grow important literature reviews have been put forward in order to extract core achievements within various specific fields gee and hillel 2010 o connor et al 2018 however such reviews may overlook development trends across the broader field of groundwater research bibliometric analysis offers a more comprehensive perspective by analysing publication trends in various generic categories such as countries un member states institutions journals citations and keywords jinshui et al 2012 pritchard 1969 several software packages have been developed as tools to help conduct bibliometric analyses such as bibexcel citespace omniviz and vosviewer liang et al 2017 velasco munoz et al 2018 a few bibliometric studies have already been performed on groundwater research literature niu et al 2014 schwartz et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 however they tend to focus on specific research questions e g schwartz et al focused on groundwater contamination and zhang et al focused on groundwater remediation it is important to understand the development trends in different branches of groundwater research therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 develop a logistic regression classifier to categorize research studies into different classes 2 describe the development trend and provide a comprehensive view of the groundwater research from 1978 to 2017 3 explore the geographical distribution of groundwater related studies and identify the drivers underlying them and 4 trace 40 year development trends for different research branches pertaining to the field of groundwater namely groundwater depletion contamination remediation and sustainable management 2 methods 2 1 data collection the web of science core collection wscc is an influential multidisciplinary academic abstract and citation database falagas et al 2008 over 12 000 journals on natural sciences engineering social sciences and arts are included therefore the wscc is a qualified data source for bibliometric analyses fig 1 shows the identification and classification process followed to acquire pertaining studies in the groundwater field for this all papers published from 1978 to 2017 incorporating groundwater in their title keywords or abstract were retrieved from wscc the search was operated on 22 january 2019 for each article the title publication year abstract keywords journal authors and author addresses were exported into an excel spreadsheet www microsoft com excel after removing duplicated articles 99 344 publications remained 2 2 data processing although all retrieved publications had at least one instance of the term groundwater in their title keywords or abstract this was deemed insufficient to demonstrate that all the publications were actually groundwater related publications therefore classification algorithms were developed to exclude inappropriate papers the classification process involved three steps firstly publications with at least one groundwater related term in their title or keywords not abstract were considered as groundwater related publications these terms are as follows groundwater ground water confined water underground water aquifer subsurface water subterranean water unconfined water artesian water phreatic water crack water fracture water fissure water crevice water karst water karstic water well water and spring water of the 99 344 publications retrieved from the wscc 29 765 papers were found to contain at least one of these groundwater related terms in their title or keywords secondly 100 of the remaining publications were randomly selected inspected and labelled as either groundwater related publications or non groundwater related it was found that the number of groundwater related terms included in the abstract was related to the likelihood of an article being a groundwater related publication less than 10 of articles containing a single groundwater related term in the abstract were found to be groundwater related publications whereas publications with four or more groundwater related terms were all 100 labelled groundwater related publications fig 2 a thirdly the probability that publications containing different numbers of groundwater related terms being groundwater related publications was calculated and a logistic regression classifier prepared and established using r with the islr package www r project org logistic regression is considered the most useful for 2 d classification problems abdulhamit and ergun 2005 dreiseitl and ohno machado 2002 worth and cronin 2003 i e for classifying publications as either groundwater related or non groundwater related the logistic regression classifier established to solve this problem used the following logistic function p x e β 0 β 1 x 1 e β 0 β 1 x where p represents the probability of the occurrence of event x β 0 and β 1 are unknown coefficients that are estimated by maximizing the likelihood of event x occurring abdulhamit and ergun 2005 the values estimated for β 0 and β 1 are shown in fig 2b and the associated p value was significantly less than 0 001 the logistic regression indicates that when groundwater related terms appear twice in the abstract there is a probability higher than 90 that the publication is groundwater related whereas when only one groundwater related term appears in the abstract the probability is only 7 1 consequently the publications with only a single groundwater related term in their abstract were removed from the study in this way a total of 80 763 papers were identified as groundwater related publications 29 765 papers with at least one groundwater related term in their title or keywords 50 998 with at least two of these terms in their abstract based on the results of the logistic regression a classification criterion was developed which was used to classify publications for certain topics papers with at least one related term in the title or keywords or at least two terms in the abstract were classified into related branches 2 3 further data mining and visualization to classify publications into different categories data mining was performed using coco r http www ssw uni linz ac at coco in this study word frequency analysis was used to evaluate text and extract the main topics from groundwater related publications with both structured and unstructured data processed han et al 2017 the distribution of groundwater related publications was explored and visualized using the gis software package arcgis www arcgis com to visualize research trends in different aspects of groundwater research a keyword list for different subcategories was developed table s1 with classifications for other topics based on the groundwater related terms listed in section 2 2 these keywords were used in order to create 5 year moving average trends 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall research trends in the past 40 years the number of groundwater related publications has been increasing over the past 40 years fig 3 there were only 149 groundwater related publications in 1978 whereas 6000 papers were published in 2017 the growth in publication number from 1978 to 1990 was relatively slow after strong yet fluctuating growth period between 1990 and 2000 the output of groundwater related publications underwent stable rise in number the wider water related research field also saw the number of publications increase significatly the ratio groundwater to water related publications increased from 2 3 in 1978 to 3 6 in 2017 indicating that groundwater has drawn a somewhat increasing proportion of hydrology research attention in the past decades the average annual growth in the number of groundwater related publications and the total number of wscc publications from 1978 to 2017 was 10 1 and 4 6 respectively furthermore the ratio of groundwater related publications to total publications in wscc has increased significantly over the 40 years rising from only 0 03 in 1978 to 0 20 in 2017 word frequency analysis was conducted on the keywords of groundwater related publications presenting a general map of prevalent topics table 1 besides water or the groundwater related terms listed in section 2 2 soil s was the most frequently found word reflecting the close relationship between groundwater and soil the high frequency of the word model s indicates that modelling is an essential aspect in much groundwater research system s in third place indicates that groundwater is likely to be considered from a system perspective transport not only refers to the movement of groundwater but also to the migration of contaminants within groundwater and takes fourth place similar to transport understanding the flow of groundwater is crucial to comprehending groundwater systems and contamination migration the high frequency of contamination and pollution indicates the importance of studies related to groundwater contamination adsorption a popular method for groundwater remediation and a natural process in groundwater systems has attracted wide attention as for pollutants nitrate occurred most frequently followed by arsenic possibly owing to their wide distribution and associated health risks groundwater is often extracted as a source of drinking water explaining the high frequency of the term drinking water interestingly china and india are the two countries occurring the most frequently within the keywords possibly due to serious groundwater issues caused by intensive development in these countries kulkarni et al 2015 rodriguez lado et al 2013 3 2 geographic distribution researchers based at institutions located in 152 different countries un member states have contributed published groundwater related studies as shown in fig 4 a due to the fact that 50 of the articles published between 1978 and 1997 lack author addresses this section only considers publications from 1998 to 2017 researchers based in the usa and china have contributed the most groundwater related papers with 16 128 and 8 589 groundwater related publications allocated to these countries respectively fig 4b germany was third with 3786 groundwater related publications followed by india 3707 and the uk 2751 the proportion of groundwater related publications as a proportion of total wscc publications for different countries un member states was calculated in general countries in western asia southern asia and africa conducted a higher proportion of their total research on the subject of groundwater than countries in other regions among all countries djibouti performed the highest portion 3 03 of their total research on groundwater fig 4c since 2016 the number of groundwater related publications deriving from china has exceeded that of the usa and india s output overtook that of germany and the uk in 2011 fig 4d the average annual growth rates of both the number and proportion of groundwater related publications were also calculated table 2 malaysia has had the highest growth rate in groundwater related publications 25 26 followed by indonesia 24 26 tunisia 24 05 and algeria 23 71 the largest growth rate in their proportion of groundwater related publications was 10 41 for argentina followed by romania 9 14 algeria 8 21 tunisia 7 87 and slovenia 7 11 most of the countries who experienced the fastest growth are in asia europe and africa the amount of groundwater related studies conducted by researchers in developed countries was generally much higher than those in developing countries but growth in research output from developing countries is greater a longer research history in developed countries supports their institutions to be more comprehensive and abundant in publishing groundwater studies niu et al 2014 groundwater research however is arguably more essential for developing countries feng et al 2013 owing to rapid economic development population growth and urbanization being associated with serious groundwater degradation and depletion in these countries bierkens et al 2014 northern china and north west india have experienced large groundwater depletion feng et al 2013 rodell et al 2009 salinity potentially toxic elements and organic compounds have been discovered in groundwater systems in many developing countries including in turkey vietnam china and india agca et al 2014 duong et al 2015 hou et al 2018 raja and venkatesan 2010 such contamination can derive either from natural sources or anthropic activities e g untreated discharge leakage from landfill or industrial sites groundwater depletion and contamination is hindering sustainable development in many developing countries which impels the research community to more actively support sustainable groundwater management 3 3 research trend analysis 3 3 1 groundwater depletion because of its geographic accessibility and low vulnerability to droughts groundwater is considered a vital resource for human nature systems chen et al 2010 foster and chilton 2003 however over extraction has caused severe groundwater depletion in many places globally famiglietti 2014 graaf et al 2017 consequently multiple negative impacts have arisen including increased water cost land subsidence and saline intrusion which have impacted human production systems especially agricultural production in arid and semi arid areas lei and jiao 2014 ye et al 2015 within this research topic studies on groundwater storage groundwater recharge land subsidence seawater intrusion have been published in recent years groundwater studies in this topic have also emerged relating to nasa s gravity recovery and climate experiment grace fig 5 quantifying groundwater recharge and storage including studies of groundwater depth patterns and analysing groundwater mass balances are needed for evaluating water resource availability bhanja et al 2014 moiwo et al 2012 groundwater recharge is historically the most productive research topic within the groundwater depletion topic with the most publications and an exponential increase in publication number r2 0 970 the percentage of groundwater studies on this topic dropped in the 1980s but then grew rapidly in subsequent years fig 5b the number of studies related to groundwater storage has grown continuously since the late 1990s also with an exponential growth pattern r2 0 987 similar to groundwater recharge the percentage of groundwater related studies on groundwater storage dropped in the 1980s and early 1990s though not as severely in recent years elopements such as nasa s gravity recovery and climate experiment grace have enabled researchers to quantify groundwater storage remotely matthew et al 2009 sun et al 2015 which provides a clear example of a novel technology being a decisive driver of a new research direction groundwater depletion is mainly caused by unbalanced groundwater extraction and recharge scanlon et al 2012 therefore carefully managed aquifer recharge is crucial for alleviating groundwater depletion chinnasamy et al 2018 o connor and hou 2019 research output on related geo hazards including seawater intrusion and land subsidence increased after the late 1990s land subsidence induced by groundwater overexploitation has triggered considerable research output seawater intrusion at coastal regions has aggravated water scarcity and led to land salinization lei and jiao 2014 the growth rates of these two research topics have risen simultaneously and steadily 3 3 2 groundwater contamination groundwater contamination is a crucial research topic for many countries harmful contaminants can derive from natural and anthropogenic sources particularly being associated with long term overutilization of fertilizers and pesticides unrestricted discharge of wastewater and waste leaching jia et al 2020 wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020a therefore countries that have undergone intensive agricultural and industrial development are at greater risk of groundwater pollution gu et al 2013 pokkate et al 2013 the sources distribution transportation transformation remediation and risk e g human health risk of groundwater contaminants have been widely explored by researchers for many years within this topic research trends pertaining to common contaminants are illustrated in fig 6 among groundwater contaminants nitrates and arsenic are the two most widely studied historically nitrates were the most studied and were included in a high percentage 9 of groundwater related publications the number of arsenic studies however has increased quite rapidly since the late 1990s although it dropped as a proportion of groundwater related publications recently decreasing from 9 2 in 2010 to 7 8 in 2011 chlorinated solvents and btex benzene toluene ethylxylene and xylene the third and fourth most studied contaminants respectively were widely studied in the late 1990s and early 2000s they were included in 5 and 4 of all groundwater studies respectively until the new millennium but their research significance dropped in the early 2000s with a slight revival in more recent years fluoride related publications displayed an increasing trend since the late 2000s in fact the number of publications regarding fluoride has exceeded those of chlorinated solvents and btex in recent years lead and chromium are another two important contaminants of concern with growing research interest the growth in the rate of studies being produced on chromium being somewhat higher than those on lead the research contribution of different countries for each groundwater contaminant was explored see fig s1 in the supplementary material the analysis shows that developing countries such as china and india have played a significant role in groundwater contamination research for example nitrate related research originating from china has exceeded that of the usa since 2016 overall trends in the number of nitrate related studies for many developed countries have been fluctuating or decreasing while increasing rapidly in some developing countries particularly china the number of arsenic related studies from the usa india and bangladesh appeared to fluctuate without an obvious overall increase or decrease but those originating from china have risen steadily fluoride publications were mainly contributed by researchers based in india with 2 3 times more related publications than those in china or the usa the usa and germany were the two key contributors to btex related studies in the late 1990s and early 2000s but research output from these two countries has since decreased in recent years china has recently become the largest contributor of btex studies due to wide distribution of such contaminants qi et al 2020a b although output from the usa still remains at a comparable level the relative decrease in groundwater studies that were performed on chlorinated solvents in the 2010s fig 6b relates to a drop in research output from the usa in china and india the publication output on chlorinated solvents has continuously increased in the past decades with 10 year growth rates of 19 and 12 respectively heavy metals have become an increasingly popular research topic due to its wide distribution in soil and groundwater and detrimental impact to public health and food security wang et al 2020c the number of chromium related groundwater studies performed by chinese research institutions have risen considerably meanwhile the number of heavy metal related groundwater studies also increased in many developed countries but at a much slower rate 3 3 3 groundwater remediation considering the severe extent of contamination in many places cleaning up groundwater contamination is considered an imperative for modern society qi et al 2020b in the past few decades groundwater remediation technologies have been researched rather intensively research trends for major remediation technologies including bioremediation adsorption chemical oxidation natural attenuation and nanomaterial assisted remediation are presented in fig 7 a b ever since the late 1990s research into bioremediation technology has led among publications on groundwater remediation in the early 2000s the number of studies on bioremediation plateaued for a short while before increasing in the following years research into adsorption technology caught up with bioremediation in the most recent years adsorption research is shown to have grown exponentially since the early 2000 s r2 0 97 however from 2014 the rate of growth in publication output eased chemical oxidation as an effective and feasible remediation technology has become a preferable option for researchers showing an obvious increase since the late 1990 s nanotechnology has attracted much research interest over a wide spectrum of environmental pollution treatments mukherjee et al 2016 wang et al 2020b nanomaterials have been applied widely in groundwater remediation especially nanoscale zero valent iron agarwal and joshi 2010 thomé et al 2015 yuan and qi 2014 consequently both the number and percentage of studies related to nanotechnology in groundwater research has increased significantly since the early 2000 s unlike for other technologies studies on natural attenuation which is identified as a sustainable remediation option suiling and mulligan 2006 increased sharply in the late 1990s but plateaued after that period trends in research on the remediation of different target contaminants are shown in fig 7c d in this analysis only groundwater publications specifically pertaining to remediation are included across all contamination related studies nitrates play the most dominant role yet these are exceeded by arsenic studies in studies that relate to remediation possibly the higher toxicity of arsenic than nitrates accounts for the higher demand for studies on arsenic remediation choong et al 2007 this is further evidence that the toxicity of a contaminant is a decisive component in the urgency to consider it zhang et al 2012 studies on the remediation of chlorinated solvents and btex in groundwater appear to closely mirror each other although studies on pb contamination are numerous than those on cr fig 7 studies on cr remediation have outgrown those on pb remediation both the number and percentage of chromium related studies were higher in remediation studies after 2002 fig 7c d 3 3 4 sustainable groundwater resource management compared to studies on the sustainability of surface water systems groundwater has gained much less attention despite serious depletion and deterioration of groundwater supplies in both developed and developing countries hu et al 2010 jacobs and holway 2004 recently however sustainable groundwater management has been called for which is closely related to a number if sustainable development climate change agriculture and drinking water supply hu et al 2010 rasool et al 2016 moreover the vulnerability and resilience of groundwater serving as a basis for groundwater sustainability have also been explored nobre et al 2007 green and sustainable remediation technologies especially thoese involving nature based solutions have drawn increasing attention in the international community wang et al 2019a fig 8 presents temporal trends for the five main topics related to sustainable groundwater management vulnerability and resilience have experienced an increase in both the number and percentage of studies groundwater vulnerability studies have mainly been conducted to map the areas susceptible to contamination with vulnerability models such as the gis based drastic model for assessing groundwater vulnerability aiming to characterise and protect groundwater li and merchant 2013 neshat et al 2014 the resilience of groundwater to climate change and droughts appears to have been a largely unexplored domain guo et al 2015 furthermore sustainable groundwater management has intrinsic relationships with systems concerning agricultural production drinking water supply and wider environmental issues including climate change gurdak 2017 hu et al 2010 the greatest importance has been attached to agriculture fig 8 with the percentage of groundwater studies incorporating agriculture exceeding 12 in 2015 as groundwater is an essential source of agriculture irrigation water the themes within agriculture studies mainly include 1 food security caused by groundwater depletion 2 the negative consequences agricultural activities have on groundwater e g nitrate and pesticide contamination and 3 food safety issues generated from groundwater contamination additionally because groundwater serves as a fundamental supply of drinking water especially in rural areas and arid regions rodriguez lado et al 2013 human health is affected directly through intake of contaminated groundwater hossain 2006 the resulting health problems after consuming groundwater contaminants may include neurological damage e g hg and pb and life threatening cancers o connor et al 2019 2020 türkdoğan et al 2003 zhang et al 2020b reflecting their significance drinking water related studies have also risen in both number and percentage meanwhile the research trend of climate change studies related to groundwater has experienced significant growth in the past decades especially since the late 2000s the themes within this topic mainly include 1 the influence of climate change on groundwater resources particularly in groundwater recharge and discharge and 2 using groundwater to support climate change adaptation the output of different countries of studies on the above topics from were explored see fig s2 in the supplementary material for vulnerability the usa contributed the most studies followed by china and italy although the difference between these countries has been shrinking in recent years interestingly research on groundwater vulnerability from iran grew very quickly only 24 countries in the world have investigated groundwater resilience and only 8 of those are developing countries the usa was the most fruitful country for agriculture related studies contributing nearly twice as many as china this may be because the usa is one of the key grain producing countries of the world and suffers from groundwater issues owing to food production activities for climate change china has shown a sharp increase in number of studies published during recent years and became the second most productive country in this field in 2017 behind the usa drinking water is an issue of much concern to developing countries among the top ten countries with the highest number of published drinking water related groundwater research five are developing countries 4 implications and outlook 4 1 implications for overall groundwater related research the precipitous growth in groundwater related research provides us with an overview of the increasing attention groundwater has received across numerous fields during the past four decades the growth rate in groundwater related studies has greatly exceeded that of the average growth of the web of science core collection wscc signifying that greater emphasis has been attached to groundwater by the scientific research community furthermore it is shown that groundwater is a broad subject covering a variety of different topics including 1 groundwater resource e g groundwater storage yield and recharge 2 groundwater contamination e g the source transportation transpiration remediation and the influence of contamination 3 the interaction between human environment systems and groundwater systems and the intrinsic feedback mechanisms between systems and 4 research methods e g detection and evaluation methods modelling studies and nasa s gravity recovery and climate experiment grace while groundwater related research forms only a small part of all water related research see fig 3 recent years have seen groundwater research experience rapid growth in multiple related topics 4 2 implications for geographic distribution historically groundwater related studies have mainly originated from institutions based in developed countries but there has been an increasing trend for studies coming out of developing countries for instance in 2017 the number of groundwater related publications from china exceeded the number from the usa becoming the largest contributor meanwhile india became the third largest contributor in the early 2010s studies from developing countries have generally focussed on certain common issues such as nitrate and arsenic pollution agriculture and drinking water gu et al 2013 hu et al 2010 whereas studies from developed countries have examined a wider scope of subjects including climate change and groundwater resilience the number of groundwater related studies that a particular country conducts as a percentage of its total research output points to the importance that country attaches to groundwater coastal areas and arid regions where groundwater has been paid more attention are more vulnerable to climate change essink et al 2010 fresh water plays an essential role in both coastal area and arid regions in arid and semi arid countries groundwater is essential to overcoming droughts scanlon et al 2010 for coastal areas apart from naturally occurring arsenic and fluoride contamination groundwater is sensitive to overexploitation dong et al 2014 therefore the complex feedbacks and interactions between human activities climate change and groundwater require further research the strategy to adapt climate change achieve sustainable development and simultaneously protect groundwater from degradation also call for farther study 4 3 implications for research trends the percentages of groundwater studies relating to depletion and sustainable management displayed generally increasing trends over the past 40 years but the percentages of other topics such as groundwater contamination and remediation have experienced varied trends for different periods research trends may provide us with an insight into some of the problems the world is encountering hossain 2006 ye et al 2015 for instance studies on chlorinated solvents and btex boomed in the late 1990s in the usa which was necessary for governmental programs such as the us superfund cerla program during that period studies on nitrates arsenic chlorinated solvents and btex have generally exhibited plateaued or decreasing patterns in the most recent years regarding groundwater remediation studies research on remediation technology has increased rapidly especially that of nanotechnology however research interest in bioremediation and natural attenuation has decreased it should be regarded that plateaued or decreasing trends do not necessarily indicate that the related issues are no longer of concern it may simply reflect the fact that other aspects of groundwater have gained attention jeevandas et al 2008 lawniczak et al 2016 considered an imperative issue groundwater has attracted more attention in developing countries than other notable environmental topics e g climate change including in turkey iran and pakistan çelebi et al 2015 mohebbi et al 2013 rasool et al 2016 research conducted in developing countries has tended to focus on inorganic pollutants like nitrate and arsenic one reason may be because sampling and analysis methods for these contaminants is somewhat easier than for many organic compounds e g volatile organic compounds vocs hou et al 2018 in developing countries like china contaminants such as total dissolved solids tds and nitrates have been regularly monitored in groundwater for over a decade while vocs have not additionally the equipment needed for analysing inorganic contaminants is often lower cost than those for organic compounds however some developing countries especially china have experienced rapid development in organic contamination related studies based on the past experience of developed countries groundwater contamination with vocs is likely to become a larger topic for research in china as research funding increases bi et al 2012 li et al 2015 4 4 outlook the issues around groundwater often pertain to a wide spectra of disciplines including geo environmental engineering environmental science geology geochemistry materials science public health agriculture and sustainable development see table s2 jeevandas et al 2008 rasool et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 the negative impacts of human activities on groundwater systems cannot be successfully tackled by a single discipline alone zaveri et al 2016 therefore greater cooperation among researchers is needed satellite based investigations of groundwater storage and contamination provide a good example of what can be achieved since the launch of nasa s grace satellite remote large scale evaluation of groundwater resources has become possible thanks to the effort of researchers from different research backgrounds moiwo et al 2012 sun et al 2015 another example is the development of nanomaterials by chemists and material scientists which provide a novel approach for groundwater remediation by environmental scientists and engineers shi et al 2015 secondary analyses i e critical reviews and bibliometric studies and meta analyses are powerful ways to make sense of the rapidly expanding body of groundwater research literature glass 1976 greater importance ought to be attached to performing such studies robustly which can extract core research achievements and identify research directions for the future development of groundwater research topics such as groundwater contamination depletion land subsidence and seawater intrusion have been intensively investigated on local scales with large amounts of data generated meta explorations that not only integrate these data but also create new knowledge from them is badly needed furthermore bibliometric studies that explore historical development patterns in groundwater reserach s relevant authorship institutions and core journals enable readers to appreciate the knowledge development status of the topic xu et al 2018 zhu and hua 2017 although the number of groundwater related studies has experienced a rapid rise knowledge gaps in groundwater research still exist the specific status of groundwater abundance and the adverse impacts of groundwater depletion to the human nature system remains an unclear picture konikow 2011 purwoarminta et al 2018 strategies to mitigate climate change sea level rise and groundwater degradation in arid semi arid area and coastal regions require significant levels of exploration dasgupta 2014 dong et al 2014 the relationship between carbon storage in soil and dissolved organic carbon requires further investigation dong et al 2019 groundwater contamination and remediation have been studied for a long time but the mechanisms behind the fate and transport of contaminants under different geochemical regimes demands further research as well as the development of sustainable approaches for groundwater remediation hou 2020 kolhatkar et al 2017 yu et al 2013 moreover wider monitoring of groundwater quality and quantity has been called for especially in developing countries as groundwater related data and information become more accessible accurate and robust groundwater model is anticipated to facilitate further knowledge mining hou and luo 2019 wang et al 2019b 5 conclusions groundwater is an essential and strategic resource however unsustainable groundwater exploitation and management has triggered severe groundwater depletion and contamination in many places throughout the world as groundwater related research is booming it is necessary to understand the past status of its development therefore in this study a logistic regression classifier was established to classify groundwater related publications published in the past 40 years trends contents and geographical distributions of these publications were explored in particular the trends of various groundwater related themes were examined overall increasing research attention has been paid to studying groundwater the annual growth of groundwater related publications significantly exceeded that of the general trend in the web of science core collection regarding spatial distribution developed countries such as the usa have maintained their historical lead in groundwater related research however research output from developing countries including china and india has grown in momentum development trends for different topics related to groundwater were drawn in this study the topics related to groundwater depletion contamination remediation technology and sustainable management were analysed all of which have experienced increasing trends in research output credit

5438,long term over exploitation and unsustainable practices have caused severe groundwater depletion and deterioration across many regions throughout the world this has triggered a series of negative impacts on human populations and the natural environment to understand groundwater related processes and explore ways to mitigate pertaining issues large numbers of groundwater related studies have been performed by the research community in this study all research papers published between 1978 and 2017 incorporating groundwater in the title keywords or abstract were retrieved from the web of science core collection wscc of these a total of 80 763 papers were identified as being groundwater related publications our analysis revealed that groundwater research output increased significantly during this period at average annual rate of 10 1 exceeding the general trend for the wscc 3 4 institutions based in developed countries have held predominance in publishing groundwater research however research output from developing countries such as china and india experienced much growth in recent years development trends were assessed among the research topics of groundwater depletion contamination remediation technology and sustainable management all of which experienced increased research output among sub topics groundwater depletion and sustainable management research have increased as a percentage of total groundwater studies while studies of arsenic chlorinated solvents btex bioremediation and natural attenuation have dropped off in recent years additionally as groundwater related research output has increased rapidly robust secondary analyses and meta analyses are called for in order to make sense of the rapidly expanding body of groundwater research literature moreover owing to the many complexities surround groundwater issues greater interdisciplinary collaboration is also called for keywords sustainable groundwater groundwater depletion groundwater contamination groundwater remediation bibliometric analysis 1 introduction groundwater is an essential natural resource it is estimated that a third of the world s total water consumption is provided by groundwater systems siebert et al 2010 it also serves as a vital supplier of irrigation water and replenishes surface water systems aeschbachhertig and gleeson 2012 famiglietti 2014 however in many areas especially arid and semi arid regions groundwater has been depleted because of long term groundwater overexploitation huang et al 2015 jamshidzadeh and mirbagheri 2011 alarmingly high depletion rates have been observed in north western india 40 mm year the high plains of the usa 27 6 mm year and the north china plain 22 0 mm year famiglietti 2014 feng et al 2013 matthew et al 2009 scanlon et al 2012 some of the detrimental consequences of groundwater depletion include increased water cost land subsidence and seawater intrusion erban et al 2013 galloway and burbey 2011 hakan 2013 lei and jiao 2014 likewise deterioration in quality is a major concern for groundwater systems burow et al 2010 foster and chilton 2003 jia et al 2019 nitrate pollution has become a pervasive problem worldwide gu et al 2013 gupta et al 2011 and arsenic contamination threatens public health in many regions rodriguez lado et al 2013 scott et al 2010 it is estimated that 19 6 million people in china and 35 77 million people in bangladesh could potentially be affected by arsenic in groundwater edmunds et al 2015 rodriguez lado et al 2013 in addition to the direct health risks associated with contaminated drinking water food safety is also affected by land irrigation with contaminated groundwater chang et al 2010 rahman et al 2014 over the past decades large numbers of research studies have been carried out to address groundwater related issues niu et al 2014 as the numbers of published research articles grow important literature reviews have been put forward in order to extract core achievements within various specific fields gee and hillel 2010 o connor et al 2018 however such reviews may overlook development trends across the broader field of groundwater research bibliometric analysis offers a more comprehensive perspective by analysing publication trends in various generic categories such as countries un member states institutions journals citations and keywords jinshui et al 2012 pritchard 1969 several software packages have been developed as tools to help conduct bibliometric analyses such as bibexcel citespace omniviz and vosviewer liang et al 2017 velasco munoz et al 2018 a few bibliometric studies have already been performed on groundwater research literature niu et al 2014 schwartz et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 however they tend to focus on specific research questions e g schwartz et al focused on groundwater contamination and zhang et al focused on groundwater remediation it is important to understand the development trends in different branches of groundwater research therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 develop a logistic regression classifier to categorize research studies into different classes 2 describe the development trend and provide a comprehensive view of the groundwater research from 1978 to 2017 3 explore the geographical distribution of groundwater related studies and identify the drivers underlying them and 4 trace 40 year development trends for different research branches pertaining to the field of groundwater namely groundwater depletion contamination remediation and sustainable management 2 methods 2 1 data collection the web of science core collection wscc is an influential multidisciplinary academic abstract and citation database falagas et al 2008 over 12 000 journals on natural sciences engineering social sciences and arts are included therefore the wscc is a qualified data source for bibliometric analyses fig 1 shows the identification and classification process followed to acquire pertaining studies in the groundwater field for this all papers published from 1978 to 2017 incorporating groundwater in their title keywords or abstract were retrieved from wscc the search was operated on 22 january 2019 for each article the title publication year abstract keywords journal authors and author addresses were exported into an excel spreadsheet www microsoft com excel after removing duplicated articles 99 344 publications remained 2 2 data processing although all retrieved publications had at least one instance of the term groundwater in their title keywords or abstract this was deemed insufficient to demonstrate that all the publications were actually groundwater related publications therefore classification algorithms were developed to exclude inappropriate papers the classification process involved three steps firstly publications with at least one groundwater related term in their title or keywords not abstract were considered as groundwater related publications these terms are as follows groundwater ground water confined water underground water aquifer subsurface water subterranean water unconfined water artesian water phreatic water crack water fracture water fissure water crevice water karst water karstic water well water and spring water of the 99 344 publications retrieved from the wscc 29 765 papers were found to contain at least one of these groundwater related terms in their title or keywords secondly 100 of the remaining publications were randomly selected inspected and labelled as either groundwater related publications or non groundwater related it was found that the number of groundwater related terms included in the abstract was related to the likelihood of an article being a groundwater related publication less than 10 of articles containing a single groundwater related term in the abstract were found to be groundwater related publications whereas publications with four or more groundwater related terms were all 100 labelled groundwater related publications fig 2 a thirdly the probability that publications containing different numbers of groundwater related terms being groundwater related publications was calculated and a logistic regression classifier prepared and established using r with the islr package www r project org logistic regression is considered the most useful for 2 d classification problems abdulhamit and ergun 2005 dreiseitl and ohno machado 2002 worth and cronin 2003 i e for classifying publications as either groundwater related or non groundwater related the logistic regression classifier established to solve this problem used the following logistic function p x e β 0 β 1 x 1 e β 0 β 1 x where p represents the probability of the occurrence of event x β 0 and β 1 are unknown coefficients that are estimated by maximizing the likelihood of event x occurring abdulhamit and ergun 2005 the values estimated for β 0 and β 1 are shown in fig 2b and the associated p value was significantly less than 0 001 the logistic regression indicates that when groundwater related terms appear twice in the abstract there is a probability higher than 90 that the publication is groundwater related whereas when only one groundwater related term appears in the abstract the probability is only 7 1 consequently the publications with only a single groundwater related term in their abstract were removed from the study in this way a total of 80 763 papers were identified as groundwater related publications 29 765 papers with at least one groundwater related term in their title or keywords 50 998 with at least two of these terms in their abstract based on the results of the logistic regression a classification criterion was developed which was used to classify publications for certain topics papers with at least one related term in the title or keywords or at least two terms in the abstract were classified into related branches 2 3 further data mining and visualization to classify publications into different categories data mining was performed using coco r http www ssw uni linz ac at coco in this study word frequency analysis was used to evaluate text and extract the main topics from groundwater related publications with both structured and unstructured data processed han et al 2017 the distribution of groundwater related publications was explored and visualized using the gis software package arcgis www arcgis com to visualize research trends in different aspects of groundwater research a keyword list for different subcategories was developed table s1 with classifications for other topics based on the groundwater related terms listed in section 2 2 these keywords were used in order to create 5 year moving average trends 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall research trends in the past 40 years the number of groundwater related publications has been increasing over the past 40 years fig 3 there were only 149 groundwater related publications in 1978 whereas 6000 papers were published in 2017 the growth in publication number from 1978 to 1990 was relatively slow after strong yet fluctuating growth period between 1990 and 2000 the output of groundwater related publications underwent stable rise in number the wider water related research field also saw the number of publications increase significatly the ratio groundwater to water related publications increased from 2 3 in 1978 to 3 6 in 2017 indicating that groundwater has drawn a somewhat increasing proportion of hydrology research attention in the past decades the average annual growth in the number of groundwater related publications and the total number of wscc publications from 1978 to 2017 was 10 1 and 4 6 respectively furthermore the ratio of groundwater related publications to total publications in wscc has increased significantly over the 40 years rising from only 0 03 in 1978 to 0 20 in 2017 word frequency analysis was conducted on the keywords of groundwater related publications presenting a general map of prevalent topics table 1 besides water or the groundwater related terms listed in section 2 2 soil s was the most frequently found word reflecting the close relationship between groundwater and soil the high frequency of the word model s indicates that modelling is an essential aspect in much groundwater research system s in third place indicates that groundwater is likely to be considered from a system perspective transport not only refers to the movement of groundwater but also to the migration of contaminants within groundwater and takes fourth place similar to transport understanding the flow of groundwater is crucial to comprehending groundwater systems and contamination migration the high frequency of contamination and pollution indicates the importance of studies related to groundwater contamination adsorption a popular method for groundwater remediation and a natural process in groundwater systems has attracted wide attention as for pollutants nitrate occurred most frequently followed by arsenic possibly owing to their wide distribution and associated health risks groundwater is often extracted as a source of drinking water explaining the high frequency of the term drinking water interestingly china and india are the two countries occurring the most frequently within the keywords possibly due to serious groundwater issues caused by intensive development in these countries kulkarni et al 2015 rodriguez lado et al 2013 3 2 geographic distribution researchers based at institutions located in 152 different countries un member states have contributed published groundwater related studies as shown in fig 4 a due to the fact that 50 of the articles published between 1978 and 1997 lack author addresses this section only considers publications from 1998 to 2017 researchers based in the usa and china have contributed the most groundwater related papers with 16 128 and 8 589 groundwater related publications allocated to these countries respectively fig 4b germany was third with 3786 groundwater related publications followed by india 3707 and the uk 2751 the proportion of groundwater related publications as a proportion of total wscc publications for different countries un member states was calculated in general countries in western asia southern asia and africa conducted a higher proportion of their total research on the subject of groundwater than countries in other regions among all countries djibouti performed the highest portion 3 03 of their total research on groundwater fig 4c since 2016 the number of groundwater related publications deriving from china has exceeded that of the usa and india s output overtook that of germany and the uk in 2011 fig 4d the average annual growth rates of both the number and proportion of groundwater related publications were also calculated table 2 malaysia has had the highest growth rate in groundwater related publications 25 26 followed by indonesia 24 26 tunisia 24 05 and algeria 23 71 the largest growth rate in their proportion of groundwater related publications was 10 41 for argentina followed by romania 9 14 algeria 8 21 tunisia 7 87 and slovenia 7 11 most of the countries who experienced the fastest growth are in asia europe and africa the amount of groundwater related studies conducted by researchers in developed countries was generally much higher than those in developing countries but growth in research output from developing countries is greater a longer research history in developed countries supports their institutions to be more comprehensive and abundant in publishing groundwater studies niu et al 2014 groundwater research however is arguably more essential for developing countries feng et al 2013 owing to rapid economic development population growth and urbanization being associated with serious groundwater degradation and depletion in these countries bierkens et al 2014 northern china and north west india have experienced large groundwater depletion feng et al 2013 rodell et al 2009 salinity potentially toxic elements and organic compounds have been discovered in groundwater systems in many developing countries including in turkey vietnam china and india agca et al 2014 duong et al 2015 hou et al 2018 raja and venkatesan 2010 such contamination can derive either from natural sources or anthropic activities e g untreated discharge leakage from landfill or industrial sites groundwater depletion and contamination is hindering sustainable development in many developing countries which impels the research community to more actively support sustainable groundwater management 3 3 research trend analysis 3 3 1 groundwater depletion because of its geographic accessibility and low vulnerability to droughts groundwater is considered a vital resource for human nature systems chen et al 2010 foster and chilton 2003 however over extraction has caused severe groundwater depletion in many places globally famiglietti 2014 graaf et al 2017 consequently multiple negative impacts have arisen including increased water cost land subsidence and saline intrusion which have impacted human production systems especially agricultural production in arid and semi arid areas lei and jiao 2014 ye et al 2015 within this research topic studies on groundwater storage groundwater recharge land subsidence seawater intrusion have been published in recent years groundwater studies in this topic have also emerged relating to nasa s gravity recovery and climate experiment grace fig 5 quantifying groundwater recharge and storage including studies of groundwater depth patterns and analysing groundwater mass balances are needed for evaluating water resource availability bhanja et al 2014 moiwo et al 2012 groundwater recharge is historically the most productive research topic within the groundwater depletion topic with the most publications and an exponential increase in publication number r2 0 970 the percentage of groundwater studies on this topic dropped in the 1980s but then grew rapidly in subsequent years fig 5b the number of studies related to groundwater storage has grown continuously since the late 1990s also with an exponential growth pattern r2 0 987 similar to groundwater recharge the percentage of groundwater related studies on groundwater storage dropped in the 1980s and early 1990s though not as severely in recent years elopements such as nasa s gravity recovery and climate experiment grace have enabled researchers to quantify groundwater storage remotely matthew et al 2009 sun et al 2015 which provides a clear example of a novel technology being a decisive driver of a new research direction groundwater depletion is mainly caused by unbalanced groundwater extraction and recharge scanlon et al 2012 therefore carefully managed aquifer recharge is crucial for alleviating groundwater depletion chinnasamy et al 2018 o connor and hou 2019 research output on related geo hazards including seawater intrusion and land subsidence increased after the late 1990s land subsidence induced by groundwater overexploitation has triggered considerable research output seawater intrusion at coastal regions has aggravated water scarcity and led to land salinization lei and jiao 2014 the growth rates of these two research topics have risen simultaneously and steadily 3 3 2 groundwater contamination groundwater contamination is a crucial research topic for many countries harmful contaminants can derive from natural and anthropogenic sources particularly being associated with long term overutilization of fertilizers and pesticides unrestricted discharge of wastewater and waste leaching jia et al 2020 wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020a therefore countries that have undergone intensive agricultural and industrial development are at greater risk of groundwater pollution gu et al 2013 pokkate et al 2013 the sources distribution transportation transformation remediation and risk e g human health risk of groundwater contaminants have been widely explored by researchers for many years within this topic research trends pertaining to common contaminants are illustrated in fig 6 among groundwater contaminants nitrates and arsenic are the two most widely studied historically nitrates were the most studied and were included in a high percentage 9 of groundwater related publications the number of arsenic studies however has increased quite rapidly since the late 1990s although it dropped as a proportion of groundwater related publications recently decreasing from 9 2 in 2010 to 7 8 in 2011 chlorinated solvents and btex benzene toluene ethylxylene and xylene the third and fourth most studied contaminants respectively were widely studied in the late 1990s and early 2000s they were included in 5 and 4 of all groundwater studies respectively until the new millennium but their research significance dropped in the early 2000s with a slight revival in more recent years fluoride related publications displayed an increasing trend since the late 2000s in fact the number of publications regarding fluoride has exceeded those of chlorinated solvents and btex in recent years lead and chromium are another two important contaminants of concern with growing research interest the growth in the rate of studies being produced on chromium being somewhat higher than those on lead the research contribution of different countries for each groundwater contaminant was explored see fig s1 in the supplementary material the analysis shows that developing countries such as china and india have played a significant role in groundwater contamination research for example nitrate related research originating from china has exceeded that of the usa since 2016 overall trends in the number of nitrate related studies for many developed countries have been fluctuating or decreasing while increasing rapidly in some developing countries particularly china the number of arsenic related studies from the usa india and bangladesh appeared to fluctuate without an obvious overall increase or decrease but those originating from china have risen steadily fluoride publications were mainly contributed by researchers based in india with 2 3 times more related publications than those in china or the usa the usa and germany were the two key contributors to btex related studies in the late 1990s and early 2000s but research output from these two countries has since decreased in recent years china has recently become the largest contributor of btex studies due to wide distribution of such contaminants qi et al 2020a b although output from the usa still remains at a comparable level the relative decrease in groundwater studies that were performed on chlorinated solvents in the 2010s fig 6b relates to a drop in research output from the usa in china and india the publication output on chlorinated solvents has continuously increased in the past decades with 10 year growth rates of 19 and 12 respectively heavy metals have become an increasingly popular research topic due to its wide distribution in soil and groundwater and detrimental impact to public health and food security wang et al 2020c the number of chromium related groundwater studies performed by chinese research institutions have risen considerably meanwhile the number of heavy metal related groundwater studies also increased in many developed countries but at a much slower rate 3 3 3 groundwater remediation considering the severe extent of contamination in many places cleaning up groundwater contamination is considered an imperative for modern society qi et al 2020b in the past few decades groundwater remediation technologies have been researched rather intensively research trends for major remediation technologies including bioremediation adsorption chemical oxidation natural attenuation and nanomaterial assisted remediation are presented in fig 7 a b ever since the late 1990s research into bioremediation technology has led among publications on groundwater remediation in the early 2000s the number of studies on bioremediation plateaued for a short while before increasing in the following years research into adsorption technology caught up with bioremediation in the most recent years adsorption research is shown to have grown exponentially since the early 2000 s r2 0 97 however from 2014 the rate of growth in publication output eased chemical oxidation as an effective and feasible remediation technology has become a preferable option for researchers showing an obvious increase since the late 1990 s nanotechnology has attracted much research interest over a wide spectrum of environmental pollution treatments mukherjee et al 2016 wang et al 2020b nanomaterials have been applied widely in groundwater remediation especially nanoscale zero valent iron agarwal and joshi 2010 thomé et al 2015 yuan and qi 2014 consequently both the number and percentage of studies related to nanotechnology in groundwater research has increased significantly since the early 2000 s unlike for other technologies studies on natural attenuation which is identified as a sustainable remediation option suiling and mulligan 2006 increased sharply in the late 1990s but plateaued after that period trends in research on the remediation of different target contaminants are shown in fig 7c d in this analysis only groundwater publications specifically pertaining to remediation are included across all contamination related studies nitrates play the most dominant role yet these are exceeded by arsenic studies in studies that relate to remediation possibly the higher toxicity of arsenic than nitrates accounts for the higher demand for studies on arsenic remediation choong et al 2007 this is further evidence that the toxicity of a contaminant is a decisive component in the urgency to consider it zhang et al 2012 studies on the remediation of chlorinated solvents and btex in groundwater appear to closely mirror each other although studies on pb contamination are numerous than those on cr fig 7 studies on cr remediation have outgrown those on pb remediation both the number and percentage of chromium related studies were higher in remediation studies after 2002 fig 7c d 3 3 4 sustainable groundwater resource management compared to studies on the sustainability of surface water systems groundwater has gained much less attention despite serious depletion and deterioration of groundwater supplies in both developed and developing countries hu et al 2010 jacobs and holway 2004 recently however sustainable groundwater management has been called for which is closely related to a number if sustainable development climate change agriculture and drinking water supply hu et al 2010 rasool et al 2016 moreover the vulnerability and resilience of groundwater serving as a basis for groundwater sustainability have also been explored nobre et al 2007 green and sustainable remediation technologies especially thoese involving nature based solutions have drawn increasing attention in the international community wang et al 2019a fig 8 presents temporal trends for the five main topics related to sustainable groundwater management vulnerability and resilience have experienced an increase in both the number and percentage of studies groundwater vulnerability studies have mainly been conducted to map the areas susceptible to contamination with vulnerability models such as the gis based drastic model for assessing groundwater vulnerability aiming to characterise and protect groundwater li and merchant 2013 neshat et al 2014 the resilience of groundwater to climate change and droughts appears to have been a largely unexplored domain guo et al 2015 furthermore sustainable groundwater management has intrinsic relationships with systems concerning agricultural production drinking water supply and wider environmental issues including climate change gurdak 2017 hu et al 2010 the greatest importance has been attached to agriculture fig 8 with the percentage of groundwater studies incorporating agriculture exceeding 12 in 2015 as groundwater is an essential source of agriculture irrigation water the themes within agriculture studies mainly include 1 food security caused by groundwater depletion 2 the negative consequences agricultural activities have on groundwater e g nitrate and pesticide contamination and 3 food safety issues generated from groundwater contamination additionally because groundwater serves as a fundamental supply of drinking water especially in rural areas and arid regions rodriguez lado et al 2013 human health is affected directly through intake of contaminated groundwater hossain 2006 the resulting health problems after consuming groundwater contaminants may include neurological damage e g hg and pb and life threatening cancers o connor et al 2019 2020 türkdoğan et al 2003 zhang et al 2020b reflecting their significance drinking water related studies have also risen in both number and percentage meanwhile the research trend of climate change studies related to groundwater has experienced significant growth in the past decades especially since the late 2000s the themes within this topic mainly include 1 the influence of climate change on groundwater resources particularly in groundwater recharge and discharge and 2 using groundwater to support climate change adaptation the output of different countries of studies on the above topics from were explored see fig s2 in the supplementary material for vulnerability the usa contributed the most studies followed by china and italy although the difference between these countries has been shrinking in recent years interestingly research on groundwater vulnerability from iran grew very quickly only 24 countries in the world have investigated groundwater resilience and only 8 of those are developing countries the usa was the most fruitful country for agriculture related studies contributing nearly twice as many as china this may be because the usa is one of the key grain producing countries of the world and suffers from groundwater issues owing to food production activities for climate change china has shown a sharp increase in number of studies published during recent years and became the second most productive country in this field in 2017 behind the usa drinking water is an issue of much concern to developing countries among the top ten countries with the highest number of published drinking water related groundwater research five are developing countries 4 implications and outlook 4 1 implications for overall groundwater related research the precipitous growth in groundwater related research provides us with an overview of the increasing attention groundwater has received across numerous fields during the past four decades the growth rate in groundwater related studies has greatly exceeded that of the average growth of the web of science core collection wscc signifying that greater emphasis has been attached to groundwater by the scientific research community furthermore it is shown that groundwater is a broad subject covering a variety of different topics including 1 groundwater resource e g groundwater storage yield and recharge 2 groundwater contamination e g the source transportation transpiration remediation and the influence of contamination 3 the interaction between human environment systems and groundwater systems and the intrinsic feedback mechanisms between systems and 4 research methods e g detection and evaluation methods modelling studies and nasa s gravity recovery and climate experiment grace while groundwater related research forms only a small part of all water related research see fig 3 recent years have seen groundwater research experience rapid growth in multiple related topics 4 2 implications for geographic distribution historically groundwater related studies have mainly originated from institutions based in developed countries but there has been an increasing trend for studies coming out of developing countries for instance in 2017 the number of groundwater related publications from china exceeded the number from the usa becoming the largest contributor meanwhile india became the third largest contributor in the early 2010s studies from developing countries have generally focussed on certain common issues such as nitrate and arsenic pollution agriculture and drinking water gu et al 2013 hu et al 2010 whereas studies from developed countries have examined a wider scope of subjects including climate change and groundwater resilience the number of groundwater related studies that a particular country conducts as a percentage of its total research output points to the importance that country attaches to groundwater coastal areas and arid regions where groundwater has been paid more attention are more vulnerable to climate change essink et al 2010 fresh water plays an essential role in both coastal area and arid regions in arid and semi arid countries groundwater is essential to overcoming droughts scanlon et al 2010 for coastal areas apart from naturally occurring arsenic and fluoride contamination groundwater is sensitive to overexploitation dong et al 2014 therefore the complex feedbacks and interactions between human activities climate change and groundwater require further research the strategy to adapt climate change achieve sustainable development and simultaneously protect groundwater from degradation also call for farther study 4 3 implications for research trends the percentages of groundwater studies relating to depletion and sustainable management displayed generally increasing trends over the past 40 years but the percentages of other topics such as groundwater contamination and remediation have experienced varied trends for different periods research trends may provide us with an insight into some of the problems the world is encountering hossain 2006 ye et al 2015 for instance studies on chlorinated solvents and btex boomed in the late 1990s in the usa which was necessary for governmental programs such as the us superfund cerla program during that period studies on nitrates arsenic chlorinated solvents and btex have generally exhibited plateaued or decreasing patterns in the most recent years regarding groundwater remediation studies research on remediation technology has increased rapidly especially that of nanotechnology however research interest in bioremediation and natural attenuation has decreased it should be regarded that plateaued or decreasing trends do not necessarily indicate that the related issues are no longer of concern it may simply reflect the fact that other aspects of groundwater have gained attention jeevandas et al 2008 lawniczak et al 2016 considered an imperative issue groundwater has attracted more attention in developing countries than other notable environmental topics e g climate change including in turkey iran and pakistan çelebi et al 2015 mohebbi et al 2013 rasool et al 2016 research conducted in developing countries has tended to focus on inorganic pollutants like nitrate and arsenic one reason may be because sampling and analysis methods for these contaminants is somewhat easier than for many organic compounds e g volatile organic compounds vocs hou et al 2018 in developing countries like china contaminants such as total dissolved solids tds and nitrates have been regularly monitored in groundwater for over a decade while vocs have not additionally the equipment needed for analysing inorganic contaminants is often lower cost than those for organic compounds however some developing countries especially china have experienced rapid development in organic contamination related studies based on the past experience of developed countries groundwater contamination with vocs is likely to become a larger topic for research in china as research funding increases bi et al 2012 li et al 2015 4 4 outlook the issues around groundwater often pertain to a wide spectra of disciplines including geo environmental engineering environmental science geology geochemistry materials science public health agriculture and sustainable development see table s2 jeevandas et al 2008 rasool et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 the negative impacts of human activities on groundwater systems cannot be successfully tackled by a single discipline alone zaveri et al 2016 therefore greater cooperation among researchers is needed satellite based investigations of groundwater storage and contamination provide a good example of what can be achieved since the launch of nasa s grace satellite remote large scale evaluation of groundwater resources has become possible thanks to the effort of researchers from different research backgrounds moiwo et al 2012 sun et al 2015 another example is the development of nanomaterials by chemists and material scientists which provide a novel approach for groundwater remediation by environmental scientists and engineers shi et al 2015 secondary analyses i e critical reviews and bibliometric studies and meta analyses are powerful ways to make sense of the rapidly expanding body of groundwater research literature glass 1976 greater importance ought to be attached to performing such studies robustly which can extract core research achievements and identify research directions for the future development of groundwater research topics such as groundwater contamination depletion land subsidence and seawater intrusion have been intensively investigated on local scales with large amounts of data generated meta explorations that not only integrate these data but also create new knowledge from them is badly needed furthermore bibliometric studies that explore historical development patterns in groundwater reserach s relevant authorship institutions and core journals enable readers to appreciate the knowledge development status of the topic xu et al 2018 zhu and hua 2017 although the number of groundwater related studies has experienced a rapid rise knowledge gaps in groundwater research still exist the specific status of groundwater abundance and the adverse impacts of groundwater depletion to the human nature system remains an unclear picture konikow 2011 purwoarminta et al 2018 strategies to mitigate climate change sea level rise and groundwater degradation in arid semi arid area and coastal regions require significant levels of exploration dasgupta 2014 dong et al 2014 the relationship between carbon storage in soil and dissolved organic carbon requires further investigation dong et al 2019 groundwater contamination and remediation have been studied for a long time but the mechanisms behind the fate and transport of contaminants under different geochemical regimes demands further research as well as the development of sustainable approaches for groundwater remediation hou 2020 kolhatkar et al 2017 yu et al 2013 moreover wider monitoring of groundwater quality and quantity has been called for especially in developing countries as groundwater related data and information become more accessible accurate and robust groundwater model is anticipated to facilitate further knowledge mining hou and luo 2019 wang et al 2019b 5 conclusions groundwater is an essential and strategic resource however unsustainable groundwater exploitation and management has triggered severe groundwater depletion and contamination in many places throughout the world as groundwater related research is booming it is necessary to understand the past status of its development therefore in this study a logistic regression classifier was established to classify groundwater related publications published in the past 40 years trends contents and geographical distributions of these publications were explored in particular the trends of various groundwater related themes were examined overall increasing research attention has been paid to studying groundwater the annual growth of groundwater related publications significantly exceeded that of the general trend in the web of science core collection regarding spatial distribution developed countries such as the usa have maintained their historical lead in groundwater related research however research output from developing countries including china and india has grown in momentum development trends for different topics related to groundwater were drawn in this study the topics related to groundwater depletion contamination remediation technology and sustainable management were analysed all of which have experienced increasing trends in research output credit

5439,wetlands are among the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world due largely to their dynamic hydrology frequent observations by satellite sensors such as the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis allow for monitoring the seasonal inter annual and long term dynamics of surface water extent however existing modis based studies have only demonstrated this for large water bodies 100 km2 despite the ecological importance of smaller sized wetland systems in this paper we assessed if the temporal dynamics of surface water extent can be effectively captured with modis for a wide range of water body sizes specifically 0 01 km2 and larger we constructed the temporal dynamics of surface water extent for 340 individual water bodies in the mediterranean region between 2000 and 2017 using a previously developed 8 day 500 m modis surface water fraction swf dataset we then evaluated how modis swf time series corresponded to water extent derived from a landsat based dataset and to satellite altimetry derived water level data results showed that although correlations between modis and landsat derived swf were poor for relative static water bodies r 0 17 they increased for more dynamic water bodies r 0 81 for dynamic water bodies 100 km2 time series of water extent derived from modis swf showed good correlation with both landsat r 0 76 and water level data ρ 0 63 our modis swf dataset can also effectively monitor the variability of very small water bodies 1 km2 when comparing with landsat data as long as the temporal variability in their surface water area was high we conclude that modis swf is a useful product to help understand hydrological dynamics for both small and larger sized water bodies and to monitor their seasonal intermittent inter annual and long term changes keywords small wetlands ramsar wetlands hydrology water area high frequency trend analysis 1 introduction wetlands are among the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world due largely to their dynamic hydrology halls 1997 the hydrological cycle of flooding and drying within a wetland is important for the formation and maintenance of specific wetland habitat types and the species that they support halls 1997 thehydrological dynamics also reflect spatial and temporal changes in a number of environmental factors including anomalous rainfall driven flood events cian et al 2018 seasonal thawing andsnowmeltin spring watts et al 2012 and longer term environmental changes street and grove 1976 characterizinghydrological variations is a prerequisite for understanding hydrological and ecological processes across different wetland types and to identify abnormal changes in wetland hydrology in relationship to normal variability of wetland hydrology general patterns however accurate information on wetland dynamics is scarce particularly for small sized wetlands ogilvie et al 2018a despite their size small wetlands in arid semi arid and mediterranean regions often act as critical refuge and breeding areas offer food sources for wildlife and harbor many plant and animal species that would otherwise not survive in the surrounding landscape calhoun et al 2017 mcculloch et al 2003 efficient accurate and robust tools for monitoring the hydrology of wetlands over large areas are urgently needed for management and conservation strategies finlayson et al 1999 turak et al 2017 remote sensing has been used as a cost effectivetool to monitor the changes of surface water in space and time alsdorf et al 2007 ozesmi and bauer 2002 two types of remote sensing instruments are suitable for monitoring earth surface water i e microwave and optical sensors microwave sensors can effectively obtain imagery during day and night they have the ability to penetrate clouds and partially also vegetation due to their usage of long wavelength radiation several studies have used passive and active microwave remote sensing data to monitor surface water and flood inundation at global scale but at a coarse spatial resolution 25x25 km du et al 2018 papa et al 2010 prigent et al 2007 schroeder et al 2015 synthetic aperture radar sar images have great potential in detecting water surface beneath vegetation schumann and moller 2015 and in near real time monitoring of flood inundation martinis et al 2009 shen et al 2019 however the high costs associated with obtaining sar datasets for large areas and in a timely fashion have limited their usefulness for continental to global applications nonetheless at present esa s sentinel 1 satellite provides free consistent global observations every 6 days offering more opportunities for water body detection including those under vegetation bioresita et al 2018 clement et al 2018 hardy et al 2019 optical remote sensing data have been intensively used to monitor open surface water and flood inundation due to their straightforward interpretability of water features very high spatial resolution imagery provided by spot ikonos quickbird rapideye worldview as well as the recent small satellite constellations such as planet labs http planet com are generally able to detect small water bodies with a higher accuracy and are also effective in monitoring the changes of surface water e g cooley et al 2017 malinowski et al 2015 however surface water studies based on very high resolution imagery usually focused on small regions due to size of the image footprint and data costs many attempts to monitor surface water changes with 10 30 m resolution optical data have been reported including spectral data from landsat borro et al 2014 doña et al 2016 jin et al 2017 tan et al 2019 and sentinel 2 kaplan and avdan 2017 yang et al 2018 for specific locations for larger spatial and longer time scales several efforts exist to map and monitor surface water changes with landsat data at regional halabisky et al 2016 heimhuber et al 2016 continental mueller et al 2016 and global scale donchyts et al 2016 pekel et al 2016 these datasets allow for analyzing surface water dynamics at fine spatial resolution and over a long time frame however the combination of clouds and revisit time of landsat results in data gaps and temporal discontinuities in the data pekel et al 2016 the limited number of observations does not provide enough detail for understanding seasonal patterns and dynamics of inter annual and long trend response much less to determine if measured changes in the surface water extent represent natural seasonal variability or abnormal changes in wetland hydrology moderate to coarse resolution imagery derived from satellite sensors such as avhrr advanced very high resolution radiometer and modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer are acquired with shorter revisit times and provide long term and dense time series data therefore they have been widely used for monitoring changes in surface water and inundation for large areas examples include nasa near real time global flood products at 250 m resolution https floodmap modaps eosdis nasa gov modis 500 m water mask carroll et al 2017 500 m resolution daily global surface water change database 2001 2016 developed by ji et al 2018 and the global waterpack which maps daily global inland water bodies at 250 m resolution for the years 2013 2015 klein et al 2017 all of these studies and datasets are based on binary classification methods thus small water bodies especially those smaller than the modis pixel size cannot be well represented for individual water bodies chen et al 2014 investigated the spatial temporal patterns of abrupt changes of poyang lake using time series of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis 16 day normalized difference vegetation index ndvi product using the same product and unsupervised classification gao et al 2012 estimated historical area changes in 34 large reservoirs around the globe khandelwal et al 2017 applied supervised classification on 16 day 500 m modis surface reflectance time series data to monitor changes in surface water extent for a global set of 94 large reservoirs these studies are confined to large water bodies with an area 100 km2 to overcome the limitation of coarse spatial resolution and incorporate small water bodies we have developed a dense 18 year time series dataset of surface water for the mediterranean region in a previous paper li et al 2019 this dataset estimated the surface water fraction swf for each 500 m modis pixel using nadir reflectances from the mcd43a4 product with a rule based regression model by assessing water fractions the dataset allows for mapping and monitoring surface water smaller than a modis pixel although in that paper we briefly illustrated the dataset s options for monitoring temporal changes a formal assessment of the ability to monitor surface water dynamics taking into account water body size has not been performed therefore the aim of this paper is to assess if our modis swf product can effectively capture the temporal changes in surface water extent for a wide range of water body sizes i e 0 01 3100 km2 our specific objectives are 1 to derive temporal dynamics of surface water extent between 2000 and 2017 for individual water bodies using the previously developed 8 day 500 m resolution modis swf dataset 2 to assess how closely those temporal dynamics match the variability of surface water extent obtained from a landsat based dataset and water level data 3 to characterize the water extent time series and to identify different dynamic patterns e g intermittent seasonal inter annual or long trend dynamics 2 data 2 1 landsat based global surface water dataset the joint research centre s global surface water jrc gsw dataset pekel et al 2016 maps the temporal and spatial dynamics of open surface water over a 32 year period from march 1984 to october 2015 at monthly time interval and at 30 m spatial resolution globally this dataset was produced by analyzing the entire archive of landsat 5 7 and 8 using an expert system the expert system is a sequential decision tree that used both the multi spectral and multi temporal attributes of the landsat archive as well as ancillary data layers the dataset was validated using 40 000 reference points from very high resolution satellite and aerial imagery which revealed a high accuracy with a commission error 1 and omission error 5 pekel et al 2016 the jrc gsw dataset includes the monthly water history dataset which is a set of 380 global maps documenting the water presence for each month from march 1984 to october 2015 and eight additional information layers documenting different facets of the surface water dynamics the complete dataset with the described layers is available in google earth engine although jrc gsw has a high spatial accuracy it only provides information on changes in surface water at a monthly interval furthermore it contains long temporal gaps due to both the limited number of acquisitions during specific time intervals and due to region and month dependent persistency of cloud cover these temporal gaps can affect the accuracy of the trend and seasonality information li et al 2019 yamazaki and trigg 2016 2 2 modis derived surface water fraction dataset the modis based surface water fraction swf dataset li et al 2019 provides 18 years 2000 2017 of water fraction maps at 500 m spatial resolution and 8 day temporal resolution for the mediterranean region we derived this dataset from the modis terra and aqua nadir brdf adjusted reflectance nbar product mcd43a4 v006 through a global rule based regression model which used modis derived spectral information its temporal characteristics and topographic information as predictor variables reference data were generated from the jrc gsw monthly water history maps for 7 000 modis scale cells 500x500 m divided into 3500 training and 3500 validation locations these reference data areas are sampled across the entire mediterranean area different water permanence types seasonal and permanent and different water fraction categories 0 100 missing data in jrc gsw monthly maps can affect the quality and accuracy of the reference data when aggregated to modis resolution therefore we only retained those modis scale cells that contained no missing data the correspondence between modis swf and surface water fraction derived from the jrc gsw product is strong r2 0 91 an advantage of modis swf over jrc gsw is that it can provide open surface water information for the long temporal and spatial data gaps of jrc gsw moreover the high temporal resolution allows better capturing of rapid changes in open surface water extent that cannot be detected by the monthly jrc gsw product li et al 2019 2 3 water level data we obtained water level time series measured with spaceborne radar altimetry for 14 large water bodies 100 km2 fig 1 and table 3 from

including jason 3 cryosat 2 and saral altika 3 methods 3 1 selection of individual water bodies to compare water extent dynamics from modis swf and jrc gsw for individual water bodies we selected and analyzed 340 water bodies these were all situated in the mediterranean region as defined by li et al 2019 these water bodies vary from 0 01 km2 to 3100 km2 in size i e mean water area according to jrc gsw time series table 1 lists the number of water bodies within five size categories i e 0 1 km2 1 5 km2 5 20 km2 20 100 km2 and 100 km2 and fig 1 shows their spatial distribution to obtain our selection of 340 water bodies we first selected all ramsar wetlands of the mediterranean region excluding the wetlands types that are not characterized by the presence of open surface water such as wet meadows marshes and peatlands this resulted in 279 water bodies we added 14 large lakes and reservoirs 100 km2 to our selection see fig 1 and the list in table 3 these 14 lakes are not ramsar sites but were included by khandelwal et al 2017 in their study on modis based surface water extent mapping and coincided with the lakes for which altimetry water level data were available section 2 3 we thus included these lakes for comparison in addition we included 47 non ramsar water bodies that showed large inter annual variability in surface water extent according to li et al 2019 3 2 calculation of water extent time series to identify open surface water dynamics per water body we first identified the spatial extent within which we summarized the open surface water presence for this purpose we used the jrc gsw maximum water extent as the initial region of interest roi around this roi we created a buffer of one 500 m resolution modis pixel to include nearby locations because there is a chance that surface water extends beyond what could be identified by jrc gsw we then derived time series of water extent for each buffered roi from the modis swf dataset by summing the water fraction of all pixels inside the roi and multiplying this by the modis pixel size i e 250 000 m2 we also derived time series of water extent from the jrc gsw monthly history dataset by multiplying the number of water pixels inside the roi with the landsat pixel size i e 900 m2 missing data in a roi can affect the accuracy when calculating the water area to deal with this problem and ensure the accuracy of the area calculations we calculated for each roi and each date the valid cloud free data fraction by dividing the valid pixels by all pixels within the roi we then only retained an area if for that date it contained at least 95 of valid data from modis swf and jrc gsw derived water extent time series 3 3 comparison of water extent time series we compared time series of surface water extent derived from modis swf with those from jrc gsw to see if the temporal dynamics of surface water extent obtained from the two datasets match with each other specifically we calculated the monthly mean water extent from modis swf for the period from february 2000 to october 2015 and compared it with jrc gsw monthly water history two statistical measures were calculated the pearson s correlation coefficient r and the normalized mean signed deviation nmsd 1 nmsd msd area mean where a r e a m e a n is the mean water area according to the jrc gsw time series msd is the mean signed deviation which is calculated as 2 msd 1 n i 1 n x i y i where x i is the time series of surface water extent derived from modis swf and y i is those derived from jrc gsw to assess if the agreement between jrc gsw and modis derived surface water results is related to the dynamics of the water body a measure of relative variability rv in surface water extent was calculated for each water body as 3 rv area max area min area mean where a r e a m a x a r e a m i n and a r e a m e a n are the maximum minimum and mean water area according to jrc gsw time series we then plotted the distribution of r as a function of rv for different water size categories we also combined the effect of both water size categories and rv on r in a single analysis for this we further divided all water bodies into six rv levels i e 0 rv 0 15 0 15 rv 0 3 0 3 rv 1 0 1 rv 2 2 rv 5 and rv 5 3 4 comparison with water level data to evaluate the performance of modis swf for monitoring the dynamics of open surface water we also compared the water extent time series with water level for 14 large lakes 100 km2 for which satellite altimetry data was available see section 2 3 specifically we calculated the spearman rank correlation ρ between monthly mean water level and monthly water extent obtained from jrc gsw and modis swf respectively a rank correlation was used because relationships between water level and extent are non linear and depend on bathymetry hayashi and van der kamp 2000 to obtain a temporal match between our modis swf 8 day product and water level in addition to the monthly comparison we also resampled the water level data available every 10 or 35 days to 8 day estimates using linear interpolation there could be long time gaps between two water level observations due to missing data ricko et al 2012 we thus further removed those interpolated data if the time gap is longer than three months the same 14 lakes were included by khandelwal et al 2017 who mapped surface water area dynamics between 2000 and 2015 based on binary classification of modis 8 day 500 m resolution data to assess if our product offers an improvement with respect to the one of khandelwal et al 2017 we calculated ρ also between water level and their 8 day time series available at http z umn edu monitoringwaterrse to make a fair comparison for both products ρ was calculated for the 2000 2015 time frame matching the study by khandelwal et al 2017 3 5 characterization of the temporal variability of water extent to characterize the temporal dynamics within the 18 year water extent time series derived from modis swf we created a subset that only included the dynamic water bodies which were defined by applying a threshold to rv for each water size category we then extracted three features including the strength of seasonality strength of trend and stationarity these features were used in previous studies to characterize hydrological time series buma et al 2016 lafare et al 2016 to extract the features we first decomposed the water extent time series using theseasonal trend decomposition algorithm stl cleveland et al 1990 which is capable ofaccommodating missing values and is robust to noise the stl decomposes a time series yt into seasonal st trend tt and remainder rt components as 4 y t s t t t r t after we obtained the seasonal st and trend tt series we normalized them to 0 1 to indicate the strength of seasonality and trend using the following equations 5 f s m a x 0 1 v a r r t v a r s t r t 6 f t m a x 0 1 v a r r t v a r t t r t where var stands for variance a series with seasonal strength f s close to 0 exhibits almost no seasonality while a series with strong seasonality will havef s close to 1 wang et al 2006 this is similar for the strength of the trend component f t we calculated the strength of seasonality and trend by using the stl features package which implements the stl algorithm in r statistical software r core team 2018 and used the suggestions of cleveland et al 1990 to set the parameter values to calculate stationarity the water extent time series were first linearly rescaled to 0 1 then we calculated the annual mean from the rescaled water extent time series the stationarity is calculated as the variance of annual mean wang et al 2006 finally based on these three characteristics i e strength of seasonality strength of trend and stationarity extracted from water extent time series derived from modis swf we organized the water bodies into groups with similar dynamic patterns using the k means clustering algorithm aghabozorgi et al 2015 4 results 4 1 comparison of water extent time series based on modis swf we constructed temporal dynamics of open surface water extent at 8 day time interval for 340 water bodies spanning a time period from 2000 to 2017 for comparison with jrc gsw three water bodies i e lake urmia in iran sebkhet sidi elhani in tunisia and sultan marshes in turkey were removed from further analysis because for 10 individual months both datasets had overlap in terms of valid water extent retrievals which was considered too few for a proper statistical basis fig 2 plots the distribution of r between monthly water extent derived from modis swf and those from jrc gsw as a function of rv for different water size categories there is a general increase in r when the water relative variability increases for all water size categories this indicates that small variations in water extent are not similarly described by the two products suggesting a lower accuracy of the modis swf in monitoring fluctuations of more stable water bodies for water bodies with a larger rv the temporal variability in monthly water extent obtained from both datasets had a good agreement with r generally above or near 0 8 this includes very small water bodies 1 km2 examples of four very small water bodies i e laguna dulce in spain laguna de la nava de fuentes in spain complexe du bas tahaddart in morocco and livanjsko polje in bosnia and herzegovina are shown in fig 3 these four water bodies are all ramsar sites with an area 1 km2 i e mean water area according to jrc gsw time series comparison of monthly water extent derived from both datasets shows a good agreement r 0 79 for these small water bodies note that several cases with small value of r are identified in fig 2 each marked with a red number these cases are caused by a number of factors which are discussed in the discussion section table 2 shows that the average correlation increases when water variability increases with the smallest r of 0 17 for static water bodies rv 0 15 and the largest r of 0 81 for highly dynamic water bodies rv 5 in addition table 2 shows that the effect of rv on r depends on the water size categories considered this may be expected as small relative changes for larger water bodies as expressed by rv still correspond to substantial absolute changes which can be captured by modis table 2 signals how much variability can be captured by our modis swf product for example the reasonable correlation r 0 5 found for water bodies smaller than 1 km2 when rv 1 implies that modis swf resembles jrc gsw for representing absolute variability of 1 km2 examination of the nmsd compared to different water size categories shows that modis swf and jrc gsw have the largest difference for the estimation of very small water bodies 1 km2 fig 4 modis swf tends to estimate smaller values of water extent compared to jrc gsw in most cases this can be partly attributed to the underestimation of larger water fractions by modis swf li et al 2018 fig 4 also reveals that nmsd decreases when rv increases for water bodies 100 km2 however the nmsd was surprisingly large for highly dynamic water bodies rv 1 for those in the 0 100 km2 size categories such as those cases marked with red numbers in fig 4 these large nmsd can be caused by a number of factors which are discussed in the discussion section 4 2 comparison with water level data monthly water extent obtained from modis swf shows moderately high correlation with both monthly water area derived from jrc gsw r 0 76 and with monthly water level data ρ 0 63 for 10 dynamic large lakes rv 0 15 and size 100 km2 table 3 correlations were low for the four lakes with a small variation rv 0 15 in surface water both r and ρ are 0 4 see table3 similarly modis swf 8 day water extent shows moderate to high correlation ρ 0 60 with water level for these 10 dynamic lakes and low correlation ρ 0 17 for the four stable lakes suggesting that the modis swf can accurately monitor the seasonal intra annual and long term variability in surface water extent of those dynamic lakes table 3 also indicates that our modis swf 8 day data outperformed the khandelwal et al 2017 results in monitoring the dynamics of water bodies with larger correlations for the 10 dynamic lakes fig 5 and fig 6 show the comparison results between water extent time series derived from different data sources and water level variability for the karakaya baraji reservoir in turkey and the tshchikskoye lake in russia respectively the karakaya baraji reservoir in turkey has a compact shape fig 5a fig 5c and fig 5f show that the reservoir has large temporal variations despite its rv of 0 30 high correlations were achieved for both the modis swf monthly ρ 0 88 and 8 day water extent ρ 0 86 suggesting that the temporal variations of this lake were well captured by modis swf and better than by the khandelwal et al 2017 study ρ 0 66 the tshchikskoye lake in russia has strong seasonal variations fig 6c and f with a rv of 0 50 the jrc gsw monthly water extent has a high correlation ρ 0 80 with water level data but with many missing data in the time series fig 6c the modis swf monthly water extent also achieved a high correlation ρ 0 80 fig 6b with the seasonal variations accurately captured fig 6c the modis swf 8 day water extent also greatly improved with respect to the khandelwal et al 2017 study ρ 0 48 4 3 characterization of water bodies by their temporal variability of water extent we created a subset of 265 water extent time series by only selecting the dynamic water bodies i e rv 1 for water bodies smaller than 1 km2 rv 0 3 for water bodies between 1 and 5 km2 and rv 0 15 for water bodies 5 km2 following the feature based clustering these 265 water bodies were separated into four different groups with different seasonal inter annual and long term dynamic patterns 1 seasonal dynamic pattern 45 water bodies this group had a clear seasonal dry wet cycle in the water extent time series but there was no obvious long term trend fig 7 a this type of water body is generally located in temperate climate regions where temperature and precipitation vary markedly across the year fig 7e the water level in wet and dry season can rise and fall in concert with the water extent 2 seasonal and inter annual dynamic pattern 105 water bodies the second group also showed a strong seasonal pattern but different from the first group it also showed a clear inter annual variability fig 7b this type of water body is common in temperate climates and in humid continental areas typified by large seasonal and inter annual temperature differences but sometimes can occur in arid and semi arid areas that experience regular drought periods 3 intermittent dynamic pattern 42 water bodies the third group was intermittently flooded with rapid inundation and drought surface water is present for variable periods without detectable seasonal periodicity weeks months or even years may be between two short periods of inundation there was also no detectable long term trend fig 7c this type of water body typically occurs in arid areas fig 7e where the periodic cycles of inundation and drought are primarily in response to extreme and irregular rainfall events this pattern is also found in floodplains such as those on the bank of the river tisza in hungary they may be mostly dry outside seasonal high water periods during which swollen rivers overspill their banks 4 inter annual and long term dynamic pattern 73 water bodies the fourth group showed an obvious inter annual and long trend either increase or decrease in surface water extent over long time without seasonal periodicity fig 7d shows the creation of a new dam in italy i e the alaco dam and has been expanding over time this type of water body is mainly distributed in dry summer temperate climate zones but can also be found in arid areas the long term changes are likely influenced by climate change and human activities 5 discussion this paper demonstrates that the modis swf dataset can provide rich hydrological data for a large number of water bodies across a large region the constructed time series provide detailed temporal information on intermittent seasonal inter annual and long term changes in surface water extent to our knowledge this is the first such construction of wetland temporal dynamics for water bodies with varying sizes 0 01 3100 km2 across a large region and at fine temporal resolution using modis imagery our work improves on previous efforts on surface water monitoring from coarse spatial resolution imagery modis or similar regarding to the detection and monitoring of small water bodies this is because modis swf estimates open surface water fraction instead of binary water presence absence kaptue et al 2013 khandelwal et al 2017 sharma et al 2015 our surface extent time series match well with the relative water level variations and improve the correlation between modis derived water area and relative water level when compared with previous modis based water mapping by khandelwal et al 2017 the comparison with high spatial resolution data i e jrc gsw showed that the modis swf dataset can accurately construct surface water dynamics for many water bodies including very small ones 1 km2 as long as they show sufficient area variations see fig 2 fig 3 and table 2 modis swf was found to be less effective for more stable water bodies that have limited temporal variation one possible reason for this is that limited area variations only result in small spectral changes particularly when having a mix of exposed wet soil and shallow water possibly within a single modis pixel klein et al 2017 yamazaki et al 2015 more importantly our work complements the high spatial resolution data i e jrc gsw by allowing for the detection of abrupt changes inundation and recession processes over short time periods fig s1 s3 and for the better representation of seasonal cycle and long term variability fig 8 and fig 9 the fact that we compared datasets i e modis swf versus landsat derived jrc gsw implies that errors and uncertainties may occur in either of the two datasets table 4 gives a summary of all illustrative examples in this paper including supplement together with their likely error sources and uncertainties these examples represent the water bodies highlighted with red numbers in fig 2 and fig 4 one source of uncertainty is that the jrc gsw monthly water dataset does not include exact dates of the landsat observations used in that month and may not be best represented by the monthly mean value that we calculated from modis swf particularly for lakes with strong dynamics within a month this uncertainty increases fig 8 shows an illustrative example of this for albufera de valencia a ramsar wetland located in eastern spain it is composed of the albufera lake and surrounding rice fields with an average water area of 34 km2 according to the jrc gsw time series the landsat imagery fig 8a revealed that these rice fields flooded twice in 2014 once around mid may to june during rice sowing and start of growth then following harvesting in september october a second flooding took place in november december for nutrient mineralization of the harvested rice fields campos taberner et al 2018 doña et al 2015 comparison of monthly surface area time series derived from jrc gsw and modis swf showed a moderate level of agreement r 0 55 for this wetland modis swf had a larger water extent than jrc gsw as shown as the red boxes in fig 8b and 8c corresponding to may and june when water area experienced rapid changes these changes may not be captured appropriately by jrc gsw due to the coarse temporal resolution and limited valid landsat observations however both the monthly fig 8c and 8 day fig 8d time series from the modis swf clearly captured the two flooding times for each year further illustrations of this same error source i e date unavailability in jrc gsw are provided in the supplementary figures s1 s2 and s3 for sebkhet el hamiet in algeria azraq oasis in jordan and lake chott el jerid in tunisian respectively these figures show strong differences between two datasets correspond to months with rapid water changes in response to erratic rainfall events ben abdallah et al 2018 bryant 1999 these examples demonstrate that a low to moderate correlation between both datasets does not necessarily imply a poor accuracy of modis swf but rather that modis allows to capture rapid temporal changes that went unobserved by the landsat archive there are several sources of commission errors that may not be completely solved by modis swf predominantly due to salt presence fig 9 and emergent vegetation fig s4 fig s5 such commission errors lead to an overestimation of water extent by modis swf fig 9 provides an illustrative example of a small water body in turkey kurt et al 2013 where salt crystallization occurred during the dry season the swf misclassified salt as water due to spectral confusion li et al 2015 resulting in overestimation of the water area by modis swf for example the jrc gsw estimated the surface water extent for this water body derived from landsat images in april 2001 to be 0 6 km2 against 1 6 km2 for modis swf fig 9c and d despite this large bias nmsd 1 49 modis swf clearly captured the water body s seasonal variations and its reduction in size between 2008 and 2014 fig 9a moreover we found that jrc gsw also has considerable omission errors for some locations fig 10 shows an example where omission errors occur for multiple dates for which we only show four moreover the heavily sediment laden seasonally occurring waters in africa were also poorly represented as already indicated by pekel et al 2016 see fig s8 these errors result in a large underestimation of water area for these dates by jrc gsw the temporal dynamics were thus not accurately captured by jrc gsw hence further illustrating that low correlations between both products do not necessarily imply a poor accuracy of modis swf in this situation linking the estimates with temporal in situ observations would be desirable both jrc gsw and modis swf contain missing values due to the presence of clouds cloud shadows snow aerosol and sensor related issues klein et al 2017 if the missing data are inside the water covered area of the roi jrc gsw and modis swf are likely to underestimate the actual water extent in this study we thus applied a 5 missing data threshold for the calculation of water area see section 3 2 locations with poor quality modis pixels e g due to cloud or aerosol effect will often return no data when exceeding the 5 threshold resulting in a sparse time series of modis swf examples are sebkhet sidi elhani in tunisia lake urmia in iran and the sultan marshes in turkey future efforts may consider incorporating temporal interpolation techniques klein et al 2017 or combining radar remote sensing which has the advantage of collecting data under poor weather or atmospheric conditions brisco 2015 montgomery et al 2018 o grady et al 2014 for areas with missing data to ensure a gap free reconstruction of inland water variability the constructed time series of surface water extent have potential to benefit a large number of applications for example the water extent can help to estimate a series of hydrological and climatological parameters it can be used to estimate river width yamazaki et al 2014 river discharge bjerklie et al 2018 pan et al 2016 and water volume gal et al 2016 ogilvie et al 2018b this would be particularly useful for data poor and ungauged wetlands and catchments several studies have estimated lake surface temperatures kettle et al 2004 and evaporation using water area zhan et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 the time series of water extent may be used as a monitoring tool for analyzing hydrologic extremes such as floods and droughts detecting abnormal changes of wetland hydrology capturing short duration events and identifying newly formed and disappearing water bodies these dynamics may be driven by a wide range of natural e g climate topography geology geomorphology and pedology and human factors maintenance irrigation wetland conversion because the role of a specific factor may differ substantially per location and wetland type further studies may use our dataset to investigate possible drivers of wetland degradation and other changes most of the water bodies analyzed in this study are wetlands of international importance ramsar sites they provide a critical habitat for many sensitive species in mediterranean environments the long monitoring information reported here may also help to improve species distribution modelling bradley and fleishman 2008 as well as understanding changes in species numbers and distribution and thus lead to improved management and conservation of biodiversity 6 conclusion this paper highlights that ourmodis derived surface water dataset is valuable for monitoringthe dynamics of mediterranean water bodies based on this dataset we constructed detailed temporal dynamics of open surface water extent for 340 water bodies with varying size 0 01 3100 km2 for large water bodies 100 km2 for which altimetry water level data was available time series of water extent derived from modis swf dataset showed good correlation with water levels our work also showed that the correlation between modis derived water area and relative water level improved when compared with previous modis based water mapping by khandelwal et al 2017 for water bodies smaller than 100 km2 swf proved to be able to effectively monitor their dynamics as long as their area variability was sufficient our work and dataset can therefore be applied to better understand the pattern of hydrological dynamics and as a monitoring tool to identify abnormal changes to seasonal dry wet cycles capturing short duration events and identifying newly formed water bodies as such it may prove a useful tool for improved water management and

5439,wetlands are among the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world due largely to their dynamic hydrology frequent observations by satellite sensors such as the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis allow for monitoring the seasonal inter annual and long term dynamics of surface water extent however existing modis based studies have only demonstrated this for large water bodies 100 km2 despite the ecological importance of smaller sized wetland systems in this paper we assessed if the temporal dynamics of surface water extent can be effectively captured with modis for a wide range of water body sizes specifically 0 01 km2 and larger we constructed the temporal dynamics of surface water extent for 340 individual water bodies in the mediterranean region between 2000 and 2017 using a previously developed 8 day 500 m modis surface water fraction swf dataset we then evaluated how modis swf time series corresponded to water extent derived from a landsat based dataset and to satellite altimetry derived water level data results showed that although correlations between modis and landsat derived swf were poor for relative static water bodies r 0 17 they increased for more dynamic water bodies r 0 81 for dynamic water bodies 100 km2 time series of water extent derived from modis swf showed good correlation with both landsat r 0 76 and water level data ρ 0 63 our modis swf dataset can also effectively monitor the variability of very small water bodies 1 km2 when comparing with landsat data as long as the temporal variability in their surface water area was high we conclude that modis swf is a useful product to help understand hydrological dynamics for both small and larger sized water bodies and to monitor their seasonal intermittent inter annual and long term changes keywords small wetlands ramsar wetlands hydrology water area high frequency trend analysis 1 introduction wetlands are among the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world due largely to their dynamic hydrology halls 1997 the hydrological cycle of flooding and drying within a wetland is important for the formation and maintenance of specific wetland habitat types and the species that they support halls 1997 thehydrological dynamics also reflect spatial and temporal changes in a number of environmental factors including anomalous rainfall driven flood events cian et al 2018 seasonal thawing andsnowmeltin spring watts et al 2012 and longer term environmental changes street and grove 1976 characterizinghydrological variations is a prerequisite for understanding hydrological and ecological processes across different wetland types and to identify abnormal changes in wetland hydrology in relationship to normal variability of wetland hydrology general patterns however accurate information on wetland dynamics is scarce particularly for small sized wetlands ogilvie et al 2018a despite their size small wetlands in arid semi arid and mediterranean regions often act as critical refuge and breeding areas offer food sources for wildlife and harbor many plant and animal species that would otherwise not survive in the surrounding landscape calhoun et al 2017 mcculloch et al 2003 efficient accurate and robust tools for monitoring the hydrology of wetlands over large areas are urgently needed for management and conservation strategies finlayson et al 1999 turak et al 2017 remote sensing has been used as a cost effectivetool to monitor the changes of surface water in space and time alsdorf et al 2007 ozesmi and bauer 2002 two types of remote sensing instruments are suitable for monitoring earth surface water i e microwave and optical sensors microwave sensors can effectively obtain imagery during day and night they have the ability to penetrate clouds and partially also vegetation due to their usage of long wavelength radiation several studies have used passive and active microwave remote sensing data to monitor surface water and flood inundation at global scale but at a coarse spatial resolution 25x25 km du et al 2018 papa et al 2010 prigent et al 2007 schroeder et al 2015 synthetic aperture radar sar images have great potential in detecting water surface beneath vegetation schumann and moller 2015 and in near real time monitoring of flood inundation martinis et al 2009 shen et al 2019 however the high costs associated with obtaining sar datasets for large areas and in a timely fashion have limited their usefulness for continental to global applications nonetheless at present esa s sentinel 1 satellite provides free consistent global observations every 6 days offering more opportunities for water body detection including those under vegetation bioresita et al 2018 clement et al 2018 hardy et al 2019 optical remote sensing data have been intensively used to monitor open surface water and flood inundation due to their straightforward interpretability of water features very high spatial resolution imagery provided by spot ikonos quickbird rapideye worldview as well as the recent small satellite constellations such as planet labs http planet com are generally able to detect small water bodies with a higher accuracy and are also effective in monitoring the changes of surface water e g cooley et al 2017 malinowski et al 2015 however surface water studies based on very high resolution imagery usually focused on small regions due to size of the image footprint and data costs many attempts to monitor surface water changes with 10 30 m resolution optical data have been reported including spectral data from landsat borro et al 2014 doña et al 2016 jin et al 2017 tan et al 2019 and sentinel 2 kaplan and avdan 2017 yang et al 2018 for specific locations for larger spatial and longer time scales several efforts exist to map and monitor surface water changes with landsat data at regional halabisky et al 2016 heimhuber et al 2016 continental mueller et al 2016 and global scale donchyts et al 2016 pekel et al 2016 these datasets allow for analyzing surface water dynamics at fine spatial resolution and over a long time frame however the combination of clouds and revisit time of landsat results in data gaps and temporal discontinuities in the data pekel et al 2016 the limited number of observations does not provide enough detail for understanding seasonal patterns and dynamics of inter annual and long trend response much less to determine if measured changes in the surface water extent represent natural seasonal variability or abnormal changes in wetland hydrology moderate to coarse resolution imagery derived from satellite sensors such as avhrr advanced very high resolution radiometer and modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer are acquired with shorter revisit times and provide long term and dense time series data therefore they have been widely used for monitoring changes in surface water and inundation for large areas examples include nasa near real time global flood products at 250 m resolution https floodmap modaps eosdis nasa gov modis 500 m water mask carroll et al 2017 500 m resolution daily global surface water change database 2001 2016 developed by ji et al 2018 and the global waterpack which maps daily global inland water bodies at 250 m resolution for the years 2013 2015 klein et al 2017 all of these studies and datasets are based on binary classification methods thus small water bodies especially those smaller than the modis pixel size cannot be well represented for individual water bodies chen et al 2014 investigated the spatial temporal patterns of abrupt changes of poyang lake using time series of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis 16 day normalized difference vegetation index ndvi product using the same product and unsupervised classification gao et al 2012 estimated historical area changes in 34 large reservoirs around the globe khandelwal et al 2017 applied supervised classification on 16 day 500 m modis surface reflectance time series data to monitor changes in surface water extent for a global set of 94 large reservoirs these studies are confined to large water bodies with an area 100 km2 to overcome the limitation of coarse spatial resolution and incorporate small water bodies we have developed a dense 18 year time series dataset of surface water for the mediterranean region in a previous paper li et al 2019 this dataset estimated the surface water fraction swf for each 500 m modis pixel using nadir reflectances from the mcd43a4 product with a rule based regression model by assessing water fractions the dataset allows for mapping and monitoring surface water smaller than a modis pixel although in that paper we briefly illustrated the dataset s options for monitoring temporal changes a formal assessment of the ability to monitor surface water dynamics taking into account water body size has not been performed therefore the aim of this paper is to assess if our modis swf product can effectively capture the temporal changes in surface water extent for a wide range of water body sizes i e 0 01 3100 km2 our specific objectives are 1 to derive temporal dynamics of surface water extent between 2000 and 2017 for individual water bodies using the previously developed 8 day 500 m resolution modis swf dataset 2 to assess how closely those temporal dynamics match the variability of surface water extent obtained from a landsat based dataset and water level data 3 to characterize the water extent time series and to identify different dynamic patterns e g intermittent seasonal inter annual or long trend dynamics 2 data 2 1 landsat based global surface water dataset the joint research centre s global surface water jrc gsw dataset pekel et al 2016 maps the temporal and spatial dynamics of open surface water over a 32 year period from march 1984 to october 2015 at monthly time interval and at 30 m spatial resolution globally this dataset was produced by analyzing the entire archive of landsat 5 7 and 8 using an expert system the expert system is a sequential decision tree that used both the multi spectral and multi temporal attributes of the landsat archive as well as ancillary data layers the dataset was validated using 40 000 reference points from very high resolution satellite and aerial imagery which revealed a high accuracy with a commission error 1 and omission error 5 pekel et al 2016 the jrc gsw dataset includes the monthly water history dataset which is a set of 380 global maps documenting the water presence for each month from march 1984 to october 2015 and eight additional information layers documenting different facets of the surface water dynamics the complete dataset with the described layers is available in google earth engine although jrc gsw has a high spatial accuracy it only provides information on changes in surface water at a monthly interval furthermore it contains long temporal gaps due to both the limited number of acquisitions during specific time intervals and due to region and month dependent persistency of cloud cover these temporal gaps can affect the accuracy of the trend and seasonality information li et al 2019 yamazaki and trigg 2016 2 2 modis derived surface water fraction dataset the modis based surface water fraction swf dataset li et al 2019 provides 18 years 2000 2017 of water fraction maps at 500 m spatial resolution and 8 day temporal resolution for the mediterranean region we derived this dataset from the modis terra and aqua nadir brdf adjusted reflectance nbar product mcd43a4 v006 through a global rule based regression model which used modis derived spectral information its temporal characteristics and topographic information as predictor variables reference data were generated from the jrc gsw monthly water history maps for 7 000 modis scale cells 500x500 m divided into 3500 training and 3500 validation locations these reference data areas are sampled across the entire mediterranean area different water permanence types seasonal and permanent and different water fraction categories 0 100 missing data in jrc gsw monthly maps can affect the quality and accuracy of the reference data when aggregated to modis resolution therefore we only retained those modis scale cells that contained no missing data the correspondence between modis swf and surface water fraction derived from the jrc gsw product is strong r2 0 91 an advantage of modis swf over jrc gsw is that it can provide open surface water information for the long temporal and spatial data gaps of jrc gsw moreover the high temporal resolution allows better capturing of rapid changes in open surface water extent that cannot be detected by the monthly jrc gsw product li et al 2019 2 3 water level data we obtained water level time series measured with spaceborne radar altimetry for 14 large water bodies 100 km2 fig 1 and table 3 from three websites 1 the u s department of agriculture s global reservoir and lake monitoring grlm http www pecad fas usda gov cropexplorer global reservoir 2 the laboratoire d etudes en géophysique et océanographies spatiales legos http hydroweb theia land fr in france crétaux et al 2011 and 3 the database for hydrological time series of inland waters dahiti http dahiti dgfi tum de en schwatke et

variation with respect to the mean level of a given envisat reference cycle at 35 day intervals is also provided the grlm offers both the raw and smoothed time series of water level which is performed with a median type filter to eliminate outliers and reduce high frequency noise we used the smoothed data in this study legos and dahiti use additional altimeter missions besides those used by grlm including jason 3 cryosat 2 and saral altika 3 methods 3 1 selection of individual water bodies to compare water extent dynamics from modis swf and jrc gsw for individual water bodies we selected and analyzed 340 water bodies these were all situated in the mediterranean region as defined by li et al 2019 these water bodies vary from 0 01 km2 to 3100 km2 in size i e mean water area according to jrc gsw time series table 1 lists the number of water bodies within five size categories i e 0 1 km2 1 5 km2 5 20 km2 20 100 km2 and 100 km2 and fig 1 shows their spatial distribution to obtain our selection of 340 water bodies we first selected all ramsar wetlands of the mediterranean region excluding the wetlands types that are not characterized by the presence of open surface water such as wet meadows marshes and peatlands this resulted in 279 water bodies we added 14 large lakes and reservoirs 100 km2 to our selection see fig 1 and the list in table 3 these 14 lakes are not ramsar sites but were included by khandelwal et al 2017 in their study on modis based surface water extent mapping and coincided with the lakes for which altimetry water level data were available section 2 3 we thus included these lakes for comparison in addition we included 47 non ramsar water bodies that showed large inter annual variability in surface water extent according to li et al 2019 3 2 calculation of water extent time series to identify open surface water dynamics per water body we first identified the spatial extent within which we summarized the open surface water presence for this purpose we used the jrc gsw maximum water extent as the initial region of interest roi around this roi we created a buffer of one 500 m resolution modis pixel to include nearby locations because there is a chance that surface water extends beyond what could be identified by jrc gsw we then derived time series of water extent for each buffered roi from the modis swf dataset by summing the water fraction of all pixels inside the roi and multiplying this by the modis pixel size i e 250 000 m2 we also derived time series of water extent from the jrc gsw monthly history dataset by multiplying the number of water pixels inside the roi with the landsat pixel size i e 900 m2 missing data in a roi can affect the accuracy when calculating the water area to deal with this problem and ensure the accuracy of the area calculations we calculated for each roi and each date the valid cloud free data fraction by dividing the valid pixels by all pixels within the roi we then only retained an area if for that date it contained at least 95 of valid data from modis swf and jrc gsw derived water extent time series 3 3 comparison of water extent time series we compared time series of surface water extent derived from modis swf with those from jrc gsw to see if the temporal dynamics of surface water extent obtained from the two datasets match with each other specifically we calculated the monthly mean water extent from modis swf for the period from february 2000 to october 2015 and compared it with jrc gsw monthly water history two statistical measures were calculated the pearson s correlation coefficient r and the normalized mean signed deviation nmsd 1 nmsd msd area mean where a r e a m e a n is the mean water area according to the jrc gsw time series msd is the mean signed deviation which is calculated as 2 msd 1 n i 1 n x i y i where x i is the time series of surface water extent derived from modis swf and y i is those derived from jrc gsw to assess if the agreement between jrc gsw and modis derived surface water results is related to the dynamics of the water body a measure of relative variability rv in surface water extent was calculated for each water body as 3 rv area max area min area mean where a r e a m a x a r e a m i n and a r e a m e a n are the maximum minimum and mean water area according to jrc gsw time series we then plotted the distribution of r as a function of rv for different water size categories we also combined the effect of both water size categories and rv on r in a single analysis for this we further divided all water bodies into six rv levels i e 0 rv 0 15 0 15 rv 0 3 0 3 rv 1 0 1 rv 2 2 rv 5 and rv 5 3 4 comparison with water level data to evaluate the performance of modis swf for monitoring the dynamics of open surface water we also compared the water extent time series with water level for 14 large lakes 100 km2 for which satellite altimetry data was available see section 2 3 specifically we calculated the spearman rank correlation ρ between monthly mean water level and monthly water extent obtained from jrc gsw and modis swf respectively a rank correlation was used because relationships between water level and extent are non linear and depend on bathymetry hayashi and van der kamp 2000 to obtain a temporal match between our modis swf 8 day product and water level in addition to the monthly comparison we also resampled the water level data available every 10 or 35 days to 8 day estimates using linear interpolation there could be long time gaps between two water level observations due to missing data ricko et al 2012 we thus further removed those interpolated data if the time gap is longer than three months the same 14 lakes were included by khandelwal et al 2017 who mapped surface water area dynamics between 2000 and 2015 based on binary classification of modis 8 day 500 m resolution data to assess if our product offers an improvement with respect to the one of khandelwal et al 2017 we calculated ρ also between water level and their 8 day time series available at http z umn edu monitoringwaterrse to make a fair comparison for both products ρ was calculated for the 2000 2015 time frame matching the study by khandelwal et al 2017 3 5 characterization of the temporal variability of water extent to characterize the temporal dynamics within the 18 year water extent time series derived from modis swf we created a subset that only included the dynamic water bodies which were defined by applying a threshold to rv for each water size category we then extracted three features including the strength of seasonality strength of trend and stationarity these features were used in previous studies to characterize hydrological time series buma et al 2016 lafare et al 2016 to extract the features we first decomposed the water extent time series using theseasonal trend decomposition algorithm stl cleveland et al 1990 which is capable ofaccommodating missing values and is robust to noise the stl decomposes a time series yt into seasonal st trend tt and remainder rt components as 4 y t s t t t r t after we obtained the seasonal st and trend tt series we normalized them to 0 1 to indicate the strength of seasonality and trend using the following equations 5 f s m a x 0 1 v a r r t v a r s t r t 6 f t m a x 0 1 v a r r t v a r t t r t where var stands for variance a series with seasonal strength f s close to 0 exhibits almost no seasonality while a series with strong seasonality will havef s close to 1 wang et al 2006 this is similar for the strength of the trend component f t we calculated the strength of seasonality and trend by using the stl features package which implements the stl algorithm in r statistical software r core team 2018 and used the suggestions of cleveland et al 1990 to set the parameter values to calculate stationarity the water extent time series were first linearly rescaled to 0 1 then we calculated the annual mean from the rescaled water extent time series the stationarity is calculated as the variance of annual mean wang et al 2006 finally based on these three characteristics i e strength of seasonality strength of trend and stationarity extracted from water extent time series derived from modis swf we organized the water bodies into groups with similar dynamic patterns using the k means clustering algorithm aghabozorgi et al 2015 4 results 4 1 comparison of water extent time series based on modis swf we constructed temporal dynamics of open surface water extent at 8 day time interval for 340 water bodies spanning a time period from 2000 to 2017 for comparison with jrc gsw three water bodies i e lake urmia in iran sebkhet sidi elhani in tunisia and sultan marshes in turkey were removed from further analysis because for 10 individual months both datasets had overlap in terms of valid water extent retrievals which was considered too few for a proper statistical basis fig 2 plots the distribution of r between monthly water extent derived from modis swf and those from jrc gsw as a function of rv for different water size categories there is a general increase in r when the water relative variability increases for all water size categories this indicates that small variations in water extent are not similarly described by the two products suggesting a lower accuracy of the modis swf in monitoring fluctuations of more stable water bodies for water bodies with a larger rv the temporal variability in monthly water extent obtained from both datasets had a good agreement with r generally above or near 0 8 this includes very small water bodies 1 km2 examples of four very small water bodies i e laguna dulce in spain laguna de la nava de fuentes in spain complexe du bas tahaddart in morocco and livanjsko polje in bosnia and herzegovina are shown in fig 3 these four water bodies are all ramsar sites with an area 1 km2 i e mean water area according to jrc gsw time series comparison of monthly water extent derived from both datasets shows a good agreement r 0 79 for these small water bodies note that several cases with small value of r are identified in fig 2 each marked with a red number these cases are caused by a number of factors which are discussed in the discussion section table 2 shows that the average correlation increases when water variability increases with the smallest r of 0 17 for static water bodies rv 0 15 and the largest r of 0 81 for highly dynamic water bodies rv 5 in addition table 2 shows that the effect of rv on r depends on the water size categories considered this may be expected as small relative changes for larger water bodies as expressed by rv still correspond to substantial absolute changes which can be captured by modis table 2 signals how much variability can be captured by our modis swf product for example the reasonable correlation r 0 5 found for water bodies smaller than 1 km2 when rv 1 implies that modis swf resembles jrc gsw for representing absolute variability of 1 km2 examination of the nmsd compared to different water size categories shows that modis swf and jrc gsw have the largest difference for the estimation of very small water bodies 1 km2 fig 4 modis swf tends to estimate smaller values of water extent compared to jrc gsw in most cases this can be partly attributed to the underestimation of larger water fractions by modis swf li et al 2018 fig 4 also reveals that nmsd decreases when rv increases for water bodies 100 km2 however the nmsd was surprisingly large for highly dynamic water bodies rv 1 for those in the 0 100 km2 size categories such as those cases marked with red numbers in fig 4 these large nmsd can be caused by a number of factors which are discussed in the discussion section 4 2 comparison with water level data monthly water extent obtained from modis swf shows moderately high correlation with both monthly water area derived from jrc gsw r 0 76 and with monthly water level data ρ 0 63 for 10 dynamic large lakes rv 0 15 and size 100 km2 table 3 correlations were low for the four lakes with a small variation rv 0 15 in surface water both r and ρ are 0 4 see table3 similarly modis swf 8 day water extent shows moderate to high correlation ρ 0 60 with water level for these 10 dynamic lakes and low correlation ρ 0 17 for the four stable lakes suggesting that the modis swf can accurately monitor the seasonal intra annual and long term variability in surface water extent of those dynamic lakes table 3 also indicates that our modis swf 8 day data outperformed the khandelwal et al 2017 results in monitoring the dynamics of water bodies with larger correlations for the 10 dynamic lakes fig 5 and fig 6 show the comparison results between water extent time series derived from different data sources and water level variability for the karakaya baraji reservoir in turkey and the tshchikskoye lake in russia respectively the karakaya baraji reservoir in turkey has a compact shape fig 5a fig 5c and fig 5f show that the reservoir has large temporal variations despite its rv of 0 30 high correlations were achieved for both the modis swf monthly ρ 0 88 and 8 day water extent ρ 0 86 suggesting that the temporal variations of this lake were well captured by modis swf and better than by the khandelwal et al 2017 study ρ 0 66 the tshchikskoye lake in russia has strong seasonal variations fig 6c and f with a rv of 0 50 the jrc gsw monthly water extent has a high correlation ρ 0 80 with water level data but with many missing data in the time series fig 6c the modis swf monthly water extent also achieved a high correlation ρ 0 80 fig 6b with the seasonal variations accurately captured fig 6c the modis swf 8 day water extent also greatly improved with respect to the khandelwal et al 2017 study ρ 0 48 4 3 characterization of water bodies by their temporal variability of water extent we created a subset of 265 water extent time series by only selecting the dynamic water bodies i e rv 1 for water bodies smaller than 1 km2 rv 0 3 for water bodies between 1 and 5 km2 and rv 0 15 for water bodies 5 km2 following the feature based clustering these 265 water bodies were separated into four different groups with different seasonal inter annual and long term dynamic patterns 1 seasonal dynamic pattern 45 water bodies this group had a clear seasonal dry wet cycle in the water extent time series but there was no obvious long term trend fig 7 a this type of water body is generally located in temperate climate regions where temperature and precipitation vary markedly across the year fig 7e the water level in wet and dry season can rise and fall in concert with the water extent 2 seasonal and inter annual dynamic pattern 105 water bodies the second group also showed a strong seasonal pattern but different from the first group it also showed a clear inter annual variability fig 7b this type of water body is common in temperate climates and in humid continental areas typified by large seasonal and inter annual temperature differences but sometimes can occur in arid and semi arid areas that experience regular drought periods 3 intermittent dynamic pattern 42 water bodies the third group was intermittently flooded with rapid inundation and drought surface water is present for variable periods without detectable seasonal periodicity weeks months or even years may be between two short periods of inundation there was also no detectable long term trend fig 7c this type of water body typically occurs in arid areas fig 7e where the periodic cycles of inundation and drought are primarily in response to extreme and irregular rainfall events this pattern is also found in floodplains such as those on the bank of the river tisza in hungary they may be mostly dry outside seasonal high water periods during which swollen rivers overspill their banks 4 inter annual and long term dynamic pattern 73 water bodies the fourth group showed an obvious inter annual and long trend either increase or decrease in surface water extent over long time without seasonal periodicity fig 7d shows the creation of a new dam in italy i e the alaco dam and has been expanding over time this type of water body is mainly distributed in dry summer temperate climate zones but can also be found in arid areas the long term changes are likely influenced by climate change and human activities 5 discussion this paper demonstrates that the modis swf dataset can provide rich hydrological data for a large number of water bodies across a large region the constructed time series provide detailed temporal information on intermittent seasonal inter annual and long term changes in surface water extent to our knowledge this is the first such construction of wetland temporal dynamics for water bodies with varying sizes 0 01 3100 km2 across a large region and at fine temporal resolution using modis imagery our work improves on previous efforts on surface water monitoring from coarse spatial resolution imagery modis or similar regarding to the detection and monitoring of small water bodies this is because modis swf estimates open surface water fraction instead of binary water presence absence kaptue et al 2013 khandelwal et al 2017 sharma et al 2015 our surface extent time series match well with the relative water level variations and improve the correlation between modis derived water area and relative water level when compared with previous modis based water mapping by khandelwal et al 2017 the comparison with high spatial resolution data i e jrc gsw showed that the modis swf dataset can accurately construct surface water dynamics for many water bodies including very small ones 1 km2 as long as they show sufficient area variations see fig 2 fig 3 and table 2 modis swf was found to be less effective for more stable water bodies that have limited temporal variation one possible reason for this is that limited area variations only result in small spectral changes particularly when having a mix of exposed wet soil and shallow water possibly within a single modis pixel klein et al 2017 yamazaki et al 2015 more importantly our work complements the high spatial resolution data i e jrc gsw by allowing for the detection of abrupt changes inundation and recession processes over short time periods fig s1 s3 and for the better representation of seasonal cycle and long term variability fig 8 and fig 9 the fact that we compared datasets i e modis swf versus landsat derived jrc gsw implies that errors and uncertainties may occur in either of the two datasets table 4 gives a summary of all illustrative examples in this paper including supplement together with their likely error sources and uncertainties these examples represent the water bodies highlighted with red numbers in fig 2 and fig 4 one source of uncertainty is that the jrc gsw monthly water dataset does not include exact dates of the landsat observations used in that month and may not be best represented by the monthly mean value that we calculated from modis swf particularly for lakes with strong dynamics within a month this uncertainty increases fig 8 shows an illustrative example of this for albufera de valencia a ramsar wetland located in eastern spain it is composed of the albufera lake and surrounding rice fields with an average water area of 34 km2 according to the jrc gsw time series the landsat imagery fig 8a revealed that these rice fields flooded twice in 2014 once around mid may to june during rice sowing and start of growth then following harvesting in september october a second flooding took place in november december for nutrient mineralization of the harvested rice fields campos taberner et al 2018 doña et al 2015 comparison of monthly surface area time series derived from jrc gsw and modis swf showed a moderate level of agreement r 0 55 for this wetland modis swf had a larger water extent than jrc gsw as shown as the red boxes in fig 8b and 8c corresponding to may and june when water area experienced rapid changes these changes may not be captured appropriately by jrc gsw due to the coarse temporal resolution and limited valid landsat observations however both the monthly fig 8c and 8 day fig 8d time series from the modis swf clearly captured the two flooding times for each year further illustrations of this same error source i e date unavailability in jrc gsw are provided in the supplementary figures s1 s2 and s3 for sebkhet el hamiet in algeria azraq oasis in jordan and lake chott el jerid in tunisian respectively these figures show strong differences between two datasets correspond to months with rapid water changes in response to erratic rainfall events ben abdallah et al 2018 bryant 1999 these examples demonstrate that a low to moderate correlation between both datasets does not necessarily imply a poor accuracy of modis swf but rather that modis allows to capture rapid temporal changes that went unobserved by the landsat archive there are several sources of commission errors that may not be completely solved by modis swf predominantly due to salt presence fig 9 and emergent vegetation fig s4 fig s5 such commission errors lead to an overestimation of water extent by modis swf fig 9 provides an illustrative example of a small water body in turkey kurt et al 2013 where salt crystallization occurred during the dry season the swf misclassified salt as water due to spectral confusion li et al 2015 resulting in overestimation of the water area by modis swf for example the jrc gsw estimated the surface water extent for this water body derived from landsat images in april 2001 to be 0 6 km2 against 1 6 km2 for modis swf fig 9c and d despite this large bias nmsd 1 49 modis swf clearly captured the water body s seasonal variations and its reduction in size between 2008 and 2014 fig 9a moreover we found that jrc gsw also has considerable omission errors for some locations fig 10 shows an example where omission errors occur for multiple dates for which we only show four moreover the heavily sediment laden seasonally occurring waters in africa were also poorly represented as already indicated by pekel et al 2016 see fig s8 these errors result in a large underestimation of water area for these dates by jrc gsw the temporal dynamics were thus not accurately captured by jrc gsw hence further illustrating that low correlations between both products do not necessarily imply a poor accuracy of modis swf in this situation linking the estimates with temporal in situ observations would be desirable both jrc gsw and modis swf contain missing values due to the presence of clouds cloud shadows snow aerosol and sensor related issues klein et al 2017 if the missing data are inside the water covered area of the roi jrc gsw and modis swf are likely to underestimate the actual water extent in this study we thus applied a 5 missing data threshold for the calculation of water area see section 3 2 locations with poor quality modis pixels e g due to cloud or aerosol effect will often return no data when exceeding the 5 threshold resulting in a sparse time series of modis swf examples are sebkhet sidi elhani in tunisia lake urmia in iran and the sultan marshes in turkey future efforts may consider incorporating temporal interpolation techniques klein et al 2017 or combining radar remote sensing which has the advantage of collecting data under poor weather or atmospheric conditions brisco 2015 montgomery et al 2018 o grady et al 2014 for areas with missing data to ensure a gap free reconstruction of inland water variability the constructed time series of surface water extent have potential to benefit a large number of applications for example the water extent can help to estimate a series of hydrological and climatological parameters it can be used to estimate river width yamazaki et al 2014 river discharge bjerklie et al 2018 pan et al 2016 and water volume gal et al 2016 ogilvie et al 2018b this would be particularly useful for data poor and ungauged wetlands and catchments several studies have estimated lake surface temperatures kettle et al 2004 and evaporation using water area zhan et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 the time series of water extent may be used as a monitoring tool for analyzing hydrologic extremes such as floods and droughts detecting abnormal changes of wetland hydrology capturing short duration events and identifying newly formed and disappearing water bodies these dynamics may be driven by a wide range of natural e g climate topography geology geomorphology and pedology and human factors maintenance irrigation wetland conversion because the role of a specific factor may differ substantially per location and wetland type further studies may use our dataset to investigate possible drivers of wetland degradation and other changes most of the water bodies analyzed in this study are wetlands of international importance ramsar sites they provide a critical habitat for many sensitive species in mediterranean environments the long monitoring information reported here may also help to improve species distribution modelling bradley and fleishman 2008 as well as understanding changes in species numbers and distribution and thus lead to improved management and conservation of biodiversity 6 conclusion this paper highlights that ourmodis derived surface water dataset is valuable for monitoringthe dynamics of mediterranean water bodies based on this dataset we constructed detailed temporal dynamics of open surface water extent for 340 water bodies with varying size 0 01 3100 km2 for large water bodies 100 km2 for which altimetry water level data was available time series of water extent derived from modis swf dataset showed good correlation with water levels our work also showed that the correlation between modis derived water area and relative water level improved when compared with previous modis based water mapping by khandelwal et al 2017 for water bodies smaller than 100 km2 swf proved to be able to effectively monitor their dynamics as long as their area variability was sufficient our work and dataset can therefore be applied to better understand the pattern of hydrological dynamics and as a monitoring tool to identify abnormal changes to seasonal dry wet cycles capturing short duration events and identifying newly formed water bodies as such it may prove a useful tool for improved water management and biodiversity conservation the 8 day time series of water extent for the 340 water bodies as derived from modis swf are openly available through https doi org 10 17026 dans x7c atbt credit authorship
