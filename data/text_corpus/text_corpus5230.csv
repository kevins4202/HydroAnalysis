characterize landscape change in the united states from 1985 to present lcmap will be used to explain how past present and future landscape change affects society and natural systems here we describe a modeling framework for producing high resolution spatial and thematic landscape projections at a national scale using a unique parcel based modeling framework the methodology was tested by modeling 11 land use scenarios and 3 climate realizations for the u s great plains results demonstrate 1 an ability to balance competing land use demands from quite variable complex scenarios 2 urban growth that matches theoretical future patterns 3 the value of remote sensing data sources for model parameterization and for deriving landscape parcels and 4 a pragmatic approach that facilitates the development of high thematic and spatial resolution projections at a national scale keywords scenario projection model land use great plains 1 introduction remote sensing provides synoptic consistent and repeatable observations of the earth s surface and is frequently used as the basis for mapping land use and land cover lulc at moderate to high resolution across broad geographic areas hansen and loveland 2012 lamine et al 2018 for the united states multiple national scale lulc mapping and monitoring programs have been based on the landsat series of earth observations including the national land cover database nlcd homer et al 2004 fry et al 2011 homer et al 2015 yang et al 2018 the u s geological survey usgs land cover trends project loveland et al 2002 sleeter et al 2013 the landfire project rollins 2009 and the u s department of agriculture s usda cropland data layer cdl usda national agricultural statistics service cropland data layer 2018 the forecasting scenarios of land use fore sce model was developed to capitalize on these remote sensing based lulc databases and has been used to both backcast and project future lulc for the conterminous united states at 250 m spatial resolution sohl et al 2014a 2016a fore sce based lulc data have been used for a wide variety of applications including assessments of biodiversity sohl 2014 bellard et al 2015 water quality and flow tao et al 2014 rajib and merwade 2017 natural hazards strader 2018 biogeochemistry and carbon ren et al 2015 tan et al 2015 and radiative forcing and climate barnes et al 2012 while the fore sce projections have been widely used it has been noted that there simply are not any alternative landscape projections for the conterminous united states at a comparable spatial and thematic resolution riordanrundel 2014 several researchers have noted the projections are a good first step in need of further refinement with a desire for landscape projections with higher spatial resolution ahiablame et al 2017 drake et al 2017 improved thematic resolution viger et al 2011 rajib et al 2016 different or customized scenarios ahiablame et al 2017 beatty et al 2016 or a need for tighter integration to hydrologic and or climate models barnes et al 2012 byrd et al 2015 improving the consistency with nlcd alone would greatly improve the utility of fore sce based landscape projections given the extremely broad user community that has developed for nlcd products over the past 20 years increased data availability and a new generation of remote sensing algorithms offer the potential to help improve our characterization of landscape change and inform regional to national scale landscape modeling national research council nrc 2014 finer spatial resolution data integrated with ancillary biophysical and socioeconomic data are improving our ability to couple land change models with models from other disciplines brown et al 2013 remote sensing data are becoming available at increased temporal density and over longer time periods particularly as data harmonization efforts facilitate data comparison and data compositing between multiple sensors such as landsat and sentinel 2 claverie et al 2018 defourny et al 2019 griffiths et al 2019 identification of landscape change has begun to move from a traditional analysis of two discrete end points in time to trajectory analyses using a temporally dense stack of remote sensing imagery kennedy et al 2007 huang et al 2010 new per pixel analyses have been developed in recent years to take advantage of the increased data availability and temporal density and use all available cloud free pixels at the site level zhu and woodcock 2014 pflugmacher et al 2019 beyond the quantification and mapping of landscape change new data sources and techniques are beginning to unlock the longstanding challenge of socializing the pixel geoghegan et al 1998 spatial driving force analyses are linking spatially explicit remote sensing data with ancillary socioeconomic and biophysical data to quantify driving force impacts on land use silva et al 2008 kuang et al 2016 increasing our ability to model the drivers of landscape change the usgs earth resources observation and science center established the land change monitoring assessment and projection lcmap initiative to capitalize on these new developments in remote sensing and to characterize landscape change across the united states lcmap relies on the deep temporal time series from the landsat archive along with new time series analyses to map and monitor landscape change from 1985 through the present however lcmap goes beyond mapping with a premise to explain how past present and future landscape change affects society and natural systems at local to national scales as part of this ongoing effort the assessment element of lcmap will characterize historical to current landscape change with descriptions of regional to national scale geographies of change and the key drivers and consequences of that change an applications element will work with interdisciplinary research teams to assess interactions among landscape change and a host of biophysical and socioeconomic applications each of these elements facilitates the projections element of lcmap here we 1 summarize goals for the projections element of the new lcmap initiative 2 describe new approaches required to meet those goals with an emphasis on using remote sensing as a basis for landscape modeling and 3 evaluate those approaches with scenario based projections in the u s great plains at substantially higher spatial and thematic resolution than past fore sce applications results demonstrate our ability to 1 produce national scale landscape projections consistent with the most widely used global scenario frameworks and 2 maintain spatial and thematic consistency to existing usgs landsat based land cover databases facilitating their use in existing research and land management applications 2 lcmap projections background and goals the projections element is dependent upon other research elements of lcmap what follows is a short summary of the monitoring and assessment elements and their contribution to projections followed by a summary of overall goals for projections 2 1 lcmap monitoring and assessment lcmap projections are dependent upon lcmap monitoring and assessment research and products as well as other remote sensing based data the monitoring element of lcmap exploits availability of landsat analysis ready data ard dwyer et al 2018 and time series analysis ard substantially reduce the burden of pre processing on users of landsat data with geometric and radiometric correction and quantification of image quality landsat level 1 terrain corrected data from landsats 4 5 7 and 8 populate ard and provide surface reflectance top of atmosphere reflectance brightness temperature and pixel quality information the monitoring methodology is based on the continuous change detection and classification ccdc algorithm zhu et al 2016 applied to all available cloud and shadow free pixels in the ard archive from 1985 to present the pixel level analysis characterizes the landscape based on components of seasonality trend and break estimates of surface reflectance and brightness temperature zhu and woodcock 2014 the change detection component of ccdc characterizes the spectral time series and identifies dates where spectral patterns diverge from past patterns these breaks serve as endpoints for distinct time series segments where within segment patterns are relatively homogeneous the classification element of ccdc uses a decision tree classifier to produce a suite of 10 different data products at annual steps for each ard tile applied for all tiles in the conterminous united states table 1 the assessment component of lcmap uses monitoring results to characterize lulc change in the united states with regional and national syntheses similar to the four regional syntheses produced as part of the usgs trends project sleeter et al 2012a auch and karstensen 2015 taylor et al 2015 sayler et al 2016 the assessments summaries will include national and regional scale synopses of the rates sectors driving forces and potential consequences of landscape change through the lcmap analysis period contributing to this work and to the validation of lcmap monitoring results is an independent reference data set of 25 000 sample points across the conterminous united states points were selected with simple random sampling with the timesync tool cohen et al 2010 used to aid in the manual interpretation of lulc attributes throughout the lcmap timeframe 1985 to present assessments work also includes research on the primary drivers of landscape change benefitting the projections work described in the next section finally assessments will coordinate with an applications element of lcmap to use monitoring and assessment results to determine feedbacks among landscape change and societal and ecological processes of interest 2 2 primary deliverables lcmap projections projections deliverables associated with lcmap are focused on maximizing relevancy for the applications of researchers land managers and others with an interest in lulc change users of past fore sce projections noted utility of the projections would be improved if spatial and thematic characteristics were comparable to national scale land cover data sets such as nlcd and cdl this work is thus designed to produce a suite of lulc projections for the conterminous united states with characteristics as similar as possible to these widely used datasets we have two primary deliverables or research outcomes associated with lcmap projections periodic production of scenario based national scale projections with updated projections created as new source scenarios become available see below collaborative modeling applications focused on interdisciplinary analyses of research questions related to 1 water resources 2 biologic resources 3 natural hazards and human health and 4 climate weather and biogeochemical cycles the focus in this paper is the production of the landscape projections themselves with two primary products 1 short to medium term business as usual bau projections based on recent lcmap measured landscape trends 2 a suite of long term projections that represent 1 the most widely used scenario frameworks e g intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc scenarios and 2 the vast uncertainties in future landscapes through scenarios with diverse outcomes new projections will be produced for each new ipcc assessment report ar short to moderate term bau projections that can be rapidly produced from recent lulc trends support near real time applications that require the most likely near term landscape trends the strategy for longer term projections is focused on maximizing utility for the widest array of research and application efforts including our own where selection of scenarios is a critical element given a literally infinite array of potential scenarios the ipcc series of scenarios are the most logical choice on which to base periodically modeled projections because they 1 explicitly define a wide array of underlying socioeconomic and climate assumptions that directly feed into lulc modeling 2 have a wide variety of ancillary data associated with them including climate data emissions economic modeling demographic assumptions and more and 3 are extremely well vetted providing an accepted scenario framework that is widely used by many researchers facilitating cooperative work and consistent comparison among research applications however individual scenarios within one scenario family tend to cluster towards similar outcomes and underestimate overall uncertainties in future landscapes sohl et al 2016b thus we will also strive to include other scenario frameworks to represent a greater range of variability to facilitate use of our projections in existing research and land management workflows we will produce national scale landscape projections that match data characteristics of existing remote sensing based lulc databases as closely as possible the scenarios for lcmap will be characterized by 1 consistent national coverage for the united states with projections suitable for use at scales from local to national 2 30 m spatial resolution matching that of nlcd cdl and lcmap 3 at a minimum thematic resolution that matches the base nlcd thematic land cover product as demonstrated in this paper we plan on extending the nlcd classification scheme to also include major crop types 4 parcel based modeling where appropriate to ensure fidelity of landscape pattern 5 modeled landscape response to projected changes in water availability and climate 3 proof of concept modeling the u s great plains there are two overarching questions as to whether the lcmap projection goals stated above are achievable 1 pragmatically is it possible to model projections at this resolution and spatial scale in a reasonable amount of time and with reasonable resources and 2 are the projections suitable in terms of spatial thematic and temporal characteristics particularly when compared to existing remote sensing based lulc data such as nlcd and cdl to model at this spatial and thematic resolution it was recognized that fore sce needed to evolve from a relatively coarse scale pixel based modeling platform to a higher resolution framework that uses real land management and ownership parcels to constrain change and better represent landscape patterns our new methodology still produces raster maps albeit at a higher 30 m spatial resolution but parcel boundaries are used to group contiguous pixels that are treated as individual modeling units we use the term parcel based here to represent that new mixed pixel parcel structure a tentative methodology as initially applied for one ecoregion in the northern great plains demonstrated that a parcel based version of the model was a vast improvement over the older fore sce version at representing landscape pattern in cropland areas sohl et al 2017 however the representation of patterns of urbanization was poor the model had trouble balancing scenario prescribed demand for so many land cover classes it did not account for impacts on land use and vegetation such as water availability and feasibility at a national scale was later deemed to be questionable due to data and resource limitations the new lcmap initiative offers a rich new source of historical land cover data and analyses that can potentially facilitate national scale high resolution parcel based modeling with new data and analysis tools available we developed new modeling methodologies and sequentially tested them across a series of three megaregions covering most of the great plains with the goal of addressing questions related to feasibility and model outputs of the approach at a national scale 3 1 study area and starting landscape we tested the new methodologies for an area covering most of the great plains in the united states fig 1 the study area was primarily defined by boundaries from u s environmental protection agency epa level iii ecoregions us epa 1999 with modeling conducted sequentially for three megaregions within the great plains 1 the south central great plains 2 the prairie potholes and 3 the upper missouri river basin within each megaregion fore sce was parameterized and independently run for smaller regions roughly corresponding to epa ecoregion boundaries with 11 independently modeled ecoregion units comprising the entirety of the great plains study area over 1 7 million km2 past fore sce applications have typically based the starting landscape on nlcd with our desire to provide projections amenable for assessing water quality and other applications where crop type potentially plays a key role we expanded the classification scheme here to include the 16 most common crop types found across the study area fig 1 the usda s cdl data 2014 era served as our primary baseline dataset with less common crop types aggregated to an other crops category to facilitate our parcel based modeling and reduce speckle present in the original cdl spatial filtering was performed for cropland areas agricultural parcel boundaries described below were intersected with the 2014 cdl with all pixels within a given parcel assigned to the cdl crop class covering the majority of the parcel our final starting lulc for 2014 represented 29 individual land cover classes at 30 m spatial resolution 3 2 scenarios and demand the overarching conceptual approach of fore sce has not changed from past applications with a demand element that characterizes overall landscape proportions across a model unit here the 11 ecoregions units in fig 1 and a spatial allocation element that places change on the landscape fig 2 with more powerful capabilities for balancing competing lulc interests demand is more straightforward than the fore sce based national backcasts and projections sohl et al 2014a 2016a demand simply consists of future proportions of each modeled lulc class and specified time interval here 10 year intervals of 2014 2020 2030 etc through 2100 with the model itself determining necessary gross and net change among classes to balance overall lulc at the prescribed proportions see spatial allocation in the next section eleven anthropogenic land use scenarios were defined that quantified future landscape projections and provided demand for fore sce with scenario variability representing the uncertainty in future landscape conditions table 2 the most common scenario in landscape modeling is a business as usual bau scenario while bau can be defined in multiple ways we simply define bau as a continuation of existing lulc trends as measured by either nlcd or lcmap for the great plains application we used historical rates of change from the 2001 to 2011 nlcd change data as nlcd classes do not include crop type the bau scenario proportionally applied individual cropland trends between the 2008 and 2014 cdl to overall trends in cropland amounts from nlcd 2001 to 2011 change ten additional scenarios were based on exogenous modeling frameworks from the ipcc and u s department of energy table 2 three scenarios were based on the u s department of energy s billion ton update btu us doe 2011 scenarios describing county level cropland change in response to incentives for biofuels including cellulosic based biofuel the three scenarios were based on different farmgate prices for dry biomass for biofuel three scenarios were based on ipcc representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios as modeled by the global change assessment model gcam for reference rcp 4 5 and rcp 2 6 conditions west et al 2014 four scenarios were based on the older ipcc special report on emissions scenarios sres nakicenovic et al 2000 using downscaled scenarios for the united states as modeled previously with fore sce sohl et al 2014 each of these scenarios provided lulc at coarse spatial scales the btu scenarios provide data at the county level while most integrated assessment models iams associated with ipcc scenarios are at 0 5 grid cells with west et al 2014 downscaling further to 0 05 thematic resolution is also coarse for many scenario frameworks including the rcp scenarios used here where only one cropland class is provided spatial downscaling was more straightforward with coarse scale exogenous scenario data summarized for each of the 11 ecoregions depicted in fig 1 serving as our scenario prescriptions demand fore sce s spatial allocation element ingests that demand and produces a spatially explicit map at the 30 m resolution to match prescribed land cover proportions sleeter et al 2012b sohl et al 2014 thematic upscaling was used to flesh out thematically coarse exogenous scenarios based on historical regional landscape proportions derived from remote sensing based lulc for example the one aggregate cropland class for the west et al 2014 scenarios referred to here as gcam ref gcam4 5 and gcam 2 6 was thematically split into initial individual crop classes by applying recent historical cropland proportions from cdl data rates of change were then initially assigned by applying the same exogenously defined cropland change rate from cdl defined recent change to all cropland classes however modifications of individual cropland trends were made to accommodate qualitative storylines associated with each scenario as appropriate for example storylines associated with the gcam2 6 and gcam4 5 scenarios noted changes in crop management with more intensive cropping patterns and fewer fallowed fields trends for the fallow class were thus adjusted from baseline trends to accommodate the storyline similar adjustments were made for other cropland classes if and only if scenario storylines provided justification for the adjustments with the lack of specificity in many exogenous scenarios cropland adjustments were often made by broad cropland categories rather than individual crops unless crop specific information was available for example some exogenous scenarios may provide storylines describing changes in cereal crops without specificity to the individual crop class in such a case all individual cereal crops were adjusted with the same proportional rate of change adjustments in all individual crop classes were made within the bounds of the exogenously defined rates of overall cropland change with prescribed increases in some crop classes balanced by corresponding decreases in other classes as necessary to balance overall cropland change rates the result of scenario construction efforts are simple tables of future landscape proportions for each decadal time step from 2014 to 2100 demand is not provided for the grassland shrubland and three forest classes these are considered flexible classes within fore sce described below in the allocation section fluctuating in response to demand for anthropogenic land uses and helping the model to meet overall demand among all competing land use classes exceptions were the gcam4 5 and gcam2 6 scenarios where increased demand for the three forest classes was specified due to scenario storylines calling for forest expansion as a carbon and climate mitigation tool in addition to the 11 anthropogenic land use scenarios we modeled 3 climate realizations to determine impacts on natural vegetation in the region for example with hotter and drier conditions anticipated in parts of the great plains environmental conditions may favor a shift from grassland to shrubland communities to explore a range of climate conditions three projected climates served as input to fore sce based on standard ipcc rcp scenarios 1 rcp4 5 a climate mitigation scenario with moderate increases in changes in radiative forcing levels 4 5 w m2 from the current day 2 rcp 8 5 a scenario with no assumed climate carbon mitigation and high resultant radiative forcing levels 8 5 w m2 and much stronger climate impacts and 3 a mid range climate scenario of average conditions between rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 each of the 11 anthropogenic land use scenarios were coupled with each of the 3 climate realizations for natural vegetation resulting in 33 unique scenario combinations for the great plains 3 3 spatial allocation the spatial allocation element of fore sce uses prescribed lulc proportions from the scenarios and places parcels patches of change on the landscape until demand is met for a given temporal interval the final map representation is still a raster image 30 m spatial resolution but with parcel boundaries constraining landscape change new elements of the spatial allocation introduced here are 1 improved urban modeling 2 new algorithms for balancing complex demand requirements with 29 lulc classes 3 delineating parcel boundaries from remote sensing imagery and 4 model response to climate and water availability 3 3 1 parcel delineation the use of parcel boundaries is necessary to ensure a realistic representation of landscape pattern at the fine spatial and thematic resolution modeled here sohl et al 2017 however a major challenge for parcel based modeling across broad regional extents is acquiring consistent relevant parcel data national research council nrc 2014 usda common land unit clu data usda 2001 2012 provide high quality delineations of land management units for agricultural land however after enactment of the food conservation and energy act of 2008 those data are no longer available outside of usda usda 2008 we possessed 2008 era clu parcels for most of the great plains and used them in the modeling here however we 1 still required alternative parcel sources for parts of the great plains approximately 10 of total cropland area 2 do not possess clu data for many other parts of the united states and 3 for the upcoming national scale projections also require parcel data for land uses other than cropland particularly forest lands object based segmentation based on temporally dense remote sensing data stacks is starting to provide image objects that can potentially serve as land management parcels for landscape modeling yan and roy 2014 2016 used landsat data stacks and object segmentation to delineate cropland parcels across the conterminous united states data that compare relatively well to clu for actively cropped areas with similar spatial characteristics for the great plains application described here we used those data to fill in gaps where we did not have clu data at the same spatial scale resulting in relatively complete and consistent representation of potential cropland parcels for the great plains however while a good surrogate for clu data parcel coverage is substantially less comprehensive and only represents areas that have been cropped at some point during the landsat record for forested lands parcel data are even more sparse with limited data availability and typically only in aspatial or coarse spatial formats butler et al 2014 a basic remote sensing based characterization has been done for four major forest management types but the data are spatially coarse and do not differentiate between contiguous parcels with the same management class marsik et al 2018 local and state governments sometimes offer parcel data but coverage is inconsistent and it is impractical for building a consistent national scale parcel data set private companies are starting to offer comprehensive parcel data even at a national scale but the data are primarily meant for local analyses and it is currently generally cost prohibitive for national scale coverage given the dominant land uses in the region forest cutting was not modeled for the great plains however to prepare for national scale projections we tested our own landsat based object segmentation for forested lands in an ard tile in the piedmont ecoregion of the southeastern united states based on lcmap monitoring products table 1 time since last change was used in conjunction with primary land cover to estimate the forest age since last disturbance this intermediate dataset was additionally subset into age intervals e g 0 10 11 20 21 30 years etc for the entire lcmap temporal period 1985 2017 an image segmentation algorithm jones et al 2001 was used to extract contiguous parcels from pixels separated into age intervals and subsequently parcel size criteria could be enforced delineated parcels exceeding size criteria based on historical forest cutting in the region were subjected to a recursive splitting routine that subdivides parcels utilizing median age resulting in maps of pseudo forest parcels 3 3 2 dynamic suitability surfaces as with past fore sce applications suitability surfaces play a key role in the spatial allocation process they quantify the relative likelihood of a given pixel s ability to support each modeled lulc class controlling landscape pattern by directing patches of landscape change into highly suitable areas to produce relevant suitability surfaces we require 1 highly accurate moderate to high resolution lulc data across broad regional to national scale geographies and 2 spatially explicit ancillary data that serve as independent variables to characterize suitability for a given lulc class remote sensing data play a vital role in our ability to characterize site suitability as they offer a cost effective means to characterize specific variables across broad spatial extents the modified 2014 cdl data described in section 3 1 served as our dependent variable for a logistic regression procedure used to construct suitability surfaces sohl et al 2014 predictor variables include soils climate elevation transportation networks and other spatially explicit variables sohl et al 2016a given multiple scenarios for the great plains that called for the establishment of a thriving alternative biofuel industry based on cellulosic feedstocks we also integrated data that characterized productivity of likely biofuel feedstocks such as switchgrass gu et al 2014 as inclusion of hydrologic variables improves land use modeling accuracy wagner and fohrer 2019 for this work we also introduced data that characterized groundwater availability historical data quantifying saturated thickness of aquifer resources were obtained for individual well heads throughout the study area and interpolated to produce a continuous surface historical trends were used to extrapolate saturated thickness forward through the 2014 to 2100 study period along with the use of projected climate data the suitability surfaces for the great plains were thus dynamic with potential suitability for a given crop for example changing in both space and time as water availability and climate change in the future described below 3 3 3 allocation methodology the spatial allocation methodology simply places new patches parcels of change on the landscape until scenario demand is met however with a new parcel based framework prescribed demand for 29 individual land cover classes and potential shifts in suitability as climate and water availability changed substantial model modifications were required from older fore sce applications for each parcel in the study area pixel membership of the underlying 30 m 2014 lulc data was established for cropland parcels all member pixels in the parcel changed in unison in response to prescribed scenario demand in effect representing field level land use decisions across the region urban modeling used a new and different allocation methodology described below classes other than cropland and urban developed relied on a pixel level allocation strategy unrestrained by parcel boundaries and thus mimicking site level landscape change for transitions such as climate induced encroachment of shrubland into grasslands the following sequence of allocation events occurs for each decadal time step and was designed to ensure that the new fore sce could 1 meet the competing prescribed demand proportions for 29 individual land cover classes when feasible 2 represent potential changes in natural vegetation in response to future climate shifts and 3 shift potential distributions of croplands as climate and water availability change 1 modify baseline suitability values based on elasticity table elasticity is a probability modifier based on quantified likelihood of occurrence for example a transition from urban to corn is extremely unlikely no matter how suitable a pixel may be to support corn elasticity tables represent likelihood of occurrence for each possible transition among the 29 lulc classes they are primarily based on empirically derived historical lulc data nlcd or lcmap but individual transitions can be modified to support the qualitative storyline associated with a given scenario 2 modify baseline suitability values based on protected lands lands with a protected status state and national parks wilderness areas conservation easements etc are masked from specified categories of change the protected area database of the united states gergely and mckerrow 2016 serves as the primary data source for establishing protected status 3 modify baseline suitability based on pixel history a pixel history layer tracks lulc change and can be used to restrict change for example forest cutting in the model uses the pixel history to enforce realistic cutting cycles parameterized individually for each ecoregion with a parcel not allowed to be cut until it reaches a realistic cutting age for that region 4 flag pixels for dynamic loss as the model iterates into the future suitability for individual lulc classes may change as projected climate or groundwater availability changes fore sce checks each pixel to see if future conditions still support the current lulc at that location and flags pixels where a change is needed these pixels are promoted and prioritized for change in the following steps 5 scenario prescribed gaining classes are placed these are lulc classes where the scenario based demand prescribes an increase pixels flagged in step 4 are prioritized for change effectively shifting unsuitable land covers into a more suitable class gaining classes may also be placed in the flexible classes described in section 3 2 e g new fields of corn being placed in existing grassland parcels 6 forced and dynamic loss if a lulc class has pixels flagged for dynamic loss step 4 due to climate or water availability change and some pixels remain after step 5 a forced loss procedure identifies the lowest probability pixels in the offending categories and forces them to transition to a suitable lulc class classes with a prescribed loss in the scenario are also reassigned to a new suitable lulc e g scenario prescribed decline of soybeans resulting in soybean conversion to grassland 7 natural vegetation response to climate distributions and proportions of grassland shrubland and forest classes may shift as climate changes in the future outside of scenario prescribed demand pixels of these classes characterized as unsuitable based on new climate conditions are shifted to a more suitable class e g grassland conversion to shrubland in a hotter and drier future climate while placement of change steps 5 and 6 is based on suitability surface values change placed in highly suitable locations the distribution is also controlled by a clumpiness variable for example new urban lands tend to be tightly clustered near existing urban lands while forest cutting may be widely dispersed fore sce s clumpiness parameter controls the degree of clumpiness or dispersion for patches of landscape change monitoring results from nlcd data or lcmap products can help to quantify landscape metrics related to the level of dispersion or clumpiness within a given region and thus inform our model parameterization for each lulc class 3 3 4 new urban model the evolution of urban areas follows a general pattern with expansion from the initial urban center edge expansion establishment and growth of nearby development centers leap frogging and coalescence of urban centers in filling dietzel et al 2005 li et al 2013 past fore sce applications sohl et al 2014a 2016a 2017 and the first sub unit modeled in the great plains south central great plains sohl et al 2019a used an older fore sce allocation methodology where urban growth consisted almost entirely of edge expansion and in filling a new approach was developed to produce spatial patterns more consistent with theoretical long term patterns of urban growth liu et al 2016 particularly the sprawling patterns evident in cities of the united states schneider and woodcock 2014 the new methodology parameterized with remote sensing based urban patterns was used for the prairie potholes and upper missouri river basin regions as follows 1 fore sce detected all edge pixels for existing urban including road networks present in our starting 2014 cdl landscape a select percentage was stochastically sampled to serve as potential seeds for urban growth 2 duplicate seed pixels from within a given parcel were dropped 3 a focal sum function was applied to remaining seeds where a moving window with a configurable radius computed focal sum counts of urban pixels near the seed pixel seed pixels were dropped from consideration if focal sum counts fell below a configurable threshold effectively ensuring growth primarily occured in areas with a substantial existing urban presence again including road networks 4 remaining seeds were stochastically selected with probability of selection correlated to each seed s focal sum count 5 seeds are sequentially grown to patch sizes that in aggregate mimic historical patch size distributions in a region a configurable percentage of seeds are prioritized to fill up land ownership parcels mimicking schneider and woodcock s 2014 characterization of urban expansion as consisting of both small plots and large tract development 6 patches of urban growth continue to be placed until the scenario based demand for new urban lands is met for that model iteration the process results in development patterns where smaller urban areas are less likely to grow than larger urban centers with dense road networks also facilitating growth of new urban centers parameters related to edge sampling percentage focal sum window radius focal sum percentile threshold and percentage of large tract development are user configurable facilitating the mimicking of urban patterns in a given region or tailoring urban growth characteristics to a given scenario storyline results of the new methodology were evaluated by 1 running both old and new urban model codes in the prairie potholes region 2 extracting the larger urban centers and computing key landscape metrics and 3 comparing results of old and new methodologies to theoretical long term urban patterns from multiple published reviews liu et al 2016 schneider and woodcock 2014 li et al 2013 3 4 assessment of results the primary goal of this work was the production of what if scenarios of potential future landscape change based on exogenous anthropogenic lulc scenarios from multiple established sources we are not predicting future landscapes nor are we characterizing or ranking the likelihood of each scenario we are offering a range of potential scenarios that 1 demonstrate uncertainties in future landscape conditions and 2 offer researchers and land managers the capability to thus potentially plan for and mitigate against any societal or ecological impacts assessment of results for the great plains was thus based on three criteria 1 model performance in representing prescribed lulc proportions from the scenarios 2 where possible assessing characteristics of the spatial allocation of that change and 3 assessing differences among the scenarios and how they represent future landscape uncertainties we are modeling 1 16 individual crop types and 29 total land cover classes and 2 a potential reshuffling of the landscape due to the dynamic impacts of climate and water availability on those classes through space and time to assess model results past fore sce applications have used the concepts of quantity disagreement disagreement with reference conditions that result from an imperfect match in overall proportions of landscape change and allocation disagreement disagreement with reference conditions due to an imperfect match in the spatial arrangement of landscape elements pontius and millones 2011 for quantity disagreement we are not validating the exogenous scenarios themselves but are validating the model s capability to adequately represent those prescribed scenarios at an aggregate level across each modeled ecoregion we examined class by class differences between prescribed demand and actual modeled change proportions for each of the 121 scenario and ecoregion combinations 11 modeled land use scenarios 11 modeled ecoregions comprising the great plains assessing allocation disagreement is substantially more difficult fidelity of landscape pattern is partially controlled by 1 partitioning scenario demand down to the level iii ecoregion scale us epa 1999 and 2 use of ecoregion specific suitability surfaces for each modeled lulc class ensuring change is placed in suitable locations where possible we assess spatial characteristics of the projections the fore sce historical backcast work offered an opportunity to assess general fore sce model performance in reproducing general historical patterns of landscape change over long time spans 1938 1992 sohl et al 2016a but such an assessment for high spatial and thematic resolution projections is more problematic as the only reference data source with the necessary spatial and thematic resolution the cropland data layer 1 provides less than a decade of continuous coverage for the study area at this spatial and thematic resolution 2 records relatively small amounts of change during that time limiting the ability to assess long term model performance and 3 direct comparability between cdl dates is questionable lark et al 2017 in lieu of again assessing model performance for a historical period through a formal quantification of pixel level allocation differences we examined more general spatial measures given the suitability surfaces for each modeled lulc class dictate where lulc change occurs we examined receiver operating characteristics roc measures quantifying model fit of the logistic regression used to construct suitability surfaces for each of the 29 lulc classes and for each of the 11 modeled ecoregions as noted above we also compared model results for the new and old urban modeling methodologies examining trends in landscape metrics and how they compared with theoretical trends for urban growth finally we wanted to use the concepts of quantity and allocation disagreement to assess the scenarios themselves quantifying how the different scenarios vary in both proportions of modeled land cover and spatial distribution for each possible pair of the 11 anthropogenic land use scenarios we examined quantity exchange and shift disagreement pontius and santacruz 2014 for the final year of the simulation 2100 computation and interpretation of those measures is confounded by the dense thematic classification scheme of 29 land cover classes we thus aggregated crop types into 4 major categories row crops small grains hay alfalfa perennial grass prior to quantification of disagreement 4 results 4 1 aggregate results great plains fig 3 depicts trends in major aggregated lulc categories from 2014 to 2100 for the 11 anthropogenic land use scenarios variability is high among the 11 scenarios with all major lulc categories experiencing declines in some scenarios and increases in others the exception is the urban developed class which increases in all scenarios scenario prescribed changes in cropland perennial grass and urban developed drive overall changes in the scenarios with the flexible classes of grassland shrubland and forest rising or falling in response to anthropogenic land use trends transformative changes to the overall landscape are evident in some scenarios most notably the btu60 and btu80 scenarios where up to 100 000 km2 is converted to perennial grass production for cellulosic based biofuel the a2 a1b gcam2 6 and gcam 4 5 scenarios have an equally strong impact on the landscape with up to 150 000 km2 of expansion of traditional croplands with concomitant strong declines in rangeland classes grassland and shrubland fig 4 portrays spatial patterns and site level uncertainty of major lulc classes across the scenarios by quantifying the number of scenarios each class present by the end of the simulation in 2100 individual crops may change among scenarios but core areas of the great plains are devoted to traditional crop production regardless of scenario e g corn and soybean production in the eastern great plains while rainfed cropland in the eastern part of the great plains is more stable traditional cropland production is more volatile among scenarios in more arid areas to the west and where projected aquifer declines are likely to impact the ability to grow traditional irrigated crops such as cotton and corn in the southern part of the study area where irrigated cotton currently dominates but aquifer declines greatly reduce future water availability irrigated cotton reverts to dryland wheat in some scenarios or to rangeland grassland or shrubland in others perennial grass for biofuel production primarily occurs in the southern and eastern great plains and on marginal cropland in the dakotas areas where biomass productivity is high enough to economically support a cellulosic based biofuel industry grassland shrubland and forest each have core areas of little variability among scenarios but cropland and perennial grass expansion in many scenarios results in regional losses of those classes table 3 depicts changes in natural vegetation in response to the three climate scenarios imposed as represented in the sres b2 scenario sres b2 is presented here alone to demonstrate climate impacts on natural vegetation as this is the scenario with the least area of anthropogenic land use agriculture or urban developed and comparison across a single land use scenario avoids issues of variable anthropogenic land use change among scenarios the rcp4 5 mid range and rcp8 5 represent increasing climate change impacts respectively with generally hotter and in parts of the great plains drier conditions by 2100 as such impacts on natural vegetation are the least for rcp4 5 and the highest for rcp8 5 the most prevalent transition is the conversion of grassland to shrubland primarily concentrated in the southwestern great plains over 30 000 km2 of grassland transitions to shrubland in the rcp4 5 scenario while nearly 80 000 km2 converts in the rcp8 5 scenario as a minor class in much of the great plains forest changes are more muted deciduous and mixed forest lose a substantial proportion of the 2014 area by 2100 primarily through conversion to grassland while evergreen forest largely concentrated in the middle and northern rockies ecoregions fig 1 shows little impact regardless of climate scenario finally fig 5 depicts full resolution results for a small region in the panhandle of texas for the 11 anthropogenic land use scenarios run with the mid range climate projection in 2014 irrigated cotton dominates the landscape but with projected aquifer declines cotton disappears from most scenarios by 2100 as an extrapolation of existing land use trends the bau scenario is the exception as dynamic climate and water impacts were not considered perennial grass replaces much of the lost cropland in the btu60 btu80 and a1b scenarios all storylines that support a strong cellulosic based biofuel industry dryland wheat replaces irrigated crops in scenarios with very high overall demand for traditional crop commodities gcam 4 5 gcam 2 6 for the environmentally focused b1 and b2 scenarios much of the cropland in the region reverts to rangeland grass and shrubland the impacts of a projected warmer and drier climate result in encroachment of shrubland into grassland areas throughout the area 4 2 new urban model performance fig 6 depicts spatial modeling results from 2014 to 2100 for the des moines iowa area for the a2 scenario the old model results in in filling of existing urban areas and growth along the periphery of large urban areas but does not produce the anticipated leap frogging as specified by li et al 2013 liu et al 2016 this results in increasingly blocky future projections of urban area with decreased landscape complexity over time alternatively the new urban model produces much more sprawling development patterns with in filling and edge expansion but also with substantial leap frogging new urban patches become established along transportation networks grow through edge expansion and coalesce over time with surrounding urban patches through in filling new model results are more consistent with theoretical long term development patterns table 4 provides key landscape metrics measured from 2014 to 2100 for prairie potholes megaregion urban centers for both the old and new fore sce urban modeling the old model results in sharply increased mean patch sizes as in filling and edge expansion dominate growth patch density edge density and landscape shape index all decline an indication of a less complex urban landscape in the future conversely the new model results in increases in patch density edge density and landscape shape index reflecting a more complex more fragmented landscape 4 3 quantity disagreement fig 7 summarizes how well fore sce met scenario prescribed demand across the 11 anthropogenic land use scenarios and 11 modeled ecoregions for most scenarios fore sce can precisely match overall demand coming within 5 of the total number of prescribed pixels of landscape change however the ability to meet scenario demand degrades towards the end of the simulation period while 93 of scenario ecoregion combinations match demand within 10 for the 2050 2060 time step that proportion drops to 64 for the last time step 2090 2100 4 4 model fit suitability surfaces fig 8 depicts roc scores describing model fit for each of the 29 lulc classes across the 11 independently modeled ecoregions roc scores average 0 85 0 09 across 292 regressions not all lulc classes were found in all ecoregions while model fit was relatively consistent across most lulc classes fit was lower on average for 1 grassland and 2 alfalfa and hay classes most of the land in the great plains is suitable for grassland yet roc scores were lower 0 74 0 09 due to the model s inability to precisely differentiate between grassland suitable areas with an actual grassland cover or grassland suitable areas converted to agricultural land uses the alfalfa and hay classes also had lower roc scores than other agricultural classes at 0 77 0 09 and 0 80 0 08 respectively 4 5 assessment of scenario differences fig 9 depicts measures of quantity exchange and shift disagreement for the year 2100 for each of the 55 possible scenario pairs total disagreement among scenario pairs is lowest for low change scenarios this includes the btu40 scenario biofuel prices are not high enough for substantial investment in cellulosic ethanol and crop and perennial grass changes are low the gcamref scenario no carbon related land use incentives and low land change and environmentally focused sres b2 scenario for many of the scenario pairs with low total disagreement quantity disagreement is half or less of total disagreement signifying that scenario prescribed demand for lulc change is relatively similar and differences are primarily due to the pixel level spatial arrangement of that change exchange and shift disagreement differences in spatial arrangement are due to both 1 stochasticity in the model itself e g exactly which fields are allocated to a given crop and 2 scenario driven differences in allocation at the ecoregion level before fore sce even allocates change overall scenario pairs with low total disagreement generally have relatively high proportions of allocation disagreement compared to scenario pairs with high total disagreement where quantity disagreement makes up the bulk of the scenario differences the highest disagreement scenarios are overwhelmingly scenario pairs that involve the btu60 and btu80 scenarios those scenarios are unique compared to the other scenario families as they call for increases in perennial grass for cellulosic ethanol production far above any other scenario set other high disagreement scenario pairs include several scenarios that strongly differ from the business as usual scenario indicating these scenarios call for future landscape change storylines that are quite dissimilar from recent land use trends finally some anomalous scenario pairs are dominated by large amounts of allocation disagreement such as the gcam2 6 and sres a1b scenario pair both scenarios prescribe similar large increases in traditional cropland hay and pasture and perennial grass fig 2 and thus quantity disagreement between the two is quite low however as indicated by high allocation disagreement strong differences in the spatial patterns of land use change are apparent for this scenario allocation disagreement is largely due to ecoregion level differences in scenario prescribed proportions of crops and perennial grass 4 6 parcel boundary delineation from lcmap data stacks while not part of the great plains modeling fig 10 provides an example of multiple versions of parcel boundaries for a small portion of the test region of the piedmont ecoregion of the eastern united states coverage of cropland and managed pastureland is generally excellent with usda clu boundaries panel a the remote sensing based object segmentation from yan and roy 2016 captures most active crops but is much less comprehensive than clu panel b panel c represents parcels derived from the lcmap based object segmentation for forested lands panel d represents a harmonized parcel boundary dataset utilizing 1 clu data for agricultural lands and 2 lcmap based segmentation for forested lands the resulting parcel boundaries are a mix of intensively monitored and recorded land use and land management boundaries clu and empirically derived pseudo management boundaries representing areas of similar forest management over the last 32 years with parcel size criteria controlling the lcmap based segmentation we can tailor the forested lands parcelization to match historical patch sizes of forest cutting information derived from lcmap monitoring products 5 discussion using a modified version of the fore sce model we have produced a suite of high resolution landscape projections for the great plains with a broad user community for landsat scale lulc data such as nlcd or cdl the projections satisfy the need for high resolution spatial simulation models that are capable of generating artificial land cover maps at high resolution and help to predict the ecological consequences of landscape dynamics langhammer et al 2019 the spatial and thematic characteristics of the projections facilitate the adoption of the projections into existing research and land management workflows that rely on landsat scale lulc data the use of a variety of exogenous scenario inputs quantifies the uncertainty in future landscapes while allowing us to incorporate necessary expertise in economics demographics energy markets and other driving forces of broad scale landscape change by capitalizing on lcmap monitoring products nlcd cdl and other remote sensing based data for model parameterization and scenario development and downscaling we play to our strengths while facilitating the development of projections consistent with the most widely used lulc databases for the united states the new urban model performed well in matching theoretical long term urban patterns luck and wu 2002 noted that widely used cellular automata urban models tend to portray compact and aggregated urban growth a pattern found in the older version of fore sce with increased mean patch size and decreases in edge density and patch density the new urban model reversed those trends with increased landscape fragmentation represented by increased patch density and edge density and increased structural complexity represented by increased landscape shape index these trends are consistent with long term urban development patterns measured by liu et al 2016 who quantified long term historical trends for 16 global cities dietzel et al 2005 found similar empirically measured patterns in the central valley of california from 1940 to 2000 however dietzel et al 2005 also postulated a diffusion and coalescence long term pattern where those trends would eventually reverse as the urbanization process matures our modeled long term trends are more consistent with diversity complexity wu et al 2011 and landscape modification gradient forman and godron 1986 hypotheses where fragmentation and structural complexity continue to increase over time liu et al 2016 schneider and woodcock 2014 found u s cities had a relatively unique expansive growth pattern with substantial new development broadly distributed over extended geographic areas outside of urban cores thus in areas such as the great plains where there are often few geographical barriers to urban expansion the continuation of sprawl as represented by the new model seems warranted even for the long term configurable model parameters allow for control of compactness or sprawl and could be tailored in future applications to specific scenario storylines or for urban centers where historical growth has been more compact fore sce was generally successful in meeting scenario prescribed demand a difficult task when balancing 29 lulc classes that could shift in space and time as climate or water availability changed however late in the simulation period generally the 2080 2090 and 2090 2100 periods there were several ecoregions and scenarios where the model struggled to meet demand in nearly all cases however failure to precisely match demand represented fore sce fighting back against unrealistic scenarios the ipcc sres and rcp gcam scenarios were particularly susceptible to struggles in meeting demand in a review of landscape projections available for the united states it was noted that downscaled global scenarios such as these are sometimes not realistic at a local or regional scale sohl et al 2016b with this new version of the model fore sce itself is a check on unrealistic scenarios while it can be manually overridden by default fore sce will stop trying to place scenario prescribed demand for a given lulc class if no more suitable parcels are available for that class this occurred late in the simulation period for many of the gcam2 6 and gcam4 5 runs where the baseline exogenous scenarios called for far more cropland alfalfa and other hay than had ever been present on the landscape historically the role of changing water availability and climate also impacted fore sce s ability to meet demand in some cases shifting environmental conditions in the future greatly reduced the area suitable for a given crop and fore sce was unable to meet demand the new model thus performed well in meeting scenario demand and for long term urban development patterns roc scores indicated good model fits when creating suitability surfaces for each ecoregion and lulc class and with fore sce s check on suitability scenario prescribed landscape change was placed in suitable locations fig 3 demonstrates highly certain landscapes in the future where most or all scenarios agree or areas with substantially different projected futures dependent upon scenario however additional quantitative validation of the spatial allocation remains problematic as noted previously the scenarios themselves are not predictions but are what if representations of future landscape conditions with variability among scenarios demonstrating uncertainty as such pontius and neeti 2010 state that for scenario based storylines using a story and simulation approach alcamo 2008 such as ours demand is not subject to uncertainty and subsequent validation in this approach but the spatial allocation of that prescribed change could be assessed we recognize that while good roc scores provide some indication of overall performance of the spatial allocation element of fore sce it is not a formal validation of final landscape pattern however with the highly variable scenarios themselves and the treatment of non stationarity in terms of site level suitability suitability shifting as climate or water availability shifts there are no correlates from the historical record on which a quantitative validation of prescribed long term projection through 2100 could be based cdl provides the only comparable data in terms of spatial and thematic resolution and as noted above they are only available for a short time period and may not be directly comparable pontius et al 2008 note the difficulties in assessing long term model performance when validation data temporal intervals are generally much shorter particularly as the amount of change occurring in short validation time periods is typically quite small in summary a primary purpose of scenario analysis is to gain insight into future decisions for which there might be no historical precedence pontius and neeti 2010 making precise quantitative validation of unprecedented conditions practically impossible 6 conclusions after the first prototype of high resolution parcel based landscape projections for a small ecoregion in the northern u s great plains sohl et al 2017 the feasibility of producing similar projections at a national scale was under question with this work we demonstrate it is feasible to produce high resolution parcel based landscape projections at broad regional and national scales fore sce is a data hungry model and one potential limitation for consistent national scale modeling is data availability particularly for suitable parcel data with a combination of usda clu parcels and remote sensing based parcels derived from lcmap monitoring products or yan and roy 2016 we have a spatial framework on which national scale projections can be built lcmap monitoring products from 1985 to present offer several advantages for supporting national scale projections with a much longer temporal history and denser temporal resolution than any other available land cover monitoring data at this scale lcmap data support parcel delineation and help quantify key parameters in fore sce including transition probabilities elasticity pixel histories for processes such as forestry activity and characterizing spatial patterns as we undertake national scale high resolution landscape projections lcmap is poised to offer unique long term consistent and relatively high resolution representations of historical current and landscape condition in the united states and thus potentially inform countless research and land management applications data availability the high resolution landscape projections for the great plains are available from

characterize landscape change in the united states from 1985 to present lcmap will be used to explain how past present and future landscape change affects society and natural systems here we describe a modeling framework for producing high resolution spatial and thematic landscape projections at a national scale using a unique parcel based modeling framework the methodology was tested by modeling 11 land use scenarios and 3 climate realizations for the u s great plains results demonstrate 1 an ability to balance competing land use demands from quite variable complex scenarios 2 urban growth

development of high thematic and spatial resolution projections at a national scale keywords scenario projection model land use great plains 1 introduction remote sensing provides synoptic consistent and repeatable observations of the earth s surface and is frequently used as the basis for mapping land use and land cover lulc at moderate to high resolution across broad geographic areas hansen and loveland 2012 lamine et al 2018 for the united states multiple national scale lulc mapping and monitoring programs have been based on the landsat series of earth observations including the national land cover database nlcd homer et al 2004 fry et al 2011 homer et al 2015 yang et al 2018 the u s geological survey usgs land cover trends project loveland et al 2002 sleeter et al 2013 the landfire

fore sce model was developed to capitalize on these remote sensing based lulc databases and has been used to both backcast and project future lulc for the conterminous united states at 250 m spatial resolution sohl et al 2014a 2016a fore sce based lulc data have been used for a wide variety of applications including assessments of biodiversity sohl 2014 bellard et al 2015 water quality and flow

projections have been widely used it has been noted that there simply are not any alternative landscape projections for the conterminous united states at a comparable spatial and thematic resolution riordanrundel 2014 several researchers have noted the projections are a good first step in need of further refinement with a desire for landscape projections with higher spatial resolution ahiablame et al 2017 drake et al 2017 improved thematic resolution viger et al 2011 rajib et al 2016 different or customized scenarios ahiablame et al 2017 beatty et al 2016 or a need for tighter integration to hydrologic and or climate models barnes et al 2012 byrd et al 2015 improving the consistency with nlcd alone would greatly improve the utility of fore sce based landscape projections given the extremely broad user community that has developed for nlcd products over the past 20 years increased data availability and a new generation of remote sensing algorithms offer the potential to help improve our characterization of landscape change and inform regional to national scale landscape modeling national research council nrc 2014 finer spatial resolution data integrated with ancillary biophysical and socioeconomic data are improving our ability to couple land change models with models from other disciplines brown et al 2013 remote sensing data are becoming available at increased temporal density and over longer time periods particularly as data harmonization efforts facilitate data comparison and data compositing between multiple sensors such as landsat and sentinel 2 claverie et al 2018 defourny et al 2019 griffiths et al 2019 identification of landscape change has begun to move from a traditional analysis of two discrete end points in time to trajectory analyses using a temporally dense stack of remote sensing imagery kennedy et al 2007 huang et al 2010 new per pixel analyses have been developed in recent years to take advantage of the increased data availability and temporal density and use all available cloud free pixels at the site level zhu and woodcock 2014 pflugmacher et al 2019 beyond the quantification and mapping of landscape change new data sources and techniques are beginning to unlock the longstanding challenge of socializing the pixel geoghegan et al 1998 spatial driving force analyses are linking spatially explicit remote sensing data with ancillary socioeconomic and biophysical data to quantify driving force impacts on land use silva et al 2008 kuang et al 2016 increasing our ability to model the drivers of landscape change the usgs earth resources observation and science center established the land change monitoring assessment and projection lcmap initiative to capitalize on these new developments in remote sensing and to characterize landscape change across the united states lcmap relies on the deep temporal time series from the landsat archive along with new time series analyses to map and monitor landscape change from 1985 through the present however lcmap goes beyond mapping with a premise to explain how past present and future landscape change affects society and natural systems at local to national scales as part of this ongoing effort the assessment element of lcmap will characterize historical to current landscape change with descriptions of regional to national scale geographies of change and the key drivers and consequences of that change an applications element will work with interdisciplinary research teams to assess interactions among landscape change and a host of biophysical and socioeconomic applications each of these elements facilitates the projections element of lcmap here we 1 summarize goals for the projections element of the new lcmap initiative 2 describe new approaches required to meet those goals with an emphasis on using remote sensing as a basis for landscape modeling and 3 evaluate those approaches with scenario based projections in the u s great plains at substantially higher spatial and thematic resolution than past fore sce applications results demonstrate our ability to 1 produce national scale landscape projections consistent with the most widely used global scenario frameworks and 2 maintain spatial and thematic consistency to existing usgs landsat based land cover databases facilitating their use in existing research and land management applications 2 lcmap projections background and goals the projections element is dependent upon other research elements of lcmap what follows is a short summary of the monitoring and assessment elements and their contribution to projections followed by a summary of overall goals for projections 2 1 lcmap monitoring and assessment lcmap projections are dependent upon lcmap monitoring and assessment research and products as well as other remote sensing based data the monitoring element of lcmap exploits availability of landsat analysis ready data ard dwyer et al 2018 and time series analysis ard substantially reduce the burden of pre processing on users of landsat data with geometric and radiometric correction and quantification of image quality landsat level 1 terrain corrected data from landsats 4 5 7 and 8 populate ard and provide surface reflectance top of atmosphere reflectance brightness temperature and pixel quality information the monitoring methodology is based on the continuous change detection and classification ccdc algorithm zhu et al 2016 applied to all available cloud and shadow free pixels in the ard archive from 1985 to present the pixel level analysis characterizes the landscape based on components of seasonality trend and break estimates of surface reflectance and brightness temperature zhu and woodcock 2014 the change detection component of ccdc characterizes the spectral time series and identifies dates where spectral patterns diverge from past patterns these breaks serve as endpoints for distinct time series segments where within segment patterns are relatively homogeneous the classification element of ccdc uses a decision tree classifier to produce a suite of 10 different data products at annual steps for each ard tile applied for all tiles in the conterminous united states table 1 the assessment component of lcmap uses monitoring results to characterize lulc change in the united states with regional and national syntheses similar to the four regional syntheses produced as part of the usgs trends project sleeter et al 2012a auch and karstensen 2015 taylor et al 2015 sayler et al 2016 the assessments summaries will include national and regional scale synopses of the rates sectors driving forces and potential consequences of landscape change through the lcmap analysis period contributing to this work and to the validation of lcmap monitoring results is an independent reference data set of 25 000 sample points across the conterminous united states points were selected with simple random sampling with the timesync tool cohen et al 2010 used to aid in the manual interpretation of lulc attributes throughout the lcmap timeframe 1985 to present assessments work also includes research on the primary drivers of landscape change benefitting the projections work described in the next section finally assessments will coordinate with an applications element of lcmap to use monitoring and assessment results to determine feedbacks among landscape change and societal and ecological processes of interest 2 2 primary deliverables lcmap projections projections deliverables associated with lcmap are focused on maximizing relevancy for the applications of researchers land managers and others with an interest in lulc change users of past fore sce projections noted utility of the projections would be improved if spatial and thematic characteristics were comparable to national scale land cover data sets such as nlcd and cdl this work is thus designed to produce a suite of lulc projections for the conterminous united states with characteristics as similar as possible to these widely used datasets we have two primary deliverables or research outcomes associated with lcmap projections periodic production of scenario based national scale projections with updated projections created as new source scenarios become available see below collaborative modeling applications focused on interdisciplinary analyses of research questions related to 1 water resources 2 biologic resources 3 natural hazards and human health and 4 climate weather and biogeochemical cycles the focus in this paper is the production of the landscape projections themselves with two primary products 1 short to medium term business as usual bau projections based on recent lcmap measured landscape trends 2 a suite of long term projections that represent 1 the most widely used scenario frameworks e g intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc scenarios and 2 the vast uncertainties in future landscapes through scenarios with diverse outcomes new projections will be produced for each new ipcc assessment report ar short to moderate term bau projections that can be rapidly produced from recent lulc trends support near real time applications that require the most likely near term landscape trends the strategy for longer term projections is focused on maximizing utility for the widest array of research and application efforts including our own where selection of scenarios is a critical element given a literally infinite array of potential scenarios the ipcc series of scenarios are the most logical choice on which to base periodically modeled projections because they 1 explicitly define a wide array of underlying socioeconomic and climate assumptions that directly feed into lulc modeling 2 have a wide variety of ancillary data associated with them including climate data emissions economic modeling demographic assumptions and more and 3 are extremely well vetted providing an accepted scenario framework that is widely used by many researchers facilitating cooperative work and consistent comparison among research applications however individual scenarios within one scenario family tend to cluster towards similar outcomes and underestimate overall uncertainties in future landscapes sohl et al 2016b thus we will also strive to include other scenario frameworks to represent a greater range of variability to facilitate use of our projections in existing research and land management workflows we will produce national scale landscape projections that match data characteristics of existing remote sensing based lulc databases as closely as possible the scenarios for lcmap will be characterized by 1 consistent national coverage for the united states with projections suitable for use at scales from local to national 2 30 m spatial resolution matching that of nlcd cdl and lcmap 3 at a minimum thematic resolution that matches the base nlcd thematic land cover product as demonstrated in this paper we plan on extending the nlcd classification scheme to also include major crop types 4 parcel based modeling where appropriate to ensure fidelity of landscape pattern 5 modeled landscape response to projected changes in water availability and climate 3 proof of concept modeling the u s great plains there are two overarching questions as to whether the lcmap projection goals stated above are achievable 1 pragmatically is it possible to model projections at this resolution and spatial scale in a reasonable amount of time and with reasonable resources and 2 are the projections suitable in terms of spatial thematic and temporal characteristics particularly when compared to existing remote sensing based lulc data such as nlcd and cdl to model at this spatial and thematic resolution it was recognized that fore sce needed to evolve from a relatively coarse scale pixel based modeling platform to a higher resolution framework that uses real land management and ownership parcels to constrain change and better represent landscape patterns our new methodology still produces raster maps albeit at a higher 30 m spatial resolution but parcel boundaries are used to group contiguous pixels that are treated as individual modeling units we use the term parcel based here to represent that new mixed pixel parcel structure a tentative methodology as initially applied for one ecoregion in the northern great plains demonstrated that a parcel based version of the model was a vast improvement over the older fore sce version at representing landscape pattern in cropland areas sohl et al 2017 however the representation of patterns of urbanization was poor the model had trouble balancing scenario prescribed demand for so many land cover classes it did not account for impacts on land use and vegetation such as water availability and feasibility at a national scale was later deemed to be questionable due to data and resource limitations the new lcmap initiative offers a rich new source of historical land cover data and analyses that can potentially facilitate national scale high resolution parcel based modeling with new data and analysis tools available we developed new modeling methodologies and sequentially tested them across a series of three megaregions covering most of the great plains with the goal of addressing questions related to feasibility and model outputs of the approach at a national scale 3 1 study area and starting landscape we tested the new methodologies for an area covering most of the great plains in the united states fig 1 the study area was primarily defined by boundaries from u s environmental protection agency epa level iii ecoregions us epa 1999 with modeling conducted sequentially for three megaregions within the great plains 1 the south central great plains 2 the prairie potholes and 3 the upper missouri river basin within each megaregion fore sce was parameterized and independently run for smaller regions roughly corresponding to epa ecoregion boundaries with 11 independently modeled ecoregion units comprising the entirety of the great plains study area over 1 7 million km2 past fore sce applications have typically based the starting landscape on nlcd with our desire to provide projections amenable for assessing water quality and other applications where crop type potentially plays a key role we expanded the classification scheme here to include the 16 most common crop types found across the study area fig 1 the usda s cdl data 2014 era served as our primary baseline dataset with less common crop types aggregated to an other crops category to facilitate our parcel based modeling and reduce speckle present in the original cdl spatial filtering was performed for cropland areas agricultural parcel boundaries described below were intersected with the 2014 cdl with all pixels within a given parcel assigned to the cdl crop class covering the majority of the parcel our final starting lulc for 2014 represented 29 individual land cover classes at 30 m spatial resolution 3 2 scenarios and demand the overarching conceptual approach of fore sce has not changed from past applications with a demand element that characterizes overall landscape proportions across a model unit here the 11 ecoregions units in fig 1 and a spatial allocation element that places change on the landscape fig 2 with more powerful capabilities for balancing competing lulc interests demand is more straightforward than the fore sce based national backcasts and projections sohl et al 2014a 2016a demand simply consists of future proportions of each modeled lulc class and specified time interval here 10 year intervals of 2014 2020 2030 etc through 2100 with the model itself determining necessary gross and net change among classes to balance overall lulc at the prescribed proportions see spatial allocation in the next section eleven anthropogenic land use scenarios were defined that quantified future landscape projections and provided demand for fore sce with scenario variability representing the uncertainty in future landscape conditions table 2 the most common scenario in landscape modeling is a business as usual bau scenario while bau can be defined in multiple ways we simply define bau as a continuation of existing lulc trends as measured by either nlcd or lcmap for the great plains application we used historical rates of change from the 2001 to 2011 nlcd change data as nlcd classes do not include crop type the bau scenario proportionally applied individual cropland trends between the 2008 and 2014 cdl to overall trends in cropland amounts from nlcd 2001 to 2011 change ten additional scenarios were based on exogenous modeling frameworks from the ipcc and u s department of energy table 2 three scenarios were based on the u s department of energy s billion ton update btu us doe 2011 scenarios describing county level cropland change in response to incentives for biofuels including cellulosic based biofuel the three scenarios were based on different farmgate prices for dry biomass for biofuel three scenarios were based on ipcc representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios as modeled by the global change assessment model gcam for reference rcp 4 5 and rcp 2 6 conditions west et al 2014 four scenarios were based on the older ipcc special report on emissions scenarios sres nakicenovic et al 2000 using downscaled scenarios for the united states as modeled previously with fore sce sohl et al 2014 each of these scenarios provided lulc at coarse spatial scales the btu scenarios provide data at the county level while most integrated assessment models iams associated with ipcc scenarios are at 0 5 grid cells with west et al 2014 downscaling further to 0 05 thematic resolution is also coarse for many scenario frameworks including the rcp scenarios used here where only one cropland class is provided spatial downscaling was more straightforward with coarse scale exogenous scenario data summarized for each of the 11 ecoregions depicted in fig 1 serving as our scenario prescriptions demand fore sce s spatial allocation element ingests that demand and produces a spatially explicit map at the 30 m resolution to match prescribed land cover proportions sleeter et al 2012b sohl et al 2014 thematic upscaling was used to flesh out thematically coarse exogenous scenarios based on historical regional landscape proportions derived from remote sensing based lulc for example the one aggregate cropland class for the west et al 2014 scenarios referred to here as gcam ref gcam4 5 and gcam 2 6 was thematically split into initial individual crop classes by applying recent historical cropland proportions from cdl data rates of change were then initially assigned by applying the same exogenously defined cropland change rate from cdl defined recent change to all cropland classes however modifications of individual cropland trends were made to accommodate qualitative storylines associated with each scenario as appropriate for example storylines associated with the gcam2 6 and gcam4 5 scenarios noted changes in crop management with more intensive cropping patterns and fewer fallowed fields trends for the fallow class were thus adjusted from baseline trends to accommodate the storyline similar adjustments were made for other cropland classes if and only if scenario storylines provided justification for the adjustments with the lack of specificity in many exogenous scenarios cropland adjustments were often made by broad cropland categories rather than individual crops unless crop specific information was available for example some exogenous scenarios may provide storylines describing changes in cereal crops without specificity to the individual crop class in such a case all individual cereal crops were adjusted with the same proportional rate of change adjustments in all individual crop classes were made within the bounds of the exogenously defined rates of overall cropland change with prescribed increases in some crop classes balanced by corresponding decreases in other classes as necessary to balance overall cropland change rates the result of scenario construction efforts are simple tables of future landscape proportions for each decadal time step from 2014 to 2100 demand is not provided for the grassland shrubland and three forest classes these are considered flexible classes within fore sce described below in the allocation section fluctuating in response to demand for anthropogenic land uses and helping the model to meet overall demand among all competing land use classes exceptions were the gcam4 5 and gcam2 6 scenarios where increased demand for the three forest classes was specified due to scenario storylines calling for forest expansion as a carbon and climate mitigation tool in addition to the 11 anthropogenic land use scenarios we modeled 3 climate realizations to determine impacts on natural vegetation in the region for example with hotter and drier conditions anticipated in parts of the great plains environmental conditions may favor a shift from grassland to shrubland communities to explore a range of climate conditions three projected climates served as input to fore sce based on standard ipcc rcp scenarios 1 rcp4 5 a climate mitigation scenario with moderate increases in changes in radiative forcing levels 4 5 w m2 from the current day 2 rcp 8 5 a scenario with no assumed climate carbon mitigation and high resultant radiative forcing levels 8 5 w m2 and much stronger climate impacts and 3 a mid range climate scenario of average conditions between rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 each of the 11 anthropogenic land use scenarios were coupled with each of the 3 climate realizations for natural vegetation resulting in 33 unique scenario combinations for the great plains 3 3 spatial allocation the spatial allocation element of fore sce uses prescribed lulc proportions from the scenarios and places parcels patches of change on the landscape until demand is met for a given temporal interval the final map representation is still a raster image 30 m spatial resolution but with parcel boundaries constraining landscape change new elements of the spatial allocation introduced here are 1 improved urban modeling 2 new algorithms for balancing complex demand requirements with 29 lulc classes 3 delineating parcel boundaries from remote sensing imagery and 4 model response to climate and water availability 3 3 1 parcel delineation the use of parcel boundaries is necessary to ensure a realistic representation of landscape pattern at the fine spatial and thematic resolution modeled here sohl et al 2017 however a major challenge for parcel based modeling across broad regional extents is acquiring consistent relevant parcel data national research council nrc 2014 usda common land unit clu data usda 2001 2012 provide high quality delineations of land management units for agricultural land however after enactment of the food conservation and energy act of 2008 those data are no longer available outside of usda usda 2008 we possessed 2008 era clu parcels for most of the great plains and used them in the modeling here however we 1 still required alternative parcel sources for parts of the great plains approximately 10 of total cropland area 2 do not possess clu data for many other parts of the united states and 3 for the upcoming national scale projections also require parcel data for land uses other than cropland particularly forest lands object based segmentation based on temporally dense remote sensing data stacks is starting to provide image objects that can potentially serve as land management parcels for landscape modeling yan and roy 2014 2016 used landsat data stacks and object segmentation to delineate cropland parcels across the conterminous united states data that compare relatively well to clu for actively cropped areas with similar spatial characteristics for the great plains application described here we used those data to fill in gaps where we did not have clu data at the same spatial scale resulting in relatively complete and consistent representation of potential cropland parcels for the great plains however while a good surrogate for clu data parcel coverage is substantially less comprehensive and only represents areas that have been cropped at some point during the landsat record for forested lands parcel data are even more sparse with limited data availability and typically only in aspatial or coarse spatial formats butler et al 2014 a basic remote sensing based characterization has been done for four major forest management types but the data are spatially coarse and do not differentiate between contiguous parcels with the same management class marsik et al 2018 local and state governments sometimes offer parcel data but coverage is inconsistent and it is impractical for building a consistent national scale parcel data set private companies are starting to offer comprehensive parcel data even at a national scale but the data are primarily meant for local analyses and it is currently generally cost prohibitive for national scale coverage given the dominant land uses in the region forest cutting was not modeled for the great plains however to prepare for national scale projections we tested our own landsat based object segmentation for forested lands in an ard tile in the piedmont ecoregion of the southeastern united states based on lcmap monitoring products table 1 time since last change was used in conjunction with primary land cover to estimate the forest age since last disturbance this intermediate dataset was additionally subset into age intervals e g 0 10 11 20 21 30 years etc for the entire lcmap temporal period 1985 2017 an image segmentation algorithm jones et al 2001 was used to extract contiguous parcels from pixels separated into age intervals and subsequently parcel size criteria could be enforced delineated parcels exceeding size criteria based on historical forest cutting in the region were subjected to a recursive splitting routine that subdivides parcels utilizing median age resulting in maps of pseudo forest parcels 3 3 2 dynamic suitability surfaces as with past fore sce applications suitability surfaces play a key role in the spatial allocation process they quantify the relative likelihood of a given pixel s ability to support each modeled lulc class controlling landscape pattern by directing patches of landscape change into highly suitable areas to produce relevant suitability surfaces we require 1 highly accurate moderate to high resolution lulc data across broad regional to national scale geographies and 2 spatially explicit ancillary data that serve as independent variables to characterize suitability for a given lulc class remote sensing data play a vital role in our ability to characterize site suitability as they offer a cost effective means to characterize specific variables across broad spatial extents the modified 2014 cdl data described in section 3 1 served as our dependent variable for a logistic regression procedure used to construct suitability surfaces sohl et al 2014 predictor variables include soils climate elevation transportation networks and other spatially explicit variables sohl et al 2016a given multiple scenarios for the great plains that called for the establishment of a thriving alternative biofuel industry based on cellulosic feedstocks we also integrated data that characterized productivity of likely biofuel feedstocks such as switchgrass gu et al 2014 as inclusion of hydrologic variables improves land use modeling accuracy wagner and fohrer 2019 for this work we also introduced data that characterized groundwater availability historical data quantifying saturated thickness of aquifer resources were obtained for individual well heads throughout the study area and interpolated to produce a continuous surface historical trends were used to extrapolate saturated thickness forward through the 2014 to 2100 study period along with the use of projected climate data the suitability surfaces for the great plains were thus dynamic with potential suitability for a given crop for example changing in both space and time as water availability and climate change in the future described below 3 3 3 allocation methodology the spatial allocation methodology simply places new patches parcels of change on the landscape until scenario demand is met however with a new parcel based framework prescribed demand for 29 individual land cover classes and potential shifts in suitability as climate and water availability changed substantial model modifications were required from older fore sce applications for each parcel in the study area pixel membership of the underlying 30 m 2014 lulc data was established for cropland parcels all member pixels in the parcel changed in unison in response to prescribed scenario demand in effect representing field level land use decisions across the region urban modeling used a new and different allocation methodology described below classes other than cropland and urban developed relied on a pixel level allocation strategy unrestrained by parcel boundaries and thus mimicking site level landscape change for transitions such as climate induced encroachment of shrubland into grasslands the following sequence of allocation events occurs for each decadal time step and was designed to ensure that the new fore sce could 1 meet the competing prescribed demand proportions for 29 individual land cover classes when feasible 2 represent potential changes in natural vegetation in response to future climate shifts and 3 shift potential distributions of croplands as climate and water availability change 1 modify baseline suitability values based on elasticity table elasticity is a probability modifier based on quantified likelihood of occurrence for example a transition from urban to corn is extremely unlikely no matter how suitable a pixel may be to support corn elasticity tables represent likelihood of occurrence for each possible transition among the 29 lulc classes they are primarily based on empirically derived historical lulc data nlcd or lcmap but individual transitions can be modified to support the qualitative storyline associated with a given scenario 2 modify baseline suitability values based on protected lands lands with a protected status state and national parks wilderness areas conservation easements etc are masked from specified categories of change the protected area database of the united states gergely and mckerrow 2016 serves as the primary data source for establishing protected status 3 modify baseline suitability based on pixel history a pixel history layer tracks lulc change and can be used to restrict change for example forest cutting in the model uses the pixel history to enforce realistic cutting cycles parameterized individually for each ecoregion with a parcel not allowed to be cut until it reaches a realistic cutting age for that region 4 flag pixels for dynamic loss as the model iterates into the future suitability for individual lulc classes may change as projected climate or groundwater availability changes fore sce checks each pixel to see if future conditions still support the current lulc at that location and flags pixels where a change is needed these pixels are promoted and prioritized for change in the following steps 5 scenario prescribed gaining classes are placed these are lulc classes where the scenario based demand prescribes an increase pixels flagged in step 4 are prioritized for change effectively shifting unsuitable land covers into a more suitable class gaining classes may also be placed in the flexible classes described in section 3 2 e g new fields of corn being placed in existing grassland parcels 6 forced and dynamic loss if a lulc class has pixels flagged for dynamic loss step 4 due to climate or water availability change and some pixels remain after step 5 a forced loss procedure identifies the lowest probability pixels in the offending categories and forces them to transition to a suitable lulc class classes with a prescribed loss in the scenario are also reassigned to a new suitable lulc e g scenario prescribed decline of soybeans resulting in soybean conversion to grassland 7 natural vegetation response to climate distributions and proportions of grassland shrubland and forest classes may shift as climate changes in the future outside of scenario prescribed demand pixels of these classes characterized as unsuitable based on new climate conditions are shifted to a more suitable class e g grassland conversion to shrubland in a hotter and drier future climate while placement of change steps 5 and 6 is based on suitability surface values change placed in highly suitable locations the distribution is also controlled by a clumpiness variable for example new urban lands tend to be tightly clustered near existing urban lands while forest cutting may be widely dispersed fore sce s clumpiness parameter controls the degree of clumpiness or dispersion for patches of landscape change monitoring results from nlcd data or lcmap products can help to quantify landscape metrics related to the level of dispersion or clumpiness within a given region and thus inform our model parameterization for each lulc class 3 3 4 new urban model the evolution of urban areas follows a general pattern with expansion from the initial urban center edge expansion establishment and growth of nearby development centers leap frogging and coalescence of urban centers in filling dietzel et al 2005 li et al 2013 past fore sce applications sohl et al 2014a 2016a 2017 and the first sub unit modeled in the great plains south central great plains sohl et al 2019a used an older fore sce allocation methodology where urban growth consisted almost entirely of edge expansion and in filling a new approach was developed to produce spatial patterns more consistent with theoretical long term patterns of urban growth liu et al 2016 particularly the sprawling patterns evident in cities of the united states schneider and woodcock 2014 the new methodology parameterized with remote sensing based urban patterns was used for the prairie potholes and upper missouri river basin regions as follows 1 fore sce detected all edge pixels for existing urban including road networks present in our starting 2014 cdl landscape a select percentage was stochastically sampled to serve as potential seeds for urban growth 2 duplicate seed pixels from within a given parcel were dropped 3 a focal sum function was applied to remaining seeds where a moving window with a configurable radius computed focal sum counts of urban pixels near the seed pixel seed pixels were dropped from consideration if focal sum counts fell below a configurable threshold effectively ensuring growth primarily occured in areas with a substantial existing urban presence again including road networks 4 remaining seeds were stochastically selected with probability of selection correlated to each seed s focal sum count 5 seeds are sequentially grown to patch sizes that in aggregate mimic historical patch size distributions in a region a configurable percentage of seeds are prioritized to fill up land ownership parcels mimicking schneider and woodcock s 2014 characterization of urban expansion as consisting of both small plots and large tract development 6 patches of urban growth continue to be placed until the scenario based demand for new urban lands is met for that model iteration the process results in development patterns where smaller urban areas are less likely to grow than larger urban centers with dense road networks also facilitating growth of new urban centers parameters related to edge sampling percentage focal sum window radius focal sum percentile threshold and percentage of large tract development are user configurable facilitating the mimicking of urban patterns in a given region or tailoring urban growth characteristics to a given scenario storyline results of the new methodology were evaluated by 1 running both old and new urban model codes in the prairie potholes region 2 extracting the larger urban centers and computing key landscape metrics and 3 comparing results of old and new methodologies to theoretical long term urban patterns from multiple published reviews liu et al 2016 schneider and woodcock 2014 li et al 2013 3 4 assessment of results the primary goal of this work was the production of what if scenarios of potential future landscape change based on exogenous anthropogenic lulc scenarios from multiple established sources we are not predicting future landscapes nor are we characterizing or ranking the likelihood of each scenario we are offering a range of potential scenarios that 1 demonstrate uncertainties in future landscape conditions and 2 offer researchers and land managers the capability to thus potentially plan for and mitigate against any societal or ecological impacts assessment of results for the great plains was thus based on three criteria 1 model performance in representing prescribed lulc proportions from the scenarios 2 where possible assessing characteristics of the spatial allocation of that change and 3 assessing differences among the scenarios and how they represent future landscape uncertainties we are modeling 1 16 individual crop types and 29 total land cover classes and 2 a potential reshuffling of the landscape due to the dynamic impacts of climate and water availability on those classes through space and time to assess model results past fore sce applications have used the concepts of quantity disagreement disagreement with reference conditions that result from an imperfect match in overall proportions of landscape change and allocation disagreement disagreement with reference conditions due to an imperfect match in the spatial arrangement of landscape elements pontius and millones 2011 for quantity disagreement we are not validating the exogenous scenarios themselves but are validating the model s capability to adequately represent those prescribed scenarios at an aggregate level across each modeled ecoregion we examined class by class differences between prescribed demand and actual modeled change proportions for each of the 121 scenario and ecoregion combinations 11 modeled land use scenarios 11 modeled ecoregions comprising the great plains assessing allocation disagreement is substantially more difficult fidelity of landscape pattern is partially controlled by 1 partitioning scenario demand down to the level iii ecoregion scale us epa 1999 and 2 use of ecoregion specific suitability surfaces for each modeled lulc class ensuring change is placed in suitable locations where possible we assess spatial characteristics of the projections the fore sce historical backcast work offered an opportunity to assess general fore sce model performance in reproducing general historical patterns of landscape change over long time spans 1938 1992 sohl et al 2016a but such an assessment for high spatial and thematic resolution projections is more problematic as the only reference data source with the necessary spatial and thematic resolution the cropland data layer 1 provides less than a decade of continuous coverage for the study area at this spatial and thematic resolution 2 records relatively small amounts of change during that time limiting the ability to assess long term model performance and 3 direct comparability between cdl dates is questionable lark et al 2017 in lieu of again assessing model performance for a historical period through a formal quantification of pixel level allocation differences we examined more general spatial measures given the suitability surfaces for each modeled lulc class dictate where lulc change occurs we examined receiver operating characteristics roc measures quantifying model fit of the logistic regression used to construct suitability surfaces for each of the 29 lulc classes and for each of the 11 modeled ecoregions as noted above we also compared model results for the new and old urban modeling methodologies examining trends in landscape metrics and how they compared with theoretical trends for urban growth finally we wanted to use the concepts of quantity and allocation disagreement to assess the scenarios themselves quantifying how the different scenarios vary in both proportions of modeled land cover and spatial distribution for each possible pair of the 11 anthropogenic land use scenarios we examined quantity exchange and shift disagreement pontius and santacruz 2014 for the final year of the simulation 2100 computation and interpretation of those measures is confounded by the dense thematic classification scheme of 29 land cover classes we thus aggregated crop types into 4 major categories row crops small grains hay alfalfa perennial grass prior to quantification of disagreement 4 results 4 1 aggregate results great plains fig 3 depicts trends in major aggregated lulc categories from 2014 to 2100 for the 11 anthropogenic land use scenarios variability is high among the 11 scenarios with all major lulc categories experiencing declines in some scenarios and increases in others the exception is the urban developed class which increases in all scenarios scenario prescribed changes in cropland perennial grass and urban developed drive overall changes in the scenarios with the flexible classes of grassland shrubland and forest rising or falling in response to anthropogenic land use trends transformative changes to the overall landscape are evident in some scenarios most notably the btu60 and btu80 scenarios where up to 100 000 km2 is converted to perennial grass production for cellulosic based biofuel the a2 a1b gcam2 6 and gcam 4 5 scenarios have an equally strong impact on the landscape with up to 150 000 km2 of expansion of traditional croplands with concomitant strong declines in rangeland classes grassland and shrubland fig 4 portrays spatial patterns and site level uncertainty of major lulc classes across the scenarios by quantifying the number of scenarios each class present by the end of the simulation in 2100 individual crops may change among scenarios but core areas of the great plains are devoted to traditional crop production regardless of scenario e g corn and soybean production in the eastern great plains while rainfed cropland in the eastern part of the great plains is more stable traditional cropland production is more volatile among scenarios in more arid areas to the west and where projected aquifer declines are likely to impact the ability to grow traditional irrigated crops such as cotton and corn in the southern part of the study area where irrigated cotton currently dominates but aquifer declines greatly reduce future water availability irrigated cotton reverts to dryland wheat in some scenarios or to rangeland grassland or shrubland in others perennial grass for biofuel production primarily occurs in the southern and eastern great plains and on marginal cropland in the dakotas areas where biomass productivity is high enough to economically support a cellulosic based biofuel industry grassland shrubland and forest each have core areas of little variability among scenarios but cropland and perennial grass expansion in many scenarios results in regional losses of those classes table 3 depicts changes in natural vegetation in response to the three climate scenarios imposed as represented in the sres b2 scenario sres b2 is presented here alone to demonstrate climate impacts on natural vegetation as this is the scenario with the least area of anthropogenic land use agriculture or urban developed and comparison across a single land use scenario avoids issues of variable anthropogenic land use change among scenarios the rcp4 5 mid range and rcp8 5 represent increasing climate change impacts respectively with generally hotter and in parts of the great plains drier conditions by 2100 as such impacts on natural vegetation are the least for rcp4 5 and the highest for rcp8 5 the most prevalent transition is the conversion of grassland to shrubland primarily concentrated in the southwestern great plains over 30 000 km2 of grassland transitions to shrubland in the rcp4 5 scenario while nearly 80 000 km2 converts in the rcp8 5 scenario as a minor class in much of the great plains forest changes are more muted deciduous and mixed forest lose a substantial proportion of the 2014 area by 2100 primarily through conversion to grassland while evergreen forest largely concentrated in the middle and northern rockies ecoregions fig 1 shows little impact regardless of climate scenario finally fig 5 depicts full resolution results for a small region in the panhandle of texas for the 11 anthropogenic land use scenarios run with the mid range climate projection in 2014 irrigated cotton dominates the landscape but with projected aquifer declines cotton disappears from most scenarios by 2100 as an extrapolation of existing land use trends the bau scenario is the exception as dynamic climate and water impacts were not considered perennial grass replaces much of the lost cropland in the btu60 btu80 and a1b scenarios all storylines that support a strong cellulosic based biofuel industry dryland wheat replaces irrigated crops in scenarios with very high overall demand for traditional crop commodities gcam 4 5 gcam 2 6 for the environmentally focused b1 and b2 scenarios much of the cropland in the region reverts to rangeland grass and shrubland the impacts of a projected warmer and drier climate result in encroachment of shrubland into grassland areas throughout the area 4 2 new urban model performance fig 6 depicts spatial modeling results from 2014 to 2100 for the des moines iowa area for the a2 scenario the old model results in in filling of existing urban areas and growth along the periphery of large urban areas but does not produce the anticipated leap frogging as specified by li et al 2013 liu et al 2016 this results in increasingly blocky future projections of urban area with decreased landscape complexity over time alternatively the new urban model produces much more sprawling development patterns with in filling and edge expansion but also with substantial leap frogging new urban patches become established along transportation networks grow through edge expansion and coalesce over time with surrounding urban patches through in filling new model results are more consistent with theoretical long term development patterns table 4 provides key landscape metrics measured from 2014 to 2100 for prairie potholes megaregion urban centers for both the old and new fore sce urban modeling the old model results in sharply increased mean patch sizes as in filling and edge expansion dominate growth patch density edge density and landscape shape index all decline an indication of a less complex urban landscape in the future conversely the new model results in increases in patch density edge density and landscape shape index reflecting a more complex more fragmented landscape 4 3 quantity disagreement fig 7 summarizes how well fore sce met scenario prescribed demand across the 11 anthropogenic land use scenarios and 11 modeled ecoregions for most scenarios fore sce can precisely match overall demand coming within 5 of the total number of prescribed pixels of landscape change however the ability to meet scenario demand degrades towards the end of the simulation period while 93 of scenario ecoregion combinations match demand within 10 for the 2050 2060 time step that proportion drops to 64 for the last time step 2090 2100 4 4 model fit suitability surfaces fig 8 depicts roc scores describing model fit for each of the 29 lulc classes across the 11 independently modeled ecoregions roc scores average 0 85 0 09 across 292 regressions not all lulc classes were found in all ecoregions while model fit was relatively consistent across most lulc classes fit was lower on average for 1 grassland and 2 alfalfa and hay classes most of the land in the great plains is suitable for grassland yet roc scores were lower 0 74 0 09 due to the model s inability to precisely differentiate between grassland suitable areas with an actual grassland cover or grassland suitable areas converted to agricultural land uses the alfalfa and hay classes also had lower roc scores than other agricultural classes at 0 77 0 09 and 0 80 0 08 respectively 4 5 assessment of scenario differences fig 9 depicts measures of quantity exchange and shift disagreement for the year 2100 for each of the 55 possible scenario pairs total disagreement among scenario pairs is lowest for low change scenarios this includes the btu40 scenario biofuel prices are not high enough for substantial investment in cellulosic ethanol and crop and perennial grass changes are low the gcamref scenario no carbon related land use incentives and low land change and environmentally focused sres b2 scenario for many of the scenario pairs with low total disagreement quantity disagreement is half or less of total disagreement signifying that scenario prescribed demand for lulc change is relatively similar and differences are primarily due to the pixel level spatial arrangement of that change exchange and shift disagreement differences in spatial arrangement are due to both 1 stochasticity in the model itself e g exactly which fields are allocated to a given crop and 2 scenario driven differences in allocation at the ecoregion level before fore sce even allocates change overall scenario pairs with low total disagreement generally have relatively high proportions of allocation disagreement compared to scenario pairs with high total disagreement where quantity disagreement makes up the bulk of the scenario differences the highest disagreement scenarios are overwhelmingly scenario pairs that involve the btu60 and btu80 scenarios those scenarios are unique compared to the other scenario families as they call for increases in perennial grass for cellulosic ethanol production far above any other scenario set other high disagreement scenario pairs include several scenarios that strongly differ from the business as usual scenario indicating these scenarios call for future landscape change storylines that are quite dissimilar from recent land use trends finally some anomalous scenario pairs are dominated by large amounts of allocation disagreement such as the gcam2 6 and sres a1b scenario pair both scenarios prescribe similar large increases in traditional cropland hay and pasture and perennial grass fig 2 and thus quantity disagreement between the two is quite low however as indicated by high allocation disagreement strong differences in the spatial patterns of land use change are apparent for this scenario allocation disagreement is largely due to ecoregion level differences in scenario prescribed proportions of crops and perennial grass 4 6 parcel boundary delineation from lcmap data stacks while not part of the great plains modeling fig 10 provides an example of multiple versions of parcel boundaries for a small portion of the test region of the piedmont ecoregion of the eastern united states coverage of cropland and managed pastureland is generally excellent with usda clu boundaries panel a the remote sensing based object segmentation from yan and roy 2016 captures most active crops but is much less comprehensive than clu panel b panel c represents parcels derived from the lcmap based object segmentation for forested lands panel d represents a harmonized parcel boundary dataset utilizing 1 clu data for agricultural lands and 2 lcmap based segmentation for forested lands the resulting parcel boundaries are a mix of intensively monitored and recorded land use and land management boundaries clu and empirically derived pseudo management boundaries representing areas of similar forest management over the last 32 years with parcel size criteria controlling the lcmap based segmentation we can tailor the forested lands parcelization to match historical patch sizes of forest cutting information derived from lcmap monitoring products 5 discussion using a modified version of the fore sce model we have produced a suite of high resolution landscape projections for the great plains with a broad user community for landsat scale lulc data such as nlcd or cdl the projections satisfy the need for high resolution spatial simulation models that are capable of generating artificial land cover maps at high resolution and help to predict the ecological consequences of landscape dynamics langhammer et al 2019 the spatial and thematic characteristics of the projections facilitate the adoption of the projections into existing research and land management workflows that rely on landsat scale lulc data the use of a variety of exogenous scenario inputs quantifies the uncertainty in future landscapes while allowing us to incorporate necessary expertise in economics demographics energy markets and other driving forces of broad scale landscape change by capitalizing on lcmap monitoring products nlcd cdl and other remote sensing based data for model parameterization and scenario development and downscaling we play to our strengths while facilitating the development of projections consistent with the most widely used lulc databases for the united states the new urban model performed well in matching theoretical long term urban patterns luck and wu 2002 noted that widely used cellular automata urban models tend to portray compact and aggregated urban growth a pattern found in the older version of fore sce with increased mean patch size and decreases in edge density and patch density the new urban model reversed those trends with increased landscape fragmentation represented by increased patch density and edge density and increased structural complexity represented by increased landscape shape index these trends are consistent with long term urban development patterns measured by liu et al 2016 who quantified long term historical trends for 16 global cities dietzel et al 2005 found similar empirically measured patterns in the central valley of california from 1940 to 2000 however dietzel et al 2005 also postulated a diffusion and coalescence long term pattern where those trends would eventually reverse as the urbanization process matures our modeled long term trends are more consistent with diversity complexity wu et al 2011 and landscape modification gradient forman and godron 1986 hypotheses where fragmentation and structural complexity continue to increase over time liu et al 2016 schneider and woodcock 2014 found u s cities had a relatively unique expansive growth pattern with substantial new development broadly distributed over extended geographic areas outside of urban cores thus in areas such as the great plains where there are often few geographical barriers to urban expansion the continuation of sprawl as represented by the new model seems warranted even for the long term configurable model parameters allow for control of compactness or sprawl and could be tailored in future applications to specific scenario storylines or for urban centers where historical growth has been more compact fore sce was generally successful in meeting scenario prescribed demand a difficult task when balancing 29 lulc classes that could shift in space and time as climate or water availability changed however late in the simulation period generally the 2080 2090 and 2090 2100 periods there were several ecoregions and scenarios where the model struggled to meet demand in nearly all cases however failure to precisely match demand represented fore sce fighting back against unrealistic scenarios the ipcc sres and rcp gcam scenarios were particularly susceptible to struggles in meeting demand in a review of landscape projections available for the united states it was noted that downscaled global scenarios such as these are sometimes not realistic at a local or regional scale sohl et al 2016b with this new version of the model fore sce itself is a check on unrealistic scenarios while it can be manually overridden by default fore sce will stop trying to place scenario prescribed demand for a given lulc class if no more suitable parcels are available for that class this occurred late in the simulation period for many of the gcam2 6 and gcam4 5 runs where the baseline exogenous scenarios called for far more cropland alfalfa and other hay than had ever been present on the landscape historically the role of changing water availability and climate also impacted fore sce s ability to meet demand in some cases shifting environmental conditions in the future greatly reduced the area suitable for a given crop and fore sce was unable to meet demand the new model thus performed well in meeting scenario demand and for long term urban development patterns roc scores indicated good model fits when creating suitability surfaces for each ecoregion and lulc class and with fore sce s check on suitability scenario prescribed landscape change was placed in suitable locations fig 3 demonstrates highly certain landscapes in the future where most or all scenarios agree or areas with substantially different projected futures dependent upon scenario however additional quantitative validation of the spatial allocation remains problematic as noted previously the scenarios themselves are not predictions but are what if representations of future landscape conditions with variability among scenarios demonstrating uncertainty as such pontius and neeti 2010 state that for scenario based storylines using a story and simulation approach alcamo 2008 such as ours demand is not subject to uncertainty and subsequent validation in this approach but the spatial allocation of that prescribed change could be assessed we recognize that while good roc scores provide some indication of overall performance of the spatial allocation element of fore sce it is not a formal validation of final landscape pattern however with the highly variable scenarios themselves and the treatment of non stationarity in terms of site level suitability suitability shifting as climate or water availability shifts there are no correlates from the historical record on which a quantitative validation of prescribed long term projection through 2100 could be based cdl provides the only comparable data in terms of spatial and thematic resolution and as noted above they are only available for a short time period and may not be directly comparable pontius et al 2008 note the difficulties in assessing long term model performance when validation data temporal intervals are generally much shorter particularly as the amount of change occurring in short validation time periods is typically quite small in summary a primary purpose of scenario analysis is to gain insight into future decisions for which there might be no historical precedence pontius and neeti 2010 making precise quantitative validation of unprecedented conditions practically impossible 6 conclusions after the first prototype of high resolution parcel based landscape projections for a small ecoregion in the northern u s great plains sohl et al 2017 the feasibility of producing similar projections at a national scale was under question with this work we demonstrate it is feasible to produce high resolution parcel based landscape projections at broad regional and national scales fore sce is a data hungry model and one potential limitation for consistent national scale modeling is data availability particularly for suitable parcel data with a combination of usda clu parcels and remote sensing based parcels derived from lcmap monitoring products or yan and roy 2016 we have a spatial framework on which national scale projections can be built lcmap monitoring products from 1985 to present offer several advantages for supporting national scale projections with a much longer temporal history and denser temporal resolution than any other available land cover monitoring data at this scale lcmap data support parcel delineation and help quantify key parameters in fore sce including transition probabilities elasticity pixel histories for processes such as forestry activity and characterizing spatial patterns as we undertake national scale high resolution landscape projections lcmap is poised to offer unique long term consistent and relatively high resolution representations of historical current and landscape condition in the united states and thus potentially inform countless research and land management applications data availability the high resolution landscape projections for the great plains are available from

26151,this paper presents the use of multivariate regression trees mrts to analyze multiobjective evolutionary algorithm moea tradeoff sets generated from a long term water utility planning problem moeas produce large sets of non dominated solutions where each solution represents an observation of how multiple predictor variables decision levers impact performance in multiple response variables objectives because they explicitly accommodate multiple response variables mrts can preserve the relationships between objectives revealed through moea assisted optimization we generated mrts for two tradeoff sets that resulted from optimizing the eldorado utility planning problem under two climate change scenarios a single mrt helped identify the subset of core planning decisions that led to preferred performance and demonstrated how decision preferences impacted performance in different objectives comparing mrts from two scenarios revealed decisions that performed well across scenarios the systematic and repeatable mrt approach can help water managers understand large high dimensional tradeoff sets and prompt additional promising analyses keywords multivariate regression tree mrt multiobjective evolutionary algorithm moea feature selection long term planning front range colorado 1 introduction many academic studies and recently several real world applications of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms moeas have established the tool s ability to produce innovative solutions and valuable performance information about water resources planning problems csu 2017 maier et al 2014 reed et al 2013 through intelligent search and evaluation of thousands of potential portfolios moeas produce suites of nondominated alternatives that explicitly elucidate relationships between conflicting planning objectives and the complex interactions among decisions that affect those objectives i e tradeoff sets thorough analysis of the information contained in such tradeoff sets generally requires working with hundreds or thousands of solutions and considering many performance and decision characteristics or dimensions simultaneously interpreting this magnitude and complexity of relational information is difficult so it is important to develop tools that facilitate water managers ability to understand causes effects and trends in decisions and performance that are embedded in the results generated by moeas to date water resources systems analysis wrsa research applications of moeas have mostly relied on parallel axis plots and or glyph plots kasprzyk et al 2009 kollat and reed 2007 matrosov et al 2015 smith et al 2016 or cartesian plots mortazavi et al 2012 wu et al 2017 for insights performing relatively subjective assessments on the tradeoffs to frame assertions of different performance priorities subjective explorations are useful for gaining general familiarity with the tradeoffs and identifying individual portfolios of interest but they may not result in insights about the fundamental system dynamics that drive performance the volume of solutions and large numbers of decisions and objectives that make moea tradeoff sets difficult to analyze heuristically also make them good candidates for employing feature selection the process of systematically reducing the dimensionality of a data set by distinguishing the most sensitive features from those that are noisy redundant or irrelevant liu et al 2010 thus identifying fundamental system properties since the 1990s feature selection has been used as a pre processing step to improve subsequent data mining applications in a wide range of fields such as bioinformatics saeys et al 2007 satellite imagery classification jain and zongker 1997 social network exploitation analysis zheleva and getoor 2009 and financial fraud detection ravisankar et al 2011 feature selection has been applied specifically to moea tradeoff sets in a number of fields though the term is not common in such studies in this context various feature selection approaches are presented as the main data mining event not preparation for data mining and used for the purpose of knowledge discovery bandaru et al 2017 provide a thorough review of this literature here we will focus on work that has employed regression trees which are the specific type of feature selection data mining method in which we are interested regression tree models are generated by recursively partitioning data into two mutually exclusive sets in order to sort the data into groups that have similar attributes they are a popular method of feature selection because they are very versatile and easy to interpret the partitioning process does not require or assume any specific distributions within the data and it can uncover hidden structures and interactions between hierarchical and nonlinear variables prasad et al 2006 verbyla 1987 among many predictor variables the method can determine which have the greatest influence on response lawrence and wright 2001 the binary rules are easy to understand for users who do not have expertise in statistics and the tree structure itself is an intuitive way to visualize a model the few studies that have used regression trees to perform feature selection on moea tradeoff sets have been limited to univariate regression trees which relate a single objective response to multiple decision levers predictors sugimura et al 2010 demonstrated regression tree analysis on the design of a centrifugal impeller the case study optimized 2 objectives using 16 design parameters and then generated a regression tree for each objective individually dudas et al 2011 optimized process rules for a 3 objective automotive production line system using 22 variables and like sugimura et al created a separate tree for each objective in another study dudas et al optimized investments in a production line using three objectives and nine decisions this time eliciting a preferred performance region from decision makers and generating trees based on different methods of measuring solutions spatial relationships to the region 2014 while these univariate regression trees provide useful information they either separate or collapse the relationships between the objectives and thus do not capitalize on one of the primary benefits of using an moea the multivariate regression tree mrt was developed to relate predictor variables to multiple response variables while maintaining the individual characteristics of the responses de ath 2002 it originated in the field of ecology and was designed to be able to relate populations of multiple species to a number of independent environmental conditions importantly mrts do not make any assumptions about the underlying relationships between the response variables mrts have been used previously for feature selection for example by questier et al 2005 to analyze how the presence or absence of various chemicals predicts certain types of smells however to our knowledge they have not been applied to feature selection using an moea tradeoff set the versatility of the method i e there is no requirement of any sort of data structure suggests it can be successfully used to analyze the complex dynamics found in such data this study makes two contributions first it builds on previous efforts to perform feature selection on moea tradeoff sets using regression trees by newly applying mrts to the task second it employs feature selection to analyze tradeoff sets generated from optimizing a complex water supply system by applying mrts to a long term water resources planning study performed using the eldorado utility planning model we demonstrate how the method can facilitate and expand on heuristically derived insights by extracting latent information about how specific combinations of decisions impact different types of performance and about which decisions are likely to perform well in a wide range of potential futures such insights may either not be discernable from heuristic analyses alone or the process of discovering them may require applying preferences that are not agreeable to all parties involved in developing a plan in the following section we present information about our methods moea tradeoff sets and regression trees we then give background on the eldorado utility case study used in the optimization next are the regression tree results followed by discussion of their implications for practical applications in water resources planning and also for future research the last section offers concluding remarks 2 methods 2 1 moea tradeoff sets multiobjective evolutionary algorithms moeas are a search technology used to efficiently generate and evaluate alternative solutions to systems whose conflicting performance objectives are impacted by many decisions that exhibit complex interactions reed et al 2013 in the context of long term water supply planning the moea intelligently designs and tests thousands of different combinations or portfolios of decisions such as reservoir sizes and conservation levels to optimize performance in objectives such as maximizing storage reliability and minimizing frequency of water use restrictions when attempting to optimize multiple conflicting objectives improvement in one objective requires sacrificing performance in another so there are tradeoffs during optimization the moea removes from the preferred group any portfolio whose performance is worse than another portfolio in all objectives that is the dominated portfolios are removed the end product of moea assisted optimization is a set of nondominated planning portfolios that quantitatively characterize the performance tradeoffs of a system the nondominated tradeoff set is valuable because it represents the system information learned by the moea as it refines combinations of decision levers to achieve better results in the objectives each portfolio within the moea tradeoff set is an observation of how multiple predictor variables decision levers affect a system s performance in multiple response variables objectives framing the dataset in this way motivates the use of mrts to help extract the relational information contained in the tradeoffs 2 2 multivariate regression trees mrts mrts are an extension of the univariate classification and regression tree cart algorithm breiman et al 1984 trees generated from categorical data are termed classification trees we are working with quantitative data and as such will limit our description to regression trees cart has been used for feature selection in several fields chebrolu et al 2004 gomez chova et al 2003 and also for other data mining purposes in wrsa bryant and lempert 2010 kwakkel and jaxa rozen 2016 for cart the steps and calculations presented below would be performed on values of a single response variable for mrts they are instead applied to the geometric centroid defined by the summed euclidian distances to the means of all response variables to convert from mrt to cart one only needs to remove the innermost summation from equations 1 through 3 found in section 2 2 1 note that because objectives incorporated into moea optimization often measure very different types of quantities all objective values need to be scaled before an mrt is generated to prevent objectives with large units and ranges from dominating the splitting this preserves the equal weighting of objectives which is a core concept that underpins the value of moeas though there are several ways of standardizing or normalizing data we recommend scaling the observations for each objective to a range of 0 1 because this approach does not distort within objective distribution or across objective relationships decision lever values do not need to be scaled 2 2 1 mrt algorithm the steps of the mrt algorithm will be presented in terms of an moea tradeoff set portfolios are observations decision variables are the predictors and objectives are the responses a calculate the error of the full data set at the root node 1 e r o o t i 1 n j 1 j y i j y j n 2 where n is the number of portfolios in the tradeoff set j is the number of objectives y i j is a portfolio s value of objective j and y n is the mean of all values of objective j b for every split between values in every decision lever sum the error impurity within and across each of the two child nodes that would result from splitting the data by that decision lever value 2 ε s p l i t k 1 2 i 1 n j 1 j y i j k y j k 2 where y i j k is a portfolio s value of objective j y j k is the child node s mean value of objective j k is the child node formed by the split and n is the number of observations in child node k c split the parent node using the decision lever and value from step b that resulted in the smallest value of ε s p l i t d repeat steps b and c for each child node until a user specified stopping criterion is met when the criterion is met splitting terminates and a node becomes a leaf stopping criterion determines the number of leaves i e the size of the tree within leaf error is defined as 3 ε l e a f i 1 n j 1 j y i j k y j k 2 the explanatory power of a tree is traditionally captured by its relative error this value represents how much of the root error was not resolved by sorting the portfolios via recursive splits in decision variables 4 r e t r e e l 1 l ε l e a f e r o o t where l is the total number of leaves on the tree y i j l is a portfolio s value of objective j y j l is the leaf s mean value of objective j and n is the number of observations in leaf l though it offers the same technical information as relative tree error we propose use of the complementary explained variance quantity cannon 2012 to summarize the overall explanatory power of the tree 5 e v 1 r e t r e e 100 focusing on minimizing error is a misleading characterization in terms of understanding the tree s value as such ev will be reported for mrts in this study 2 2 2 cross validation the cross validation technique commonly used when generating mrts which is also used in this study is 10 fold cross validation for each fold a model is trained on 90 of the data and tested by calculating the r e t r e e that results once the withheld 10 are placed in their respective leaves the average of the 10 r e t r e e values is reported back as the cross validated relative error cvre this process is undertaken for every potential size of tree to enable comparison between r e t r e e and cvre which can guide users in determining optimal tree size 2 2 3 mrt selection in any statistical modeling application steps must be taken to ensure that the model appropriately represents the underlying data to the extent that the method can do so meaningfully for regression trees it is also important to ensure that the structure of the tree is understandable for users so the most appropriate tree will need to balance descriptive power and interpretability this can be achieved by using standard cross validation procedures and or knowledge of the data to prune the tree murphy 2012 one common way of determining the best tree is by examining the progression of its cvre as size increases if cvre stagnates or starts to increase the model is said to be overfit there is no gain or potentially a loss of explanatory power as the tree increases in complexity in such cases a rule of thumb proposed by breiman et al 1984 is to choose the smallest tree that achieves the minimum cvre plus one standard error the min 1se rule however not all data sets exhibit divergent error behavior other approaches to determining appropriate tree size include requiring a minimum number of observations per node defining the minimum amount of error reduction that must be met for a split to proceed and pre specifying tree size or depth 2 2 4 example mrt to preview the conceptual and visual results of generating an mrt we present a simple example problem and tree the water utility for a growing city has two objectives to minimize frequency of imposing annual water use restrictions on customers and also minimize the amount of expensive and environmentally disruptive new storage it has to build to meet increasing demands the decision levers available to the city are to build or not build a reservoir with up to 100 million cubic meter mcm of capacity and to enact or not enact conservation measures that would reduce demand by 20 a binary decision 0 no conservation 1 conservation enacted fig 1 represents how an mrt generated for this problem might look the mrt has two splits and three leaves each leaf is comprised of a set of portfolios whose range of performance in each of the two planning objectives is characterized by a boxplot at the root the boxplot for each objective would span the entire plotting range included in fig 1 for demonstration purposes each of the three leaves has a different configuration of performance tradeoffs across the two objectives because the mrt divides the tradeoff set such that the variance in performance is reduced in one or more objectives the mrt shows how many portfolios are in each leaf and the error remaining within each leaf calculated as the summed differences between each portfolio s actual performances in each objective compared to the mean performances in each objective of all in leaf portfolios see equation 3 while error is appropriate in terms of the quantity calculated it is actually just an indication of spread around the means and does not indicate that portfolios are incorrectly placed in the leaf leaves with larger numbers of portfolios tend to have higher error because there are more errors to sum and leaves with a large distribution of performance in one or more objectives i e large boxplot ranges will also have higher in leaf error leaf 1 has the fewest portfolios and tightest ranges so in leaf error is smallest leaf 3 has the most portfolios and larger ranges for both objectives so it has higher error the branches of the tree are formed by splitting the portfolios based on their values of the two decision levers the first split is based on reservoir size this indicates that reservoir size explains the most variance across all objectives leaf 1 shows that the larger reservoirs require larger volume of new storage as indicated by the height of the teal boxplot and also that a larger reservoir will result in relatively fewer years of restrictions as indicated by the low placement of the light purple boxplot portfolios with reservoirs less than 50 mcm in capacity the right hand tree branch are further split based on whether conservation was enacted and that distinction leads to two different ranges for years in restriction as indicated by the different heights of the light purple boxplots in leaves 2 and 3 the ev value at the bottom of the plot indicates how well the tree was able to organize the set of portfolios into groups of similar performance characteristics this tree was able to explain 75 of the variance using two splits the sum of error across leaves is 25 and the root error is 100 there is no threshold of ev that indicates whether a tree is valid or useful if a user sees value in the percentage of variance explained then the tree is valuable assuming the tree was appropriately pruned using cross validation criteria and problem knowledge furthermore it would not actually be desirable to generate a tree that explained 100 of the variance for two reasons it would be unwieldy and it would eliminate the opportunity to use human reasoning to explore flexibility in the decision space as opposed to relying on the mrt algorithm to exhaustively organize the portfolios 2 2 5 analyzing mrts applications of mrts in other fields are often motivated by understanding how things co occur which focuses on the relative relationships of response variables generally species of plants or animals within and across mrt leaves e g two species may be very prominent in leaves characterized by certain environmental conditions but rarely found in others so they are likely to be found together davidson et al 2010 de ath 2002 herzschuh and birks 2010 larsen and speckman 2004 in this context studies often examine population composition at each split in the mrt to identify the species that are most influential in each partition and also perform within leaf calculations to determine indicator species another common use of mrts is to use splits to delineate geographic regions either using latitude and longitude directly or via climate or ecosystem variables that can be mapped cannon 2012 hamann et al 2011 salonen et al 2012 the first type of application is very leaves focused and the second type gains most information from the splits a major difference between using mrts to explain population composition or climate effects vs applying them to moea tradeoff sets is that moea tradeoff sets exist to facilitate the elucidation and navigation of preferences users have values that determine which performance tradeoffs are acceptable and also have opinions about the decisions that comprise a portfolio this suggests two approaches to analyzing mrts generated from moea tradeoffs that are valuable because of the ability to navigate relationships between leaves and splits objectives and decisions iteratively 2 2 5 1 leaves first analysis after visual inspection of all leaves users will be able to identify a subset that represent preferred patterns of performance tradeoffs and then review the splits portfolio decisions that led to the leaf referring back to fig 1 a user that values minimization of water use restrictions far more than avoidance of building new storage would focus on leaf 1 once leaf 1 is identified the user would learn that reaching the leaf requires at least a 50 mcm reservoir 2 2 5 2 root first analysis without the benefit of moea tradeoff sets to facilitate in depth discussion of performance tradeoffs water utilities typically focus on decision preferences when crafting portfolios to test during long term planning studies smith et al 2018 in this paradigm an mrt user would start at the root of the tree and at each split determine the preferred value of a decision following decision preferences down the tree to one or more leaves would reveal how decision preferences affect performance tradeoffs and potentially help users see where compromises are needed to avoid unacceptable performance the mrt in fig 1 would demonstrate to a user that if they wanted to avoid a large reservoir right branch and not enact conservation right branch they could expect relatively frequent incidence of water use restrictions this likely would not be considered desirable 2 2 6 software this study used the mvpart r package de ath 2014 2002 r core team 2016 which is archived but still functional its primary function executes the algorithm described in section 2 2 1 and the most important parameters are those that control cross validation and the complexity parameter cp the stopping criterion that defines the amount of error reduction that must be achieved by a split to continue growing the tree we note our settings in the results section the only functionality we altered was the standard plotting included with the package mvpart generates a set of bar plots for the mean objective values at each leaf but we replaced the bars with boxplots to give more information the repository of data packages and code necessary to reproduce this study s results can be found in the acknowledgements 3 case study 3 1 front range colorado the front range of colorado is an urban corridor on the eastern slope of the rocky mountains that encompasses several mid sized cities and many smaller communities water providers in the region rely heavily on runoff from highly variable annual mountain snowpack so storage is critical for weathering intra and interannual water supply fluctuations doesken 2014 rajagopalan et al 2009 the long term impact that climate change will have on colorado s hydrology is unclear temperatures are expected to continue increasing but precipitation could increase or decrease lukas et al 2014 however despite the possibility of increased precipitation there is likely to be less water in the future due to the dominance of higher temperatures udall and overpeck 2017 woodbury et al 2012 in addition to the natural supply variability and uncertainty from climate change the front range is experiencing the compounding challenge of rapid population growth the regional population is projected to increase by 40 by 2050 state of colorado 2017 water management in colorado is further complicated by the prior appropriation doctrine a legal framework that bases the succession of streamflow access on date of first use first in time first in right hobbs 2004 farmers and energy companies own the vast majority of senior water rights in the state and by 1900 most of the water in eastern slope rivers was fully appropriated eschner et al 1983 this means that as cities grew they collected a mixture of supplies from multiple locations including the western slope of the rockies by acquiring junior streamflow diversion rights building junior reservoirs buying senior diversion rights from agriculture or buying shares in other water companies all long term utility planning involves making many decisions and balancing conflicting objectives on the front range these inherent difficulties are exacerbated by rapidly increasing demand highly uncertain impacts of climate change complex regulations and contentious social and environmental issues this context is the basis of our moea case study briefly described in the next section 3 2 eldorado utility planning model the eldorado utility planning model was designed based on input from 11 front range water managers to generically capture important regional management features and challenges smith et al 2017 it encompasses the region surrounding a small municipal water provider called the eldorado utility eldorado is located on the eastern slope of a mountain range along with eight other water users that directly compete with the utility to divert and store water eldorado has mostly junior diversion rights junior storage rights in two reservoirs that it owns and also has shares in a water wholesale company that it takes out of a reservoir owned by that entity one of eldorado s diversion rights comes from the western slope where an additional four users impede the utility s access to water the model incorporates a wide range of water rights dates to capture the temporal complexity created by prior appropriation it also has great spatial complexity to reflect the fact that in colorado water is constantly being diverted from and returned to the stream overall there are five distinct basins in the model each with a streamflow input site at its headwaters the model was designed such that under historic hydrology eldorado s existing system and sources could meet 100 of current demands with only rare need for restrictions different future streamflow scenarios that alter timing and volume of streamflow require the utility to take action in order to meet growing demands these scenarios and demands are described in section 3 4 for more detailed model and optimization information refer to smith et al 2018 the eldorado utility planning model was built using the riverware modeling software zagona et al 2001 riverware s advanced capabilities facilitated our use of prior appropriation water allocation and enabled us to manage ownership of water through its accounting functionality the model uses over 150 custom rules to operate the intricate relationships between objects users and accounts and is an example of the kind of complex decision support system that many utilities have incorporated into their planning labadie 2004 3 3 problem formulation the problem formulation includes 13 decision levers and 7 objectives which are briefly described here 3 3 1 decision levers eldorado utility has a total of 13 decision levers available to enable it to meet growing demands with potentially more challenging streamflow conditions some increase the system s operational flexibility some involve acquiring or freeing up water and some develop new storage they are briefly described below and summarized in table 2 where applicable lever descriptions include a reference to the relevant user in fig 2 3 3 1 1 enhancing operations certain water sources in colorado are reusable cities carefully monitor their return flows from unconsumed water so that they can re divert reusable return flows to meet demands this is only possible by legally acquiring the right to exchange the water from downstream to upstream and only works well with strategic storage options three levers help eldorado take advantage of reusable return flows exchange determines whether the legal right is acquired to store reusable water in a reservoir owned by eldorado leasevol xres determines the amount of dedicated exchange storage space eldorado rent in the external res xr and lease ag2res determines whether eldorado is allowed to use available space in ag2 irrigation co res a2r to store reusable water 3 3 1 2 increasing supply there are three ways that eldorado can gain access to new supplies the utility can acquire portions of water rights of other users in the model it can buy shares of water companies in the model and it can create water through conservation or increasing distribution efficiency eldorado may purchase up to 20 of the rights of ag3 user ag3 rights ag3 and industrial user ind rights industrial ag3 rights are very senior and may be stored but are not available year round industrial rights are mid seniority and must be directly diverted from the stream but are available year round eldorado may buy shares from either wholesaler ws1 ws2 shares wholesaler or ag2 irrigation co a2r shares ag2 through shares interruptible the utility may also execute a contract for access to a2r shares that is triggered when eldorado s storage is severely depleted acquiring water from any of these sources will draw water away from regional agriculture and industry and potentially disrupt those communities finally eldorado may enact none moderate or aggressive conservation measures consfactor or increase distribution efficiency disteff by up to 3 3 3 1 3 building storage there are three opportunities for eldorado to increase the amount of storage it owns the utility may expand the existing south res sr to help store both existing and new eastern slope and western slope water expandvol southres eldorado can build a new west slope res wsr to store its existing western slope diversion right buildvol westsloperes this is a very challenging proposition because of regulatory social and environmental considerations lastly the utility can develop gravel pits gp downstream of its return point to capture reusable flows gp 3 3 2 objectives brief qualitative descriptions of the seven objectives are given below for further detail and equations please refer to the appendix the first three objectives restlev1 restlev2 and restlev3 seek to minimize the total number of years within the 25 year simulation that eldorado goes into three restriction levels of increasing intensity to comply with eldorado s current reliability policy the utility can only go into each level 5 1 and 0 years out of 25 respectively the fourth objective missedopp minimizes the average annual volume of water that the utility misses i e when timing of demand or availability of storage space prevent eldorado from capitalizing on the full amount of its water rights optimizing how efficiently eldorado uses the water it has helps prevent wasteful acquisitions objective five new supply seeks to minimize the average annual volume of water eldorado uses from new sources though the utility does need to acquire or create new water to meet growing demands they do not want to take more than they need for future water security the sixth objective april1storage maximizes carryover storage of the lowest storage to annual demand percentage recorded during the 25 year simulation april 1 is the approximate date when reservoirs would be at their lowest levels before spring runoff begins to fill them again and is a measure of carry over storage compared with the restrictions based objectives this captures a longer term reliability signal because it evaluates performance based on the worst performing year of the simulation finally newstorage minimizes the volume of newly built storage within each portfolio because storage is difficult to permit and socially and environmentally contentious eldorado seeks to carefully consider the number and size of storage projects it pursues the combination of this and the newsupply objective provide a cost like signal and allow the utility to consider planning policy on a broader level smith et al 2018 3 4 scenarios the optimization runs using the eldorado utility planning model assumed a buildout demand based on 40 population increase by 2050 state of colorado 2017 when the simulation time horizon starts the demands exhibit single family residential patterns i e use increases substantially during summer months when lawns are irrigated the irrigation demands go up slightly during dry years and are affected by conservation and distribution efficiency levers but the baseline population demand does not change throughout the simulation because future streamflow in colorado is highly uncertain the set of studies associated with this model use several hydrologic scenarios the scenarios relevant to this article are the 1 c and 4 c warmer futures which were chosen based on a front range climate change study woodbury et al 2012 the perturbed hydrology used monthly changes i e deltas from that study and generated sets of stochastic headwater streamflow the stochastic simulation first generates annual streamflow timeseries using a knn resampling approach lall and sharma 1996 which are disaggregated to monthly flows using the proportional disaggregation method of nowak et al 2010 the monthly deltas from for the warming scenario from woodbury et al 2012 are then applied 3 5 optimization implementation we used the borg moea for this study hadka and reed 2013 which tests have shown to perform similarly or favorably compared to other state of the art algorithms on difficult benchmark problems reed et al 2013 zatarain salazar et al 2016 the eldorado utility planning model embedded in the search loop simulates the supply and usage dynamics of eldorado utility and other regional water users over 25 years from 2050 to 2075 at a monthly timestep portfolios were tested as fully implemented configurations of eldorado s system performance of each portfolio was evaluated across ten hydrologic traces each distributed to a separate computing core of an amazon web services elastic compute cloud ec2 instance mathew and varia 2019 each distributed simulation took approximately 20 s this relatively long simulation time prompted us to limit search to 5 000 function evaluations though this number of evaluations is lower than that of many other moea studies the resulting tradeoff set is sufficiently large and diverse to demonstrate the mrt method we used the default borg settings except for changing initial population size from 100 to 50 3 6 heuristic analysis of eldorado optimization tradeoffs 3 6 1 sample analysis using parallel axis plots fig 3 presents a set of eldorado pareto optimal portfolios from a 1 c perturbed optimization run we will use the set to facilitate readers understanding of moea tradeoff sets and describe how the eldorado utility planning model captures front range colorado water management tradeoffs the figure also offers an opportunity to demonstrate the challenge of heuristically analyzing the results of moea assisted optimization the performance and decision tradeoffs of the set of 961 portfolios are presented using parallel axis plots which are a visual analytics technique commonly used in multiobjective optimization studies herman et al 2014 kasprzyk et al 2013 watson and kasprzyk 2017 in fig 3a each of the seven performance objectives is represented by a vertical axis each of the 961 portfolios is represented by a segmented line that crosses each axis at the level of performance it achieves in that objective where crossing lower on an axis denotes better performance note that april 1 storage is the only maximization objective so even though higher levels of storage are better that is still represented by lower positioning on the axis the portfolio lines are colored based on whether they comply with eldorado s reliability policy grey portfolios are noncompliant and then the number of years they were in level 1 restrictions with dark blue corresponding to zero years at the bottom of the leftmost axis the violins on the axes show portfolio densities to clarify trends in performance that can be obscured due to overlapping lines fig 3b is oriented identically to fig 3a except that there are 13 axes one for each decision lever every portfolio line in fig 3a has a corresponding line in fig 3b that conveys the amounts or levels of all of the decisions within the portfolio the lower a line crosses an axis in fig 3b the less of that decision has been chosen in fig 3a we can see relationships between the objectives color enables us to tell that all of the dark blue portfolios with zero years in level 1 restrictions have medium to high levels of new supply fifth axis from the left medium to high levels of april 1 carryover storage but may have anywhere from 0 2 to 15 4 mcm 200 12 500 af of new storage rightmost axis this means that to minimize years in level 1 restrictions it is imperative that eldorado obtain new water sources but may choose to build or avoid large amounts of new reservoir storage however portfolios that do not build much new storage perform more poorly in april 1 storage and tend to require greater volumes of new supply this shows an important tradeoff within the eldorado model as well as on the front range utilities often have to choose between meeting growing demands with new supplies that come from conservation and other users shares and rights which may be socially and economically disruptive to communities and relying on contentious expensive infrastructure that is difficult to permit filtering the portfolios here through color based on reliability compliance represents non subjective criteria that a utility might use to begin learning how portfolios decision attributes relate to performance working up from the bottom of the wholesaler shares axis in fig 3b we can see that as these increase performance in level 1 restrictions improves the same is true for increasing levels of conservation only green portfolios with three or more years in restrictions plot at the bottom indicating that no conservation was enacted 3 6 2 limitations of heuristic analysis fig 3 was designed to demonstrate the specific points described in the paragraphs below it that is the order of the axes and the use of color supported a narrative this demonstrates a fundamental problem with how many dimensional datasets are presented that is exacerbated by the existence of user preferences shapes colors and data orientation all influence perception of underlying system dynamics visually inspecting the parallel plots revealed useful information about tradeoffs and trends in two decision levers beyond this point in a heuristic analysis an issue arises what is the next move a manager could ask what would happen if the set was filtered to exclude portfolios that have any instances of restrictions another idea would be to exclude from the compliant set any portfolios that build a contentious west slope reservoir or we could try to focus on portfolios that have lower amounts of new storage but the violin in fig 3a shows that there is no natural break point at which to segment the portfolios and thus the differentiation between levels of performance would be subjective the logic effectively applied to the early stages of the heuristic analysis is the result of the authors years of expertise with moea tradeoff sets parallel axis plots and the eldorado utility system not every moea user could do this despite having comfort and experience with the tradeoffs the array of paths we suggested above shows how quickly the analysis can become ambiguous and potentially counterproductive the questions that managers try to answer with the tradeoff set and the order in which they are asked will heavily influence perceptions which could then be difficult to dislodge despite re ordering the conditions on which the results are filtered may be based on preferences that are not shared by all parties involved in a planning process e g minimizing new storage may align with judgements about whether reservoirs are environmentally responsible even if analyses are iterative relying heavily on conflicting preferences to orient filtering may increase users focus on different positions finally because of computational limitations most practical applications of moeas to wrsa problems will require users to cull hydrology however decisions that perform well in one set of potential hydrologic futures may or may not be robust given different conditions when moeas are used for planning under deep uncertainty multiple rounds of optimization can be used to address shortcomings inherent to scenario specific optimization eker and kwakkel 2018 watson and kasprzyk 2017 the issues described above compound when multiple tradeoff sets are generated the list below summarizes the general limitations of using a heuristic approach alone to analyze moea tradeoffs visual representations of many dimensional data involve subjective decisions that can influence perceptions of system dynamics humans are not good at deciphering patterns across many dimensions that could include complex interactions predetermined decision and performance preferences may heavily influence heuristic analyses and prevent users of moea tradeoff sets from seeking or learning fundamental system dynamics different users perceptions of system dynamics resulting from subjective heuristic analyses could exacerbate conflict and without objective information about decision and performance dynamics it is more difficult to draw conclusions when working with multiple tradeoff sets mrts are a simple automated approach to analyzing moea tradeoffs that produce multiple insights simultaneously including them alongside heuristic analyses of tradeoff sets provides a neutral and repeatable foundation that can clarify results and orient additional investigations in the next section we present the results of using mrts for feature selection and describe how their structure and insights can enhance system and tradeoff understanding 4 results we performed two separate optimizations of the eldorado utility case study one for the 1 c perturbed hydrology and one for the 4 c and created an mrt for each set of tradeoffs we first describe the results of an mrt generated from the 1 c perturbed portfolios described in the previous section and follow that discussion with an mrt from a 4 c perturbed optimization generating two trees helps to validate the use of the mrt method on tradeoffs from the eldorado utility case study and enables us to gain additional insights into the system behavior by comparing them 4 1 mrt for 1 c perturbed tradeoff set the plot of cvre vs tree size shown in fig 4 was produced by fitting an mrt to the eldorado utility 1 c perturbed tradeoff set described in section 3 6 we allowed the mrt algorithm to build a large tree based on a cp of 0 001 a very small cp value allowed us to analyze the progression of cvre over the course of many splits the minimum cvre shown here is marked by the red dot though the cvre would likely continue to decrease very slowly as the tree grew and the tree size that corresponds to the min 1se rule is marked in yellow at no point does the cvre start to increase or fully stagnate so choosing the tree size for this data set is more subjective the choice made for this study was to require that in order for a split to occur it must meet an error reduction threshold of at least 1 of the root error so the cp was set to be 0 01 this corresponds to a tree with 14 leaves marked by the vertical dashed line and a maximum tree depth of 5 splits the value was chosen heuristically by balancing simplicity descriptive value and meaningful interpretation of the criterion the next round cp value would be 0 005 and result in an unwieldy 28 leaf tree fig 5 and fig 6 present the left and right branches respectively of the mrt generated from the 961 portfolios in the 1 c perturbed tradeoff set described in section 3 6 we will first orient the reader to the features of the tree and then discuss different approaches to analyzing it at the top of the tree halves in figs 5 and 6 we see that the first split is based on the conservation level incorporated into each portfolio no conservation is consfactor 0 moderate conservation is consfactor 1 and aggressive conservation is consfactor 2 the left branch includes portfolios where consfactor is greater than or equal to 1 5 i e portfolios that have aggressive conservation the number reported is the average between the levels of decision above and below the split as another example following the left branch the next split is on the volume of west slope res to the left are portfolios that have reservoirs up to 6 5 mcm 5300 af and to the right go the portfolios that have reservoir volumes starting at 6 7 mcm 5400 af the granularity of the split value depends on the increment of a decision lever presented in table 2 following splits down to the leaves each leaf has a set of boxplots one for each of the seven objectives denoted by the color and ranges shown in the legend the order of the boxplots is the same as the order in which the objectives were first described which is also their order in fig 3a and like the parallel plots the lower a boxplot is positioned within the plot area the better the performances of the portfolios within the leaf the ev value at the bottom indicates that the tree explains 70 4 of the performance objective variance within the data set 4 1 1 analyzing the tree leaves first our first analysis will start at the leaves consider the ranges of performance for the objectives assert a set of priorities to direct focus on a single leaf and then follow the branches up to the root to see what decision rules produced that leaf for example eldorado utility managers and by extension managers in the front range who were the basis of the eldorado model may want to prioritize reliability related objectives smith et al 2019 given that criteria leaves that have boxplots that are very low with small ranges in the first three objectives blue grey and red would contain portfolios of interest examination of the leaves in figs 5 and 6 shows that there are three that meet that boxplot configuration leaves 1 2 and 6 see fig 5 focusing on leaves 2 and 6 which are superior to leaf 1 in years in level 1 restrictions will help illustrate the value of mrts and connect them to recognizable tradeoffs fig 7 provides a close up comparison of the two sets of boxplots the decision rules that lead to leaf 2 are aggressive conservation a west slope res smaller than 6 6 mcm 5350 af 5 200 or more shares of the ag2 irrigation co and at least 7 of industrial user s water rights none of the portfolios have any incidence of any level of restrictions they have moderate to high volumes of missedopp water a very high range of newsupply the highest range of all the leaves medium high april 1 carryover storage and moderate to low volumes of newstorage despite having zero years in restrictions the april 1 carryover storage objective is not as high i e positioned as low as might be expected because the portfolios within the leaf have relatively low amounts of newstorage as shown in fig 5 and emphasized in fig 7 the path to leaf 6 includes aggressive conservation a west slope res 6 6 mcm 5350 af or larger and at least 6300 ag2 shares the performance ranges in leaf 6 are notably different than in leaf 2 among the portfolios in leaf 6 there is one occurrence of level 1 restrictions and one occurrence of level 2 restrictions moderate volume of missedopp water moderate to high newsupply high to moderate volumes of april 1 carryover storage and high to very high volumes of newstorage incorporating the larger west slope res reduced leaf 6 s reliance on newsupply e g via the industrial rights required in leaf 2 but the portfolios are therefore more likely to have large amounts of newstorage the patterns in these two leaves echo the tradeoff between newsupply and newstorage discussed for the parallel plot in fig 3a the ability to confirm these mrt results with surface level visual analysis provides more confidence in the mrt findings that are harder to deduce heuristically such as the importance of a large amount of ag2shares which shows up in both leaves emphasizing leaves 2 and 6 as superior to others in reliability objectives does not preclude other leaves and other sets of decisions from containing portfolios that match eldorado s performance priorities the leaves simply indicate that after sequentially splitting the portfolios based on all of the relationships within the tradeoff set these particular sets of decision levers are most likely to result in appealing portfolios furthermore the decisions in the paths to highly reliable leaves must still be accompanied by actions in the other decision levers there is just more flexibility in the values for the levers not represented in splits 4 1 2 analyzing the tree root first analyzing the tree starting from the leaves up as described in the previous section is a way of asserting performance preferences and understanding which decisions are likely to lead to good performance starting from the root and working down allows users to understand the impact on performance of decision preferences using the tree branch in fig 6 we can demonstrate the four steps of a path that an eldorado manager might take down the tree if a general policy of new water sources but limited reservoir expansion was preferred 1 at the first split a manager may choose to go to the right because she or he does not want to have to rely on aggressive conservation to meet performance goals 2 at the next split a manager may choose to go left because wholesaler shares are a reliable water source that does not require infrastructure 3 next a manager may go left to avoid a large west slope res because of cost permitting etc 4 finally the manager may go right to see how bad the outcomes could be if no conservation was enacted leaf 11 is the outcome of applying these decision preferences and the boxplots reveal that they will likely result in decent performance in newsupply and newstorage but poor performance in the other objectives this manager would have learned that the combination of decisions in this path will likely result in non preferable performance regardless of the other 10 decisions in the portfolio 4 1 3 reviewing mrt insights the insights gained from mrts would likely have been difficult to obtain through heuristic approaches but they should also be verified because splits are not guaranteed to be meaningful and built upon using different types of analyses one option is to use interactive visual analytics software such as tableau jones 2014 to manually apply mrt splits and further explore portfolios within leaves of interest as each split down a branch is applied to the dataset for example by filtering on decision levers ranges in one or more objectives should shift indicating that the split had meaningful impact fig 8 provides an example by revisiting the parallel plots used in fig 3 fig 8a and b are oriented almost exactly like the plots in fig 3 the only difference is that in this figure color is used to distinguish the set of 27 portfolios from leaf 2 in fig 8a the pattern and ranges of the leaf 2 portfolios performance across the seven objectives matches the boxplots from fig 7a the ranges of consfactor west slope res ag2shares and industrial rights in the decision levers in fig 8b reflect the splits and red dashed axis lines highlight the restricted ranges of those decisions in eight of the remaining nine decision dimensions there is considerable variety in potential values to accompany the constrained decisions the levels of wholesaler shares are almost universally very high though so this decision lever correlated closely with a split based on another decision lever and the large numbers of wholesaler shares are contributing to the preferred performance though they were not explicitly represented in the mrt other types of visualizations such as pair wise scatter plots between individual decisions and objectives or correlation matrices between objectives and decision levers may also be helpful in mrt verification if there are no identifiable relationships between the decision levers represented in splits and one or more objectives users should be cautious in their interpretation of mrt results 4 2 mrt for 4 c perturbed tradeoff set all previous discussions of tradeoffs portfolios and trees have referred to a set of portfolios generated from optimizing for a 1 c warmer future planning in consideration of multiple possible future scenarios is beneficial in and of itself and it also increases the impact of moea based mrts fig 9 and fig 10 present an mrt generated from a set of portfolios optimized for 4 c perturbed hydrology tree size was determined by using the same logic that was described for the 1 c tree in section 4 1 and the 1 error reduction criteria was used again after briefly describing a few features specific to the 4 c tree we discuss findings from comparing the two trees the root error and total number of portfolios are given at the root node of the mrt in figs 9 and 10 splits leaves boxplots colors and objective ranges are all oriented the same as in fig 5 but note that the objective ranges are different this is especially relevant in the first three objectives years in levels of restrictions the more challenging hydrology resulted in more frequent restrictions and fewer portfolios with low incidence of curtailment the ev indicates that the tree explains 71 2 of the performance variance found within the tradeoff set if we repeat the same leaf first exercise from the 1 c tree where we determined that the performance preference was to have minimal years in all three levels of restrictions that criteria reduces viable leaves down to two leaf 1 and leaf 3 from fig 9 the decision path to leaf 1 includes aggressive conservation at least 4060 wholesaler shares a west slope res less than 4 3 mcm 4350 af and at least 7 of industrial users rights the splits for leaf 3 are like leaf 1 aggressive conservation and at least 4060 wholesaler shares but then instead of a small west slope res and a percentage of industrial rights leaf 3 includes a west slope res at least 5 4 mcm 4350 af in volume a comparison of the two leaves shows that they exhibit the same newsupply newstorage tradeoff seen in the 1 c mrt and the original parallel plots of the 1 c tradeoffs as noted for the 1 c tree this agreement the parallel plots and the 4 c tree signals that the mrt is accurately capturing major dynamics while providing more detailed latent information 4 3 comparing mrts comparing the broad characteristics of the two trees provides valuable information first we note that the decisions on which splits occur are very similar across both trees consfactor west slope res and industrial rights are prominent in both trees in the 1 c tree ag2 shares are more important while in the 4 c tree wholesaler shares are more important since wholesaler shares are a western slope source and ag2 shares are eastern slope this may be indicative of a shift in basin yields with warmer temperatures the general agreement in splits suggests that these decisions are the most influential factors in a portfolio in either scenario and this is a fundamental insight about the eldorado system we can expand on this general decision lever agreement by comparing sets of leaves from the two trees first we will compare leaf 2 from the 1 c tree and leaf 1 from the 4 c tree as shown in fig 11 the decisions that lead to these leaves with very similar objective tradeoffs include three nearly identical splits aggressive conservation a medium or smaller west slope res and approximately 7 or more of the industrial rights ag2 shares in 1 c are traded for wholesaler shares in 4 c now compare leaf 6 from the 1 c tree and leaf 3 from the 4 c tree in fig 12 like the previous comparison the patterns of objective performances are similar and they share two almost identical splits aggressive conservation and medium to large west slope res again ag2 shares in 1 c are replaced by wholesaler shares in 4 c the 1 c and 4 c perturbed hydrologies are substantially different in runoff timing magnitude and overall annual hydrograph shape the presence of overlapping decisions across the two hydrologies for two fundamental planning strategies minimizing newstorage in fig 11 vs minimizing newsupply in fig 12 suggests that each strategy corresponds to a set of core decisions and that these decisions are robust to a wide range of futures 5 discussion the previous section focused on interpretation of mrts but we also wish to address larger implications of their use in both wrsa practice and research 5 1 context for incorporating mrts into tradeoff analyses mrts offer an unbiased and repeatable method of using moea tradeoff sets to learn about fundamental system dynamics and gain detailed information about which decisions are likely to have the most impact on system performance while these are valuable contributions an mrt is not a substitute for in depth exploration of a tradeoff set and the information it provides should be combined with system knowledge to ensure accurate interpretation ultimately mrts are a promising tool to orient and enhance other types of tradeoff set analysis all of which require technical skills and expert reflection to use properly 5 2 building on mrt results in practice generating and interpreting mrts can result in fundamental system insights as demonstrated in section 4 but the most important benefits are derived from the different ways that the predictive capabilities of the trees can be used for example once promising leaves are identified managers can build on the core strategies without having to re run an optimization this can facilitate diving into unexplored parts of the decision space or answering policy questions that were not formally posed in the original formulation of the optimization in a computationally efficient manner the trees can also provide quick answers to what if scenarios or emerging contexts such as if a new path is needed because a reservoir does not receive a critical permit or a source of water that was integral to a plan is no longer available the ability of moeas to generate a set of portfolios that have approximately best performance for the many ways that tradeoffs can be balanced does not necessarily imply that the portfolio chosen will ultimately be contained within it portfolios that are not strictly nondominated may be preferred for un modeled reasons the insights gained from nondominated mrts can be used in a targeted exploration of dominated portfolios of interest or mrts could be generated using the full set of portfolios generated by the moea 5 3 future research the findings and limitations of this study suggest several interesting areas of additional wrsa moea research one idea is to use insights from mrts to learn about a problem and constrain a new iteration of the problem formulation to target a specific region of objective performance this would be a new approach to the de novo planning framework demonstrated by kasprzyk et al 2012 the identification of robust decisions across scenarios is also a promising result that warrants structured analysis to develop a framework to guide the use of mrts for this purpose another beneficial direction would be to test mrts on different types of water resources applications e g reservoir operations to determine whether the results are meaningful in non planning contexts we also suggest exploring the efficacy and value of combining different feature selection methods with wrsa tradeoff sets and then assessing whether they are considered useful and usable by practitioners who have used or are interested in employing moeas in their planning processes smith et al 2017 6 conclusion the increasing prevalence of moea studies in wrsa research and practice calls for greater attention to developing tradeoff analysis tools while tradeoff sets are complex and often challenging to analyze heuristically the high dimensionality and large volume of results produced by moeas can be assets when combined with feature selection here we present mrts which relate performance variations within and across multiple objectives to distinct subsets of specific decisions providing users with information about the most consequential decisions and their most productive ranges using the eldorado utility planning model we demonstrated multiple types of analysis that can be performed with mrts starting with the mrt leaves managers may identify groups of portfolios that correspond to their performance priorities and learn which decision splits were critical to arriving at promising leaves alternatively starting at the top of the tree and following decision splits down based on decision preferences provides information about how these preferences impact performance across multiple objectives finally comparing leaves from different trees may shed light on decisions that perform well across multiple futures insights gained from all of these approaches can inform in depth exploration of the tradeoff set and prompt new policy questions mrts are versatile simple to generate and present easily comprehensible insights that may not be apparent during heuristic analyses of tradeoff sets they overcome mostly or entirely the limitations described in this paper the only subjective choice required in the visual representation of the tradeoffs is the order in which performance boxplots are places they find patterns across many dimensions in an objective and repeatable process that eliminates the possibility of interference from user preferences that can skew perceptions and exacerbate conflict and they provide an objective basis on which to compare

26151,this paper presents the use of multivariate regression trees mrts to analyze multiobjective evolutionary algorithm moea tradeoff sets generated from a long term water utility planning problem moeas produce large sets of non dominated solutions where each solution represents an observation of how multiple predictor variables decision levers impact performance in multiple response variables objectives because they explicitly accommodate multiple response variables mrts can preserve the relationships between objectives revealed through moea assisted optimization we generated mrts for two tradeoff sets that resulted from optimizing the eldorado utility planning problem under two climate change scenarios a single mrt helped identify the subset of core planning decisions that led to preferred performance and demonstrated how decision preferences impacted performance in different objectives comparing mrts from two scenarios revealed decisions that performed well across scenarios the systematic and repeatable mrt approach can help water managers understand large high dimensional tradeoff sets and prompt additional promising analyses keywords multivariate regression tree mrt multiobjective evolutionary algorithm moea feature selection long term planning front range colorado 1 introduction many academic studies and recently several real world applications of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms moeas have established the tool s ability to produce innovative solutions and valuable performance information about water resources planning problems csu 2017 maier et al 2014 reed et al 2013 through intelligent search and evaluation of thousands of potential portfolios moeas produce suites of nondominated alternatives that explicitly elucidate relationships between conflicting planning objectives and the complex interactions among decisions that affect those objectives i e tradeoff sets thorough analysis of the information contained in such tradeoff sets generally requires working with hundreds or thousands of solutions and considering many performance and decision characteristics or dimensions simultaneously interpreting this magnitude and complexity of relational information is difficult so it is important to develop tools that facilitate water managers ability to understand causes effects and trends in decisions and performance that are embedded in the results generated by moeas to date water resources systems analysis wrsa research applications of moeas have mostly relied on parallel axis plots and or glyph plots kasprzyk et al 2009 kollat and reed 2007 matrosov et al 2015 smith et al 2016 or cartesian plots mortazavi et al 2012 wu et al 2017 for insights performing relatively subjective assessments on the tradeoffs to frame assertions of different performance priorities subjective explorations are useful for gaining general familiarity with the tradeoffs and identifying individual portfolios of interest but they may not result in insights about the fundamental system dynamics that drive performance the volume of solutions and large numbers of decisions and objectives that make moea tradeoff sets difficult to analyze heuristically also make them good candidates for employing feature selection the process of systematically reducing the dimensionality of a data set by distinguishing the most sensitive features from those that are noisy redundant or irrelevant liu et al 2010 thus identifying fundamental system properties since the 1990s feature selection has been used as a pre processing step to improve subsequent data mining applications in a wide range of fields such as bioinformatics saeys et al 2007 satellite imagery classification jain and zongker 1997 social network exploitation analysis zheleva and getoor 2009 and financial fraud detection ravisankar et al 2011 feature selection has been applied specifically to moea tradeoff sets in a number of fields though the term is not common in such studies in this context various feature selection approaches are presented as the main data mining event not preparation for data mining and used for the purpose of knowledge discovery bandaru et al 2017 provide a thorough review of this literature here we will focus on work that has employed regression trees which are the specific type of feature selection data mining method in which we are interested regression tree models are generated by recursively partitioning data into two mutually exclusive sets in order to sort the data into groups that have similar attributes they are a popular method of feature selection because they are very versatile and easy to interpret the partitioning process does not require or assume any specific distributions within the data and it can uncover hidden structures and interactions between hierarchical and nonlinear variables prasad et al 2006 verbyla 1987 among many predictor variables the method can determine which have the greatest influence on response lawrence and wright 2001 the binary rules are easy to understand for users who do not have expertise in statistics and the tree structure itself is an intuitive way to visualize a model the few studies that have used regression trees to perform feature selection on moea tradeoff sets have been limited to univariate regression trees which relate a single objective response to multiple decision levers predictors sugimura et al 2010 demonstrated regression tree analysis on the design of a centrifugal impeller the case study optimized 2 objectives using 16 design parameters and then generated a regression tree for each objective individually dudas et al 2011 optimized process rules for a 3 objective automotive production line system using 22 variables and like sugimura et al created a separate tree for each objective in another study dudas et al optimized investments in a production line using three objectives and nine decisions this time eliciting a preferred performance region from decision makers and generating trees based on different methods of measuring solutions spatial relationships to the region 2014 while these univariate regression trees provide useful information they either separate or collapse the relationships between the objectives and thus do not capitalize on one of the primary benefits of using an moea the multivariate regression tree mrt was developed to relate predictor variables to multiple response variables while maintaining the individual characteristics of the responses de ath 2002 it originated in the field of ecology and was designed to be able to relate populations of multiple species to a number of independent environmental conditions importantly mrts do not make any assumptions about the underlying relationships between the response variables mrts have been used previously for feature selection for example by questier et al 2005 to analyze how the presence or absence of various chemicals predicts certain types of smells however to our knowledge they have not been applied to feature selection using an moea tradeoff set the versatility of the method i e there is no requirement of any sort of data structure suggests it can be successfully used to analyze the complex dynamics found in such data this study makes two contributions first it builds on previous efforts to perform feature selection on moea tradeoff sets using regression trees by newly applying mrts to the task second it employs feature selection to analyze tradeoff sets generated from optimizing a complex water supply system by applying mrts to a long term water resources planning study performed using the eldorado utility planning model we demonstrate how the method can facilitate and expand on heuristically derived insights by extracting latent information about how specific combinations of decisions impact different types of performance and about which decisions are likely to perform well in a wide range of potential futures such insights may either not be discernable from heuristic analyses alone or the process of discovering them may require applying preferences that are not agreeable to all parties involved in developing a plan in the following section we present information about our methods moea tradeoff sets and regression trees we then give background on the eldorado utility case study used in the optimization next are the regression tree results followed by discussion of their implications for practical applications in water resources planning and also for future research the last section offers concluding remarks 2 methods 2 1 moea tradeoff sets multiobjective evolutionary algorithms moeas are a search technology used to efficiently generate and evaluate alternative solutions to systems whose conflicting performance objectives are impacted by many decisions that exhibit complex interactions reed et al 2013 in the context of long term water supply planning the moea intelligently designs and tests thousands of different combinations or portfolios of decisions such as reservoir sizes and conservation levels to optimize performance in objectives such as maximizing storage reliability and minimizing frequency of water use restrictions when attempting to optimize multiple conflicting objectives improvement in one objective requires sacrificing performance in another so there are tradeoffs during optimization the moea removes from the preferred group any portfolio whose performance is worse than another portfolio in all objectives that is the dominated portfolios are removed the end product of moea assisted optimization is a set of nondominated planning portfolios that quantitatively characterize the performance tradeoffs of a system the nondominated tradeoff set is valuable because it represents the system information learned by the moea as it refines combinations of decision levers to achieve better results in the objectives each portfolio within the moea tradeoff set is an observation of how multiple predictor variables decision levers affect a system s performance in multiple response variables objectives framing the dataset in this way motivates the use of mrts to help extract the relational information contained in the tradeoffs 2 2 multivariate regression trees mrts mrts are an extension of the univariate classification and regression tree cart algorithm breiman et al 1984 trees generated from categorical data are termed classification trees we are working with quantitative data and as such will limit our description to regression trees cart has been used for feature selection in several fields chebrolu et al 2004 gomez chova et al 2003 and also for other data mining purposes in wrsa bryant and lempert 2010 kwakkel and jaxa rozen 2016 for cart the steps and calculations presented below would be performed on values of a single response variable for mrts they are instead applied to the geometric centroid defined by the summed euclidian distances to the means of all response variables to convert from mrt to cart one only needs to remove the innermost summation from equations 1 through 3 found in section 2 2 1 note that because objectives incorporated into moea optimization often measure very different types of quantities all objective values need to be scaled before an mrt is generated to prevent objectives with large units and ranges from dominating the splitting this preserves the equal weighting of objectives which is a core concept that underpins the value of moeas though there are several ways of standardizing or normalizing data we recommend scaling the observations for each objective to a range of 0 1 because this approach does not distort within objective distribution or across objective relationships decision lever values do not need to be scaled 2 2 1 mrt algorithm the steps of the mrt algorithm will be presented in terms of an moea tradeoff set portfolios are observations decision variables are the predictors and objectives are the responses a calculate the error of the full data set at the root node 1 e r o o t i 1 n j 1 j y i j y j n 2 where n is the number of portfolios in the tradeoff set j is the number of objectives y i j is a portfolio s value of objective j and y n is the mean of all values of objective j b for every split between values in every decision lever sum the error impurity within and across each of the two child nodes that would result from splitting the data by that decision lever value 2 ε s p l i t k 1 2 i 1 n j 1 j y i j k y j k 2 where y i j k is a portfolio s value of objective j y j k is the child node s mean value of objective j k is the child node formed by the split and n is the number of observations in child node k c split the parent node using the decision lever and value from step b that resulted in the smallest value of ε s p l i t d repeat steps b and c for each child node until a user specified stopping criterion is met when the criterion is met splitting terminates and a node becomes a leaf stopping criterion determines the number of leaves i e the size of the tree within leaf error is defined as 3 ε l e a f i 1 n j 1 j y i j k y j k 2 the explanatory power of a tree is traditionally captured by its relative error this value represents how much of the root error was not resolved by sorting the portfolios via recursive splits in decision variables 4 r e t r e e l 1 l ε l e a f e r o o t where l is the total number of leaves on the tree y i j l is a portfolio s value of objective j y j l is the leaf s mean value of objective j and n is the number of observations in leaf l though it offers the same technical information as relative tree error we propose use of the complementary explained variance quantity cannon 2012 to summarize the overall explanatory power of the tree 5 e v 1 r e t r e e 100 focusing on minimizing error is a misleading characterization in terms of understanding the tree s value as such ev will be reported for mrts in this study 2 2 2 cross validation the cross validation technique commonly used when generating mrts which is also used in this study is 10 fold cross validation for each fold a model is trained on 90 of the data and tested by calculating the r e t r e e that results once the withheld 10 are placed in their respective leaves the average of the 10 r e t r e e values is reported back as the cross validated relative error cvre this process is undertaken for every potential size of tree to enable comparison between r e t r e e and cvre which can guide users in determining optimal tree size 2 2 3 mrt selection in any statistical modeling application steps must be taken to ensure that the model appropriately represents the underlying data to the extent that the method can do so meaningfully for regression trees it is also important to ensure that the structure of the tree is understandable for users so the most appropriate tree will need to balance descriptive power and interpretability this can be achieved by using standard cross validation procedures and or knowledge of the data to prune the tree murphy 2012 one common way of determining the best tree is by examining the progression of its cvre as size increases if cvre stagnates or starts to increase the model is said to be overfit there is no gain or potentially a loss of explanatory power as the tree increases in complexity in such cases a rule of thumb proposed by breiman et al 1984 is to choose the smallest tree that achieves the minimum cvre plus one standard error the min 1se rule however not all data sets exhibit divergent error behavior other approaches to determining appropriate tree size include requiring a minimum number of observations per node defining the minimum amount of error reduction that must be met for a split to proceed and pre specifying tree size or depth 2 2 4 example mrt to preview the conceptual and visual results of generating an mrt we present a simple example problem and tree the water utility for a growing city has two objectives to minimize frequency of imposing annual water use restrictions on customers and also minimize the amount of expensive and environmentally disruptive new storage it has to build to meet increasing demands the decision levers available to the city are to build or not build a reservoir with up to 100 million cubic meter mcm of capacity and to enact or not enact conservation measures that would reduce demand by 20 a binary decision 0 no conservation 1 conservation enacted fig 1 represents how an mrt generated for this problem might look the mrt has two splits and three leaves each leaf is comprised of a set of portfolios whose range of performance in each of the two planning objectives is characterized by a boxplot at the root the boxplot for each objective would span the entire plotting range included in fig 1 for demonstration purposes each of the three leaves has a different configuration of performance tradeoffs across the two objectives because the mrt divides the tradeoff set such that the variance in performance is reduced in one or more objectives the mrt shows how many portfolios are in each leaf and the error remaining within each leaf calculated as the summed differences between each portfolio s actual performances in each objective compared to the mean performances in each objective of all in leaf portfolios see equation 3 while error is appropriate in terms of the quantity calculated it is actually just an indication of spread around the means and does not indicate that portfolios are incorrectly placed in the leaf leaves with larger numbers of portfolios tend to have higher error because there are more errors to sum and leaves with a large distribution of performance in one or more objectives i e large boxplot ranges will also have higher in leaf error leaf 1 has the fewest portfolios and tightest ranges so in leaf error is smallest leaf 3 has the most portfolios and larger ranges for both objectives so it has higher error the branches of the tree are formed by splitting the portfolios based on their values of the two decision levers the first split is based on reservoir size this indicates that reservoir size explains the most variance across all objectives leaf 1 shows that the larger reservoirs require larger volume of new storage as indicated by the height of the teal boxplot and also that a larger reservoir will result in relatively fewer years of restrictions as indicated by the low placement of the light purple boxplot portfolios with reservoirs less than 50 mcm in capacity the right hand tree branch are further split based on whether conservation was enacted and that distinction leads to two different ranges for years in restriction as indicated by the different heights of the light purple boxplots in leaves 2 and 3 the ev value at the bottom of the plot indicates how well the tree was able to organize the set of portfolios into groups of similar performance characteristics this tree was able to explain 75 of the variance using two splits the sum of error across leaves is 25 and the root error is 100 there is no threshold of ev that indicates whether a tree is valid or useful if a user sees value in the percentage of variance explained then the tree is valuable assuming the tree was appropriately pruned using cross validation criteria and problem knowledge furthermore it would not actually be desirable to generate a tree that explained 100 of the variance for two reasons it would be unwieldy and it would eliminate the opportunity to use human reasoning to explore flexibility in the decision space as opposed to relying on the mrt algorithm to exhaustively organize the portfolios 2 2 5 analyzing mrts applications of mrts in other fields are often motivated by understanding how things co occur which focuses on the relative relationships of response variables generally species of plants or animals within and across mrt leaves e g two species may be very prominent in leaves characterized by certain environmental conditions but rarely found in others so they are likely to be found together davidson et al 2010 de ath 2002 herzschuh and birks 2010 larsen and speckman 2004 in this context studies often examine population composition at each split in the mrt to identify the species that are most influential in each partition and also perform within leaf calculations to determine indicator species another common use of mrts is to use splits to delineate geographic regions either using latitude and longitude directly or via climate or ecosystem variables that can be mapped cannon 2012 hamann et al 2011 salonen et al 2012 the first type of application is very leaves focused and the second type gains most information from the splits a major difference between using mrts to explain population composition or climate effects vs applying them to moea tradeoff sets is that moea tradeoff sets exist to facilitate the elucidation and navigation of preferences users have values that determine which performance tradeoffs are acceptable and also have opinions about the decisions that comprise a portfolio this suggests two approaches to analyzing mrts generated from moea tradeoffs that are valuable because of the ability to navigate relationships between leaves and splits objectives and decisions iteratively 2 2 5 1 leaves first analysis after visual inspection of all leaves users will be able to identify a subset that represent preferred patterns of performance tradeoffs and then review the splits portfolio decisions that led to the leaf referring back to fig 1 a user that values minimization of water use restrictions far more than avoidance of building new storage would focus on leaf 1 once leaf 1 is identified the user would learn that reaching the leaf requires at least a 50 mcm reservoir 2 2 5 2 root first analysis without the benefit of moea tradeoff sets to facilitate in depth discussion of performance tradeoffs water utilities typically focus on decision preferences when crafting portfolios to test during long term planning studies smith et al 2018 in this paradigm an mrt user would start at the root of the tree and at each split determine the preferred value of a decision following decision preferences down the tree to one or more leaves would reveal how decision preferences affect performance tradeoffs and potentially help users see where compromises are needed to avoid unacceptable performance the mrt in fig 1 would demonstrate to a user that if they wanted to avoid a large reservoir right branch and not enact conservation right branch they could expect relatively frequent incidence of water use restrictions this likely would not be considered desirable 2 2 6 software this study used the mvpart r package de ath 2014 2002 r core team 2016 which is archived but still functional its primary function executes the algorithm described in section 2 2 1 and the most important parameters are those that control cross validation and the complexity parameter cp the stopping criterion that defines the amount of error reduction that must be achieved by a split to continue growing the tree we note our settings in the results section the only functionality we altered was the standard plotting included with the package mvpart generates a set of bar plots for the mean objective values at each leaf but we replaced the bars with boxplots to give more information the repository of data packages and code necessary to reproduce this study s results can be found in the acknowledgements 3 case study 3 1 front range colorado the front range of colorado is an urban corridor on the eastern slope of the rocky mountains that encompasses several mid sized cities and many smaller communities water providers in the region rely heavily on runoff from highly variable annual mountain snowpack so storage is critical for weathering intra and interannual water supply fluctuations doesken 2014 rajagopalan et al 2009 the long term impact that climate change will have on colorado s hydrology is unclear temperatures are expected to continue increasing but precipitation could increase or decrease lukas et al 2014 however despite the possibility of increased precipitation there is likely to be less water in the future due to the dominance of higher temperatures udall and overpeck 2017 woodbury et al 2012 in addition to the natural supply variability and uncertainty from climate change the front range is experiencing the compounding challenge of rapid population growth the regional population is projected to increase by 40 by 2050 state of colorado 2017 water management in colorado is further complicated by the prior appropriation doctrine a legal framework that bases the succession of streamflow access on date of first use first in time first in right hobbs 2004 farmers and energy companies own the vast majority of senior water rights in the state and by 1900 most of the water in eastern slope rivers was fully appropriated eschner et al 1983 this means that as cities grew they collected a mixture of supplies from multiple locations including the western slope of the rockies by acquiring junior streamflow diversion rights building junior reservoirs buying senior diversion rights from agriculture or buying shares in other water companies all long term utility planning involves making many decisions and balancing conflicting objectives on the front range these inherent difficulties are exacerbated by rapidly increasing demand highly uncertain impacts of climate change complex regulations and contentious social and environmental issues this context is the basis of our moea case study briefly described in the next section 3 2 eldorado utility planning model the eldorado utility planning model was designed based on input from 11 front range water managers to generically capture important regional management features and challenges smith et al 2017 it encompasses the region surrounding a small municipal water provider called the eldorado utility eldorado is located on the eastern slope of a mountain range along with eight other water users that directly compete with the utility to divert and store water eldorado has mostly junior diversion rights junior storage rights in two reservoirs that it owns and also has shares in a water wholesale company that it takes out of a reservoir owned by that entity one of eldorado s diversion rights comes from the western slope where an additional four users impede the utility s access to water the model incorporates a wide range of water rights dates to capture the temporal complexity created by prior appropriation it also has great spatial complexity to reflect the fact that in colorado water is constantly being diverted from and returned to the stream overall there are five distinct basins in the model each with a streamflow input site at its headwaters the model was designed such that under historic hydrology eldorado s existing system and sources could meet 100 of current demands with only rare need for restrictions different future streamflow scenarios that alter timing and volume of streamflow require the utility to take action in order to meet growing demands these scenarios and demands are described in section 3 4 for more detailed model and optimization information refer to smith et al 2018 the eldorado utility planning model was built using the riverware modeling software zagona et al 2001 riverware s advanced capabilities facilitated our use of prior appropriation water allocation and enabled us to manage ownership of water through its accounting functionality the model uses over 150 custom rules to operate the intricate relationships between objects users and accounts and is an example of the kind of complex decision support system that many utilities have incorporated into their planning labadie 2004 3 3 problem formulation the problem formulation includes 13 decision levers and 7 objectives which are briefly described here 3 3 1 decision levers eldorado utility has a total of 13 decision levers available to enable it to meet growing demands with potentially more challenging streamflow conditions some increase the system s operational flexibility some involve acquiring or freeing up water and some develop new storage they are briefly described below and summarized in table 2 where applicable lever descriptions include a reference to the relevant user in fig 2 3 3 1 1 enhancing operations certain water sources in colorado are reusable cities carefully monitor their return flows from unconsumed water so that they can re divert reusable return flows to meet demands this is only possible by legally acquiring the right to exchange the water from downstream to upstream and only works well with strategic storage options three levers help eldorado take advantage of reusable return flows exchange determines whether the legal right is acquired to store reusable water in a reservoir owned by eldorado leasevol xres determines the amount of dedicated exchange storage space eldorado rent in the external res xr and lease ag2res determines whether eldorado is allowed to use available space in ag2 irrigation co res a2r to store reusable water 3 3 1 2 increasing supply there are three ways that eldorado can gain access to new supplies the utility can acquire portions of water rights of other users in the model it can buy shares of water companies in the model and it can create water through conservation or increasing distribution efficiency eldorado may purchase up to 20 of the rights of ag3 user ag3 rights ag3 and industrial user ind rights industrial ag3 rights are very senior and may be stored but are not available year round industrial rights are mid seniority and must be directly diverted from the stream but are available year round eldorado may buy shares from either wholesaler ws1 ws2 shares wholesaler or ag2 irrigation co a2r shares ag2 through shares interruptible the utility may also execute a contract for access to a2r shares that is triggered when eldorado s storage is severely depleted acquiring water from any of these sources will draw water away from regional agriculture and industry and potentially disrupt those communities finally eldorado may enact none moderate or aggressive conservation measures consfactor or increase distribution efficiency disteff by up to 3 3 3 1 3 building storage there are three opportunities for eldorado to increase the amount of storage it owns the utility may expand the existing south res sr to help store both existing and new eastern slope and western slope water expandvol southres eldorado can build a new west slope res wsr to store its existing western slope diversion right buildvol westsloperes this is a very challenging proposition because of regulatory social and environmental considerations lastly the utility can develop gravel pits gp downstream of its return point to capture reusable flows gp 3 3 2 objectives brief qualitative descriptions of the seven objectives are given below for further detail and equations please refer to the appendix the first three objectives restlev1 restlev2 and restlev3 seek to minimize the total number of years within the 25 year simulation that eldorado goes into three restriction levels of increasing intensity to comply with eldorado s current reliability policy the utility can only go into each level 5 1 and 0 years out of 25 respectively the fourth objective missedopp minimizes the average annual volume of water that the utility misses i e when timing of demand or availability of storage space prevent eldorado from capitalizing on the full amount of its water rights optimizing how efficiently eldorado uses the water it has helps prevent wasteful acquisitions objective five new supply seeks to minimize the average annual volume of water eldorado uses from new sources though the utility does need to acquire or create new water to meet growing demands they do not want to take more than they need for future water security the sixth objective april1storage maximizes carryover storage of the lowest storage to annual demand percentage recorded during the 25 year simulation april 1 is the approximate date when reservoirs would be at their lowest levels before spring runoff begins to fill them again and is a measure of carry over storage compared with the restrictions based objectives this captures a longer term reliability signal because it evaluates performance based on the worst performing year of the simulation finally newstorage minimizes the volume of newly built storage within each portfolio because storage is difficult to permit and socially and environmentally contentious eldorado seeks to carefully consider the number and size of storage projects it pursues the combination of this and the newsupply objective provide a cost like signal and allow the utility to consider planning policy on a broader level smith et al 2018 3 4 scenarios the optimization runs using the eldorado utility planning model assumed a buildout demand based on 40 population increase by 2050 state of colorado 2017 when the simulation time horizon starts the demands exhibit single family residential patterns i e use increases substantially during summer months when lawns are irrigated the irrigation demands go up slightly during dry years and are affected by conservation and distribution efficiency levers but the baseline population demand does not change throughout the simulation because future streamflow in colorado is highly uncertain the set of studies associated with this model use several hydrologic scenarios the scenarios relevant to this article are the 1 c and 4 c warmer futures which were chosen based on a front range climate change study woodbury et al 2012 the perturbed hydrology used monthly changes i e deltas from that study and generated sets of stochastic headwater streamflow the stochastic simulation first generates annual streamflow timeseries using a knn resampling approach lall and sharma 1996 which are disaggregated to monthly flows using the proportional disaggregation method of nowak et al 2010 the monthly deltas from for the warming scenario from woodbury et al 2012 are then applied 3 5 optimization implementation we used the borg moea for this study hadka and reed 2013 which tests have shown to perform similarly or favorably compared to other state of the art algorithms on difficult benchmark problems reed et al 2013 zatarain salazar et al 2016 the eldorado utility planning model embedded in the search loop simulates the supply and usage dynamics of eldorado utility and other regional water users over 25 years from 2050 to 2075 at a monthly timestep portfolios were tested as fully implemented configurations of eldorado s system performance of each portfolio was evaluated across ten hydrologic traces each distributed to a separate computing core of an amazon web services elastic compute cloud ec2 instance mathew and varia 2019 each distributed simulation took approximately 20 s this relatively long simulation time prompted us to limit search to 5 000 function evaluations though this number of evaluations is lower than that of many other moea studies the resulting tradeoff set is sufficiently large and diverse to demonstrate the mrt method we used the default borg settings except for changing initial population size from 100 to 50 3 6 heuristic analysis of eldorado optimization tradeoffs 3 6 1 sample analysis using parallel axis plots fig 3 presents a set of eldorado pareto optimal portfolios from a 1 c perturbed optimization run we will use the set to facilitate readers understanding of moea tradeoff sets and describe how the eldorado utility planning model captures front range colorado water management tradeoffs the figure also offers an opportunity to demonstrate the challenge of heuristically analyzing the results of moea assisted optimization the performance and decision tradeoffs of the set of 961 portfolios are presented using parallel axis plots which are a visual analytics technique commonly used in multiobjective optimization studies herman et al 2014 kasprzyk et al 2013 watson and kasprzyk 2017 in fig 3a each of the seven performance objectives is represented by a vertical axis each of the 961 portfolios is represented by a segmented line that crosses each axis at the level of performance it achieves in that objective where crossing lower on an axis denotes better performance note that april 1 storage is the only maximization objective so even though higher levels of storage are better that is still represented by lower positioning on the axis the portfolio lines are colored based on whether they comply with eldorado s reliability policy grey portfolios are noncompliant and then the number of years they were in level 1 restrictions with dark blue corresponding to zero years at the bottom of the leftmost axis the violins on the axes show portfolio densities to clarify trends in performance that can be obscured due to overlapping lines fig 3b is oriented identically to fig 3a except that there are 13 axes one for each decision lever every portfolio line in fig 3a has a corresponding line in fig 3b that conveys the amounts or levels of all of the decisions within the portfolio the lower a line crosses an axis in fig 3b the less of that decision has been chosen in fig 3a we can see relationships between the objectives color enables us to tell that all of the dark blue portfolios with zero years in level 1 restrictions have medium to high levels of new supply fifth axis from the left medium to high levels of april 1 carryover storage but may have anywhere from 0 2 to 15 4 mcm 200 12 500 af of new storage rightmost axis this means that to minimize years in level 1 restrictions it is imperative that eldorado obtain new water sources but may choose to build or avoid large amounts of new reservoir storage however portfolios that do not build much new storage perform more poorly in april 1 storage and tend to require greater volumes of new supply this shows an important tradeoff within the eldorado model as well as on the front range utilities often have to choose between meeting growing demands with new supplies that come from conservation and other users shares and rights which may be socially and economically disruptive to communities and relying on contentious expensive infrastructure that is difficult to permit filtering the portfolios here through color based on reliability compliance represents non subjective criteria that a utility might use to begin learning how portfolios decision attributes relate to performance working up from the bottom of the wholesaler shares axis in fig 3b we can see that as these increase performance in level 1 restrictions improves the same is true for increasing levels of conservation only green portfolios with three or more years in restrictions plot at the bottom indicating that no conservation was enacted 3 6 2 limitations of heuristic analysis fig 3 was designed to demonstrate the specific points described in the paragraphs below it that is the order of the axes and the use of color supported a narrative this demonstrates a fundamental problem with how many dimensional datasets are presented that is exacerbated by the existence of user preferences shapes colors and data orientation all influence perception of underlying system dynamics visually inspecting the parallel plots revealed useful information about tradeoffs and trends in two decision levers beyond this point in a heuristic analysis an issue arises what is the next move a manager could ask what would happen if the set was filtered to exclude portfolios that have any instances of restrictions another idea would be to exclude from the compliant set any portfolios that build a contentious west slope reservoir or we could try to focus on portfolios that have lower amounts of new storage but the violin in fig 3a shows that there is no natural break point at which to segment the portfolios and thus the differentiation between levels of performance would be subjective the logic effectively applied to the early stages of the heuristic analysis is the result of the authors years of expertise with moea tradeoff sets parallel axis plots and the eldorado utility system not every moea user could do this despite having comfort and experience with the tradeoffs the array of paths we suggested above shows how quickly the analysis can become ambiguous and potentially counterproductive the questions that managers try to answer with the tradeoff set and the order in which they are asked will heavily influence perceptions which could then be difficult to dislodge despite re ordering the conditions on which the results are filtered may be based on preferences that are not shared by all parties involved in a planning process e g minimizing new storage may align with judgements about whether reservoirs are environmentally responsible even if analyses are iterative relying heavily on conflicting preferences to orient filtering may increase users focus on different positions finally because of computational limitations most practical applications of moeas to wrsa problems will require users to cull hydrology however decisions that perform well in one set of potential hydrologic futures may or may not be robust given different conditions when moeas are used for planning under deep uncertainty multiple rounds of optimization can be used to address shortcomings inherent to scenario specific optimization eker and kwakkel 2018 watson and kasprzyk 2017 the issues described above compound when multiple tradeoff sets are generated the list below summarizes the general limitations of using a heuristic approach alone to analyze moea tradeoffs visual representations of many dimensional data involve subjective decisions that can influence perceptions of system dynamics humans are not good at deciphering patterns across many dimensions that could include complex interactions predetermined decision and performance preferences may heavily influence heuristic analyses and prevent users of moea tradeoff sets from seeking or learning fundamental system dynamics different users perceptions of system dynamics resulting from subjective heuristic analyses could exacerbate conflict and without objective information about decision and performance dynamics it is more difficult to draw conclusions when working with multiple tradeoff sets mrts are a simple automated approach to analyzing moea tradeoffs that produce multiple insights simultaneously including them alongside heuristic analyses of tradeoff sets provides a neutral and repeatable foundation that can clarify results and orient additional investigations in the next section we present the results of using mrts for feature selection and describe how their structure and insights can enhance system and tradeoff understanding 4 results we performed two separate optimizations of the eldorado utility case study one for the 1 c perturbed hydrology and one for the 4 c and created an mrt for each set of tradeoffs we first describe the results of an mrt generated from the 1 c perturbed portfolios described in the previous section and follow that discussion with an mrt from a 4 c perturbed optimization generating two trees helps to validate the use of the mrt method on tradeoffs from the eldorado utility case study and enables us to gain additional insights into the system behavior by comparing them 4 1 mrt for 1 c perturbed tradeoff set the plot of cvre vs tree size shown in fig 4 was produced by fitting an mrt to the eldorado utility 1 c perturbed tradeoff set described in section 3 6 we allowed the mrt algorithm to build a large tree based on a cp of 0 001 a very small cp value allowed us to analyze the progression of cvre over the course of many splits the minimum cvre shown here is marked by the red dot though the cvre would likely continue to decrease very slowly as the tree grew and the tree size that corresponds to the min 1se rule is marked in yellow at no point does the cvre start to increase or fully stagnate so choosing the tree size for this data set is more subjective the choice made for this study was to require that in order for a split to occur it must meet an error reduction threshold of at least 1 of the root error so the cp was set to be 0 01 this corresponds to a tree with 14 leaves marked by the vertical dashed line and a maximum tree depth of 5 splits the value was chosen heuristically by balancing simplicity descriptive value and meaningful interpretation of the criterion the next round cp value would be 0 005 and result in an unwieldy 28 leaf tree fig 5 and fig 6 present the left and right branches respectively of the mrt generated from the 961 portfolios in the 1 c perturbed tradeoff set described in section 3 6 we will first orient the reader to the features of the tree and then discuss different approaches to analyzing it at the top of the tree halves in figs 5 and 6 we see that the first split is based on the conservation level incorporated into each portfolio no conservation is consfactor 0 moderate conservation is consfactor 1 and aggressive conservation is consfactor 2 the left branch includes portfolios where consfactor is greater than or equal to 1 5 i e portfolios that have aggressive conservation the number reported is the average between the levels of decision above and below the split as another example following the left branch the next split is on the volume of west slope res to the left are portfolios that have reservoirs up to 6 5 mcm 5300 af and to the right go the portfolios that have reservoir volumes starting at 6 7 mcm 5400 af the granularity of the split value depends on the increment of a decision lever presented in table 2 following splits down to the leaves each leaf has a set of boxplots one for each of the seven objectives denoted by the color and ranges shown in the legend the order of the boxplots is the same as the order in which the objectives were first described which is also their order in fig 3a and like the parallel plots the lower a boxplot is positioned within the plot area the better the performances of the portfolios within the leaf the ev value at the bottom indicates that the tree explains 70 4 of the performance objective variance within the data set 4 1 1 analyzing the tree leaves first our first analysis will start at the leaves consider the ranges of performance for the objectives assert a set of priorities to direct focus on a single leaf and then follow the branches up to the root to see what decision rules produced that leaf for example eldorado utility managers and by extension managers in the front range who were the basis of the eldorado model may want to prioritize reliability related objectives smith et al 2019 given that criteria leaves that have boxplots that are very low with small ranges in the first three objectives blue grey and red would contain portfolios of interest examination of the leaves in figs 5 and 6 shows that there are three that meet that boxplot configuration leaves 1 2 and 6 see fig 5 focusing on leaves 2 and 6 which are superior to leaf 1 in years in level 1 restrictions will help illustrate the value of mrts and connect them to recognizable tradeoffs fig 7 provides a close up comparison of the two sets of boxplots the decision rules that lead to leaf 2 are aggressive conservation a west slope res smaller than 6 6 mcm 5350 af 5 200 or more shares of the ag2 irrigation co and at least 7 of industrial user s water rights none of the portfolios have any incidence of any level of restrictions they have moderate to high volumes of missedopp water a very high range of newsupply the highest range of all the leaves medium high april 1 carryover storage and moderate to low volumes of newstorage despite having zero years in restrictions the april 1 carryover storage objective is not as high i e positioned as low as might be expected because the portfolios within the leaf have relatively low amounts of newstorage as shown in fig 5 and emphasized in fig 7 the path to leaf 6 includes aggressive conservation a west slope res 6 6 mcm 5350 af or larger and at least 6300 ag2 shares the performance ranges in leaf 6 are notably different than in leaf 2 among the portfolios in leaf 6 there is one occurrence of level 1 restrictions and one occurrence of level 2 restrictions moderate volume of missedopp water moderate to high newsupply high to moderate volumes of april 1 carryover storage and high to very high volumes of newstorage incorporating the larger west slope res reduced leaf 6 s reliance on newsupply e g via the industrial rights required in leaf 2 but the portfolios are therefore more likely to have large amounts of newstorage the patterns in these two leaves echo the tradeoff between newsupply and newstorage discussed for the parallel plot in fig 3a the ability to confirm these mrt results with surface level visual analysis provides more confidence in the mrt findings that are harder to deduce heuristically such as the importance of a large amount of ag2shares which shows up in both leaves emphasizing leaves 2 and 6 as superior to others in reliability objectives does not preclude other leaves and other sets of decisions from containing portfolios that match eldorado s performance priorities the leaves simply indicate that after sequentially splitting the portfolios based on all of the relationships within the tradeoff set these particular sets of decision levers are most likely to result in appealing portfolios furthermore the decisions in the paths to highly reliable leaves must still be accompanied by actions in the other decision levers there is just more flexibility in the values for the levers not represented in splits 4 1 2 analyzing the tree root first analyzing the tree starting from the leaves up as described in the previous section is a way of asserting performance preferences and understanding which decisions are likely to lead to good performance starting from the root and working down allows users to understand the impact on performance of decision preferences using the tree branch in fig 6 we can demonstrate the four steps of a path that an eldorado manager might take down the tree if a general policy of new water sources but limited reservoir expansion was preferred 1 at the first split a manager may choose to go to the right because she or he does not want to have to rely on aggressive conservation to meet performance goals 2 at the next split a manager may choose to go left because wholesaler shares are a reliable water source that does not require infrastructure 3 next a manager may go left to avoid a large west slope res because of cost permitting etc 4 finally the manager may go right to see how bad the outcomes could be if no conservation was enacted leaf 11 is the outcome of applying these decision preferences and the boxplots reveal that they will likely result in decent performance in newsupply and newstorage but poor performance in the other objectives this manager would have learned that the combination of decisions in this path will likely result in non preferable performance regardless of the other 10 decisions in the portfolio 4 1 3 reviewing mrt insights the insights gained from mrts would likely have been difficult to obtain through heuristic approaches but they should also be verified because splits are not guaranteed to be meaningful and built upon using different types of analyses one option is to use interactive visual analytics software such as tableau jones 2014 to manually apply mrt splits and further explore portfolios within leaves of interest as each split down a branch is applied to the dataset for example by filtering on decision levers ranges in one or more objectives should shift indicating that the split had meaningful impact fig 8 provides an example by revisiting the parallel plots used in fig 3 fig 8a and b are oriented almost exactly like the plots in fig 3 the only difference is that in this figure color is used to distinguish the set of 27 portfolios from leaf 2 in fig 8a the pattern and ranges of the leaf 2 portfolios performance across the seven objectives matches the boxplots from fig 7a the ranges of consfactor west slope res ag2shares and industrial rights in the decision levers in fig 8b reflect the splits and red dashed axis lines highlight the restricted ranges of those decisions in eight of the remaining nine decision dimensions there is considerable variety in potential values to accompany the constrained decisions the levels of wholesaler shares are almost universally very high though so this decision lever correlated closely with a split based on another decision lever and the large numbers of wholesaler shares are contributing to the preferred performance though they were not explicitly represented in the mrt other types of visualizations such as pair wise scatter plots between individual decisions and objectives or correlation matrices between objectives and decision levers may also be helpful in mrt verification if there are no identifiable relationships between the decision levers represented in splits and one or more objectives users should be cautious in their interpretation of mrt results 4 2 mrt for 4 c perturbed tradeoff set all previous discussions of tradeoffs portfolios and trees have referred to a set of portfolios generated from optimizing for a 1 c warmer future planning in consideration of multiple possible future scenarios is beneficial in and of itself and it also increases the impact of moea based mrts fig 9 and fig 10 present an mrt generated from a set of portfolios optimized for 4 c perturbed hydrology tree size was determined by using the same logic that was described for the 1 c tree in section 4 1 and the 1 error reduction criteria was used again after briefly describing a few features specific to the 4 c tree we discuss findings from comparing the two trees the root error and total number of portfolios are given at the root node of the mrt in figs 9 and 10 splits leaves boxplots colors and objective ranges are all oriented the same as in fig 5 but note that the objective ranges are different this is especially relevant in the first three objectives years in levels of restrictions the more challenging hydrology resulted in more frequent restrictions and fewer portfolios with low incidence of curtailment the ev indicates that the tree explains 71 2 of the performance variance found within the tradeoff set if we repeat the same leaf first exercise from the 1 c tree where we determined that the performance preference was to have minimal years in all three levels of restrictions that criteria reduces viable leaves down to two leaf 1 and leaf 3 from fig 9 the decision path to leaf 1 includes aggressive conservation at least 4060 wholesaler shares a west slope res less than 4 3 mcm 4350 af and at least 7 of industrial users rights the splits for leaf 3 are like leaf 1 aggressive conservation and at least 4060 wholesaler shares but then instead of a small west slope res and a percentage of industrial rights leaf 3 includes a west slope res at least 5 4 mcm 4350 af in volume a comparison of the two leaves shows that they exhibit the same newsupply newstorage tradeoff seen in the 1 c mrt and the original parallel plots of the 1 c tradeoffs as noted for the 1 c tree this agreement the parallel plots and the 4 c tree signals that the mrt is accurately capturing major dynamics while providing more detailed latent information 4 3 comparing mrts comparing the broad characteristics of the two trees provides valuable information first we note that the decisions on which splits occur are very similar across both trees consfactor west slope res and industrial rights are prominent in both trees in the 1 c tree ag2 shares are more important while in the 4 c tree wholesaler shares are more important since wholesaler shares are a western slope source and ag2 shares are eastern slope this may be indicative of a shift in basin yields with warmer temperatures the general agreement in splits suggests that these decisions are the most influential factors in a portfolio in either scenario and this is a fundamental insight about the eldorado system we can expand on this general decision lever agreement by comparing sets of leaves from the two trees first we will compare leaf 2 from the 1 c tree and leaf 1 from the 4 c tree as shown in fig 11 the decisions that lead to these leaves with very similar objective tradeoffs include three nearly identical splits aggressive conservation a medium or smaller west slope res and approximately 7 or more of the industrial rights ag2 shares in 1 c are traded for wholesaler shares in 4 c now compare leaf 6 from the 1 c tree and leaf 3 from the 4 c tree in fig 12 like the previous comparison the patterns of objective performances are similar and they share two almost identical splits aggressive conservation and medium to large west slope res again ag2 shares in 1 c are replaced by wholesaler shares in 4 c the 1 c and 4 c perturbed hydrologies are substantially different in runoff timing magnitude and overall annual hydrograph shape the presence of overlapping decisions across the two hydrologies for two fundamental planning strategies minimizing newstorage in fig 11 vs minimizing newsupply in fig 12 suggests that each strategy corresponds to a set of core decisions and that these decisions are robust to a wide range of futures 5 discussion the previous section focused on interpretation of mrts but we also wish to address larger implications of their use in both wrsa practice and research 5 1 context for incorporating mrts into tradeoff analyses mrts offer an unbiased and repeatable method of using moea tradeoff sets to learn about fundamental system dynamics and gain detailed information about which decisions are likely to have the most impact on system performance while these are valuable contributions an mrt is not a substitute for in depth exploration of a tradeoff set and the information it provides should be combined with system knowledge to ensure accurate interpretation ultimately mrts are a promising tool to orient and enhance other types of tradeoff set analysis all of which require technical skills and expert reflection to use properly 5 2 building on mrt results in practice generating and interpreting mrts can result in fundamental system insights as demonstrated in section 4 but the most important benefits are derived from the different ways that the predictive capabilities of the trees can be used for example once promising leaves are identified managers can build on the core strategies without having to re run an optimization this can facilitate diving into unexplored parts of the decision space or answering policy questions that were not formally posed in the original formulation of the optimization in a computationally efficient manner the trees can also provide quick answers to what if scenarios or emerging contexts such as if a new path is needed because a reservoir does not receive a critical permit or a source of water that was integral to a plan is no longer available the ability of moeas to generate a set of portfolios that have approximately best performance for the many ways that tradeoffs can be balanced does not necessarily imply that the portfolio chosen will ultimately be contained within it portfolios that are not strictly nondominated may be preferred for un modeled reasons the insights gained from nondominated mrts can be used in a targeted exploration of dominated portfolios of interest or mrts could be generated using the full set of portfolios generated by the moea 5 3 future research the findings and limitations of this study suggest several interesting areas of additional wrsa moea research one idea is to use insights from mrts to learn about a problem and constrain a new iteration of the problem formulation to target a specific region of objective performance this would be a new approach to the de novo planning framework demonstrated by kasprzyk et al 2012 the identification of robust decisions across scenarios is also a promising result that warrants structured analysis to develop a framework to guide the use of mrts for this purpose another beneficial direction would be to test mrts on different types of water resources applications e g reservoir operations to determine whether the results are meaningful in non planning contexts we also suggest exploring the efficacy and value of combining different feature selection methods with wrsa tradeoff sets and then assessing whether they are considered useful and usable by practitioners who have used or are interested in employing moeas in their planning processes smith et al 2017 6 conclusion the increasing prevalence of moea studies in wrsa research and practice calls for greater attention to developing tradeoff analysis tools while tradeoff sets are complex and often challenging to analyze heuristically the high dimensionality and large volume of results produced by moeas can be assets when combined with feature selection here we present mrts which relate performance variations within and across multiple objectives to distinct subsets of specific decisions providing users with information about the most consequential decisions and their most productive ranges using the eldorado utility planning model we demonstrated multiple types of analysis that can be performed with mrts starting with the mrt leaves managers may identify groups of portfolios that correspond to their performance priorities and learn which decision splits were critical to arriving at promising leaves alternatively starting at the top of the tree and following decision splits down based on decision preferences provides information about how these preferences impact performance across multiple objectives finally comparing leaves from different trees may shed light on decisions that perform well across multiple futures insights gained from all of these approaches can inform in depth exploration of the tradeoff set and prompt new policy questions mrts are versatile simple to generate and present easily comprehensible insights that may not be apparent during heuristic analyses of tradeoff sets they overcome mostly or entirely the limitations described in this paper the only subjective choice required in the visual representation of the tradeoffs is the order in which performance boxplots are places they find patterns across many dimensions in an objective and repeatable process that eliminates the possibility of interference from user preferences that can skew perceptions and exacerbate conflict and they provide an objective basis on which to compare

26152,this study estimates the impact of future variations in temperature and precipitation associated with climate change scenarios on the probability of total trihalomethanes tthm concentrations exceeding a threshold in drinking water 108 drinking water utilities dwus located in the province of quebec canada were selected for this study temperature and precipitation variations from the period 2006 2009 to three predicted periods 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 were estimated using two climate models and three emission scenarios the probability of tthm threshold exceedances was calculated using a multilevel logistic regression model based on three variables treatment type temperature and precipitation and three hierarchical levels tthm samples dwus and source water ecosystem results showed a low but significant increase in the probability of tthm threshold exceedances over time between 1 9 and 4 7 there was also a significant probability difference between seasons up to 30 and between treatment types between 25 and 40 keywords drinking water trihalomethanes climate change multilevel regression models abstract 1 introduction future changes in air temperature and precipitation are to be anticipated owing to increases in greenhouse gas ghg emissions intergovernmental panel for climate change ipcc 2013 the expected changes may vary in different parts of the world due to specific characteristics influencing climate ipcc 2013 in the southern part of the province of quebec canada and for the period between the years 2007 and 2080 bourque and simonet 2008 predicted increases in temperature between 2 5 c and 8 c and variations in precipitation between 1 and 43 in the winter and spring and between 11 and 18 in the summer and fall temperature and precipitation are known to have an impact on the amount of natural organic matter nom present in surface water chong soh et al 2008 cool et al 2014 a precursor to the formation of disinfection by products dbps in drinking water reckhow et al 2004 for example one of the most common groups of dbps trihalomethanes thms is formed following the reaction of nom and chlorine rook 1974 thm formation is also influenced by water temperature chang et al 2010 obolensky and singer 2008 which is positively correlated to air temperature caissie et al 2001 therefore predicted variations in temperature and precipitation could influence the amount of nom available and in the same way influence thm concentrations in drinking water variations in dbp concentrations are a matter of concern since studies have linked some dbps to possible carcinogenic effects and adverse reproductive outcomes king et al 2000 komulainen 2004 levallois et al 2012 richardson et al 2007 richardson and postigo 2012 total thms tthms a group composed of the four principal thms found in drinking water chloroform bromoform bromodichloromethane and dibromochloromethane are used as a dbp indicator in most drinking water regulations and guidelines because they are easily detectable in drinking water the province of quebec regulates tthms based on a mean annual threshold of 80 μg l with an annual minimum of four seasonal samples collected at the end of distribution system government of quebec 2009 and while many drinking water utilities dwus in the province of quebec have tthm concentrations below the mean annual threshold some have recorded concentrations exceeding the regulatory threshold quebec ministry of the environment mddelcc 2010a two studies have already hypothesized a possible impact of climate change on dbp concentrations delpla et al 2009 a study of the impacts of climate change on surface water quality in relation to drinking water production and chong soh et al 2008 a study of the potential effects of climate change and ozone depletion on water quality quantity and treatability due to the potential health effects of dbps and possible increases in their concentrations following climate change research should take place to monitor the possible impacts of climate change on dbps in drinking water the possible impacts of climate change on the microbiological quality of drinking water have been investigated in the past 15 years e g charron et al 2004 coffey et al 2014 curriero et al 2001 hunter 2003 patz et al 2008 rose et al 2001 however following our literature review we concluded that research on the influence of climate change on dbps in drinking water is still at the exploratory stage recently delpla et al 2016 studied the impact of climate change on dbps in 13 small drinking water utilities dwus in southern quebec that primarily used conventional water treatment 12 out of 13 used coagulation flocculation sedimentation filtration and chlorination the analysis was based on monthly data over one year different emission scenarios and 17 dbp regression models 10 of which were for thms selected from chowdhury et al 2010 chen and westerhoff 2010 sadiq and rodriguez 2011 and zhang et al 2011 the results demonstrated annual average increases in tthm concentrations between 2 7 and 9 5 according to the emission scenarios and time periods the study concluded that annual tthm concentrations from all dwus would not exceed the quebec regulatory threshold however the study considered a limited number of dwus located in the same area within a 100 km radius and most had conventional treatment different strategies are used by dwus to reduce thm concentrations in drinking water for example use of groundwater rather than surface water since groundwater generally has lower nom concentrations dalva and moore 1991 jardine et al 1989 in the case of surface water the use of an advanced treatment technology conventional treatment with activated carbon can diminish the amounts of nom in water before disinfection and thus concentrations of thm in drinking water gray 2008 matilainen et al 2010 therefore dwus that use chlorination only should demonstrate the same resilience to variations in climate as dwus that use more advanced treatment the objective of this study was to explore and estimate the impact of possible future changes in temperature and precipitation on the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding a threshold of 80 μg l based on the quebec canada drinking water regulation qdwr the study considered a large number of dwus supplied by surface water that used various types of treatment and were located across the province dwus supplied by surface water were considered because as explained in the previous paragraph surface water contains higher amounts of nom than groundwater the use of a greater number of dwus covering a large geographical area and resorting to various types of treatment technologies should serve to account for spatial differences in climate change estimates and in dwu resilience to climate change using a multilevel logistic regression model developed previously by the research team cool et al 2015 and based on climate models and emission scenarios this study compared the impact of predicted climate change on the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold the probability calculations were based on the dwu its water treatment type and its surrounding natural environment and climate predicted from various climate change emission scenarios and climate models it was anticipated that the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold would increase in time and that this increase would be less important for dwus with more advanced treatment 2 methodology 2 1 description of the multilevel logistic regression model and the dataset 2 1 1 multilevel logistic regression model this study used the multilevel logistic regression model developed previously by cool et al 2015 to estimate the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding a specific threshold based on the qdwr the tthm threshold from the qdwr corresponded to a mean annual concentration of 80 μg l based on a minimum of four seasonal samples collected at the end of distribution systems government of quebec 2009 tthm samples collected by dwus for regulatory compliance purposes were divided into two categories according to threshold samples that had a tthm concentration equal to or below 80 μg l not exceeding the threshold and samples that had a tthm concentration over 80 μg l exceeding the threshold this represented the dependent variable for the model dichotomic variable with two possible values exceeding the threshold or not exceeding the threshold the multilevel logistic regression model included three independent variables treatment type chlorination only or more advanced treatment precipitation total rain precipitation in millimeters for 10 days prior to water sampling and temperature mean value of maximum daily temperatures in celsius degrees for 60 days prior to water sampling the duration in days of total precipitation and mean temperature values were selected from an earlier study cool et al 2014 that compared results from simple regression analyses between dissolved organic carbon an indicator for nom in water and various temporal scenarios of precipitation and temperature the temporal scenarios with the highest r2 were selected to represent the period during which climate had the greatest impact on the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon the regression model also considered a three level hierarchical structure tthm samples first level dwus second level and natural regions 1 1 natural regions are geographic units distinguished on the basis of regional geology geomorphology and climate li and ducruc 1999 mddelcc 2012 third level the multilevel nature of the regression model suggested that the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold would be influenced by the dwu where the water is sampled and the natural region where the dwu is located the regression model s parameters are presented in table 1 2 1 2 datasets the dataset used to model the current probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold is the same dataset that was used to build the regression model cool et al 2015 tthm measurements were selected from a large drinking water database banque informatisée eau potable with information from compulsory drinking water quality samples and utility related information managed by the mddelcc 2010a water samples were collected at least four times a year once per season by drinking water operators and analyzed by certified laboratories government of quebec 2009 tthm concentrations were measured between 2006 and 2009 for a total of 2435 samples representing the first level variable for the model these samples were collected from 108 dwus representing the second level for the model located in the province of quebec and supplied by surface water the dwus were located mostly in the southern part of quebec where most of the population of quebec resides and the region under study covered 20 natural regions 2 2 one natural region 201 surrounding the montreal metropolitan region contained a relatively high number of dwus compared to the other natural regions to establish a relatively similar weight for each natural region in the modeling process and since surface water in region 201 is clearly influenced by two different types of geographical landscapes i e if divided by the st lawrence river the northern part is influenced by the southern laurentian and the southern part by the appalachians the natural region was divided in two i e regions 201a and 201b therefore in the modeling process there are 21 natural regions instead of 20 representing the third level for the model the information about dwu treatment type was collected from a mddelcc online database mddelcc 2010b the treatment information in this database is updated regularly and includes the presence or absence of five treatment types for dwus supplied by surface water chlorination filtration ozonation activated carbon and ultraviolet uv dwus using at least one treatment type in addition to chlorination were considered in the more advanced treatment category 76 dwus and dwus using only chlorination as treatment were considered in the chlorination only category 32 dwus the information was retrieved in early 2010 in order to best represent the treatment used during the current period 2006 2009 the location of dwus their treatment types and the natural regions are presented in fig 1 data on precipitation and temperature for the current period were collected daily from a climatic database known as info climat mddelcc 2010c the climate station located closer to a dwu s water source intake was selected to represent climate for the dwu in question climate information was collected from november 2005 to december 2009 2 2 description of climate model and emission scenarios used for climate prediction climate model and emission scenarios were used to predict climate change using different calculation methods climate models section 2 2 1 and under different possible scenarios of greenhouse gas ghg emissions emission scenarios section 2 2 2 2 2 1 climate model climate models are a mathematical representation of the climate system based on physical chemical and biological properties they simulate the dynamics of the climate system to project future climate ipcc 2007 one coupled global climate model was used to estimate future variations in climate coupled global climate models are able to consider simultaneously the effects of the atmosphere the earth and oceans around the planet but due to their high needs in calculating capacity offer a coarse spatial and temporal resolution the coupled global climate model selected for this study is the fourth generation global climate model canadian earth system model version 2 canesm2 developed by the canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis 3 3 cccma www cccma ec gc ca cccma the results were downloaded from the archive of the climate model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 available on the cccma website cccma 2019 2 2 2 emission scenarios emission scenarios are predictions of ghg aerosols and other pollutants emission increases based on expected estimations of population growth economic patterns technology and other factors wmo 2014 representative concentration pathways rcps provide spatial datasets of land use change and sector based emissions of air pollutants and specify annual greenhouse gas concentrations and anthropogenic emissions up to 2100 rcps are based on a combination of integrated assessment models simple climate models atmospheric chemistry and global carbon cycle models ipcc 2013 outputs from all rcp scenarios available on the cccma website were included in the analysis climate estimates were available for three representative concentration pathways rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 from the canesm2 global climate model descriptions of the different rcps considered are presented in table 2 2 3 methodology used to predict the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold 2 3 1 determination of time periods various time periods were used to study the evolution of the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold in time the first time period was the current period it covered the same four years that were used to build the regression model 2006 2009 this current period represented actual data to compare the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold with three other predicted periods based on 30 year segments between the end of the current period 2010 and the last year of available climate predictions 2099 these predicted periods are 2010 2039 2020 2040 2069 2050 and 2070 2099 2080 one more time period reference period covering 20 years 1998 2017 was selected as an indicator of the current period nine years this reference period was used solely in the methodological process to estimate future variations in climate as explained in section 2 3 4 therefore no probability results were calculated for the reference period 2 3 2 selection and adaptation of variables from the climate models variables from the climate models were selected to be used as indicators of the climatic variables considered in the tthm regression model section 2 1 1 they served to model the impacts of future variations in climate on the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold we selected two variables from the climate models with a seasonal frequency temperature mean max c and total precipitation mm day the temperature mean max variable is the seasonal mean value from maximum daily temperatures and was selected to represent the temperature variable from the regression model 60 day mean of maximum daily temperatures the total precipitation variable was the seasonal mean of daily amount of precipitation estimated and was selected with a slight adaptation to represent the precipitation variable from the regression model 10 day total rain precipitation the adaptation contained two steps to change daily precipitation to 10 day periods the first step consisted of computing for each season the mean number of days with precipitation over the current period 2006 2009 based on climate values from all climate stations used in the study for one 10 day period it was determined that rain falls on average 1 1 day during winter 3 3 days during spring 4 8 days during summer and 4 1 days during fall then we multiplied precipitation outputs from the climate models by the factor associated with its season for example if the total precipitation value from the climate model was 10 mm day during the summer its value would be multiplied by 4 8 factor associated with summer for a total of 48 mm over 10 days 2 3 3 association of climate information with dwus a climate model predicts temperature and precipitation values for a set of surface grid cells the resolution of surface grid cells depends on the climate model selected and each surface grid cells from one climate model is given climate values for each emission scenario the association of surface grid cells with each dwu was based on the geographical location of the dwu s source water uptake for all dwus the global climate model included outputs for eleven surface grid cells and each surface grid cell covered between one and 38 dwus the location of surface grid cells and dwu source water uptakes are shown in fig 2 2 3 4 estimating climate values for predicted periods temperature and precipitation values from the climate model varied spatially according to surface grid cells and each surface grid cell could represent up to 38 dwus in order to ensure a spatial variation of climate values within each surface grid cell we estimated climate values using three steps according to the methodology suggested by köhler et al 2009 for each surface grid cell and each year between 1998 beginning of the reference period and 2099 end of the last predicted period the climate models calculated a seasonal mean of temperature and precipitation based on the methodologies of the climate models and the estimations of the emission scenarios using these results we calculated climate seasonal means for the reference period and all three predicted periods then for each season and each emission scenario we calculated the difference in climate values between the reference period and each of the predicted periods this allowed us to estimate seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation between the reference period and each predicted period finally we considered temperature and precipitation values associated with each tthm sample from the current period and added for each predicted period and emission scenario the seasonal climate variation value estimated from the surface grid cell associated with their respective dwu therefore for each of the tthm samples n 2435 in the current period there was one climate value estimated for each predicted period 2020 2050 2080 and for each emission scenario rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for a total of more than 20 000 climate values all climate values estimated from this method were used to calculate the predicted probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold section 2 3 5 in addition to improving the spatial variability of climate values within each surface grid cell this methodology allowed us to compare similar number of years between the reference period 20 years 4 4 the number of years for the reference period was restricted to 20 years rather than 30 years to limit overlapping with the 2020 predicted period and to obtain a better representation of the climate during the current period which represents seven years and the predicted periods 30 years rather than the current period 4 years and predicted periods 30 years when predicting variations in climate 2 3 5 predicting the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold the equation used to calculate the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold was based on a previously developed multilevel logistic regression model equation 1 1 π ˆ 1 1 exp b 0 r e s j k r e s k b 1 t r e a t j k b 2 t e m p i j k b 3 p r e c i j k where π ˆ is the predicted probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold for sample i in dwu j nested in natural region k b0 is the log odds of that probability when all variables have a value of zero resjk is the residual specifically for the dwu j in natural region k resk is the residual specifically for natural region k b1 is the increase in log odds for a dwu that uses more advanced treatment instead of chlorination only treat jk is the dwu s treatment type value 0 for chlorination only and 1 for more advanced treatment b2 and b3 are the increase in log odds for an increase of one unit in temperature c and precipitation mm respectively and temp ijk and precijk are the temperature and the precipitation values associated to the tthm sample respectively the model was calibrated using iterative generalized least squares igls and second order penalized quasi likelihood pql transformation preceded by first order marginal quasi likelihood mql to reduce the chances of convergence problems which is the least biased quasi likelihood transformation all parameters bx and residual values from the equation remained constant for each probability calculated similarly the treatment type remained unchanged therefore possible treatment type modifications throughout the years were not considered in the analysis however temperature and precipitation values were representative of climate values from the current and predicted periods and from each emission scenario there was one probability result calculated for each climate value i e more than 20 000 probability results 2 4 statistical analysis the comparison of climate values and the probabilities of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold between time periods emission scenarios seasons and treatment types was carried out using a pairwise mean comparison tests in stata statacorp 2013 a pairwise mean comparison test compares each possible pair of categories and tests the difference between them with the student s t test results are presented as p values considered statistically significant at three different levels 0 1 0 05 and 0 01 3 results and discussion 3 1 temperature and precipitation estimations by season time periods and emission scenarios seasonal and overall temperature and precipitation values for the current period plus the difference and significance levels between the current period and the predicted periods for each emission scenario are presented in table 3 temperatures increase in time for all emission scenarios and seasons increases in temperatures are very significant i e p value 0 01 between the current period and both the 2050 and 2080 predicted periods increases in temperature between the current period and the 2020 predicted period are significant mostly for the rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 emission scenarios demonstrating higher temperature increases sooner in time for those two emission scenarios the biggest increase for all seasons is within rcp 8 5 emission scenario the most extreme emission scenarios in terms of ghg emissions moreover the biggest seasonal temperature increases are expected in winter and summer according to the results presented in table 3 most precipitation values are not expected to vary importantly in time the climate models predicted a significant p value 0 01 and consistent increase in precipitation mostly in the spring and the fall between the current period and the different predicted periods for the different scenarios a slight but non significant decrease in precipitation was noticed in the summer season only for the rcp 2 6 scenario in 2080 3 2 probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold 3 2 1 probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold according to emission scenarios and climate models the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold for each emission scenario and climate model is presented in table 4 overall rows and differences in probability between emission scenarios and their significance levels p values are presented in table 5 the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold increases from the least extreme emission scenario rcp2 6 to the most extreme emission scenario rcp8 5 and especially for the last predicted period 2080 indeed as indicated in table 2 the three emission scenarios selected from this study have different levels of estimated ghg emissions based on these levels the rcp2 6 emission scenario is considered the least extreme including also a decrease in emissions at the end of the century the rcp4 5 emission scenario is considered as average and the rcp8 5 emission scenario is considered the most extreme therefore the results table 4 indicate that the emission scenarios influence in the same way as their extremeness the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold results from table 5 also demonstrate that the estimated probabilities increase faster for the most extreme scenarios since the differences between the emission scenarios increase considerably when the probabilities are predicted further in time this results in an increasing significance i e reduction of p values in probability differences between emission scenarios in time table 5 the 2020 predicted period do not show any statistically significant difference in probability between emission scenarios p value 0 230 however significant differences are observed for the 2050 and the 2080 predicted period when comparing the least extreme emission scenario rcp2 6 with the most extreme emission scenarios rcp 8 5 p values 0 05 and also when comparing for the 2080 period only the average emission scenario rcp4 5 with an extreme emission scenario rcp8 5 p value 0 054 3 2 2 probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold according to time periods the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold according to time periods is also presented in table 4 the results demonstrate an increasing probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold in time for all emission scenarios these increasing probabilities follow the same trend as temperature values predicted by the climate models as shown in table 3 the difference in probability between time periods and their significance levels p values is presented in table 6 as hypothesized the results demonstrate a relatively low but statistically significant increase in probability from the current period to the 2050 and the 2080 predicted periods for all emission scenarios however no statistically significant difference in probability is found between the current period and the 2020 predicted period p value 0 158 the difference in probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold between time periods increases as the emission scenarios become more extreme i e from rcp 2 6 to rcp 8 5 this once again demonstrates a greater increase in probability in time for the most extreme scenarios and results in statistically significant differences in probability between the 2020 predicted period and the 2050 predicted period for the average rcp4 5 and the most extreme rcp8 5 emission scenario and between the 2050 predicted period and the 2080 predicted period for the most extreme emission scenario rcp 8 5 3 2 3 probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold according to seasons the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold according to seasons for each time period and for each emission scenario separately and together section all are presented in table 4 for each emission scenario and each time period the water samples taken during summer have the highest probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold followed by the fall spring and winter these seasonal variations in probability follow the same pattern as temperature and precipitation table 3 which based on the regression model are positively correlated to the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold the differences in probabilities between seasons and their significance levels p values for all emission scenarios and each time period are presented in table 7 5 5 we merged the results from all emission scenarios because in the majority of cases there was no significant difference in the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold between emission scenarios section 3 2 1 the results show large and statistically significant intra annual variations in the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold between seasons for all time periods around 32 35 between winter and summer p value 0 001 the results also show a slight increase in the intra annual variations as probabilities are estimated further in time i e increase in intra annual variations through time of 0 8 between winter and spring and 3 4 between winter and summer which means that intra annual variations in probabilities are expected to increase in time 3 2 4 probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold according to treatment types table 8 presents the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold for dwus using chlorination only and dwus using more advanced treatment results are presented by seasons overall and by time periods for each time period and each season the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold for dwus using chlorination only as treatment is significantly higher than for dwus using more advanced treatment p value 0 001 these results are in line with the regression model that presents a significantly higher log odds value for dwus using chlorination only see table 1 it is also extensively documented in the literature that dwus using more advanced treatment are able to reduce organic thm precursors that originate from surface water prior to chlorination thus reducing tthm concentrations hrudey 2008 matilainen et al 2010 kim and yu 2005 the results also show that dwus using more advanced treatment are more resilient to intra annual variations indeed dwus that use chlorination alone show a greater intra annual variation than dwus that use more advanced treatment also as was the case when analyzing the difference in probability between time periods for all dwus the results show a relatively small but statistically significant increase in probability in time for dwus using either type of treatment indeed table 8 shows that total variations i e difference between the current period and the 2080 predicted period are predicted to be approximately 6 1 for dwus using chlorination only and 3 8 for dwus using more advanced treatment this suggests that overall dwus using more advanced treatment tend to be more resilient than dwus using chlorination only not only in terms of intra annual variations but also to predicted climate variations through time however while intra annual variations increase from approximately 30 for dwus using more advanced treatment to approximately 40 for dwus using chlorination only the increases in probability in time i e total variation are much smaller this comparison shows a relatively small increase in probability in time when compared with the reduction of probability for dwus using more advanced treatment rather than chlorination only and also when compared with the intra annual variations that dwu operators are currently dealing with 4 summary and conclusions previous analyses i e cool et al 2015 have identified temperature and precipitation as having a significant influence on the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding a threshold of 80 μg l based on the mean annual regulatory threshold from the qdwr government of quebec 2009 using the same multilevel logistic regression model of cool et al 2015 and based on climate models and emission scenarios this paper explored and estimated the impact of possible future changes in temperature and precipitation on the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding that specific threshold it was hypothesized that this probability could increase as a result of future variations in temperature and precipitation related to climate change it was also hypothesized that dwus that use more advanced treatment should prove to be more resilient to climate change than dwus that use chlorination only the multilevel logistic regression model included three variables treatment type temperature and precipitations and considered a three level hierarchical structure samples dwus and natural regions future variations in temperature and precipitation were estimated from one climate model one global canesm2 and from three emission scenarios representative concentration pathway 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold was estimated for the current period 2006 2009 and three predicted periods 2010 2039 2020 2040 2069 2050 and 2070 2099 2080 and was compared between emission scenarios and climate models time periods seasons and treatment types temperatures are expected to increase significantly in time for all seasons and all emission scenarios precipitation shows significant and consistent increase mostly in the spring and the fall between the current period and the three predicted periods and for the three scenarios a slight but non significant decrease in precipitation was noticed in the summer season rcp2 6 in 2080 predicted period statistically significant differences in the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold were found for the 2050 and 2080 predicted periods between the least extreme emission scenario rcp 2 6 and the most extreme emission scenario rcp 8 5 and between the average emission scenario rcp 4 5 and the most extreme emission scenario for 2080 predicted period statistically significant differences in probability were found between the current period and both the 2050 and the 2080 predicted periods for all emission scenarios finally large statistically significant differences in probability were found between seasons and between treatment types with higher probabilities during summer followed by fall spring and winter and for dwus using chlorination alone as treatment as hypothesized there was a small but statistically significant increase in the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold through time and dwus using more advanced treatment proved to be more resilient to climate change these results also showed a great difference in probability between the treatment types and between seasons thus the improvement of water treatment over the years through the use of technologies that contribute to removing dbp precursors or improving the efficiency of the treatment should have a great impact on reducing the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold for dwu currently using chlorination only most of them small systems these treatment improvements will necessarily emerge as the qdwr makes its mandatory for dwus supplied by surface water to remove contaminants through a filtration process government of quebec 2014 therefore we believe that in the future these changes in treatment efficiency could significantly reduce the influence of climate change on the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold especially since dwus in the province of quebec are built to cope with large intra annual variations studies considering the impact of climate change on dbps are still at an exploratory stage as most research on drinking water quality and climate change has focused on microbiological water quality to our knowledge only one study has previously examined the subject i e delpla et al 2016 and it is the first time that the impact of climate change on dbps has been studied at such a large scale in fact our study considered 108 dwus using different types of treatments and located across the province of quebec the study also considered a multilevel logistic regression model which allowed us consider the correlations of tthm concentrations within dwus as well as the correlation of dwus sampled within the same natural regions multilevel regression models are relatively new to the field of drinking water quality modeling and the methodology is particularly well suited to modeling hierarchically structured data rasbash et al 2009 the same approach could be used in future research to consider the impact of climate change on other dbps or chemical substances affected by territorial and climatic characteristics the same modeling strategy might also be useful in further studies to estimate the evolution of human exposure to drinking water contaminants in relation to climate change results should be interpreted at the light of some limitations for example the study hypothesized that the type of treatment and treatment efficiency did not change over the years however in canada and elsewhere there have been many upgrades at municipal dwus in recent years mostly associated with regulatory updates moreover even though nom concentrations in source water are influenced by water temperature precipitation and the natural region in which the dwu is located it is also influenced by a very complex interaction of various factors that may change over time such as land use or the patterns for nom exports within watersheds mullholland 2003 not included in the analysis the regression model used is generalized for regional analysis while the model is a great tool for analyses on many dwus its logistic form does not allow the analysis of probabilities between dwus or any other group of tthm samples with similar concentrations although we used only one model in our study we considered a model that provide values close to the mean of the ensemble of models for canada this approach using values close to the mean or median of the outputs of different climatic models was also used by another study fenech et al 2007 finally extreme climate events were not considered for this study extreme precipitation and drought may influence drinking water quality by its impact on source water chong soh et al 2008 hunter 2003 since the changes in source water quality during extreme climatic events can occur quickly dwu operators might have a hard time adapting their treatment accordingly some studies have considered the impact of the predicted increase in the frequency of extreme weather events on the microbiological quality of drinking water e g curriero et al 2001 hunter 2003 rose et al 2001 high precipitation levels have been shown to significantly increase the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold cool et al 2015 it is recognized that subchronic exposures from 1 month to 1 year during pregnancy could be associated with health issues like reproductive effects small for gestational age for example levallois et al 2012 in future work it would be relevant to analyze the impact of extreme weather events on tthm or other dbps concentrations or on their probability of exceeding regulatory or health based thresholds software data availability the model was developed with mlwin software version 2 27 and the scripts are available upon request from the

26152,this study estimates the impact of future variations in temperature and precipitation associated with climate change scenarios on the probability of total trihalomethanes tthm concentrations exceeding a threshold in drinking water 108 drinking water utilities dwus located in the province of quebec canada were selected for this study temperature and precipitation variations from the period 2006 2009 to three predicted periods 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 were estimated using two climate models and three emission scenarios the probability of tthm threshold exceedances was calculated using a multilevel logistic regression model based on three variables treatment type temperature and precipitation and three hierarchical levels tthm samples dwus and source water ecosystem results showed a low but significant increase in the probability of tthm threshold exceedances over time between 1 9 and 4 7 there was also a significant probability difference between seasons up to 30 and between treatment types between 25 and 40 keywords drinking water trihalomethanes climate change multilevel regression models abstract 1 introduction future changes in air temperature and precipitation are to be anticipated owing to increases in greenhouse gas ghg emissions intergovernmental panel for climate change ipcc 2013 the expected changes may vary in different parts of the world due to specific characteristics influencing climate ipcc 2013 in the southern part of the province of quebec canada and for the period between the years 2007 and 2080 bourque and simonet 2008 predicted increases in temperature between 2 5 c and 8 c and variations in precipitation between 1 and 43 in the winter and spring and between 11 and 18 in the summer and fall temperature and precipitation are known to have an impact on the amount of natural organic matter nom present in surface water chong soh et al 2008 cool et al 2014 a precursor to the formation of disinfection by products dbps in drinking water reckhow et al 2004 for example one of the most common groups of dbps trihalomethanes thms is formed following the reaction of nom and chlorine rook 1974 thm formation is also influenced by water temperature chang et al 2010 obolensky and singer 2008 which is positively correlated to air temperature caissie et al 2001 therefore predicted variations in temperature and precipitation could influence the amount of nom available and in the same way influence thm concentrations in drinking water variations in dbp concentrations are a matter of concern since studies have linked some dbps to possible carcinogenic effects and adverse reproductive outcomes king et al 2000 komulainen 2004 levallois et al 2012 richardson et al 2007 richardson and postigo 2012 total thms tthms a group composed of the four principal thms found in drinking water chloroform bromoform bromodichloromethane and dibromochloromethane are used as a dbp indicator in most drinking water regulations and guidelines because they are easily detectable in drinking water the province of quebec regulates tthms based on a mean annual threshold of 80 μg l with an annual minimum of four seasonal samples collected at the end of distribution system government of quebec 2009 and while many drinking water utilities dwus in the province of quebec have tthm concentrations below the mean annual threshold some have recorded concentrations exceeding the regulatory threshold quebec ministry of the environment mddelcc 2010a two studies have already hypothesized a possible impact of climate change on dbp concentrations delpla et al 2009 a study of the impacts of climate change on surface water quality in relation to drinking water production and chong soh et al 2008 a study of the potential effects of climate change and ozone depletion on water quality quantity and treatability due to the potential health effects of dbps and possible increases in their concentrations following climate change research should take place to monitor the possible impacts of climate change on dbps in drinking water the possible impacts of climate change on the microbiological quality of drinking water have been investigated in the past 15 years e g charron et al 2004 coffey et al 2014 curriero et al 2001 hunter 2003 patz et al 2008 rose et al 2001 however following our literature review we concluded that research on the influence of climate change on dbps in drinking water is still at the exploratory stage recently delpla et al 2016 studied the impact of climate change on dbps in 13 small drinking water utilities dwus in southern quebec that primarily used conventional water treatment 12 out of 13 used coagulation flocculation sedimentation filtration and chlorination the analysis was based on monthly data over one year different emission scenarios and 17 dbp regression models 10 of which were for thms selected from chowdhury et al 2010 chen and westerhoff 2010 sadiq and rodriguez 2011 and zhang et al 2011 the results demonstrated annual average increases in tthm concentrations between 2 7 and 9 5 according to the emission scenarios and time periods the study concluded that annual tthm concentrations from all dwus would not exceed the quebec regulatory threshold however the study considered a limited number of dwus located in the same area within a 100 km radius and most had conventional treatment different strategies are used by dwus to reduce thm concentrations in drinking water for example use of groundwater rather than surface water since groundwater generally has lower nom concentrations dalva and moore 1991 jardine et al 1989 in the case of surface water the use of an advanced treatment technology conventional treatment with activated carbon can diminish the amounts of nom in water before disinfection and thus concentrations of thm in drinking water gray 2008 matilainen et al 2010 therefore dwus that use chlorination only should demonstrate the same resilience to variations in climate as dwus that use more advanced treatment the objective of this study was to explore and estimate the impact of possible future changes in temperature and precipitation on the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding a threshold of 80 μg l based on the quebec canada drinking water regulation qdwr the study considered a large number of dwus supplied by surface water that used various types of treatment and were located across the province dwus supplied by surface water were considered because as explained in the previous paragraph surface water contains higher amounts of nom than groundwater the use of a greater number of dwus covering a large geographical area and resorting to various types of treatment technologies should serve to account for spatial differences in climate change estimates and in dwu resilience to climate change using a multilevel logistic regression model developed previously by the research team cool et al 2015 and based on climate models and emission scenarios this study compared the impact of predicted climate change on the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold the probability calculations were based on the dwu its water treatment type and its surrounding natural environment and climate predicted from various climate change emission scenarios and climate models it was anticipated that the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold would increase in time and that this increase would be less important for dwus with more advanced treatment 2 methodology 2 1 description of the multilevel logistic regression model and the dataset 2 1 1 multilevel logistic regression model this study used the multilevel logistic regression model developed previously by cool et al 2015 to estimate the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding a specific threshold based on the qdwr the tthm threshold from the qdwr corresponded to a mean annual concentration of 80 μg l based on a minimum of four seasonal samples collected at the end of distribution systems government of quebec 2009 tthm samples collected by dwus for regulatory compliance purposes were divided into two categories according to threshold samples that had a tthm concentration equal to or below 80 μg l not exceeding the threshold and samples that had a tthm concentration over 80 μg l exceeding the threshold this represented the dependent variable for the model dichotomic variable with two possible values exceeding the threshold or not exceeding the threshold the multilevel logistic regression model included three independent variables treatment type chlorination only or more advanced treatment precipitation total rain precipitation in millimeters for 10 days prior to water sampling and temperature mean value of maximum daily temperatures in celsius degrees for 60 days prior to water sampling the duration in days of total precipitation and mean temperature values were selected from an earlier study cool et al 2014 that compared results from simple regression analyses between dissolved organic carbon an indicator for nom in water and various temporal scenarios of precipitation and temperature the temporal scenarios with the highest r2 were selected to represent the period during which climate had the greatest impact on the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon the regression model also considered a three level hierarchical structure tthm samples first level dwus second level and natural regions 1 1 natural regions are geographic units distinguished on the basis of regional geology geomorphology and climate li and ducruc 1999 mddelcc 2012 third level the multilevel nature of the regression model suggested that the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold would be influenced by the dwu where the water is sampled and the natural region where the dwu is located the regression model s parameters are presented in table 1 2 1 2 datasets the dataset used to model the current probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold is the same dataset that was used to build the regression model cool et al 2015 tthm measurements were selected from a large drinking water database banque informatisée eau potable with information from compulsory drinking water quality samples and utility related information managed by the mddelcc 2010a water samples were collected at least four times a year once per season by drinking water operators and analyzed by certified laboratories government of quebec 2009 tthm concentrations were measured between 2006 and 2009 for a total of 2435 samples representing the first level variable for the model these samples were collected from 108 dwus representing the second level for the model located in the province of quebec and supplied by surface water the dwus were located mostly in the southern part of quebec where most of the population of quebec resides and the region under study covered 20 natural regions 2 2 one natural region 201 surrounding the montreal metropolitan region contained a relatively high number of dwus compared to the other natural regions to establish a relatively similar weight for each natural region in the modeling process and since surface water in region 201 is clearly influenced by two different types of geographical landscapes i e if divided by the st lawrence river the northern part is influenced by the southern laurentian and the southern part by the appalachians the natural region was divided in two i e regions 201a and 201b therefore in the modeling process there are 21 natural regions instead of 20 representing the third level for the model the information about dwu treatment type was collected from a mddelcc online database mddelcc 2010b the treatment information in this database is updated regularly and includes the presence or absence of five treatment types for dwus supplied by surface water chlorination filtration ozonation activated carbon and ultraviolet uv dwus using at least one treatment type in addition to chlorination were considered in the more advanced treatment category 76 dwus and dwus using only chlorination as treatment were considered in the chlorination only category 32 dwus the information was retrieved in early 2010 in order to best represent the treatment used during the current period 2006 2009 the location of dwus their treatment types and the natural regions are presented in fig 1 data on precipitation and temperature for the current period were collected daily from a climatic database known as info climat mddelcc 2010c the climate station located closer to a dwu s water source intake was selected to represent climate for the dwu in question climate information was collected from november 2005 to december 2009 2 2 description of climate model and emission scenarios used for climate prediction climate model and emission scenarios were used to predict climate change using different calculation methods climate models section 2 2 1 and under different possible scenarios of greenhouse gas ghg emissions emission scenarios section 2 2 2 2 2 1 climate model climate models are a mathematical representation of the climate system based on physical chemical and biological properties they simulate the dynamics of the climate system to project future climate ipcc 2007 one coupled global climate model was used to estimate future variations in climate coupled global climate models are able to consider simultaneously the effects of the atmosphere the earth and oceans around the planet but due to their high needs in calculating capacity offer a coarse spatial and temporal resolution the coupled global climate model selected for this study is the fourth generation global climate model canadian earth system model version 2 canesm2 developed by the canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis 3 3 cccma www cccma ec gc ca cccma

predictions of ghg aerosols and other pollutants emission increases based on expected estimations of population growth economic patterns technology and other factors wmo 2014 representative concentration pathways rcps provide spatial datasets of land use change and sector based emissions of air pollutants and specify annual greenhouse gas concentrations and anthropogenic emissions up to 2100 rcps are based on a combination of integrated assessment models simple climate models atmospheric chemistry and global carbon cycle models ipcc 2013 outputs from all rcp scenarios available on the cccma website were included in the analysis climate estimates were available for three representative concentration pathways rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 from the canesm2 global climate model descriptions of the different rcps considered are presented in table 2 2 3 methodology used to predict the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold 2 3 1 determination of time periods various time periods were used to study the evolution of the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold in time the first time period was the current period it covered the same four years that were used to build the regression model 2006 2009 this current period represented actual data to compare the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold with three other predicted periods based on 30 year segments between the end of the current period 2010 and the last year of available climate predictions 2099 these predicted periods are 2010 2039 2020 2040 2069 2050 and 2070 2099 2080 one more time period reference period covering 20 years 1998 2017 was selected as an indicator of the current period nine years this reference period was used solely in the methodological process to estimate future variations in climate as explained in section 2 3 4 therefore no probability results were calculated for the reference period 2 3 2 selection and adaptation of variables from the climate models variables from the climate models were selected to be used as indicators of the climatic variables considered in the tthm regression model section 2 1 1 they served to model the impacts of future variations in climate on the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold we selected two variables from the climate models with a seasonal frequency temperature mean max c and total precipitation mm day the temperature mean max variable is the seasonal mean value from maximum daily temperatures and was selected to represent the temperature variable from the regression model 60 day mean of maximum daily temperatures the total precipitation variable was the seasonal mean of daily amount of precipitation estimated and was selected with a slight adaptation to represent the precipitation variable from the regression model 10 day total rain precipitation the adaptation contained two steps to change daily precipitation to 10 day periods the first step consisted of computing for each season the mean number of days with precipitation over the current period 2006 2009 based on climate values from all climate stations used in the study for one 10 day period it was determined that rain falls on average 1 1 day during winter 3 3 days during spring 4 8 days during summer and 4 1 days during fall then we multiplied precipitation outputs from the climate models by the factor associated with its season for example if the total precipitation value from the climate model was 10 mm day during the summer its value would be multiplied by 4 8 factor associated with summer for a total of 48 mm over 10 days 2 3 3 association of climate information with dwus a climate model predicts temperature and precipitation values for a set of surface grid cells the resolution of surface grid cells depends on the climate model selected and each surface grid cells from one climate model is given climate values for each emission scenario the association of surface grid cells with each dwu was based on the geographical location of the dwu s source water uptake for all dwus the global climate model included outputs for eleven surface grid cells and each surface grid cell covered between one and 38 dwus the location of surface grid cells and dwu source water uptakes are shown in fig 2 2 3 4 estimating climate values for predicted periods temperature and precipitation values from the climate model varied spatially according to surface grid cells and each surface grid cell could represent up to 38 dwus in order to ensure a spatial variation of climate values within each surface grid cell we estimated climate values using three steps according to the methodology suggested by köhler et al 2009 for each surface grid cell and each year between 1998 beginning of the reference period and 2099 end of the last predicted period the climate models calculated a seasonal mean of temperature and precipitation based on the methodologies of the climate models and the estimations of the emission scenarios using these results we calculated climate seasonal means for the reference period and all three predicted periods then for each season and each emission scenario we calculated the difference in climate values between the reference period and each of the predicted periods this allowed us to estimate seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation between the reference period and each predicted period finally we considered temperature and precipitation values associated with each tthm sample from the current period and added for each predicted period and emission scenario the seasonal climate variation value estimated from the surface grid cell associated with their respective dwu therefore for each of the tthm samples n 2435 in the current period there was one climate value estimated for each predicted period 2020 2050 2080 and for each emission scenario rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for a total of more than 20 000 climate values all climate values estimated from this method were used to calculate the predicted probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold section 2 3 5 in addition to improving the spatial variability of climate values within each surface grid cell this methodology allowed us to compare similar number of years between the reference period 20 years 4 4 the number of years for the reference period was restricted to 20 years rather than 30 years to limit overlapping with the 2020 predicted period and to obtain a better representation of the climate during the current period which represents seven years and the predicted periods 30 years rather than the current period 4 years and predicted periods 30 years when predicting variations in climate 2 3 5 predicting the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold the equation used to calculate the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold was based on a previously developed multilevel logistic regression model equation 1 1 π ˆ 1 1 exp b 0 r e s j k r e s k b 1 t r e a t j k b 2 t e m p i j k b 3 p r e c i j k where π ˆ is the predicted probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold for sample i in dwu j nested in natural region k b0 is the log odds of that probability when all variables have a value of zero resjk is the residual specifically for the dwu j in natural region k resk is the residual specifically for natural region k b1 is the increase in log odds for a dwu that uses more advanced treatment instead of chlorination only treat jk is the dwu s treatment type value 0 for chlorination only and 1 for more advanced treatment b2 and b3 are the increase in log odds for an increase of one unit in temperature c and precipitation mm respectively and temp ijk and precijk are the temperature and the precipitation values associated to the tthm sample respectively the model was calibrated using iterative generalized least squares igls and second order penalized quasi likelihood pql transformation preceded by first order marginal quasi likelihood mql to reduce the chances of convergence problems which is the least biased quasi likelihood transformation all parameters bx and residual values from the equation remained constant for each probability calculated similarly the treatment type remained unchanged therefore possible treatment type modifications throughout the years were not considered in the analysis however temperature and precipitation values were representative of climate values from the current and predicted periods and from each emission scenario there was one probability result calculated for each climate value i e more than 20 000 probability results 2 4 statistical analysis the comparison of climate values and the probabilities of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold between time periods emission scenarios seasons and treatment types was carried out using a pairwise mean comparison tests in stata statacorp 2013 a pairwise mean comparison test compares each possible pair of categories and tests the difference between them with the student s t test results are presented as p values considered statistically significant at three different levels 0 1 0 05 and 0 01 3 results and discussion 3 1 temperature and precipitation estimations by season time periods and emission scenarios seasonal and overall temperature and precipitation values for the current period plus the difference and significance levels between the current period and the predicted periods for each emission scenario are presented in table 3 temperatures increase in time for all emission scenarios and seasons increases in temperatures are very significant i e p value 0 01 between the current period and both the 2050 and 2080 predicted periods increases in temperature between the current period and the 2020 predicted period are significant mostly for the rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 emission scenarios demonstrating higher temperature increases sooner in time for those two emission scenarios the biggest increase for all seasons is within rcp 8 5 emission scenario the most extreme emission scenarios in terms of ghg emissions moreover the biggest seasonal temperature increases are expected in winter and summer according to the results presented in table 3 most precipitation values are not expected to vary importantly in time the climate models predicted a significant p value 0 01 and consistent increase in precipitation mostly in the spring and the fall between the current period and the different predicted periods for the different scenarios a slight but non significant decrease in precipitation was noticed in the summer season only for the rcp 2 6 scenario in 2080 3 2 probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold 3 2 1 probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold according to emission scenarios and climate models the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold for each emission scenario and climate model is presented in table 4 overall rows and differences in probability between emission scenarios and their significance levels p values are presented in table 5 the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold increases from the least extreme emission scenario rcp2 6 to the most extreme emission scenario rcp8 5 and especially for the last predicted period 2080 indeed as indicated in table 2 the three emission scenarios selected from this study have different levels of estimated ghg emissions based on these levels the rcp2 6 emission scenario is considered the least extreme including also a decrease in emissions at the end of the century the rcp4 5 emission scenario is considered as average and the rcp8 5 emission scenario is considered the most extreme therefore the results table 4 indicate that the emission scenarios influence in the same way as their extremeness the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold results from table 5 also demonstrate that the estimated probabilities increase faster for the most extreme scenarios since the differences between the emission scenarios increase considerably when the probabilities are predicted further in time this results in an increasing significance i e reduction of p values in probability differences between emission scenarios in time table 5 the 2020 predicted period do not show any statistically significant difference in probability between emission scenarios p value 0 230 however significant differences are observed for the 2050 and the 2080 predicted period when comparing the least extreme emission scenario rcp2 6 with the most extreme emission scenarios rcp 8 5 p values 0 05 and also when comparing for the 2080 period only the average emission scenario rcp4 5 with an extreme emission scenario rcp8 5 p value 0 054 3 2 2 probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold according to time periods the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold according to time periods is also presented in table 4 the results demonstrate an increasing probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold in time for all emission scenarios these increasing probabilities follow the same trend as temperature values predicted by the climate models as shown in table 3 the difference in probability between time periods and their significance levels p values is presented in table 6 as hypothesized the results demonstrate a relatively low but statistically significant increase in probability from the current period to the 2050 and the 2080 predicted periods for all emission scenarios however no statistically significant difference in probability is found between the current period and the 2020 predicted period p value 0 158 the difference in probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold between time periods increases as the emission scenarios become more extreme i e from rcp 2 6 to rcp 8 5 this once again demonstrates a greater increase in probability in time for the most extreme scenarios and results in statistically significant differences in probability between the 2020 predicted period and the 2050 predicted period for the average rcp4 5 and the most extreme rcp8 5 emission scenario and between the 2050 predicted period and the 2080 predicted period for the most extreme emission scenario rcp 8 5 3 2 3 probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold according to seasons the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold according to seasons for each time period and for each emission scenario separately and together section all are presented in table 4 for each emission scenario and each time period the water samples taken during summer have the highest probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold followed by the fall spring and winter these seasonal variations in probability follow the same pattern as temperature and precipitation table 3 which based on the regression model are positively correlated to the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold the differences in probabilities between seasons and their significance levels p values for all emission scenarios and each time period are presented in table 7 5 5 we merged the results from all emission scenarios because in the majority of cases there was no significant difference in the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold between emission scenarios section 3 2 1 the results show large and statistically significant intra annual variations in the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold between seasons for all time periods around 32 35 between winter and summer p value 0 001 the results also show a slight increase in the intra annual variations as probabilities are estimated further in time i e increase in intra annual variations through time of 0 8 between winter and spring and 3 4 between winter and summer which means that intra annual variations in probabilities are expected to increase in time 3 2 4 probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold according to treatment types table 8 presents the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold for dwus using chlorination only and dwus using more advanced treatment results are presented by seasons overall and by time periods for each time period and each season the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold for dwus using chlorination only as treatment is significantly higher than for dwus using more advanced treatment p value 0 001 these results are in line with the regression model that presents a significantly higher log odds value for dwus using chlorination only see table 1 it is also extensively documented in the literature that dwus using more advanced treatment are able to reduce organic thm precursors that originate from surface water prior to chlorination thus reducing tthm concentrations hrudey 2008 matilainen et al 2010 kim and yu 2005 the results also show that dwus using more advanced treatment are more resilient to intra annual variations indeed dwus that use chlorination alone show a greater intra annual variation than dwus that use more advanced treatment also as was the case when analyzing the difference in probability between time periods for all dwus the results show a relatively small but statistically significant increase in probability in time for dwus using either type of treatment indeed table 8 shows that total variations i e difference between the current period and the 2080 predicted period are predicted to be approximately 6 1 for dwus using chlorination only and 3 8 for dwus using more advanced treatment this suggests that overall dwus using more advanced treatment tend to be more resilient than dwus using chlorination only not only in terms of intra annual variations but also to predicted climate variations through time however while intra annual variations increase from approximately 30 for dwus using more advanced treatment to approximately 40 for dwus using chlorination only the increases in probability in time i e total variation are much smaller this comparison shows a relatively small increase in probability in time when compared with the reduction of probability for dwus using more advanced treatment rather than chlorination only and also when compared with the intra annual variations that dwu operators are currently dealing with 4 summary and conclusions previous analyses i e cool et al 2015 have identified temperature and precipitation as having a significant influence on the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding a threshold of 80 μg l based on the mean annual regulatory threshold from the qdwr government of quebec 2009 using the same multilevel logistic regression model of cool et al 2015 and based on climate models and emission scenarios this paper explored and estimated the impact of possible future changes in temperature and precipitation on the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding that specific threshold it was hypothesized that this probability could increase as a result of future variations in temperature and precipitation related to climate change it was also hypothesized that dwus that use more advanced treatment should prove to be more resilient to climate change than dwus that use chlorination only the multilevel logistic regression model included three variables treatment type temperature and precipitations and considered a three level hierarchical structure samples dwus and natural regions future variations in temperature and precipitation were estimated from one climate model one global canesm2 and from three emission scenarios representative concentration pathway 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold was estimated for the current period 2006 2009 and three predicted periods 2010 2039 2020 2040 2069 2050 and 2070 2099 2080 and was compared between emission scenarios and climate models time periods seasons and treatment types temperatures are expected to increase significantly in time for all seasons and all emission scenarios precipitation shows significant and consistent increase mostly in the spring and the fall between the current period and the three predicted periods and for the three scenarios a slight but non significant decrease in precipitation was noticed in the summer season rcp2 6 in 2080 predicted period statistically significant differences in the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold were found for the 2050 and 2080 predicted periods between the least extreme emission scenario rcp 2 6 and the most extreme emission scenario rcp 8 5 and between the average emission scenario rcp 4 5 and the most extreme emission scenario for 2080 predicted period statistically significant differences in probability were found between the current period and both the 2050 and the 2080 predicted periods for all emission scenarios finally large statistically significant differences in probability were found between seasons and between treatment types with higher probabilities during summer followed by fall spring and winter and for dwus using chlorination alone as treatment as hypothesized there was a small but statistically significant increase in the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold through time and dwus using more advanced treatment proved to be more resilient to climate change these results also showed a great difference in probability between the treatment types and between seasons thus the improvement of water treatment over the years through the use of technologies that contribute to removing dbp precursors or improving the efficiency of the treatment should have a great impact on reducing the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold for dwu currently using chlorination only most of them small systems these treatment improvements will necessarily emerge as the qdwr makes its mandatory for dwus supplied by surface water to remove contaminants through a filtration process government of quebec 2014 therefore we believe that in the future these changes in treatment efficiency could significantly reduce the influence of climate change on the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold especially since dwus in the province of quebec are built to cope with large intra annual variations studies considering the impact of climate change on dbps are still at an exploratory stage as most research on drinking water quality and climate change has focused on microbiological water quality to our knowledge only one study has previously examined the subject i e delpla et al 2016 and it is the first time that the impact of climate change on dbps has been studied at such a large scale in fact our study considered 108 dwus using different types of treatments and located across the province of quebec the study also considered a multilevel logistic regression model which allowed us consider the correlations of tthm concentrations within dwus as well as the correlation of dwus sampled within the same natural regions multilevel regression models are relatively new to the field of drinking water quality modeling and the methodology is particularly well suited to modeling hierarchically structured data rasbash et al 2009 the same approach could be used in future research to consider the impact of climate change on other dbps or chemical substances affected by territorial and climatic characteristics the same modeling strategy might also be useful in further studies to estimate the evolution of human exposure to drinking water contaminants in relation to climate change results should be interpreted at the light of some limitations for example the study hypothesized that the type of treatment and treatment efficiency did not change over the years however in canada and elsewhere there have been many upgrades at municipal dwus in recent years mostly associated with regulatory updates moreover even though nom concentrations in source water are influenced by water temperature precipitation and the natural region in which the dwu is located it is also influenced by a very complex interaction of various factors that may change over time such as land use or the patterns for nom exports within watersheds mullholland 2003 not included in the analysis the regression model used is generalized for regional analysis while the model is a great tool for analyses on many dwus its logistic form does not allow the analysis of probabilities between dwus or any other group of tthm samples with similar concentrations although we used only one model in our study we considered a model that provide values close to the mean of the ensemble of models for canada this approach using values close to the mean or median of the outputs of different climatic models was also used by another study fenech et al 2007 finally extreme climate events were not considered for this study extreme precipitation and drought may influence drinking water quality by its impact on source water chong soh et al 2008 hunter 2003 since the changes in source water quality during extreme climatic events can occur quickly dwu operators might have a hard time adapting their treatment accordingly some studies have considered the impact of the predicted increase in the frequency of extreme weather events on the microbiological quality of drinking water e g curriero et al 2001 hunter 2003 rose et al 2001 high precipitation levels have been shown to significantly increase the probability of tthm concentrations exceeding the threshold cool et al 2015 it is recognized that subchronic exposures from 1 month to 1 year during pregnancy could be associated with health issues like reproductive effects small for gestational age for example levallois et al 2012 in future work it would be relevant to analyze the impact of extreme weather events on tthm or other dbps concentrations or on their probability of exceeding regulatory or health based thresholds software data availability the model was developed with mlwin software version 2 27 and the scripts are available upon request from the

26153,aiming to subsidize the rational water resources management an r package called agriwater was created in order to obtain the energy balance on the soil and actual evapotranspiration using satellite imagery and agrometeorological data this package apply the simple algorithm for evapotranspiration retrieving safer to calculate the evapotranspiration fraction e t r or e t a e t 0 1 actual evapotranspiration e t a and latent heat flux λe the slob equation calculate the net radiation r n ground heat flux g is modeled from r n and the sensible heat flux h is retrieved as the residue of the energy balance equation landsat 8 with and without thermal bands sentinel 2 and modis digital images can be used results are presented in raster format and can be post processed by gis analysis or anothers r procedures a study case using sentinel 2 images and agrometeorological data of a semiarid area from brazil was performed the requirements and conditions for use of the package are explained keywords actual evapotranspiration evapotranspiration fraction net radiation latent heat flux sensible heat flux soil heat flux 1 introduction research on irrigation management is a very important topic because agricultural activities consume large volumes of water thus efforts to provide a rational and efficient use of water resources have been made to provide a good estimate of water demand in order to adequate the irrigation schedule of crops jayakumar et al 2017 filgueiras et al 2017 in this context water demands by agriculture may undergo significant modifications by leading to climate changes at both local and global scales since it depends on factors associated with soil plant and atmosphere zhang et al 2012 the evapotranspiration e t provides a link between energy and water balance in the hydrological cycle e t is defined as the transfer of liquid water to the atmosphere as water vapor from bare soil and water bodies such as rivers and lakes evaporation as well as vegetated surfaces through plants leaves transpiration allen et al 1998 et is often one of the largest fluxes of water from watersheds resende et al 2015 bhattarai et al 2017 ramírez cuesta et al 2019 so that estimating its water flux is critical for many applications estimation of large scale et using space based observations has gained popularity with the advancement in optical and thermal remote sensing bastiaanssen et al 1998 allen et al 2007 teixeira 2010 singh et al 2014 senay et al 2017 vanino et al 2018 the long term trends of e t and its drivers need to be understood and quantified under changing climatic conditions to address water security issues related to water rights water allocation crop water use efficiency urban water supply and industrial water use increasing e t over the past 50 years was reported walter et al 2004 for several large basins across the conterminous united states the e t is partitioned in reference evapotranspiration e t 0 and actual evapotranspiration e t a e t o is considered as the water flow of a reference surface as the grass with specific characteristics such as a albedo value equal to 0 23 and the leaf area index lai 2 88 asce 2005 while e t a is the actual water flow that occurs involving all environmental conditions on the other hand in well irrigated crops the values of the evapotranspiration fraction e t r e t a e t 0 1 known as the crop coefficient kc if refers to applications in well irrigated areas are used to estimate the water requirements allen et al 1998 consoli and papa 2013 on the other hand in natural vegetation this indicator can be used to characterize water stress conditions lu et al 2011 agrometeorological parameters vegetation characteristics management and environmental aspects affect et teixeira et al 2016 other factors to be considered are ground cover plant density plant architecture microclimate and soil moisture crop practices and the type of irrigation system can affct the microclimate mainly the canopy characteristics and the moisture content of the soil and the plants the effect of soil moisture on water fluxes is primarily conditioned by the magnitude of the water deficit and soil characteristics carlson and ripley 1997 on the other hand too much water will result in water logging which might damage the root and limit root water uptake by inhibiting respiration for these reasons the quantification of et is indispensable for water management in irrigated crops because it represents the water demand of the crop to be used for irrigation schedule the combination of remote sensing with agrometeorological data allows the evaluation of water balance and radiation parameters to improve irrigation management and diagnosis of the required amount of water to be applied the evaluation of ecosystem responses to environmental conditions variations also can be done by means of energy balance represented by their partitions in latent heat sensible heat and soil heat fluxes krishnan et al 2012 chen et al 2009 there are several studies about energy and mass fluxes on different vegetated surfaces zhang et al 2012 huizhi and jianwu 2012 hu et al 2009 as well as their dependence on biophysical and meteorological variables chen et al 2009 yang et al 2011 remote sensing measures reflected radiation and by making use of such measurements as forward model of the interaction of light with the earth s surface it is possible to inversely estimate properties of the earth s surface land cover type biomass and leaf area index for each image pixel can be modeled such properties represent spatially varying states at particular points in time bastiaanssen et al 2000 teixeira et al 2009a b palacios orueta et al 2012 it is difficult to quantify such fluxes for composite landscape to derive et single source land surface energy balance models are often used among the most widely used are the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 its successor mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 and the simplified surface energy balance sseb senay et al 2016 the disadvantage of many remote sensing energy balance methods such as sebal metric and sebs is the need of mapping thermohydrological extreme conditions the so called anchor pixels with extreme temperature and vegetation or water in the case of sebal conditions for example a cold healthy fully vegetated and irrigated field pixel has to be identified to calibrate the model internally in addition to a hot dry bare soil pixel allen et al 2013 this might limit the applicability of metric to identify et in times when agriculture is not at its peak or following a wet event in spring or winter where such a hot pixel cannot be easily fetched pôças et al 2014 another problem to the practical applicability of the remote sensing energy balance models aiming at the end users is the need of background knowledge in radiation physics involved in the description of these algorithms on the other hand the suitability of applying the penman monteith pm equation by the surface conductance algorithm has been shown by using remotely sensed vegetation indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi together with weather data cleugh et al 2007 so although the sebal and metric had been calibrated and validated with field radiation and energy balance measurements showing satisfactory performances for example in the brazilian semiarid region teixeira et al 2009a b folhes et al 2009 the major difficulty in its applicability for deriving estimates for the whole year is the assumption of zero latent heat flux λe for dry pixels this is because during the rainy season the mixed ecosystems of irrigated crops and natural vegetation are homogenously wet with the whole region presenting high et rates for these reasons a simpler method to retrieve actual evapotranspiration is desirable simple algorithm for evapotranspiration retrieving safer is an algorithm for estimating large scale et formulated by teixeira 2010 which has the advantage of not being mandatory the use of anchor pixels nor the use of thermal bands which can also be used in the absence of measured temperature data different from sebal and metric and for this reason is a more operationally application than others methods safer model requires agrometeorological data of reference evapotranspiration e t o global radiation r g and average air temperature t a to be integrated with radiometrically data from digital images this algorithm has the additional advantage of the possibility for using daily weather data from either conventional or automatic agrometeorological stations this is an important characteristic because it allows a historical evaluation of the energy balance components on a large scale as data from automatic sensors are results from relatively recent advances on instrumental technology safer was recently developed in the semiarid conditions of brazil which has already been validated with field data from four flux stations involving irrigated crops and natural vegetation teixeira et al 2012 this paper presents an r software package to spatially model the actual evapotranspiration and energy balance using remote sensing data from landsat 8 sentinel 2 and modis images together with a agrometeorological data by the safer algorithm the safer model is described in section 2 of this article the r package agriwater is described in section 3 including the pre processing of the digital images included as well as the package structure and core functions in section 3 also a study case in a semiarid area of northeast brazil is presented with various features of the package including 1 data pre processing 2 estimation of all results from the package use and producing summaries and plots of results and 3 examples of post processing with the raster results to make another useful spatial analysis in section 4 potentials and limitations of the package are discussed which are followed by the conclusions in section 5 2 energy balance and actual evapotranspiration modelling by simple algorithm for evapotranspiration retrieving safer safer arose from the need for an operationalization of actual evapotranspiration modelling seeking a model that did not require anchor pixels such as sebal and metric initially it was named as pm2 model teixeira et al 2009 because it was an adaptation of the penman monteith equation and from teixeira et al 2012 received the current name it is an algorithm because it requires as main inputs surface albedo data ndvi and surface temperature which are obtained sequentially from equations that relate radiometric data from multispectral images and agrometeorological data a flowchart with these relationships is presented in fig 1 all the regression coefficients of the parameters in fig 1 and equations below were determined in different areas of brazil with digital images from different satellites like landsat teixeira et al 2017 2016 2015a 2014 coaguila et al 2017 and modis teixeira et al 2015b and field measurements involving strong contrasting agroecosystems and under different thermohydrological conditions throughout several years table 1 shows information about sentinel 2 landsat 8 and modis which provides digital images that can be used as input for safer the sentinel 2 mission is a constellation with two twin satellites sentinel 2a was launched on 23

main inputs are surface albedo ndvi and surface temperature surface albedo and ndvi are obtained directly from satellite imagery data the surface temperature can be obtained either from thermal bands

considered as 1 70 and 0 13 obtained from field and satellite measurements teixeira et al 2008 teixeira et al 2014a teixeira et al 2014b and was calibrated with a r2 0 96 teixeira 2010 2 3 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the ndvi normalized difference vegetation index is an indicator related to the land cover and vegetation stages rouse et al 1974 obtained from satellite image as eq 6 6 n d v i r n i r r r e d r n i r r r e d where r n i r and r r e d represent the reflectance over the range of wavelengths in the near infrared nir and red red regions of the solar spectrum respectively purevdorj et al 1998 and filgueiras et al 2019a studied direct relationships between vegetation cover and satellite indexes including ndvi ribeiro et al 2017 and risso et al 2012 concluded that ndvi was efficient in differentiating phenological stages of the corn and soybean crop respectively 2 4 surface temperature for acquiring the energy and water balance components from satellite images in general their thermal bands are used for estimating the remotely sensed temperature by using the thermal region from the landsat 8 sensor the spectral radiance from the band 10 and 11 were converted into radiometric temperatures applicable at the top of the atmosphere tb by eq 7 7 t b k k 2 k l n k 1 k l k 1 where l k are the pixel values of bands 10 and 11 and k1k and k2k are conversion coefficients available in the metadata of landsat 8 images the average value between tb10 and tb11 is corrected to retrieve the surface temperature by a regression curve by eq 8 8 t s d t b f where d a n d f a r e the regression coefficients which for a 24 h period was considered as 1 11 and 31 89 and was calibrated with a r2 0 95 teixeira 2010 however if the satellite does not have a thermal band there is also the possibility of retrieve the surface temperature using grids of air temperature together with satellite measurements by applying the residual method according to silva et al 2018 the daily surface temperature t s values can be estimated by equation 9 9 t s ε a σ t a 4 a l τ s w ε s σ 4 where τ s w is the shortwave atmosphere transmissivity defined as 44 of r g to the incident solar radiation at the top of atmosphere teixeira et al 2008 teixeira 2010 values ε a and ε s are respectively the atmospheric and surface emissivities σ is the stefan boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 4 and a l coefficient can be explained by daily variations teixeira et al 2014b silva et al 2018 by equation 10 10 a l c t a d where t a is the daily average air temperature from agrometeorological station inside the study area with leaf area index lai of 2 88 and estimated albedo of 0 23 r g is the 24 h values of global solar radiation and c and d are regression coefficients equal to 6 99 and 39 93 teixeira et al 2014a the main uncertainties associated with surface temperature modelling come from obtaining a l eq 10 because the air temperature is measured on a standard surface that is not affected by the roughness generated by different types of vegetation bastiaanssen et al 1998 applied a constant value of a l 110 without considering the local thermal conditions filgueiras et al 2019b applied machine learning methods to model the surface temperature and emphasizes its complexity following teixeira et al 2008 and teixeira et al 2014a ε a and ε s were calculated as 11 ε a a a l n τ s w b a 12 ε s a s ln n d v i b s where a a b a a s and b s are regression which from teixeira 2010 were considered respectively 0 94 0 10 0 06 and 1 00 teixeira et al 2009 calibrated ε a and ε s with r2 of 0 75 and 0 90 respectively 2 5 evapotranspiration fraction and actual evapotranspiration retrivieng the ratio between actual evapotranspiration e t a and reference evapotranspiration e t o so called evapotranspiration fraction or crop coefficient e t r was calculated according to equation 13 following the technical formalism we named e t r of crop coefficient when a modelling is performed on irrigated areas respecting the nomenclature from the fao 56 manual allen et al 1998 and evapotranspiration fraction in areas without irrigation as natural vegetation and rainfed crops because it is a less restricted term 13 e t r e t a e t o e x p e f t s α 0 n d v i where e and f are regression coefficients being 1 8 and 0 008 respectively teixeira 2010 calibrated this equation and obtained a r2 0 91 a advantage of eq 13 compared with bastiaanssen et al 1998 and allen et al 2007 is the possibility of application in any environment according to the thermal conditions without the need for an anchor pixel teixeira 2010 has demonstrated that there are no significant differences between the daily and satellite overpass values of the etr ratio the ratio can also be a good option as an input parameter for the soil moisture estimations at the regional scale teixeira 2010 silva et al 2018 these coefficients was successfully applied to areas with different land uses silva et al 2018 for example applied in watersheds occupied by eucalyptus sugar cane pasture and forest finally e t a is derived by eq 14 14 e t a e t r e t 0 e t a is composed of soil evaporation and plant transpiration and depends primarily on energy supply the vapor pressure gradient between surface and atmosphere and wind speed aggregates in reference evapotranspiration evaporation in soil specifically is directly dependent on soil moisture soil water content and its ability to conduct water to the roots should be considered allen et al 1998 fig 2 presents a simplified sensitivity analysis of the safer in each graph in fig 2 one of the inputs of the safer model is variable and the other two are fixed the fixed value was 25 c for the surface temperature 0 50 for the ndvi and of 0 15 for the surface albedo low surface temperature values reduce water uptake by plant roots by causing reduced permeability and increasing water viscosity which increases resistance to water flows on the soil this effect is predicted by the safer as can be seen in the curve where albedo and ndvi are fixed and the surface temperature varies generating a smaller evapotranspiration fraction with its increase kramer and kozlowski 1979 consider that the kc doubles with a decrease from 25 c to 5 c this effect is quite effective in reference evapotranspiration calculations which is offset by the e t r which gives the low surface temperature pixels greater weight the increase of albedo or ndvi generate an increase in the e t r the e t r in crops without water stress is considered analogous to the crop coefficient kc in natural vegetation e t r characterizes a index of the moisture in the root zone of plants 2 6 radiation and energy balance net radiation r n plays a fundamental role in biophysical processes involving exchanges of energy and mass in the planetary boundary layer since it constitutes the main energy source used in the heating of soil and air and in plant evapotranspiration r n is partitioned into latent heat λ e the energy needed for et sensible heat flux h and soil heat flux or heat flux to the materials from which water evaporates g other energy terms such as heat stored or released in or from canopies or the energy used in metabolic activities are in general not considered because they account only for a small fraction of daily r n and may be neglected in environmental studies the atmosphere warms up when r n is positive net radiation r n mj m 2 day 1 represents the difference between the energy flux densities that enter and leave the surface involving all the wavelengths and is modeled by the slob s equation bruin and stricker 2000 teixeira et al 2015a in eq 15 that was derived by teixeira et al 2008 considering four energy balance field experiments involving different thermohydrological conditions in brazil 15 r n 1 α 0 r g a l τ s w where τ s w is the shortwave atmosphere transmissivity defined as the ratio of r g to the incident solar radiation at the top of atmosphere heat energy storage terms of the soil plant canopy ecosystem can be examined from the complete steady state surface energy balance equation of the system defined as the following eq 16 16 r n λ e h g where r n is the net radiation received at the soil plant surfaces λe is the latent heat flux h is the sensible heat exchange with the atmosphere through convection and g is the soil heat flux all terms in equation 16 can be expressed in w m 2 or mj m 2 d 1 being either positive or negative the energy balance process is illustrated in fig 3 the changes in the air mass temperature and humidity below the flux measurement height are storage terms that were not accounted for in this analysis equation 16 states that the r n is redistributed over h λe and g considering only vertical fluxes and ignoring the net rate at which energy is being transferred horizontally by advection however this term can be significant near the edges of crops or natural vegetation et is the process of energy consuming by the agroecosystem which can be represented as the latent heat flux λe in the radiation balance on the soil as a first approximation an e t a of 1 mm day 1 is equivalent to a λe of 28 w m 2 or 2 45 mj m 2 in this paper the basic unit for energy variables is mj eq 17 show the transformation of e t a into latent heat flux 17 λ e 2 45 e t a soil heat flux g mj m 2 day 1 represents the amount of radiant energy absorbed or released at the soil surface during a given time period and equation 18 was used 18 g r n g exp h α 0 where g and h are regression coefficients which from teixeira et al 2008 were considered respectively 3 98 and 31 98 teixeira 2010 calibrated this equation with r2 0 90 g depends on soil temperature gradient and soil thermal conductivity which are hard to determine using thermal remote sensing data this parameter defines the available energy r n g to be converted to sensible or latent heat the generally practiced neglect of the g term in the energy balance equation is not agronomically justified in view of associated sub soil migration of moisture g is difficult to measure because it includes conduction and convection heat transfer processes heitman et al 2010 however g is a necessary input for many evaporation measurements and prediction techniques evaporation measured with the bowen ratio energy approach is dependent on an accurate value for the available energy and the fraction of soil heat flux to net radiation varies from 0 1 to 0 3 from well vegetated land to bare soil conditions teixeira et al 2015 the sensible heat flux h mj m 2 day 1 was estimated as the residue of the energy balance equation 19 h r n λ e g safer was created to estimate e t a without the need for ground energy balance calculation teixeira et al 2015 initiated the application of safer in the energy balance modelling this is another difference of this method compared with sebal and metric because they start from the energy balance to estimate e t a after the first application of safer in semiarid areas from brazil simple calibrations were made for its use in northwest são paulo climatic conditions by hernandez et al 2014 with landsat 5 images the authors compared the safer results with the results of the surface energy balance algorithm for land algorithm sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 and the culture coefficient methodology kc allen et al 1998 in corn bean and sugarcane crops irrigated by central pivots the et obtained from the application of both algorithms was higher than that estimated by the fao method and the overestimations were related to errors in the phenological stages considerations when applying the tabulated kc values however safer presented better performance than sebal especially in the initial period of the crop when there are conditions of partial soil cover by vegetative canopies also in the northwest of são paulo teixeira et al 2014 applied safer to determine energy balance components in pivots with corn crop landsat 5 images covering all phenological phases allowed us to establish a relationship between these components and the accumulated degree days ddac from planting to harvest in the northeast of são paulo teixeira et al 2016 quantified the energy and mass exchanges between different agroecosystems applying safer with the product mod13q1 during 2015 for sugarcane coffee and natural vegetation respectively the fractions of rn used as λe were 68 87 and 77 whereas for h these were 27 7 and 16 and in the case of g these were 5 6 and 7 it can be concluded that the sugarcane crop presented lower water consumption than coffee in the annual scale which is an advantage in the current conditions of water scarcity however the replacement of natural vegetation by sugarcane crop could contribute to environmental warming while cooling was observed in the case of coffee crop silva et al 2018 applied safer in an area in southeast brazil which presents a vast agricultural landscape mosaic using sentinel 2 images evapotranspiration fraction ranges for the period studied 2014 2018 were 0 92 1 35 in the area occupied by sugarcane crop 0 56 0 94 pasture 1 17 1 56 silviculture and 1 05 1 36 forest in the same study area silva et al 2019 applied safer and spatial analysis of surface runoff to estimate groundwater recharge potential by water balance to model groundwater level in 39 shallow wells the average annual groundwater recharge potential for each of the land uses pasture sugarcane crop silviculture and forest varied between 15 and 50 of the rainfall in southern brazil a region characterized by a subtropical climate leivas et al 2015 successfully applied safer for e t a determination during all rice phenological stages using bands 1 and 2 of the mod13q1 product the average pixel for the initial phase of culture was 1 9 1 0 mm day 1 in the development phase it reached 4 9 mm day 1 falling to a minimum of 1 8 0 8 mm day 1 during the harvest period the average value for the entire production cycle was 2 3 1 0 mm day 1 once again the sensitivity of the algorithm was detected to detect the dynamics of the components of the energy and water balances in this case in annual crops from southern brazil in the coastal areas of northeast brazil teixeira et al 2019 analyzed e t a for dwarf coconut crops finding mean values of 4 0 0 6 mm day 1 safer was also applied with the modis mod13q1 product in the brazilian wetland wetland region to determine the radiation and energy balance in its different ecosystems teixeira et al 2015d the available energy r n g used as λe were on average 65 50 and 49 in the barão de melgaço paiaguás and nhecolândia mesoregions respectively the successful application of safer in tropical semiarid subtropical and wetland areas of brazil shows the versatility and applicability of this algorithm 3 r package agriwater r www r project org is an open source programming environment which is gaining rapidly in usage across a many wide ranges of disciplines r core team 2019 it is an interpreted language that offers excellent interactive analysis capabilities and is ideal for the rapid development of statistical and data analysis applications its native language allows the development of new algorithms from a wide variety of mathematical statistical and graphical functions input and output facilities and operators for vectors and matrices in addition to the basic operations r can be extended by installing packages developed by software users one of the principal advantages of r for the agriwater project is that it is free and open source it is very robust and works on a wide range of platforms including microsoft windows apple os x and linux ensuring that all the examples in an r package run as expected is part of the system of package development and testing in r packages submitted to cran are required to go through extensive checks of both the code and documentation and to ensure all provided examples run as expected these checks are made on a daily basis this process ensures that all code runs exactly as intended package development also strongly encourages the use of comprehensive help files thus formalizing and structuring the different functions contained in a package the package agriwater has been structured and planned in order to aggregate the best practices described by researchers who have conducted studies with the safer model input data are a shapefile mask of the study area datasets of reference evapotranspiration e t o global radiation r g and average air temperature t a and reflectances from sentinel 2 or modis satellite or digital numbers from landsat 8 in this way three basic questions are asked to choose which function to use for the study area is there a single weather agrometeorological station or a network of stations from which satellite will the images come landsat 8 sentinel 2 or modis if landsat 8 images are used will the thermal bands be used too table 3 presents a summary of the functions available in the package agriwater if there is only one agrometeorological station one must choose one of the functions of the first column if there is a network of stations the functions of the second column will be used in the third column are secondary functions that aid researchers who only want the surface albedo or the reflectances of landsat 8 functions are specific to each satellite functions with s2 in the command name indicates that it uses sentinel 2 satellite images l8 indicates the use of landsat 8 l8t the use of landsat 8 including thermal bands and modis the use of modis no functions were created for the use of the modis and sentinel 2 thermal bands because it has spatial resolution of 1 km which would excessively increase uncertainty the modelling with 250 and 10 m respectively the coefficients e and f of equation 13 are in the function argument to allow the calibration of this equation to new areas of study that do not have good results with the existing calibrations when there is an unique value for the study area on the day of the satellite passage this value is reported in the function argument when there is a network of stations the spatial interpolation of these values must be performed within the study area and generate raster files with names equal to those of the single valued functions argument r g tif t a tif e t 0 tif doy and decimal degree coordinates are required to calculate the maximum solar irradiance input on the day of the satellite passage which governs the calculation of shortwave atmosphere transmissivity eq 11 for this reason digital images must be converted to coordinate projections in decimal degrees previously this verification was not included in the package since the available conversion functions are still heavy for high and medium resolution images and can be performed in other gis software table 4 presents a brief description input data and outputs of each command available in the package agriwater the functions started with kc characterize the evapotranspiration fraction e t r which is analogous to the crop coefficient from allen et al 1998 when the analysis is performed in well irrigated areas the functions started with evapo characterizes the actual evapotranspiration and therefore requires e t 0 the functions started with radiation perform the study of the entire energy balance note that some functions include others but they are independent in other words the study of the energy balance made by the radiation functions does not require the user to run an evapo function before in other words functions beginning with kc follow the methodology presented in this paper from eqs 1 13 evapo functions follow eqs 1 14 and radiation from eqs 1 19 thus the user chooses which function to use according to the available data table 5 describe the outputs listed in table 3 it is necessary to previously define the working folder where the function will be runned and to place the satellite images in it and the raster files with the interpolated meteorological data if necessary in this folder the output raster files will be saved other more specific specifications can be seen in the vignette of the package agriwater https cran r project org web packages agriwater vignettes agriwater html a case study is presented below with codes to exemplify the use of the package agriwater 4 study case 4 1 study area semiarid area in northeast brazil fig 4 shows the study area together with the agrometeorological stations inside the petrolina county pernambuco state and juazeiro county bahia state northeast of brazil the sandy soil is classified as latossoil red yellow with low retention capacity with a groundwater depth of around 2 5 m teixeira et al 2017 the semiarid region of brazil mostly in the northeast is influenced by disturbed currents of south north east and west in its climatology excluding high altitude sites all areas present annual average air temperatures above 24 c and even higher than 26 c in depressions with 200 m 250 m altitude the average maximum values are 33 c while for the minimum it is 19 c the average monthly values are in the range of 17 c to 29 c the rainy season is concentrated from january to april with peaks occurring in march teixeira et al 2009 according to the climatic classification of koppen the climate is bsh semi arid with a short rainy season in the summer with average temperature of 24 8 c with august being the driest month and the rainy season concentrated between the months of november and april the thermal homogeneity strongly contrasts with the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the rainfall regime according to teixeira et al 2015 68 of the annual precipitation occurs between january and april which presents a long term 50 years average value of 570 mm yr 1 the main commercial crops in the brazilian semi arid region are mango and vineyard orchards these crops are surrounded by natural vegetation the caatinga fig 4 mango orchards flourish and fruit regularly every year vines in warm tropical conditions exhibit continuous and accelerated physiological processes unlike those grown in temperate climates the caatinga species are defined as having shrub aspects with small leaves and spines distributed irregularly on the soil surface teixeira et al 2009 algorithms such as sebal and metric were calibrated and validated by using energy balance measurements in the field presenting favorable performance in the brazilian semiarid conditions teixeira et al 2009a b folhes et al 2009 however there is a need for the simultaneous existence of extreme thermohydrological conditions for provide a anchor pixel hot and cold pixel which are difficult to obtain during the rainy season in this region since in this period all species of ecosystems mixed species of irrigated crops and natural vegetation are in homogeneous moisture conditions in the root zone and present high rates of e t a with favorable thermal conditions teixeira et al 2009 teixeira 2010 validated safer for the study area with four field experiments involved measurements of e t a with bowen ratio and eddy covariance this validation involved measurements covering two growing seasons of irrigated fruit crops wine grape table grape mango orchard and two years with different rainfall conditions in natural vegetation caatinga and resulted in excellent results with r2 0 9 for equation 13 4 2 r package agriwater procedures and results analyis visible and near infrared spectral bands of images from the sentinel 2 satellite with 10 m spatial resolution of may 13 2016 doy 134 and august 22 2016 doy 235 were used global solar radiation r g air temperature t a and reference evapotranspiration e t 0 data were obtained from automatic agrometeorological stations indicated in the map of fig 2 the land use of the study area in 2016 was adapted of the map made by mapbiomas http mapbiomas org a complete example code for energy balance and evapotranspiration analysis is presented in table a1 in appendix a all sentinel 2 images in one of the doys studied are stored in the r workspace indicated by the setwd command the packages raster rgdal and sp must be installed before using the package agriwater for the first time the gstat package is suggested to perform the spatial interpolation process of the variables rg ta and eto the idw command will be used for the interpolation raster files are generated with the writeraster command there is also a suggestion of code for reprojection of the digital images if necessary finally with the command radiation s2 grid of the package agriwater is generated the modelling of energy balance and evapotranspiration fig 5 is a screenshot of data processing and et estimation with evapo s2 grid for this case study exposing the eta modelling result with plot fig 5 presents the complete energy balance and evapotranspiration outputs from package agriwater figs 6 and 7 were done with qgis 3 4 mapping tools using the raster files provided by agriwater the inputs of safer model fig 6 are produced with agriwater package and can be understood as an output if just these variables are desired besides that they help the user to analyze the results of the model table 6 shows that the average daily values of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi surface temperature and albedo the crop coefficient or evapotranspiration fraction actual evapotranspiration net radiation latent sensible and ground heat fluxes on caatinga and irrigated areas in the irrigated areas ndvi reached values higher than 0 7 evidencing the vegetation response to irrigation in areas with natural vegetation the ndvi was around 0 25 and presented negative values in the são francisco river barbosa et al 2011 verified a lag of time response between the ndvi and the occurrence of precipitation in the brazilian northeast semiarid region in the mixed agroecosystems of the brazilian semiarid region the darker surfaces of the vegetation have low values of surface albedo absorbing more solar radiation than lighter ones depending also on the soil moisture conditions teixeira et al 2008 through field measurements in the caatinga teixeira et al 2008 reported the dependence of α 0 on rainfall conditions ranging from 0 10 to 0 18 similar to that shown in fig 7 but this variable as the net radiation were homogeneous along the field without strong distinctions among irrigated and natural vegetation the surface temperature affects the available energy by interference in the long wave radiation balance net radiation was higher in the irrigated area than in caatinga due to the higher albedo in caatinga lower values occurred in irrigated crops compared to drier areas of natural vegetation in well irrigated crops the concept of etr is equivalent to that of the crop coefficient kc and can be used to estimate water requirements at different spatial and temporal scales teixeira et al 2012 in the caatinga species this indicator characterizes the moisture conditions in the root zone lu et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 studying steppes in mongolia china found seasonal variations of etr with daily mean values of 0 16 and maxima of 0 75 inferior to the irrigated crops and superior to the caatinga species of the current study however lu et al 2011 in the same chinese region reported etr values greater than 1 00 for six different ecosystems like those for well irrigated crops of the são francisco river surface albedo and actual evapotranspiration had low standard deviation in the irrigated area in percentage terms indicating good irrigation uniformity the average e t a for two dates was respectively 0 09 0 10 mm and 0 12 0 14 mm for caatinga vegetation and 3 45 0 79 mm and 3 59 0 58 mm for irrigated area caatinga vegetation presented the lowest values of actual evapotranspiration around 0 1 mm contrasting with the irrigated areas particularly in semiarid regions the e t a process play a major role in the hydrologic cycle since most of precipitation is evaporated or transpired by plants however physical interactions on the soil vegetation atmosphere continuum are one of the most difficult and complex hydrologic components to be modelled kim and kaluarachchi 2017 xu and singh 2005 the energy available in the system usually is used for heating the air and on irrigated areas is consumed by the evapotranspiratory process and for this reason presented higher values of latent heat flux while the caatinga vegetation converts most of the available energy into sensible heat h teixeira et al 2008 the higher values of λe were accompanied by the more negative correspondent values of h evidencing an additional horizontal energy to the crop caused by irrigation while in the natural vegetation area the values of λe decreased and h had the highest positive values the peaks of λe are within the range found by folhes et al 2009 from 7 4 to 14 7 mj m 2day 1 with application of the metric model in irrigated fruit trees in the semi arid conditions of the brazilian northeast as well as in the study by consoli and papa 2013 that negative values of h were verified through measurements with a system of turbulent correlations in orange orchard in the mediterranean semi arid conditions in sicily italy the coefficient a l averaged 146 for our semi arid condition similar to the average value of 143 reported by teixeira et al 2009a b this value is higher than the originally suggested value of 110 found for the netherlands bastiaanssen et al 1998 teixeira et al 2009a b if this value if this value were applied to the brazilian semiarid would generate high bias as already reported by teixeira et al 2009a b the difference can be ascribed to different thermal conditions between the macroclimates silva et al 2012 reported a mean value of kc of 0 73 in irrigated dwarf coconut plantation within the range found for the mixed agroecosystems of the current study for sugarcane crop covering the entire soil eksteen et al 2014 found values between 1 10 and 1 50 in petrolina measurements of soil water balance in hoses by azevedo et al 2003 found kc mean values of 0 71 while in the same region teixeira et al 2009 found kc values between 0 63 and 0 91 for vines in semi arid conditions in northeast brazil santos et al 2010 applied the sebal and s sebs algorithms with landsat images and reached maximum et values of 6 0 mm day 1 for the irrigated cotton crop under brazilian semi arid conditions also in this region but in this case using the metric model folhes et al 2009 found e t a rates between 3 0 and 6 0 mm day 1 for irrigated fruit trees similar to those in this current study 4 3 post processing with agriwater products the results generated by the agriwater package can be applied to other models of interest to water management following are models and their spatial results are discussed table a2 presents the source code for this post processing linked to et there is the production of biomass which is fundamental for understanding the dynamics of energy and carbon fluxes in soil purevdorj et al 1998 in agroecosystems with varied land uses the relationship between radiometric data obtained from a canopy or vegetated field and parameters that categorize the growth stages of plants is the principle used for the study of biomass production by remote sensing the combination of measurements of electromagnetic radiation reflected by vegetation in some spectral bands results in vegetation indices vi using vegetation indexes it is possible to reduce the dimensionality of the data and to highlight the spectral response of the vegetation when related to the soil carlson and ripley 1997 the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation apar was approximated directly from par according to equation 20 it s the part of the short wave solar radiation 0 3 3 0 μm that supports photosynthesis in green plants 20 a p a r f p a r p a r where f par was estimated from the ndvi values according to equation 21 considered for a mixture of arable crop types the following coefficients bastiaanssen and ali 2003 21 f p a r i n d v i j where the coefficients i and j were considered respectively to be 1 257 and 0 161 bastiaanssen and ali 2003 teixeira 2010 and the primary production of biomass bio was quantified according to equation 22 teixeira et al 2014 2015a coaguila et al 2017 22 bio ε m a x e t r a p a r 0 864 where 0 864 is a unit conversion factor and ε m a x is the maximum light use efficiency which according to monteith 1972 varies only with c3 and c4 crops if not water stressed in the present study ε m a x was considered 2 5 2 5 g mj 1 which is an average value for c3 crops found in the literature bastiaanssen and ali 2003 the improvements of monteith s model have resulted in correction terms for environmental conditions including soil moisture and heat stresses teixeira et al 2009b to classify the energy transference of the radiation balance parameters ratios as h r n λe r n and g r n were calculated for each pixel the knowledge of this fractions is relevant to considering the land use change and climate change effects teixeira et al 2017 looking for classify the vegetated surface as irrigated crops and natural vegetation the sureal surface resistance algorithm model formulated by teixeira 2010 to estimate the water fluxes resistance r s was applied following equation 23 23 r s l m t s α 0 1 n d v i where l and m are regression coefficients considered respectively 0 04 e 2 72 for the brazilian semiarid condition pixels with r s values bellow 800 s m 1 and ndvi above or equal to 0 40 were considered as irrigated crops if r s was in between 800 and 10000 s m 1 they should be natural vegetation the high end of this last range was considered to eliminate humankind structures or bare soil teixeira 2010 calibrated this equation with a r2 0 93 the evaporative fraction e f was retrivied by eq 24 sebal and metric use this concept as the basis for evapotranspiration modelling here e f is used as an indicator of soil moisture this parameter quantifies the percentage of available energy that is converted into evapotranspiration 24 e f λ e r n g for water productivity wp analysis eq 25 was used 25 w p b i o e t a wp may be defined as the ratio of the net benefits from crop forestry fishery livestock and mixed agricultural systems to the amount of water required to produce those benefits considering vegetation wp can be biomass production bio per water consumed including that originated from rainfall irrigation seepage and changes in root zone storage molden et al 2007 according to li et al 2016 wp is more affected by agronomy practices than by climatic factors and its improvements should be based on advanced technologies involving crop and water management table 7 presents the average values of biomass primary production and the radiation transference ratios in caatinga and irrigated areas for each doy fig 8 present the maps of the post processing products the lowest rs values indicated well root zone moisture conditions less resistance to water fluxes while the highest ones may be related to drier conditions the spatial and temporal variations are very clear bringing additional confidence to the sureal algorithm for classify land by water and vegetation different conditions on large scales the parameter r s increases with decreasing e t a thus there was one more way to differentiate irrigated areas of caatinga energy balance partitions also aid in this spatial distinction teixeira et al 2013 estimated the energy balance in the same study area of the present article applying the safer and sureal in modis images from 2010 to 2011 different energy partitions were obtained between the irrigated and natural species with the highest annual fractions of rn being used as h in the caatinga 78 and as λe 71 in irrigated areas on some occasions within the irrigated plots the heat horizons of the naturally drier areas were observed teixeira et al 2017 applied safer and sureal to images of landsat 8 in petrolina involving different thermohydrological conditions in 2014 the respective values of λe h and g for irrigated crops and caatinga represented fractions of rn of 70 26 and 4 and 25 72 and 3 heat advection conditions were again observed throughout the year promoting in some cases values of λe being 23 higher than those of r n and negative values of h in well irrigated crops daily g rn fractions ranged from 2 to 5 in both land uses without strong distinctions this result is in agreement with teixeira 2010 and teixeira et al 2017 which studied the same area consoli and papa 2013 reported a daily fraction of 0 01 in orange orchards in the mediterranean semiarid climate h mean value for the natural vegetation reached almost all of the net radiation available for the soil while in the irrigated area was lower consoli and papa 2013 reached a average h rn of 30 in mediterranean semiarid conditions the irrigated area presents λe rn values greater than 1 by receiving water supplementation however the natural vegetation has very low evapotranspiration and λe rn is also lower than a irrigated area since most of its energy is converted into sensible heat h the average primary production for two dates was respectively 1 65 3 27 kg ha 1 day 1 and 1 70 5 25 kg ha 1 day 1 caatinga and 53 78 22 64 kg ha 1 day 1 and 64 45 26 58 kg ha 1 day 1 irrigated area santana et al 2008 found evidence of the correlation of production in coniferous forests with available water on the soil high irrigation providing good moisture levels in the root zone together with large r g levels increase photosynthetic activity and favors large biomass production rates bio is directly related to the product harvested through the harvest index hi the percentage of biomass effectively harvested and transformed into the final product and the fraction of carbon in the biomass teixeira et al 2015 coaguila et al 2017 silva et al 2018 evaporative fraction values indicated higher conversion of available energy to evapotranspiration in the irrigated area which was already expected teixeira et al 2008 2017 reported mean e f values of 0 80 and 0 30 for irrigated area and caatinga respectively which are close to the average pixel values shown in table 7 to avoid bias by low e t a values when calculating wp in caatinga values less than 0 3 mm day 1 were eliminated teixeira et al 2013 reported wp values in petrolina were between 1 6 and 2 2 kg m 3 while in juazeiro this range was from 1 0 to 1 6 kg m 3 some pixels have reached high values greater than 5 kg m 3 teixeira et al 2019 reported wp around 3 5 kg m 3 for dwarf coconut in the coastal areas of northeast brazil in the semi arid inner mongolia wp values of 1 1 1 3 kg m 3 for oats 1 5 2 6 kg m 3 for sunflower 0 5 1 1 kg m 3 for legumes and 3 1 4 4 kg m 3 for potato were reported yuan et al 2013 for oil seed crop under the semi arid conditions of india wp ranged from 1 9 to 2 3 kg m 3 adak et al 2013 5 discussion 5 1 potentials with the current scenario of climate change and uncertainties the use of models becomes an interesting tool for current and future projections the elaboration of more aggressive or conservative scenarios about the potential of the natural and anthropic environment to deal with water and productive potential of agricultural areas looking for sustainability dealing with this situation is not an easy task and hydrological models can help with this process similarly with the current population of eight billion people on the globe and future projections made by models the need to produce food is urgent produce more in the same area using less inputs especially water more crop per drop thus fostering the use of models applied to water and agronomic issues is important for us to advance the predictions made helping planning and decision making the main difficulty of the sebal and metric models lies in the iterative process that determines the h values and the use of anchor pixels to obtain temperature variation and aerodynamic resistance to heat transport in all pixels of an area being estimated based on wind speed and surface temperature using an internal calibration of the near surface temperature difference between the two surface levels according to bastiaanssen et al 1998 and allen et al 2007 respectively this step of these methodologies are complex and uses a solution called internal calibration that requires specific radiation knowledge and identification of extreme hydrological condition the advantage of using the safer model in energy balance modelling lies in its methodology that allows obtaining the value of λe before determining the values of h and g the evapotranspiration fraction is retrieved from surface albedo surface temperature and ndvi which is obtained by remote sensing in this way the model allows the combination of agrometeorological and spectral information for the estimation of large scale evapotranspiration in an efficient and less complex way than the sebal and metric models the output from this package is formatted as raster files tif so it can be easily used as an input to other r packages and gis geographical information systems software for further analyses post processing application of the study case section 4 3 showed examples of this potential use in r software all functions use the regression coefficients of equation 13 as arguments to allows users to calibrate the major equation of safer model for another areas where measured actual evapotranspiration is available the use of sentinel 2 images provides 10 m resolution results which can be used in precision agriculture applications on the other hand modis images provides daily surface reflectance images which can improve regional studies looking for a better water resources management 5 2 limitations our understanding of the soil plant atmosphere continuum hinges on our ability to measure and account for all the critical processes that occur in this complex environment checking missing data in input agrometeorological data or missing pixels in digital images as well as caution about projection and interpolation methods are required in developing this package we have tested with our own test data as well as a number of user provided data sets and we ensured that the package runs free of errors when all pre processing steps of the package documentation are done users also should be aware of the assumptions and limitations prior to using any function of this package there are several models for reference evapotranspiration estimation which contains assumptions related to the regional climate conditions for example teixeira 2010 applied penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and silva et al 2018 used automatic station eto data so users should apply the eto model that works better under the climate of the study area new calibrations are desirable to improve model results in areas where they have not yet been tested the coefficients a l eq 10 can be calibrated to improve method results also the coefficients of equation 13 which drives evapotranspiration values can be calibrated when data are available from eddy covariance bowen ratio lysimeters etc error propagation between the algorithm steps is the main source of uncertainty and emphasizes the need for calibration and validation of these various steps the safer algorithm models on a daily scale so it does not support hourly analysis 6 summary and conclusions this paper presents the r package agriwater for the spatial modelling of actual evapotranspiration and radiation balance on the soil using the simple algorithm for evapotranspiration retrieving safer the results are presented in the form of raster images in tif extension with the same resolution of the digital images which are used as input data post processing analysis can be done by using r and gis based softwares the use of safer model for large scale regional analysis were rather encouraging given the complex mixture of the ecosystems in the semiarid conditions considering that only maps of ndvi surface albedo and surface temperature together with interpolated agrometeorological data are necessary without the need of crop classification nor extreme thermohydrological conditions to set hot and cold pixels this method provides estimation of large scale evapotranspiration in an efficient and less complex way than the sebal and metric models it is hoped that this package will give a new tool to researchers looking for the spatially study of primordial variables to manage water resources and agricultural productivity implementations that make it easier to apply spatial models can increase our ability to investigate the impact of structural uncertainty in remotely sensed et model formulations via the use of ensemble modelling software availability description spatial modeling of energy balance and actual evapotranspiration using satellite images and meteorological data options of satellite are landsat 8 with and without thermal bands sentinel 2 and modis respectively spatial resolutions are 30 100 10 and 250 m user can use data from a single meteorological station or a grid of meteorological stations using any spatial interpolation method teixeira 2010 https doi org 10 3390 rs0251287 teixeira et

26153,aiming to subsidize the rational water resources management an r package called agriwater was created in order to obtain the energy balance on the soil and actual evapotranspiration using satellite imagery and agrometeorological data this package apply the simple algorithm for evapotranspiration retrieving safer to calculate the evapotranspiration fraction e t r or e t a e t 0 1 actual evapotranspiration e t a and latent heat flux λe the slob equation calculate the net radiation r n ground heat flux g is modeled from r n and the sensible heat flux h is retrieved as the residue of the energy balance equation landsat 8 with and without thermal bands sentinel 2 and modis digital images can be used results are presented in raster format and can be post processed by gis analysis or anothers r procedures a study case using sentinel 2 images and agrometeorological data of a semiarid area from brazil was performed the requirements and conditions for use of the package are explained keywords actual evapotranspiration evapotranspiration fraction net radiation latent heat flux sensible heat flux soil heat flux 1 introduction research on irrigation management is a very important topic because agricultural activities consume large volumes of water thus efforts to provide a rational and efficient use of water resources have been made to provide a good estimate of water demand in order to adequate the irrigation schedule of crops jayakumar et al 2017 filgueiras et al 2017 in this context water demands by agriculture may undergo significant modifications by leading to climate changes at both local and global scales since it depends on factors associated with soil plant and atmosphere zhang et al 2012 the evapotranspiration e t provides a link between energy and water balance in the hydrological cycle e t is defined as the transfer of liquid water to the atmosphere as water vapor from bare soil and water bodies such as rivers and lakes evaporation as well as vegetated surfaces through plants leaves transpiration allen et al 1998 et is often one of the largest fluxes of water from watersheds resende et al 2015 bhattarai et al 2017 ramírez cuesta et al 2019 so that estimating its water flux is critical for many applications estimation of large scale et using space based observations has gained popularity with the advancement in optical and thermal remote sensing bastiaanssen et al 1998 allen et al 2007 teixeira 2010 singh et al 2014 senay et al 2017 vanino et al 2018 the long term trends of e t and its drivers need to be understood and quantified under changing climatic conditions to address water security issues related to water rights water allocation crop water use efficiency urban water supply and industrial water use increasing e t over the past 50 years was reported walter et al 2004 for several large basins across the conterminous united states the e t is partitioned in reference evapotranspiration e t 0 and actual evapotranspiration e t a e t o is considered as the water flow of a reference surface as the grass with specific characteristics such as a albedo value equal to 0 23 and the leaf area index lai 2 88 asce 2005 while e t a is the actual water flow that occurs involving all environmental conditions on the other hand in well irrigated crops the values of the evapotranspiration fraction e t r e t a e t 0 1 known as the crop coefficient kc if refers to applications in well irrigated areas are used to estimate the water requirements allen et al 1998 consoli and papa 2013 on the other hand in natural vegetation this indicator can be used to characterize water stress conditions lu et al 2011 agrometeorological parameters vegetation characteristics management and environmental aspects affect et teixeira et al 2016 other factors to be considered are ground cover plant density plant architecture microclimate and soil moisture crop practices and the type of irrigation system can affct the microclimate mainly the canopy characteristics and the moisture content of the soil and the plants the effect of soil moisture on water fluxes is primarily conditioned by the magnitude of the water deficit and soil characteristics carlson and ripley 1997 on the other hand too much water will result in water logging which might damage the root and limit root water uptake by inhibiting respiration for these reasons the quantification of et is indispensable for water management in irrigated crops because it represents the water demand of the crop to be used for irrigation schedule the combination of remote sensing with agrometeorological data allows the evaluation of water balance and radiation parameters to improve irrigation management and diagnosis of the required amount of water to be applied the evaluation of ecosystem responses to environmental conditions variations also can be done by means of energy balance represented by their partitions in latent heat sensible heat and soil heat fluxes krishnan et al 2012 chen et al 2009 there are several studies about energy and mass fluxes on different vegetated surfaces zhang et al 2012 huizhi and jianwu 2012 hu et al 2009 as well as their dependence on biophysical and meteorological variables chen et al 2009 yang et al 2011 remote sensing measures reflected radiation and by making use of such measurements as forward model of the interaction of light with the earth s surface it is possible to inversely estimate properties of the earth s surface land cover type biomass and leaf area index for each image pixel can be modeled such properties represent spatially varying states at particular points in time bastiaanssen et al 2000 teixeira et al 2009a b palacios orueta et al 2012 it is difficult to quantify such fluxes for composite landscape to derive et single source land surface energy balance models are often used among the most widely used are the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 its successor mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 and the simplified surface energy balance sseb senay et al 2016 the disadvantage of many remote sensing energy balance methods such as sebal metric and sebs is the need of mapping thermohydrological extreme conditions the so called anchor pixels with extreme temperature and vegetation or water in the case of sebal conditions for example a cold healthy fully vegetated and irrigated field pixel has to be identified to calibrate the model internally in addition to a hot dry bare soil pixel allen et al 2013 this might limit the applicability of metric to identify et in times when agriculture is not at its peak or following a wet event in spring or winter where such a hot pixel cannot be easily fetched pôças et al 2014 another problem to the practical applicability of the remote sensing energy balance models aiming at the end users is the need of background knowledge in radiation physics involved in the description of these algorithms on the other hand the suitability of applying the penman monteith pm equation by the surface conductance algorithm has been shown by using remotely sensed vegetation indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi together with weather data cleugh et al 2007 so although the sebal and metric had been calibrated and validated with field radiation and energy balance measurements showing satisfactory performances for example in the brazilian semiarid region teixeira et al 2009a b folhes et al 2009 the major difficulty in its applicability for deriving estimates for the whole year is the assumption of zero latent heat flux λe for dry pixels this is because during the rainy season the mixed ecosystems of irrigated crops and natural vegetation are homogenously wet with the whole region presenting high et rates for these reasons a simpler method to retrieve actual evapotranspiration is desirable simple algorithm for evapotranspiration retrieving safer is an algorithm for estimating large scale et formulated by teixeira 2010 which has the advantage of not being mandatory the use of anchor pixels nor the use of thermal bands which can also be used in the absence of measured temperature data different from sebal and metric and for this reason is a more operationally application than others methods safer model requires agrometeorological data of reference evapotranspiration e t o global radiation r g and average air temperature t a to be integrated with radiometrically data from digital images this algorithm has the additional advantage of the possibility for using daily weather data from either conventional or automatic agrometeorological stations this is an important characteristic because it allows a historical evaluation of the energy balance components on a large scale as data from automatic sensors are results from relatively recent advances on instrumental technology safer was recently developed in the semiarid conditions of brazil which has already been validated with field data from four flux stations involving irrigated crops and natural vegetation teixeira et al 2012 this paper presents an r software package to spatially model the actual evapotranspiration and energy balance using remote sensing data from landsat 8 sentinel 2 and modis images together with a agrometeorological data by the safer algorithm the safer model is described in section 2 of this article the r package agriwater is described in section 3 including the pre processing of the digital images included as well as the package structure and core functions in section 3 also a study case in a semiarid area of northeast brazil is presented with various features of the package including 1 data pre processing 2 estimation of all results from the package use and producing summaries and plots of results and 3 examples of post processing with the raster results to make another useful spatial analysis in section 4 potentials and limitations of the package are discussed which are followed by the conclusions in section 5 2 energy balance and actual evapotranspiration modelling by simple algorithm for evapotranspiration retrieving safer safer arose from the need for an operationalization of actual evapotranspiration modelling seeking a model that did not require anchor pixels such as sebal and metric initially it was named as pm2 model teixeira et al 2009 because it was an adaptation of the penman monteith equation and from teixeira et al 2012 received the current name it is an algorithm because it requires as main inputs surface albedo data ndvi and surface temperature which are obtained sequentially from equations that relate radiometric data from multispectral images and agrometeorological data a flowchart with these relationships is presented in fig 1 all the regression coefficients of the parameters in fig 1 and equations below were determined in different areas of brazil with digital images from different satellites like landsat teixeira et al 2017 2016 2015a 2014 coaguila et al 2017 and modis teixeira et al 2015b and field measurements involving strong contrasting agroecosystems and under different thermohydrological conditions throughout several years table 1 shows information about sentinel 2 landsat 8 and modis which provides digital images that can be used as input for safer the sentinel 2 mission is a constellation with two twin satellites sentinel 2a was launched on 23 june 2015 and sentinel 2b was launched on 7 march 2017 it provides multi spectral images in 13 bands at different spatial resolutions including three visible rgb and one near infrared nir bands at 10 m spatial resolution six red edge and shortwave infrared swir bands at 20 m and three atmospheric correction bands at 60 m acquired at a swath width of 290 km and a three day temporal resolution the landsat 8 satellite was launched on february 11 2013 and comes from a partnership between the usgs united states geological survey and nasa national aeronautics and space administration usgs 2017 it has two sensors oli operational land imager with nine bands and tirs thermal infrared sensor with two bands usgs 2017 modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer is a sensor that was launched into earth orbit by nasa in 1999 on board the terra eos am satellite and in 2002 on board the aqua eos pm satellite modis capture data in 36 spectral bands ranging in wavelength from 0 4 μm to 14 4 μm and at varying spatial resolutions 2 bands at 250 m 5 bands at 500 m and 29 bands at 1 km teixeira et al 2015b the following sections presents the equations that make up the safer algorithm its three main inputs are surface albedo ndvi and surface temperature surface albedo and ndvi are obtained directly from satellite imagery data the surface temperature can be obtained either from thermal bands when modelling with landsat 8 data or from a model using data from satellite and agrometeorological stations optionally when using landsat 8 data and mandatorily when using sentinel 2 and modis imagery 2 1 radiance and reflectance from landsat 8 digital number to convert the quantized and calibrated digital numbers dn of the landsat 8 oli sensor system into radiance and spectral reflectance radiometric coefficients available in the image metadata file were used at first atmospheric corrections were made and the digital values were converted into spectral radiance chander and markham 2003 for each band by eq 1 and radiance l band is the radiant intensity per area projected source in a direction being measured in watts per square meter per steradian w m 2 sr 1 1 l b a n d l m a x l m i n 255 d n d n m i n where l m a x and l m i n represent the maximum and minimum radiances d n is the digital number of each pixel and d n m i n is the minimum digital number of the satellite image d n m a x l m a x and l m i n are given by metadata of landsat 8 usgs 2017 for each band the reflectances r band are calculated according to eq 2 2 r band π l b a n d e s u n b a n d cos z e 0 where e s u n b a n d represent the spectral irradiance at the top of atmosphere z is the zenithal angle and e 0 is the daily angle given by the earth position related to the sun in given geographical coordinate and day of year doy 2 2 surface albedo albedo is defined as the ratio between reflected and incident sunlight and is an important parameter in the study of climate change desertification fires and environmental impacts silva et al 2005 for retrieving surface albedo α 0 following fig 2 firstly the planetary albedo for the visible and infrared partition of the electromagnetic spectrum α p was calculated as the total sum of the different narrow band reflectances r b a n d values according to weights for each band w b a n d according to eq 3 this equation is used for sentinel 2 and landsat 8 modelling 3 α p w b a n d r b a n d modis satellite has a particular equation for the planetary albedo eq 4 that contains a coefficient a teixeira et al 2013 4 α p a w b a n d r b a n d the weights for the different bands was computed as the ration of the amount of the incoming shortwave radiation from the sum in each band and the sum of incoming shortwave radiation for the bands at the top of the atmosphere toa table 2 presents weights for each satellite the daily α 0 values were obtained according to eq 5 5 α 0 b α p c where b and c are regression coefficients which for a 24 h period was considered as 1 70 and 0 13 obtained from field and satellite measurements teixeira et al 2008 teixeira et al 2014a teixeira et al 2014b and was calibrated with a r2 0 96 teixeira 2010 2 3 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the ndvi normalized difference vegetation index is an indicator related to the land cover and vegetation stages rouse et al 1974 obtained from satellite image as eq 6 6 n d v i r n i r r r e d r n i r r r e d where r n i r and r r e d represent the reflectance over the range of wavelengths in the near infrared nir and red red regions of the solar spectrum respectively purevdorj et al 1998 and filgueiras et al 2019a studied direct relationships between vegetation cover and satellite indexes including ndvi ribeiro et al 2017 and risso et al 2012 concluded that ndvi was efficient in differentiating phenological stages of the corn and soybean crop respectively 2 4 surface temperature for acquiring the energy and water balance components from satellite images in general their thermal bands are used for estimating the remotely sensed temperature by using the thermal region from the landsat 8 sensor the spectral radiance from the band 10 and 11 were converted into radiometric temperatures applicable at the top of the atmosphere tb by eq 7 7 t b k k 2 k l n k 1 k l k 1 where l k are the pixel values of bands 10 and 11 and k1k and k2k are conversion coefficients available in the metadata of landsat 8 images the average value between tb10 and tb11 is corrected to retrieve the surface temperature by a regression curve by eq 8 8 t s d t b f where d a n d f a r e the regression coefficients which for a 24 h period was considered as 1 11 and 31 89 and was calibrated with a r2 0 95 teixeira 2010 however if the satellite does not have a thermal band there is also the possibility of retrieve the surface temperature using grids of air temperature together with satellite measurements by applying the residual method according to silva et al 2018 the daily surface temperature t s values can be estimated by equation 9 9 t s ε a σ t a 4 a l τ s w ε s σ 4 where τ s w is the shortwave atmosphere transmissivity defined as 44 of r g to the incident solar radiation at the top of atmosphere teixeira et al 2008 teixeira 2010 values ε a and ε s are respectively the atmospheric and surface emissivities σ is the stefan boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 4 and a l coefficient can be explained by daily variations teixeira et al 2014b silva et al 2018 by equation 10 10 a l c t a d where t a is the daily average air temperature from agrometeorological station inside the study area with leaf area index lai of 2 88 and estimated albedo of 0 23 r g is the 24 h values of global solar radiation and c and d are regression coefficients equal to 6 99 and 39 93 teixeira et al 2014a the main uncertainties associated with surface temperature modelling come from obtaining a l eq 10 because the air temperature is measured on a standard surface that is not affected by the roughness generated by different types of vegetation bastiaanssen et al 1998 applied a constant value of a l 110 without considering the local thermal conditions filgueiras et al 2019b applied machine learning methods to model the surface temperature and emphasizes its complexity following teixeira et al 2008 and teixeira et al 2014a ε a and ε s were calculated as 11 ε a a a l n τ s w b a 12 ε s a s ln n d v i b s where a a b a a s and b s are regression which from teixeira 2010 were considered respectively 0 94 0 10 0 06 and 1 00 teixeira et al 2009 calibrated ε a and ε s with r2 of 0 75 and 0 90 respectively 2 5 evapotranspiration fraction and actual evapotranspiration retrivieng the ratio between actual evapotranspiration e t a and reference evapotranspiration e t o so called evapotranspiration fraction or crop coefficient e t r was calculated according to equation 13 following the technical formalism we named e t r of crop coefficient when a modelling is performed on irrigated areas respecting the nomenclature from the fao 56 manual allen et al 1998 and evapotranspiration fraction in areas without irrigation as natural vegetation and rainfed crops because it is a less restricted term 13 e t r e t a e t o e x p e f t s α 0 n d v i where e and f are regression coefficients being 1 8 and 0 008 respectively teixeira 2010 calibrated this equation and obtained a r2 0 91 a advantage of eq 13 compared with bastiaanssen et al 1998 and allen et al 2007 is the possibility of application in any environment according to the thermal conditions without the need for an anchor pixel teixeira 2010 has demonstrated that there are no significant differences between the daily and satellite overpass values of the etr ratio the ratio can also be a good option as an input parameter for the soil moisture estimations at the regional scale teixeira 2010 silva et al 2018 these coefficients was successfully applied to areas with different land uses silva et al 2018 for example applied in watersheds occupied by eucalyptus sugar cane pasture and forest finally e t a is derived by eq 14 14 e t a e t r e t 0 e t a is composed of soil evaporation and plant transpiration and depends primarily on energy supply the vapor pressure gradient between surface and atmosphere and wind speed aggregates in reference evapotranspiration evaporation in soil specifically is directly dependent on soil moisture soil water content and its ability to conduct water to the roots should be considered allen et al 1998 fig 2 presents a simplified sensitivity analysis of the safer in each graph in fig 2 one of the inputs of the safer model is variable and the other two are fixed the fixed value was 25 c for the surface temperature 0 50 for the ndvi and of 0 15 for the surface albedo low surface temperature values reduce water uptake by plant roots by causing reduced permeability and increasing water viscosity which increases resistance to water flows on the soil this effect is predicted by the safer as can be seen in the curve where albedo and ndvi are fixed and the surface temperature varies generating a smaller evapotranspiration fraction with its increase kramer and kozlowski 1979 consider that the kc doubles with a decrease from 25 c to 5 c this effect is quite effective in reference evapotranspiration calculations which is offset by the e t r which gives the low surface temperature pixels greater weight the increase of albedo or ndvi generate an increase in the e t r the e t r in crops without water stress is considered analogous to the crop coefficient kc in natural vegetation e t r characterizes a index of the moisture in the root zone of plants 2 6 radiation and energy balance net radiation r n plays a fundamental role in biophysical processes involving exchanges of energy and mass in the planetary boundary layer since it constitutes the main energy source used in the heating of soil and air and in plant evapotranspiration r n is partitioned into latent heat λ e the energy needed for et sensible heat flux h and soil heat flux or heat flux to the materials from which water evaporates g other energy terms such as heat stored or released in or from canopies or the energy used in metabolic activities are in general not considered because they account only for a small fraction of daily r n and may be neglected in environmental studies the atmosphere warms up when r n is positive net radiation r n mj m 2 day 1 represents the difference between the energy flux densities that enter and leave the surface involving all the wavelengths and is modeled by the slob s equation bruin and stricker 2000 teixeira et al 2015a in eq 15 that was derived by teixeira et al 2008 considering four energy balance field experiments involving different thermohydrological conditions in brazil 15 r n 1 α 0 r g a l τ s w where τ s w is the shortwave atmosphere transmissivity defined as the ratio of r g to the incident solar radiation at the top of atmosphere heat energy storage terms of the soil plant canopy ecosystem can be examined from the complete steady state surface energy balance equation of the system defined as the following eq 16 16 r n λ e h g where r n is the net radiation received at the soil plant surfaces λe is the latent heat flux h is the sensible heat exchange with the atmosphere through convection and g is the soil heat flux all terms in equation 16 can be expressed in w m 2 or mj m 2 d 1 being either positive or negative the energy balance process is illustrated in fig 3 the changes in the air mass temperature and humidity below the flux measurement height are storage terms that were not accounted for in this analysis equation 16 states that the r n is redistributed over h λe and g considering only vertical fluxes and ignoring the net rate at which energy is being transferred horizontally by advection however this term can be significant near the edges of crops or natural vegetation et is the process of energy consuming by the agroecosystem which can be represented as the latent heat flux λe in the radiation balance on the soil as a first approximation an e t a of 1 mm day 1 is equivalent to a λe of 28 w m 2 or 2 45 mj m 2 in this paper the basic unit for energy variables is mj eq 17 show the transformation of e t a into latent heat flux 17 λ e 2 45 e t a soil heat flux g mj m 2 day 1 represents the amount of radiant energy absorbed or released at the soil surface during a given time period and equation 18 was used 18 g r n g exp h α 0 where g and h are regression coefficients which from teixeira et al 2008 were considered respectively 3 98 and 31 98 teixeira 2010 calibrated this equation with r2 0 90 g depends on soil temperature gradient and soil thermal conductivity which are hard to determine using thermal remote sensing data this parameter defines the available energy r n g to be converted to sensible or latent heat the generally practiced neglect of the g term in the energy balance equation is not agronomically justified in view of associated sub soil migration of moisture g is difficult to measure because it includes conduction and convection heat transfer processes heitman et al 2010 however g is a necessary input for many evaporation measurements and prediction techniques evaporation measured with the bowen ratio energy approach is dependent on an accurate value for the available energy and the fraction of soil heat flux to net radiation varies from 0 1 to 0 3 from well vegetated land to bare soil conditions teixeira et al 2015 the sensible heat flux h mj m 2 day 1 was estimated as the residue of the energy balance equation 19 h r n λ e g safer was created to estimate e t a without the need for ground energy balance calculation teixeira et al 2015 initiated the application of safer in the energy balance modelling this is another difference of this method compared with sebal and metric because they start from the energy balance to estimate e t a after the first application of safer in semiarid areas from brazil simple calibrations were made for its use in northwest são paulo climatic conditions by hernandez et al 2014 with landsat 5 images the authors compared the safer results with the results of the surface energy balance algorithm for land algorithm sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 and the culture coefficient methodology kc allen et al 1998 in corn bean and sugarcane crops irrigated by central pivots the et obtained from the application of both algorithms was higher than that estimated by the fao method and the overestimations were related to errors in the phenological stages considerations when applying the tabulated kc values however safer presented better performance than sebal especially in the initial period of the crop when there are conditions of partial soil cover by vegetative canopies also in the northwest of são paulo teixeira et al 2014 applied safer to determine energy balance components in pivots with corn crop landsat 5 images covering all phenological phases allowed us to establish a relationship between these components and the accumulated degree days ddac from planting to harvest in the northeast of são paulo teixeira et al 2016 quantified the energy and mass exchanges between different agroecosystems applying safer with the product mod13q1 during 2015 for sugarcane coffee and natural vegetation respectively the fractions of rn used as λe were 68 87 and 77 whereas for h these were 27 7 and 16 and in the case of g these were 5 6 and 7 it can be concluded that the sugarcane crop presented lower water consumption than coffee in the annual scale which is an advantage in the current conditions of water scarcity however the replacement of natural vegetation by sugarcane crop could contribute to environmental warming while cooling was observed in the case of coffee crop silva et al 2018 applied safer in an area in southeast brazil which presents a vast agricultural landscape mosaic using sentinel 2 images evapotranspiration fraction ranges for the period studied 2014 2018 were 0 92 1 35 in the area occupied by sugarcane crop 0 56 0 94 pasture 1 17 1 56 silviculture and 1 05 1 36 forest in the same study area silva et al 2019 applied safer and spatial analysis of surface runoff to estimate groundwater recharge potential by water balance to model groundwater level in 39 shallow wells the average annual groundwater recharge potential for each of the land uses pasture sugarcane crop silviculture and forest varied between 15 and 50 of the rainfall in southern brazil a region characterized by a subtropical climate leivas et al 2015 successfully applied safer for e t a determination during all rice phenological stages using bands 1 and 2 of the mod13q1 product the average pixel for the initial phase of culture was 1 9 1 0 mm day 1 in the development phase it reached 4 9 mm day 1 falling to a minimum of 1 8 0 8 mm day 1 during the harvest period the average value for the entire production cycle was 2 3 1 0 mm day 1 once again the sensitivity of the algorithm was detected to detect the dynamics of the components of the energy and water balances in this case in annual crops from southern brazil in the coastal areas of northeast brazil teixeira et al 2019 analyzed e t a for dwarf coconut crops finding mean values of 4 0 0 6 mm day 1 safer was also applied with the modis mod13q1 product in the brazilian wetland wetland region to determine the radiation and energy balance in its different ecosystems teixeira et al 2015d the available energy r n g used as λe were on average 65 50 and 49 in the barão de melgaço paiaguás and nhecolândia mesoregions respectively the successful application of safer in tropical semiarid subtropical and wetland areas of brazil shows the versatility and applicability of this algorithm 3 r package agriwater r www r project org is an open source programming environment which is gaining rapidly in usage across a many wide ranges of disciplines r core team 2019 it is an interpreted language that offers excellent interactive analysis capabilities and is ideal for the rapid development of statistical and data analysis applications its native language allows the development of new algorithms from a wide variety of mathematical statistical and graphical functions input and output facilities and operators for vectors and matrices in addition to the basic operations r can be extended by installing packages developed by software users one of the principal advantages of r for the agriwater project is that it is free and open source it is very robust and works on a wide range of platforms including microsoft windows apple os x and linux ensuring that all the examples in an r package run as expected is part of the system of package development and testing in r packages submitted to cran are required to go through extensive checks of both the code and documentation and to ensure all provided examples run as expected these checks are made on a daily basis this process ensures that all code runs exactly as intended package development also strongly encourages the use of comprehensive help files thus formalizing and structuring the different functions contained in a package the package agriwater has been structured and planned in order to aggregate the best practices described by researchers who have conducted studies with the safer model input data are a shapefile mask of the study area datasets of reference evapotranspiration e t o global radiation r g and average air temperature t a and reflectances from sentinel 2 or modis satellite or digital numbers from landsat 8 in this way three basic questions are asked to choose which function to use for the study area is there a single weather agrometeorological station or a network of stations from which satellite will the images come landsat 8 sentinel 2 or modis if landsat 8 images are used will the thermal bands be used too table 3 presents a summary of the functions available in the package agriwater if there is only one agrometeorological station one must choose one of the functions of the first column if there is a network of stations the functions of the second column will be used in the third column are secondary functions that aid researchers who only want the surface albedo or the reflectances of landsat 8 functions are specific to each satellite functions with s2 in the command name indicates that it uses sentinel 2 satellite images l8 indicates the use of landsat 8 l8t the use of landsat 8 including thermal bands and modis the use of modis no functions were created for the use of the modis and sentinel 2 thermal bands because it has spatial resolution of 1 km which would excessively increase uncertainty the modelling with 250 and 10 m respectively the coefficients e and f of equation 13 are in the function argument to allow the calibration of this equation to new areas of study that do not have good results with the existing calibrations when there is an unique value for the study area on the day of the satellite passage this value is reported in the function argument when there is a network of stations the spatial interpolation of these values must be performed within the study area and generate raster files with names equal to those of the single valued functions argument r g tif t a tif e t 0 tif doy and decimal degree coordinates are required to calculate the maximum solar irradiance input on the day of the satellite passage which governs the calculation of shortwave atmosphere transmissivity eq 11 for this reason digital images must be converted to coordinate projections in decimal degrees previously this verification was not included in the package since the available conversion functions are still heavy for high and medium resolution images and can be performed in other gis software table 4 presents a brief description input data and outputs of each command available in the package agriwater the functions started with kc characterize the evapotranspiration fraction e t r which is analogous to the crop coefficient from allen et al 1998 when the analysis is performed in well irrigated areas the functions started with evapo characterizes the actual evapotranspiration and therefore requires e t 0 the functions started with radiation perform the study of the entire energy balance note that some functions include others but they are independent in other words the study of the energy balance made by the radiation functions does not require the user to run an evapo function before in other words functions beginning with kc follow the methodology presented in this paper from eqs 1 13 evapo functions follow eqs 1 14 and radiation from eqs 1 19 thus the user chooses which function to use according to the available data table 5 describe the outputs listed in table 3 it is necessary to previously define the working folder where the function will be runned and to place the satellite images in it and the raster files with the interpolated meteorological data if necessary in this folder the output raster files will be saved other more specific specifications can be seen in the vignette of the package agriwater https cran r project org web packages agriwater vignettes agriwater html a case study is presented below with codes to exemplify the use of the package agriwater 4 study case 4 1 study area semiarid area in northeast brazil fig 4 shows the study area together with the agrometeorological stations inside the petrolina county pernambuco state and juazeiro county bahia state northeast of brazil the sandy soil is classified as latossoil red yellow with low retention capacity with a groundwater depth of around 2 5 m teixeira et al 2017 the semiarid region of brazil mostly in the northeast is influenced by disturbed currents of south north east and west in its climatology excluding high altitude sites all areas present annual average air temperatures above 24 c and even higher than 26 c in depressions with 200 m 250 m altitude the average maximum values are 33 c while for the minimum it is 19 c the average monthly values are in the range of 17 c to 29 c the rainy season is concentrated from january to april with peaks occurring in march teixeira et al 2009 according to the climatic classification of koppen the climate is bsh semi arid with a short rainy season in the summer with average temperature of 24 8 c with august being the driest month and the rainy season concentrated between the months of november and april the thermal homogeneity strongly contrasts with the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the rainfall regime according to teixeira et al 2015 68 of the annual precipitation occurs between january and april which presents a long term 50 years average value of 570 mm yr 1 the main commercial crops in the brazilian semi arid region are mango and vineyard orchards these crops are surrounded by natural vegetation the caatinga fig 4 mango orchards flourish and fruit regularly every year vines in warm tropical conditions exhibit continuous and accelerated physiological processes unlike those grown in temperate climates the caatinga species are defined as having shrub aspects with small leaves and spines distributed irregularly on the soil surface teixeira et al 2009 algorithms such as sebal and metric were calibrated and validated by using energy balance measurements in the field presenting favorable performance in the brazilian semiarid conditions teixeira et al 2009a b folhes et al 2009 however there is a need for the simultaneous existence of extreme thermohydrological conditions for provide a anchor pixel hot and cold pixel which are difficult to obtain during the rainy season in this region since in this period all species of ecosystems mixed species of irrigated crops and natural vegetation are in homogeneous moisture conditions in the root zone and present high rates of e t a with favorable thermal conditions teixeira et al 2009 teixeira 2010 validated safer for the study area with four field experiments involved measurements of e t a with bowen ratio and eddy covariance this validation involved measurements covering two growing seasons of irrigated fruit crops wine grape table grape mango orchard and two years with different rainfall conditions in natural vegetation caatinga and resulted in excellent results with r2 0 9 for equation 13 4 2 r package agriwater procedures and results analyis visible and near infrared spectral bands of images from the sentinel 2 satellite with 10 m spatial resolution of may 13 2016 doy 134 and august 22 2016 doy 235 were used global solar radiation r g air temperature t a and reference evapotranspiration e t 0 data were obtained from automatic agrometeorological stations indicated in the map of fig 2 the land use of the study area in 2016 was adapted of the map made by mapbiomas http mapbiomas org a complete example code for energy balance and evapotranspiration analysis is presented in table a1 in appendix a all sentinel 2 images in one of the doys studied are stored in the r workspace indicated by the setwd command the packages raster rgdal and sp must be installed before using the package agriwater for the first time the gstat package is suggested to perform the spatial interpolation process of the variables rg ta and eto the idw command will be used for the interpolation raster files are generated with the writeraster command there is also a suggestion of code for reprojection of the digital images if necessary finally with the command radiation s2 grid of the package agriwater is generated the modelling of energy balance and evapotranspiration fig 5 is a screenshot of data processing and et estimation with evapo s2 grid for this case study exposing the eta modelling result with plot fig 5 presents the complete energy balance and evapotranspiration outputs from package agriwater figs 6 and 7 were done with qgis 3 4 mapping tools using the raster files provided by agriwater the inputs of safer model fig 6 are produced with agriwater package and can be understood as an output if just these variables are desired besides that they help the user to analyze the results of the model table 6 shows that the average daily values of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi surface temperature and albedo the crop coefficient or evapotranspiration fraction actual evapotranspiration net radiation latent sensible and ground heat fluxes on caatinga and irrigated areas in the irrigated areas ndvi reached values higher than 0 7 evidencing the vegetation response to irrigation in areas with natural vegetation the ndvi was around 0 25 and presented negative values in the são francisco river barbosa et al 2011 verified a lag of time response between the ndvi and the occurrence of precipitation in the brazilian northeast semiarid region in the mixed agroecosystems of the brazilian semiarid region the darker surfaces of the vegetation have low values of surface albedo absorbing more solar radiation than lighter ones depending also on the soil moisture conditions teixeira et al 2008 through field measurements in the caatinga teixeira et al 2008 reported the dependence of α 0 on rainfall conditions ranging from 0 10 to 0 18 similar to that shown in fig 7 but this variable as the net radiation were homogeneous along the field without strong distinctions among irrigated and natural vegetation the surface temperature affects the available energy by interference in the long wave radiation balance net radiation was higher in the irrigated area than in caatinga due to the higher albedo in caatinga lower values occurred in irrigated crops compared to drier areas of natural vegetation in well irrigated crops the concept of etr is equivalent to that of the crop coefficient kc and can be used to estimate water requirements at different spatial and temporal scales teixeira et al 2012 in the caatinga species this indicator characterizes the moisture conditions in the root zone lu et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 studying steppes in mongolia china found seasonal variations of etr with daily mean values of 0 16 and maxima of 0 75 inferior to the irrigated crops and superior to the caatinga species of the current study however lu et al 2011 in the same chinese region reported etr values greater than 1 00 for six different ecosystems like those for well irrigated crops of the são francisco river surface albedo and actual evapotranspiration had low standard deviation in the irrigated area in percentage terms indicating good irrigation uniformity the average e t a for two dates was respectively 0 09 0 10 mm and 0 12 0 14 mm for caatinga vegetation and 3 45 0 79 mm and 3 59 0 58 mm for irrigated area caatinga vegetation presented the lowest values of actual evapotranspiration around 0 1 mm contrasting with the irrigated areas particularly in semiarid regions the e t a process play a major role in the hydrologic cycle since most of precipitation is evaporated or transpired by plants however physical interactions on the soil vegetation atmosphere continuum are one of the most difficult and complex hydrologic components to be modelled kim and kaluarachchi 2017 xu and singh 2005 the energy available in the system usually is used for heating the air and on irrigated areas is consumed by the evapotranspiratory process and for this reason presented higher values of latent heat flux while the caatinga vegetation converts most of the available energy into sensible heat h teixeira et al 2008 the higher values of λe were accompanied by the more negative correspondent values of h evidencing an additional horizontal energy to the crop caused by irrigation while in the natural vegetation area the values of λe decreased and h had the highest positive values the peaks of λe are within the range found by folhes et al 2009 from 7 4 to 14 7 mj m 2day 1 with application of the metric model in irrigated fruit trees in the semi arid conditions of the brazilian northeast as well as in the study by consoli and papa 2013 that negative values of h were verified through measurements with a system of turbulent correlations in orange orchard in the mediterranean semi arid conditions in sicily italy the coefficient a l averaged 146 for our semi arid condition similar to the average value of 143 reported by teixeira et al 2009a b this value is higher than the originally suggested value of 110 found for the netherlands bastiaanssen et al 1998 teixeira et al 2009a b if this value if this value were applied to the brazilian semiarid would generate high bias as already reported by teixeira et al 2009a b the difference can be ascribed to different thermal conditions between the macroclimates silva et al 2012 reported a mean value of kc of 0 73 in irrigated dwarf coconut plantation within the range found for the mixed agroecosystems of the current study for sugarcane crop covering the entire soil eksteen et al 2014 found values between 1 10 and 1 50 in petrolina measurements of soil water balance in hoses by azevedo et al 2003 found kc mean values of 0 71 while in the same region teixeira et al 2009 found kc values between 0 63 and 0 91 for vines in semi arid conditions in northeast brazil santos et al 2010 applied the sebal and s sebs algorithms with landsat images and reached maximum et values of 6 0 mm day 1 for the irrigated cotton crop under brazilian semi arid conditions also in this region but in this case using the metric model folhes et al 2009 found e t a rates between 3 0 and 6 0 mm day 1 for irrigated fruit trees similar to those in this current study 4 3 post processing with agriwater products the results generated by the agriwater package can be applied to other models of interest to water management following are models and their spatial results are discussed table a2 presents the source code for this post processing linked to et there is the production of biomass which is fundamental for understanding the dynamics of energy and carbon fluxes in soil purevdorj et al 1998 in agroecosystems with varied land uses the relationship between radiometric data obtained from a canopy or vegetated field and parameters that categorize the growth stages of plants is the principle used for the study of biomass production by remote sensing the combination of measurements of electromagnetic radiation reflected by vegetation in some spectral bands results in vegetation indices vi using vegetation indexes it is possible to reduce the dimensionality of the data and to highlight the spectral response of the vegetation when related to the soil carlson and ripley 1997 the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation apar was approximated directly from par according to equation 20 it s the part of the short wave solar radiation 0 3 3 0 μm that supports photosynthesis in green plants 20 a p a r f p a r p a r where f par was estimated from the ndvi values according to equation 21 considered for a mixture of arable crop types the following coefficients bastiaanssen and ali 2003 21 f p a r i n d v i j where the coefficients i and j were considered respectively to be 1 257 and 0 161 bastiaanssen and ali 2003 teixeira 2010 and the primary production of biomass bio was quantified according to equation 22 teixeira et al 2014 2015a coaguila et al 2017 22 bio ε m a x e t r a p a r 0 864 where 0 864 is a unit conversion factor and ε m a x is the maximum light use efficiency which according to monteith 1972 varies only with c3 and c4 crops if not water stressed in the present study ε m a x was considered 2 5 2 5 g mj 1 which is an average value for c3 crops found in the literature bastiaanssen and ali 2003 the improvements of monteith s model have resulted in correction terms for environmental conditions including soil moisture and heat stresses teixeira et al 2009b to classify the energy transference of the radiation balance parameters ratios as h r n λe r n and g r n were calculated for each pixel the knowledge of this fractions is relevant to considering the land use change and climate change effects teixeira et al 2017 looking for classify the vegetated surface as irrigated crops and natural vegetation the sureal surface resistance algorithm model formulated by teixeira 2010 to estimate the water fluxes resistance r s was applied following equation 23 23 r s l m t s α 0 1 n d v i where l and m are regression coefficients considered respectively 0 04 e 2 72 for the brazilian semiarid condition pixels with r s values bellow 800 s m 1 and ndvi above or equal to 0 40 were considered as irrigated crops if r s was in between 800 and 10000 s m 1 they should be natural vegetation the high end of this last range was considered to eliminate humankind structures or bare soil teixeira 2010 calibrated this equation with a r2 0 93 the evaporative fraction e f was retrivied by eq 24 sebal and metric use this concept as the basis for evapotranspiration modelling here e f is used as an indicator of soil moisture this parameter quantifies the percentage of available energy that is converted into evapotranspiration 24 e f λ e r n g for water productivity wp analysis eq 25 was used 25 w p b i o e t a wp may be defined as the ratio of the net benefits from crop forestry fishery livestock and mixed agricultural systems to the amount of water required to produce those benefits considering vegetation wp can be biomass production bio per water consumed including that originated from rainfall irrigation seepage and changes in root zone storage molden et al 2007 according to li et al 2016 wp is more affected by agronomy practices than by climatic factors and its improvements should be based on advanced technologies involving crop and water management table 7 presents the average values of biomass primary production and the radiation transference ratios in caatinga and irrigated areas for each doy fig 8 present the maps of the post processing products the lowest rs values indicated well root zone moisture conditions less resistance to water fluxes while the highest ones may be related to drier conditions the spatial and temporal variations are very clear bringing additional confidence to the sureal algorithm for classify land by water and vegetation different conditions on large scales the parameter r s increases with decreasing e t a thus there was one more way to differentiate irrigated areas of caatinga energy balance partitions also aid in this spatial distinction teixeira et al 2013 estimated the energy balance in the same study area of the present article applying the safer and sureal in modis images from 2010 to 2011 different energy partitions were obtained between the irrigated and natural species with the highest annual fractions of rn being used as h in the caatinga 78 and as λe 71 in irrigated areas on some occasions within the irrigated plots the heat horizons of the naturally drier areas were observed teixeira et al 2017 applied safer and sureal to images of landsat 8 in petrolina involving different thermohydrological conditions in 2014 the respective values of λe h and g for irrigated crops and caatinga represented fractions of rn of 70 26 and 4 and 25 72 and 3 heat advection conditions were again observed throughout the year promoting in some cases values of λe being 23 higher than those of r n and negative values of h in well irrigated crops daily g rn fractions ranged from 2 to 5 in both land uses without strong distinctions this result is in agreement with teixeira 2010 and teixeira et al 2017 which studied the same area consoli and papa 2013 reported a daily fraction of 0 01 in orange orchards in the mediterranean semiarid climate h mean value for the natural vegetation reached almost all of the net radiation available for the soil while in the irrigated area was lower consoli and papa 2013 reached a average h rn of 30 in mediterranean semiarid conditions the irrigated area presents λe rn values greater than 1 by receiving water supplementation however the natural vegetation has very low evapotranspiration and λe rn is also lower than a irrigated area since most of its energy is converted into sensible heat h the average primary production for two dates was respectively 1 65 3 27 kg ha 1 day 1 and 1 70 5 25 kg ha 1 day 1 caatinga and 53 78 22 64 kg ha 1 day 1 and 64 45 26 58 kg ha 1 day 1 irrigated area santana et al 2008 found evidence of the correlation of production in coniferous forests with available water on the soil high irrigation providing good moisture levels in the root zone together with large r g levels increase photosynthetic activity and favors large biomass production rates bio is directly related to the product harvested through the harvest index hi the percentage of biomass effectively harvested and transformed into the final product and the fraction of carbon in the biomass teixeira et al 2015 coaguila et al 2017 silva et al 2018 evaporative fraction values indicated higher conversion of available energy to evapotranspiration in the irrigated area which was already expected teixeira et al 2008 2017 reported mean e f values of 0 80 and 0 30 for irrigated area and caatinga respectively which are close to the average pixel values shown in table 7 to avoid bias by low e t a values when calculating wp in caatinga values less than 0 3 mm day 1 were eliminated teixeira et al 2013 reported wp values in petrolina were between 1 6 and 2 2 kg m 3 while in juazeiro this range was from 1 0 to 1 6 kg m 3 some pixels have reached high values greater than 5 kg m 3 teixeira et al 2019 reported wp around 3 5 kg m 3 for dwarf coconut in the coastal areas of northeast brazil in the semi arid inner mongolia wp values of 1 1 1 3 kg m 3 for oats 1 5 2 6 kg m 3 for sunflower 0 5 1 1 kg m 3 for legumes and 3 1 4 4 kg m 3 for potato were reported yuan et al 2013 for oil seed crop under the semi arid conditions of india wp ranged from 1 9 to 2 3 kg m 3 adak et al 2013 5 discussion 5 1 potentials with the current scenario of climate change and uncertainties the use of models becomes an interesting tool for current and future projections the elaboration of more aggressive or conservative scenarios about the potential of the natural and anthropic environment to deal with water and productive potential of agricultural areas looking for sustainability dealing with this situation is not an easy task and hydrological models can help with this process similarly with the current population of eight billion people on the globe and future projections made by models the need to produce food is urgent produce more in the same area using less inputs especially water more crop per drop thus fostering the use of models applied to water and agronomic issues is important for us to advance the predictions made helping planning and decision making the main difficulty of the sebal and metric models lies in the iterative process that determines the h values and the use of anchor pixels to obtain temperature variation and aerodynamic resistance to heat transport in all pixels of an area being estimated based on wind speed and surface temperature using an internal calibration of the near surface temperature difference between the two surface levels according to bastiaanssen et al 1998 and allen et al 2007 respectively this step of these methodologies are complex and uses a solution called internal calibration that requires specific radiation knowledge and identification of extreme hydrological condition the advantage of using the safer model in energy balance modelling lies in its methodology that allows obtaining the value of λe before determining the values of h and g the evapotranspiration fraction is retrieved from surface albedo surface temperature and ndvi which is obtained by remote sensing in this way the model allows the combination of agrometeorological and spectral information for the estimation of large scale evapotranspiration in an efficient and less complex way than the sebal and metric models the output from this package is formatted as raster files tif so it can be easily used as an input to other r packages and gis geographical information systems software for further analyses post processing application of the study case section 4 3 showed examples of this potential use in r software all functions use the regression coefficients of equation 13 as arguments to allows users to calibrate the major equation of safer model for another areas where measured actual evapotranspiration is available the use of sentinel 2 images provides 10 m resolution results which can be used in precision agriculture applications on the other hand modis images provides daily surface reflectance images which can improve regional studies looking for a better water resources management 5 2 limitations our understanding of the soil plant atmosphere continuum hinges on our ability to measure and account for all the critical processes that occur in this complex environment checking missing data in input agrometeorological data or missing pixels in digital images as well as caution about projection and interpolation methods are required in developing this package we have tested with our own test data as well as a number of user provided data sets and we ensured that the package runs free of errors when all pre processing steps of the package documentation are done users also should be aware of the assumptions and limitations prior to using any function of this package there are several models for reference evapotranspiration estimation which contains assumptions related to the regional climate conditions for example teixeira 2010 applied penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and silva et al 2018 used automatic station eto data so users should apply the eto model that works better under the climate of the study area new calibrations are desirable to improve model results in areas where they have not yet been tested the coefficients a l eq 10 can be calibrated to improve method results also the coefficients of equation 13 which drives evapotranspiration values can be calibrated when data are available from eddy covariance bowen ratio lysimeters etc error propagation between the algorithm steps is the main source of uncertainty and emphasizes the need for calibration and validation of these various steps the safer algorithm models on a daily scale so it does not support hourly analysis 6 summary and conclusions this paper presents the r package agriwater for the spatial modelling of actual evapotranspiration and radiation balance on the soil using the simple algorithm for evapotranspiration retrieving safer the results are presented in the form of raster images in tif extension with the same resolution of the digital images which are used as input data post processing analysis can be done by using r and gis based softwares the use of safer model for large scale regional analysis were rather encouraging given the complex mixture of the ecosystems in the semiarid conditions considering that only maps of ndvi surface albedo and surface temperature together with interpolated agrometeorological data are necessary without the need of crop classification nor extreme thermohydrological conditions to set hot and cold pixels this method provides estimation of large scale evapotranspiration in an efficient and less complex way than the sebal and metric models it is hoped that this package will give a new tool to researchers looking for the spatially study of primordial variables to manage water resources and agricultural productivity implementations that make it easier to apply spatial models can increase our ability to investigate the impact of structural uncertainty in remotely sensed et model formulations via the use of ensemble modelling software availability description spatial modeling of energy balance and actual evapotranspiration using satellite images and meteorological data options of satellite are landsat 8 with and without thermal bands sentinel 2 and modis respectively spatial resolutions are 30 100 10 and 250 m user can use data from a single meteorological station or a grid of meteorological stations using any spatial interpolation method teixeira 2010 https doi org 10 3390 rs0251287 teixeira et

26154,the first stages of the modeling process remain thus far poorly studied in particular the modeler s decision making in regard to the inclusion and representation of environmental phenomena within the model anchoring itself in the theoretical and methodological framework of science and technology studies the present study aims at identifying and retracing the origin of the modeler s choices extensive semi constructed interviews were conducted with european and north american modelers in a variety of disciplines within earth and universe sciences the outcome of the interviews sheds light on the role of different actors in transferring choices progressively incorporated in the modelers practice up to becoming self evident we introduce and engage the sociological concept of habits as an additional layer of analysis modeling habits can contribute to efficiency and expertise provided their origin epistemic load and implications in regard to collectives are assessed keywords model construction model structure identification decision making sociology habits 1 introduction the modeling community aims at sound modeling practices the ubiquity of numerical models computer simulation models of processes occurring within a system in scientific research and their use for decision making processes framed in a context of political and public defiance has led environmental modelers to pay increasing attention towards enhancing the credibility of their models a vast number of studies have been devoted to the assessment of model uncertainty refsgaard et al 2007 notably through sensitivity analyses error propagation calculations or multi modeling approaches climate science has witnessed an almost exponential rise of model intercomparison projects eyring et al 2016 a nowadays spreading practice in various disciplines e g kim et al 2018 krysanova et al 2017 rosenzweig et al 2013 thielen et al 2008 in parallel the evaluation of model performance remains a sensitive topic academically and when collaborating with stakeholders not surprisingly it has triggered extensive discussion in the modeling community numerous studies can be found on approaches to model evaluation see e g bennett et al 2013 harmel et al 2014 its philosophical relevance oreskes et al 1994 and terminological and epistemological alternatives rykiel 1996 beven and young 2013 augusiak et al 2014 the above mentioned body of literature focuses primarily on the last stages of the modeling process uncertainty assessments model intercomparison and performance evaluations are generally realized after the construction of the model in comparison the initial steps of the modeling process including the selection of processes to be represented their associated equations software etc are far from having been addressed as closely in the context of water management and environmental decision making some authors have called for more global consideration of the modeling process from start to finish in the aim to establish good practices and to head towards quality assurance of models grimm et al 2014 jakeman et al 2006 refsgaard et al 2007 sound modeling practices after all shall not be restricted to a particular stage of modeling in this perspective the present research precisely focuses on the least studied steps of the modeling process the very initial steps of the model building activity which are just as likely to impact the end of the pipe product as later stages when reflecting on the practices of modeling a striking aspect of model construction lies in the number of decisions that have to be made by the modeler or his group beck and krueger 2016 related the existence of these choices to the scientific uncertainty inherent to environmental modeling 1 1 in the case of integrated assessment modeling beck and krueger 2016 distinguish scientific uncertainty from ethical uncertainty the latest being associated to the different possible approaches to address ethical implications of climate change most natural processes and their interactions are far from being theoretically completely understood and hence do not enable scientific determinism additionally a model always amounts to a simplification of reality while some natural processes and interactions will be chosen to be integrated in the model others will be disregarded but even when a particular natural process has been selected the modeler may still face a wide range of representations to choose from guillemot 2010 indeed many different approaches to the inclusion of one and the same process can generally be contemplated which process representation is selected significantly influences the model behavior and the modeling outputs we asked ourselves on which basis the modeler does then select one of the representations of the process under consideration and not another one we can think of several explanations which are not new to the modeling community jakeman et al 2006 and radchuk et al 2016 extensively showed how model objectives and available data do and should constrain model construction existing paradigms and theoretical accounts also guide the choice of particular representations or suggest relationships between different model variables on the intricate relationship between models and theories see for example morgan and morrison 1999 and winsberg 2010 1999 the same applies to technical constraints the modeler necessarily has to make choices based on the limitations of available software and computational power while these explanations were handled in the modeling literature as external factors discussion emerged on their internal psychological ethical counterparts beven 2008 1991 and westerberg et al 2017 engaged the concept of perceptual models encompassing the modeler s personal representation of the hydrological system or of uncertainty azadi et al 2017 investigated the philosophical paradigms underlying land use change models van der sluijs 2002 and krueger et al 2012 stressed the subjective and implicit nature of modeling assumptions voinov et al 2014 advocated appropriate assessment and communication of values of both modelers and users during the process of modeling drawing from operational research hämäläinen 2015 shed light on possible behavioral issues related to the modeler such as cognitive and motivational biases while lahtinen et al 2017 insisted on the path dependence of decisions in model construction we however identify a rarely studied link between the seemingly external theoretical data driven technical and internal roots for decision making in the process of model construction indeed the modeler has seldom been considered as a social actor within networks a notable exception concerns the interface between the political decision making spheres and modeling which has been approached among others in the context of climate modeling and integrated model assessments by shackley et al 1999 and beck and krueger 2016 the two studies insisted on the mutual construction of modeling and policy the former displayed how the modeler s implicit view of the policy process is likely to influence his epistemological stance and his modeling practices while the latter highlighted the political and ethical implications of each modeling choice addressing more broadly the embedding of water science research in its social context krueger et al 2012 presented an account of the coproduction of knowledge by experts and non certified expert stakeholders and citizens while these studies have contributed significantly to the understanding of interactions of modeling practices and policy the modeler also acts within scientific networks which has been studied less extensively however she is part of a group within an institute or a research department attached to an institution she was maybe member of other groups before she has been interacting with other individuals in and outside of her institute for years and became part of an international network she reads meets discusses presents submits defends reviews prior to that she was educated in a particular university or in several ones where others have taught and supervised her how could this not influence her modeling within science and technology studies krueck and borchers 1999 shackley 2001 and sundberg 2010 approached institutional and disciplinary cultures of modeling in climate science and astrophysics modelers so we think are not unaware of these aspects playing an important role in model construction the existence of modeling schools peculiar to certain universities for instance or differences in modeling approaches depending on the institute s country of origin are commonly yet informally discussed 2 2 a recent exception consists of the text mining research of addor and melsen 2019 who highlight regional preferences for the choice of hydrological models the problem we fundamentally lack empirical studies that enable us to better understand the social construction of environmental modeling amidst the plethora of best practice modeling guidelines we miss data on how modelers the individuals themselves actually make decisions when building a new model we lack observations and based upon them analyses and conceptualizations which could help the community to reflect on existing practices consequently lane 2014 called for a constructivist exploration of the modeling process beck and krueger 2016 regretted the absence of empirical investigations on how modeling choices are made in practice these empirical studies are required to pave the way for increased reflexivity on implicit and explicit mechanisms within model building which are likely to significantly impact modeling outputs the present research is a first step in this direction anchoring ourselves in the theoretical framework of science and technology studies we pursue the objective of identifying the origin of modelers decision making in model construction conceptualizing it and discussing its relevance and implications to this end we employ an established methodology from social sciences based on extensive semi directed interviews conducted with scientists constructing models in a variety of disciplines within earth and universe sciences many of which with high relevance for current societal issues related to climate change we consider choices related to representations of natural processes through time transfer functions and numerical schemes this methodology is presented in section 2 along with its epistemological justification we then explore the obtained material in section 3 and propose a conceptualization of the observed mechanisms of transfer and incorporation of choices the sociological concept of habits is then introduced and discussed as an additional suitable layer of analysis the relevance and implications of this concept for the modeling community are accordingly discussed section 4 summarizes our main findings 2 methodology the present section introduces in subsection 2 1 and 2 2 the epistemic stance adopted in the research and its justification the general design of the research the selection of the interviewees the interview grid and considerations on anonymity are addressed in subsections 2 3 to 2 7 2 1 modeling choices decision making in model construction encompasses a high number of choices made by the modeler sometimes in an iterative process it should be noted that while the existence of these choices might appear evident to the modeler they have long been overlooked by philosophical accounts which considered models to be fully derived from theory or observations see the analysis of morgan and morrison 1999 suggesting a form of scientific determinism however the modeler needs to select the temporal and spatial scale at which to simulate the system at stake as well as the desired type of output he or she has to choose the processes which he or she wants to incorporate their interactions their representation through physical equations or parametrization their numerical implementation the source of data the programming language in which to code the model the hardware and software at use many other choices are already blackboxed into the existing tools and infrastructure which are used e g programming language software data sets mathematical formalism etc this study does not address decision making in its globality but explicitly chooses to focus on one of these choices the choices considered herein concern the representations of natural processes through time transfer functions model equations representing processes over time within the system considered or numerical schemes the numerical solutions used for time transfer functions table 1 specifies whether time transfer functions or numerical schemes were addressed in the interviews we concentrate hence not on the choice of processes to incorporate but on the representation of these processes furthermore the focus lies on decisions made by individuals the model builders related to a single model equation or component 2 2 methodological stance identifying the root of decisions made during the modeling process is not a straightforward task as pointed out by guillemot 2009 and sundberg 2010 the model building activity of a researcher can prove particularly opaque to analyze through direct ethnological observation one of the dominating methodologies of science and technology studies since the pioneering work of latour and woolgar 1979 such an undertaking could provide relevant data as shown by jaton 2017a 2017b for the neighboring domain of algorithm construction however addressing the origins of decisions in model building through direct observation would require limiting oneself to decisions that are verbalized through discussions with colleagues notes and alike during the process itself in order to enlarge one s analysis to also encompass the substantial number of decisions which do not leave traces during the process one necessarily has to rely on a posteriori verbalization words hence but which words a rather straightforward approach would consist of basing one s analysis on written words only studying the literature accompanying the release of a model isolating the reasons behind modeling choices could then amount to a text analysis however the format and the purpose of the document most notably peer reviewed articles deeply reshape the narration rinck 2010 in his work on the imrad introduction methodology results analysis and discussion format pontille 2007 insists on the recomposition of the temporality of research activities that this format implies the interweaving and the superposition of research operations as they appear in the real path of empirical investigations are masked in favor of a linear narration that necessarily omits selects cuts flattens and impersonalizes objectivates the course of actions moreover and partly as a consequence far from all decisions are being documented in articles technical documentation or user manuals authors will detail the process representation they used in the model but not necessarily explain the justification of this choice we do not believe that this lack of justification represents a conscious omission rather it could indicate that the choice of this representation is a stabilized practice in the community so common that neither the authors nor the possible reviewers deem any justification necessary it is hence not the presence of words in written material justifying choices which forms our starting point but their very absence on the basis of articles or manuals we would be uncapable of retracing the origins of the modeler s choice another source another type of verbalization is required oral narration obtained in face to face meetings with the modeler herself can be just this other source of course in this case too will we not no more than with written material pretend to have access to the intangible reality of the highly complex intra and interindividual mechanism of decision making oral words too are chosen facts can be modified recomposed or eluded yet interviews through their dynamical and spontaneous nature enable a constant adaptation to the discourse of the researcher there where silence reigns questions can be asked upon there where words flow these can be collected with no maximum number of words limit which would restrict the level of detail of the information retrieved interviews have hence been a privileged methodology of science and technology studies scholars when exploring various facets of modeling see for example daniel 2018 on odor dispersion models lahsen 2005 and guillemot 2009 on global circulation models sundberg 2010 on models in astrophysics and meteorology landström et al 2011 on modeling in flood risk management kouw 2016 on hydraulic models an abundant literature has been devoted to the methodology of interviews in qualitative research one can refer to the work of among many others gubrium and holstein 2001 seidman 2013 kvale 1996 weiss 1995 or spradley 2016 2 3 general design we chose to conduct semi directed interviews one of the most widely used methods of interviews in social research quivy and van campenhoudt 1995 semi directed interviews are based on an interview grid detailed at the end of this section which is designed prior to the interviews but does not consist of a constraining listing of questions the semi prefix of the method indicates that the guiding of the interview is constantly re adapted by the interviewer to the course of the interview see mason 2004 semi directed interviews predominantly make use of open questions which call for narrative or argumentative content priority is given to the flow of the interviewee s discourse 2 4 interviewees we decided not to limit ourselves to one scientific discipline when selecting interviewees we assume that numerical modeling practices in earth and universe sciences share common issues or puzzles in kuhn s understanding of the word kuhn 1962 related to the representation of natural phenomena and their temporal and spatial scales these issues such as the trade offs between the simplifications necessarily required and the appropriate level of detail for the modeling projects objectives as well as the discretization of time and space are embracing the disciplines well beyond their traditional frontiers while the answers developed to tackle these issues can be of a specific nature we hypothesize that the process of decision making itself reaches a more generic level testing this hypothesis implies to explore the internal and external variability of modeling choices and led us to interview modelers from different scientific disciplines many of which with high relevance for current societal issues are modelers from various disciplines taking similar aspects into account when selecting representations of processes can we identify common threads beyond disciplines and specific models we consequently conducted interviews with modelers in astrophysics biogeosciences ecology geochemistry geomorphology hydrology and hydrogeology our focus on the roots of decision making led us to select researchers who actually developed the model from the earliest stages of the modeling project on additionally as the starting point of our reflection was based on the absence of justifications in accompanying written material we decided to consider models which had already been presented to the community through peer reviewed articles an uncomplicated way of choosing interviewees could then have consisted of singling out in our direct academic accountancies the modelers who satisfied these criteria yet the risk of remaining in one and the same network of researchers would be latent not that we aimed for exhaustivity an irrelevant grail whenever the complexity of human thoughts actions and interactions is at stake but we did want to account for some of the diversity in earth and universe sciences except for two none of the interviewees did hence belong to any of our professional or academic networks the interviewees were selected on the basis of their models which we identified as suiting the diversity we wished to attain in the types of models considered see section 2 5 the results presented in section 3 are predominantly based on the content of seven of the interviews a total of fourteen extensive interviews were however conducted encompassing researchers involved in different stages of the modeling process while these interviews are not explicitly considered in the analysis they formed an additional background which enabled to test the interview grid as well as to prolongate and investigate the modelers discourses the seven interviewees under consideration came from five universities or research institutes located in four different countries in europe and north america five of the interviewees were now working at a different university than the one where they had obtained their phd four of these in a different country except for one postdoctoral researcher the interviewees were senior scientists or professors 2 5 types of models an overview of the natural systems simulated by the models of the interviewees as well as their spatial scale can be found in table 1 a diversity in the types of models from models openly presented as simplistic up to highly complex ones was sought across disciplines some could run on a laptop while others required access to national supercomputing centers all interviewees constructed the model during their phd or as young postdoctoral researchers except for two researchers whose models were constructed in cooperation with others in later stages of their careers yet all interviewees who had started constructing their model more than five years prior to the interview were still actively developing it the models at stake represented a significant part of their current professional activity all models are nowadays used by groups outside of their institute and country of origin four of the seven models can be considered as highly prominent in their associated field of research yielding important yearly literature and for two of them annual or bi annual international user conferences are held 2 6 interview grid prior to the interviews the interviewees had been contacted via e mail and been solely informed of the general theme of the interview the construction of models in their field its purpose a sociological research and the geoscientific background of the interviewer they did not have access to the interview grid nor to the research objectives the interviews all face to face were conducted by the first author at the working place of the interviewee four of the interviews were conducted in french the mother tongue of these interviewees the remaining ones in english the interviews were open ended but generally lasted from one to two hours the literature surrounding the models had been carefully studied by the interviewer in forehand enabling precise questions about specific components of the models due to the nature of these semi directed interviews open questions giving priority to the interviewee s discourse this duration almost equated to the actual speaking time of the modeler and warranted in depth narratives the interviews started with an introductive question about the general context and the reasons that lead to the construction of the model this apparently trifling question pursued a double objective put the interviewee at ease by enabling him to start with a biographic narrative and shape a general understanding of the base of the construction of the model would the modeler engage theoretical technical related to data hardware or software or societal issues in his narration of the model s origin how much would the modeler intertwin his own academic biography in the initial threads of the model s story would he mention colleagues or supervisors and if so which role would he grant them what place would other pre existing models take in his explanations in some cases this introductive question could lead to up to 25 min of uninterrupted narration depending on the elements that surfaced additional questions were asked to clarify or obtain information on parts of the interviewee s story this introductive question granted a common ground of discussion and enabled the interviewer to move on to questions on more detailed aspects of the model a second set of questions focused on a particular component of the model which could either be a time transfer function representing a natural phenomenon or a specific numerical scheme the time transfer function or numerical scheme had been explicitly chosen by the interviewer because the accompanying literature did not enable one to identify the reasons of its selection by the modeler through her questions the interviewer attempted to obtain enough information enabling her to retrace the origin of the component we should point out here that we did not strive for the historical origin of the component itself in the manner of mackenzie 2003 in economics or lane 2014 in hydrology instead information was sought on the origin of the component in the modeler s experience by answering the general why did you use this component question the interviewee was naturally encouraged to cover the content of other unasked questions was it a component that the modeler had already been using in earlier work if so why did he use it in the first place was he asked or advised by others to implement it did he use other alternatives before or afterwards these aspects were often entangled by the interviewee in an argumentative net leading him to detail the added value that he perceived in the use of this component the interviewee was then asked about the reception of the model by the community this question would of course reveal more about the modeler s own perception of the reception and about how willing he was to report on criticism to a stranger yet shifting the focus to an external point of view the point of view of others on his modeling work could prove useful to assess how the modeler regarded his own community would he place himself in opposition to particular criticism referring to modeling groups inside of his discipline or would he justify alternative points of view on his work the interview was then concluded by a reverse question focusing this time on his glance on the modeling work of others the interviewee was asked what he generally deemed necessary in order to assess the quality of a new model which he would read about in a peer reviewed article what type of justifications or explanations would he require would the use of particular components be considered unavoidable would certain approaches be favored if so why this wide question the only of its kind in the interview as it did not focus on the interviewee s model enabled the interviewer to approach the interviewee s perception of the modeling activity from yet another angle time was left at the end of the interview for the interviewee to add whatever he felt had been missing during the conversation the interviews were recorded and entirely transcribed the equivalent for the interviews considered for the content analysis presented in the next section of an 80 000 words document 2 7 anonymity the names and affiliation of the interviewees quoted in section 3 remain undisclosed the interviewees are referred to through single letters from a to g their field of research can be looked up in table 1 along with the description of the system simulated by the model and its spatial scale we deem these indications necessary for the reader to picture himself the types of models at stake it should be noted that we do not conceive the interviewees as spoke persons of their disciplines representing the epistemic stance of a complete group neither do we intend to shift the emphasis of the present research on a hazardous comparison among disciplines for which our methodology was not designed however exploring the disciplinary diversity enables to question the origin of influences on modeling choices as arising from field specific differences regarding the modeling content or from inter personal dynamics 3 results and discussion this section is divided into six subsections we shall first assess the implementation of the method section 3 1 before continuing with the content analysis the interviewees accounts of the origins of the construction of their model are displayed in subsection 3 2 subsection 3 3 presents and discusses the interviewees explanations of the choice of particular representations in their model these findings are conceptualized in subsection 3 4 and framed within existing sociological accounts in section 3 5 section 3 6 explores the implications of the employed conceptualization for existing practices 3 1 epistemic position the results of this study just like any outcome from a field research whether in the disciplines under consideration or in sociology and anthropology are highly dependent on the methodological set up employed we were aware of the fact that the detail of the answers the degree of introspection the readiness to open oneself up to the questions of a stranger would derive from the interviewee s perception of the research in this respect we were surprised by the interest the interviewees displayed in the study and the confidence they placed in the interviewer the discussions proved considerably more open and franker than we would have expected part of it can probably be explained through the epistemic position of the interviewer even though the interviewees had been informed of her original background in environmental sciences they regarded the interviewer as a social scientist she had not carried out extensive research in their fields was nowadays anchored in the domain of science and technology studies and hence not perceived as a rival while the risk of facing overly controlled and contained answers vanished that of hovering at a too general level was looming in many of the interviews the modelers were tempted to explain their field of study to the interviewer as to a layman she then had to demonstrate that the discussion could engage on more detailed aspects of the modeling process the turn was generally reached when the interviewer started asking questions on a particular component of the model using the modeler s article as reference for the discussion the most manifest illustration of such a tipping point appeared in an interview conducted with a modeler who straight after the interviewer quoted the work from a scientist of the same field expressed his surprise and immediately dropped the formal french vous for the colloquial tu you the interview could then continue on a more detailed and technical basis the position of the interviewer might hence be considered as two fold simultaneously in and outside the domain of study it guaranteed both a distance and a proximity to the interviewee which could explain some of the density of the collected answers 3 2 narrating the origins of the modeling process the methodological choice to use oral narratives as a source stemmed from the assumption that scientific articles exert significant reshaping and cutting out of the course of events when they were asked about the general context and the reasons that lead to the construction of the model the interviewees narratives were indeed convoluted drifting away from the motivations reported in their academic research article s on the model considered the geomorphologist a whose article strongly underlined the drawbacks of pre existing models high computational demands or predictive uncertainty as a justification for the model s construction immediately weakened the importance of the role these drawbacks had actually played in the modeling process that s more to that s very common when you write a paper about modeling you show the strength of the other models but then this is the limitation and you continue to do that for several models and your model is trying to address those limitations it s almost like selling the model so why do we need this model you know so that s usually how i phrase all my papers the reality or the interviewee s narrative about the historicity of events proved more complex rather than involving other preexisting models the interviewee assigned significant emphasis to the role of individual actors and coincidental encounters the professor who interviewee a was working with anchored in fluvial geomorphology indeed met a field person from another research area wetland sciences during a meeting this wetland scientist told him about an erratic phenomenon they had observed in the field which seemed hard to predict the professor being a modeler could see the link between that phenomenon which he had not previously worked on and a modeling technique based on cellular automata that was quite well known and had a bit of popularity in his own field geomorphology he subsequently told his conversation partner that a model could possibly explain this behavior and instructed interviewee a to build the model so he came back to the office and he explained to me this whole dialog he had and he said hey would you like to build it on your free time i said sure why not so that s how that started the role of interviewee a then amounted to code the model according to the method identified by his professor but also in a later stage to squeeze the model s intricate coincidental genesis in the mold of scientific writing several actors were indeed intertwined in interviewee s a narrative from the very beginning on yet entirely replaced within the article in favor of a posteriori rationalization a particular environmental issue leading to a research question the drawbacks of existing models to tackle it leading to the necessity of this innovation etc the puzzle encountered by the wetland scientist his fortuitous discussion with the professor in geomorphology the community within which the modeling technique was quite well known and to which the professor belonged however all played a substantial role in the commencement of the modeling project these first answers on the general context of model construction of which as we will see below interviewee a s narrative seemed rather representative than outlying appeared to confirm our methodological stance to go beyond what could have been deduced from scientific articles only indeed before even approaching during the interviews particular choices in the representation of natural phenomena the very rationale underlying the construction of the models already appeared to unfurl rich and manifold interactions between individuals collectives institutions and their sociotechnical networks the narrative of interviewee b is a further example in this regard as a hydrologist interviewee b was hired in his current university to build a global hydrological model his director had identified the construction of a global model as a niche a decision interviewee b refers to as strategical the only question that we had was we had to build a model and yeah that was it there was no direct scientific question other than just getting the model going so laughs yeah so it was a bit of a strange deal constructing a new model rather than using a pre existing one could prove profitable in the long term interviewee b reported that while no direct application was determined the model would contribute to establish an innovative orientation of the research group in hydrology its existence would open up collaborations with other groups and funding opportunities as well as enable to attract researchers whose expertise would be durably beneficial for the institute with the construction of the model progressing investments were made in technical infrastructure high performance computing devices which significantly increased over time a growing number of researchers were involved in the development maintenance and use of the model contributing to its positioning on the international scene and to the constitution of a geocomputational group within the institute the model was thus an actant in structuring and stabilizing a network of scientists equipment and computing machines in the institution on the structuring role of objects in scientific practice see for example the work of latour and woolgar 1979 1993 and vinck 1999 2011 2012 far from being unique these motivations were echoed by other interviewees hydrogeologist d reported on funding opportunities related to societal issues on waste disposal steering the construction of his model geochemist c and biogeoscientist g involved strategical orientations of their university or institute in their models genesis which were coupled to a global circulation model while astrophysicist f underlined competition against other groups see section 3 4 as motivating the rapid development of an efficient and innovative alternative for the simulation of galaxy formation these first answers highlight the impossibility to separate the initial impulses to the construction of the models from their collective and institutional context of emergence which co shape them along with their designed scientific objectives having now elaborated the motivations of the construction of models we will delve into the details of the modelers choices in the representation of natural phenomena in the next sections aiming to approach this collective co shaping at closer sight 3 3 explaining choices in model construction the interviewees had constructed either all for the majority of them or substantial parts of the first version of their model themselves yet in the second part of the interview where the interviewees were invited to explain precise modeling decisions all modelers were quick to involve many other actors in their narratives the unfolding of actors in the narratives was of two kinds the actors were either individualized identified and named by the interviewees a particular person or diffusely mentioned a collective these two different cases will be treated hereafter in section 3 3 1 and section 3 3 2 it should be remembered that no question had been asked on these actors the general question as presented in section 2 6 remained that of why the interviewees had chosen this particular transfer function or numerical scheme to represent the natural phenomena at stake we expected answers involving mainly technical constraints associated to hardware and software limitations issues related to data availability results of comparisons between the application of several alternatives and observational data successful preceding experience with the implementation of the equation or numerical scheme the spontaneous immediate involvement of other actors in the answers surprised us 3 3 1 involvement of individual actors and epistemic stances whenever the interviewees engaged individuals in their narrative their role was explicitly delineated often chronologically hydrogeologist d for example whose model simulated the hydrological cycle of the earth s surface and subsurface explained that he attended courses by a professor member of his thesis committee a person he deemed really brilliant because of his knowledge of numerical methods and with a very very practical mind due to his past in industry this professor had used the method in one of his models and taught it in his course the interviewee reported to have decided straight away to use the method which became one of the distinctive features of his model 3 3 in this case precising the type of numerical method employed would be likely to reveal the identity of the modeler we hence keep it undisclosed interestingly it is only after having mentioned his professor in his narrative that interviewee d started to list technical reasons for the implementation of the method efficiency stability and rapidity these characteristics which were advantages compared to what most people were using at that time indubitably played a paramount role yet the intellectual and biographic authority of the professor stood at the forefront of the interviewee s justification of the use of the method we will not engage on a hierarchization of the actual influence of each aspect the intellectual and biographic authority of the professor versus the advantages of the use of the method for computing purposes and for departing oneself from groups competing for the same sources of funding played in the decision oral narratives let room for a posteriori rationalization too the interviewee might have wanted to emphasize through highlighting his influence the gratitude towards a professor he considered as his mentor or reversely justify the use of the method by listing its advantages however the fact that the interviewee from the very beginning of his answer on spontaneously involved another actor in his justification referred to his own education and opposed himself to other groups enables us to retrieve first glimpses at sociological aspects of decision making invisible in the accompanying literature and rarely analyzed in the modeling context members of the thesis committee most notably the thesis director himself were the individual actors that most frequently appeared in the interviewees narratives about the choice of model components colleagues though often referred to generically and less precisely identified were involved in the discourse too as acting on modeling choices for example ecologist e explained how his local model of vegetation dynamics was at first quite complicated until a colleague of his department forced him to make it as simple as possible leading him to discard terms in the time transfer function describing plant density selecting linear functions and removing any differentiation between plant components he briefly reported on the discussion with his colleague as a series of repeated questions which initiated a change of perspective on his own approach so he referring to his colleague said why do you need that points at one term of the transfer function why do you need that points at a second term of the transfer function why do you need that ecologist e consequently parameterized or suppressed the terms of the transfer function the colleague had addressed while they had been physically represented before the colleague probably never exerted an actual external constraint to parameterize or suppress these terms however the use of the verb force in forcing him to make it as simple as possible stated above is interesting in this regard because of the externality of decisions it suggests in the same way that data scarcity or computational limitations are often described in literature as constraining the choice of representations here data and computational power appeared to be available the suggestion of his colleague which ecologist e reported about as a decisive bottleneck in the development of the model seemed to be rooted into considerations of epistemic nature interestingly while ecologist e seemingly easily accepted the input of his colleague he rejected comments of the reviewers of the first journal he submitted the manuscript on his model to which deemed it too simplistic just like the comments of hydrologists who called for a more explicit representation of overland flow within his model conversely the interviewee modified the nowadays widely used model towards even greater simplicity with one of his doctoral students in later stages of model development simplicity was repeatedly advocated in the course of the interview as a form of epistemic virtue to which the interviewee was increasingly tending over his career while he had already built very simple models during his phd he had started to complexify them after it the encounter with his colleague appeared to have resonated with his epistemic stance and brought him back to an approach of modeling which he nowadays strongly identified himself with his colleague s questions we could interpret had steered the representation towards their shared epistemic stance the reviewers and hydrologists comments distant from it had been disregarded ecologist e was the interviewee who most clearly established a link between his modeling choice and his and his colleague s epistemic stance however five of the remaining six modelers also spontaneously alluded during the interviews to what they frequently defined as their modeling philosophy the consistent and repeated use of the term simplicity in ecologist e s discourse could be linked to the simplicity complexity dichotomy being often discussed within the discipline e g peck 2004 merow et al 2014 simplicity having historically been a well established epistemic view on modeling in ecology see the analysis of evans et al 2013 the strong discipline specific past discussions on process based or physically based versus conceptual modeling see for example freeze and harlan 1969 beven 1989 1993 grayson et al 1992 could also explain hydrologist b s and hydrogeologist d s up front framing of their models within one of the two approaches at the very beginning of the interviews noteworthily the sociotechnical implications of these epistemic views on modeling appeared to be very different from one discipline to another describing his cosmological model as being of the discovery type as opposed to models designed for forecasting purposes astrophysicist f appeared very close to ecologist e s and geomorphologist a s approach when he stated that in this discovery mode we have to simplify the equations up to the extremes you should not get troubled by a whole bunch of thorny considerations yet the geomorphological and the ecological simple models required only a few lines of code and very limited computational time while the simple cosmological model was run on a national supercomputing center and demanded extensive numerical solving techniques while the dichotomy between competing epistemic views seemed very common across disciplines the underlying implications appeared discipline specific these epistemic dimensions of modeling surfacing in the interviews connect two social dimensions of the origin of modeling choices the inter personal one which we outlined in this section and the collective one which will be treated into more details in section 3 3 2 3 3 2 allusion to collectives beside the role of individual actors on modeling choices and epistemic dimensions of modeling being amply mentioned modelers recurrently referred in their narratives to collectives this case was most obvious for geochemist c who incorporated in his answers his institute or the entire community of scientists from his field of study his model which simulated the distribution and evolution of greenhouse gases and aerosols within the atmosphere was coupled to a global circulation model gcm and regularly participated in international model intercomparison projects which he repeatedly made mention of the interviewee seemed not to perceive his model as a singularity but as one representative of a set of models which all pursued an identical objective accordingly whenever the interviewee started his sentence with this model he automatically corrected himself and replaced the words by each model the wall of collectivity could not be broken his practices were that of an entire group which he very coherently identified himself with this represented a peculiarity in comparison to the other interviews in which the modelers all started a case specific narrative a possible explanation could lie in geochemist c s research field the modeler emphasized how in his domain the ensemble median forecast obtained from model intercomparison projects and based on forecasts from a set of different models is considered to yield better results than any of these models alone what seemed to be sought for was not the one model displaying outcomes in best accordance with observations but a diversity of models that enabled to represent the scientific uncertainty at play in climatic processes the fact that his model simulated particular aerosols such as desert dust with increased physical accuracy while focusing less on marine salts for example was hence deemed by the interviewee as serving the community by increasing the diversity of representations this collective endeavor was particularly striking in geochemist c s narrative and could not be explained by his participation to model intercomparison projects alone indeed biogeoscientist g s model just as geochemist c s was also coupled to a gcm and took part in a high number of intercomparison projects too yet interviewee g did not adopt a similar collective mode of narration while frequently mentioning and comparing his approach to that of other models he dove into its singularities and its individual genesis a main difference between these two cases may reside in the strong structural and epistemic divergences between biogeoscientist g s model which simulated the phenology and carbon cycle of the biosphere and the alternative ones geochemist c appeared to find these divergences less prominent in his own discipline which facilitated his identification with an entire set of models while geochemist c s answers represented an outlier through his constant collective mode of narration collectives were not absent from the other interviews these collectives were loosely and atemporally called upon they were utterly generic in a striking opposition to the explicit mention of individuals reported about in section 3 3 1 hydrologist b described an equation he used to represent evapotranspiration within his global hydrological model as being a kind of hydrological practice more or less the standard adding later on that if people have the data they will then use it here data availability appeared to act as a first filter among alternatives excluding representations that required data for example root fraction and canopy resistance the modeler did not possess the extent of their use within the community or more precisely within the collective sharing a similar epistemic stance acted as a second one while explaining his choice of another transfer function to represent snow melt and snow accumulation he outlined a general approach to component selection one of the first things that you do when starting to build a model is that you start looking at what are the typical components of models that exist and this component is i think one of the most well known this thought was rephrased in a later stage of the interview but often of course you look at yeah what is a kind of consensus within hydrological practice and that that s your starting point the description of a representation as standard typical or as belonging to a consensus or disciplinary practice was echoed by geormophologist a who considered the cellular automaton representation his professor had chosen to have a bit of popularity in his field or by biogeoscientist g who reported that everybody almost all models use this representation of photosynthesis which is a bit the one of reference even though alternatives existed ecologist e described a time transfer function he used for plant growth as very common typically used for that and five other parts of time transfer functions as textbook he seemed surprised to be asked about the origin of the implementation of these representations which he precisely considered to be so common yet this apparent triviality was exactly what we aim to scrutinize the common typical popular or well known nature of the representation suggests the absence of choice the representation imposes itself through its wide use in the community in the eyes of the modelers the choice of that representation is hence well nigh not perceived as one a choice was still made since alternatives existed in each of the cases detailed above but the interviewees narratives seemed to imply that the choice had been made by others embraced in the above cited terminology engaging collectives not only had these implied collectives rendered the choice trivial through its ubiquity they had also set it as a standard hydrologist b or as a reference biogeoscientist g by using that one representation the modeler was thus within the norm which implied collectives these norms referred to remained however unclear typical standard very common or well known for whom everybody was a generalization the interviewees were often gradually whittling down in the course of the interview they first reduced it to their own discipline as in the case of geomorphologist a and hydrologist b cited above ecologist e asserted that hydrologists and meteorologists would defensively stand up when confronted to the transfer functions used within his model biogeoscientist g criticized the fact that ecologists would seek for simplicity in global models while he considered that the more generic 4 4 by generic the interviewee meant close to processes and hence less dependent on the type of vegetation the representation of photosynthesis was the easier it could be applied to the globe but even within the suggested frontiers of their discipline the interviewees progressively distanced themselves from an all embracing generality except for interviewee c and g they directly mentioned having faced critics from peers whose approaches and sometimes epistemic stances were different interviewee a e or criticized competing alternatives in their field b d f the peers they alluded to could slowly be excluded from the picture of the implied and norm creating collective who then were these crowds hiding behind the consensus the practice the popularity the picture remained utterly blurry should we maybe consider the interviewees generalizations to be a sign that they too could not pinpoint the exact origin of the choice that had imposed itself that it was so embodied kaufmann 2001 interiorized that its origin in the model as well as in the modeler s practice had faded away if so how to make it resurge in order to better apprehend the processes at hand the interviewees involvement of particular individuals in their narratives which we outlined in section 3 3 1 might offer a grip in order to engage on this reverse journey in the next section we dissect these individual accounts in the search of a process which could ultimately have led to the observed generalizations and to the perceived absence of choice 3 4 transfer and path dependence the involvement of human actors represented a cornerstone in the interviewees explanations about the choice of representations in their models as stated in section 3 3 1 members of the thesis committee belonged to the most cited individuals regardless of the time from five up to twenty six years that had elapsed since the interviewees who cited them had earned their doctorate through the example of hydrogeologist d we showed how the intellectual and biographic authority of a supervising professor could be intertwined in the narration of the implementation of a particular representation interviewee d reported the use of the numerical scheme as a seemingly direct transfer the choice of the professor who had used the method for his own model had been adopted by the interviewee and was still nowadays a distinctive feature of his hydrogeological model the case of interviewee f detailed below depicts a lengthier less conscious process which will be used as a starting point for our conceptual model interviewee f started to construct his model as a post doctoral researcher twenty years prior to the interview he still continues to develop this model which is nowadays used by a wide network of scientists in his research field astrophysics the model ought to simulate galaxy formation in the course of the interview the modeler spoke about rivals who were using a different numerical method to represent fluid dynamics of hydrogen this numerical method will be named hereafter zeta he went on to relate a quite spectacular quite famous controversy which had opposed the supporters of one numerical method against the other two schools which referred to specific groups across the globe 5 5 according to the interviewee these groups were not specifically found in particular regions but could co exist within a same institution the financial and institutional consequences of the controversy presented hereafter were however significantly more important in northern america than in europe and who competed with each other across different subdisciplines from galaxy formation to planet formation the two numerical methods had such strong implications on the representation of fluid dynamics that the interviewee considered them to be structuring the entire modeling approach in some particular modeling cases the alpha representation the interviewee used proved complex a bit wobbly to apply a limitation the zeta representation could overcome however when comparisons were carried out it was realized that the zeta representation had an abominable problem and was a total disaster hydrogen simulated by zeta had the viscosity of honey even though the alpha representation also showed drawbacks the thing should not be idealized the interviewee specified several times the zeta representation was at least momentarily crushed he conveyed the impression to have stood on the right side of history the comparisons had temporary revealed winners and losers which for the latter resulted in declining funding but why did he at the very beginning long before the controversy broke out and established alpha choose to use this one rather than zeta the full answer of the interviewee to this exact question is transcribed hereunder it is an interesting question because indeed during my phd my phd director was only working with alpha and so i was educated with it and so i couldn t imagine doing something else because by lack of knowledge when we are phd students we don t know much so we and so after my thesis i naturally evolved with this approach because it was what i knew it was a natural evolution it is as yes when we can speak a language we evolve with this language so here it is a bit the same i knew how to speak alpha and so i naturally kept on evolving with this approach but it is true that yes it is the main reason i believe this answer contrasted with the vehemence displayed in the prior account of the controversy the fact that the interviewee stood on the winning side depended on his thesis director two decades ago had the latter been working with zeta the interviewee suggests he would himself have been likely to use this alternative numerical method in addition to this relativistic perspective the interviewee s answer deserves attention for another aspect it underscores that of a process an evolution as the repetitive use of the related verb furthermore emphasizes the interviewee depicts himself as a doctoral student without a priori preference for either of the two approaches in contact with a user of the alpha approach moreover holding the academic responsibility to guide his work his thesis director the interviewee is progressively educated to use it the evolution continues well beyond his doctorate having gained particular skills in using alpha the interviewee is naturally inclined to pursue that direction drifting away from what originally could be considered as a coincidence this process appears self reinforcing the more the interviewee uses alpha the more the probability of him switching to zeta in the course of his career diminishes the interviewee s analogy with languages is enlightening in this regard implementing a numerical method requires learning the gain of particular skills in other words time and efforts the re use of a numerical method mastered by the modeler hence smooths out the friction edwards 2013 of this process by speaking a language he is already fluent with he avoids having to invest supplementary time and cognitive resources in starting from scratch anew the astrophysicist f is not anymore under the academic influence of his phd director but both explicit and tacit knowledge accumulated through the repetitive use of alpha induce a path dependence david 1985 lahtinen et al 2017 this path dependence is of course reinforced or rendered less reversible by the suitability of the alpha method to the interviewee s objectives and its success in comparison to zeta this aspect of path dependence was also evoked by geomorphologist a and hydrologist b geomorphologist a witnessed with skepticism current external endeavors to increase physical descriptions of processes within his model it s like something is working why do you want to change it when being asked by the end of the interview whether he had anything to add hydrologist b started to outline that for him a funny thing in model building was that a lot of choices you make are to a certain extent subjective and went on to describe what he called the legacy effect at a given moment you have the legacy effect in the model you know stuff you put in a long time ago and yes maybe you want to change it but then at a given moment it becomes difficult to change it and also there are things in a model that are still relatively you know you put them in at initial steps and well they function the legacy effect mentioned by hydrologist b can be understood as a synonym of path dependence here the internal structure of the model is seemingly presented as an additional factor contributing to the modeler keeping the same representation changing of representation could require modifying the very structure of the model while many developments were based on it implying considerable time investment and technical difficulties just as for geomorphologist a the fact that the model functions functioning being regularly defined by the interviewees as producing results in accordance with available observations reinforces the path dependence and diminishes the likeliness of the modeler throwing himself into the challenges of the modification of a representation additionally and albeit not directly mentioned by the interviewees funding opportunities can also contribute to the reinforcement of the path dependence by encouraging the extension of a specialized track the modeler already embarked upon 3 5 incorporation and anchoring the evolution astrophysicist f refers to can be split into two phases displayed in fig 1 we shall describe the first phase as the transfer of a choice of a particular representation alpha from an external actor the thesis director to the modeler interviewee f the representation is progressively incorporated by the modeler in his practice up to becoming his own a second phase defined as incorporation in the language analogy the modeler becomes fluent he gains skills and expertise which render the use of the representation increasingly evident note that these two phases are not divided by a sharp line rather the choice for a particular representation is gradually interiorized as the modeler keeps on using the representation we believe that another process runs in parallel to the progressive incorporation in the case of interviewee f the alpha representation was not used solely by his thesis director but by other peers too put in other words the transferred choice was or had been shared by other astrophysicists in or outside his university or institute additionally and in contrary to the zeta method it had been used by engineers too a collective the interviewee made repeated reference to in the course of the interview and which in his opinion seemed to speak for the efficiency of the method by using the alpha representation the interviewee hence implicitly joined a collective a network of researchers and engineers sharing a similar approach and epistemic stance we insist here on the implicit character this anchoring may have at the beginning of the process during his doctorate interviewee f was indeed most likely unaware of embracing a particular current distinct of that of the zeta users through his use of alpha he describes himself as not knowing of alternatives to alpha at that time it is only in later stages of his career that the anchoring in a collective became explicit and that the modeler could refer as he did to the two different schools one of which was rival through the shading line of fig 1 we postulate that the more the modeler uses the representation the more his anchoring in the network of its users solidifies collaborations with other researchers sharing a similar approach participations in conferences and publications in journals within which the representation is well accepted contribute to stabilizing the modeler s anchoring in the collective but the anchoring may in turn reinforce the incorporation itself as the dotted line on the right of the figure displays in the alpha versus zeta rivalry the outcome of the controversy acted as deepening the furrow already ploughed by the modeler the controversy confirmed him in the already incorporated use of the representation changing of representation would not only have challenged two decades of work and expertise but also implied to turn away from a relatively clear cut collective in which the modeler had established himself the initiated conceptualization represented by the two phased transfer incorporation arrow and the progressive anchoring fig 1 can prove useful to re interpret the accounts provided in section 3 3 along with interviewee f interviewees a e and d made explicit reference to the transfer of a choice of a representation geormophologist a explained how his professor had the idea of a cellular automaton approach that would allow to reproduce observed patterns in wetlands see section 3 2 and asked him to use it the interviewee had to become familiar with it which he did through a book that explained the algorithm in the modeler s own words the approach was very simple he rapidly assimilated incorporated it here his path however diverged from that of astrophysicist f while the transfer and the progressive incorporation was still observed it happened on a shorter definite time span indeed the project he worked on was limited in time and arising from wetland sciences did not correspond to his main discipline the interviewee moved away from the topic in his new position yet he showed particular consciousness of the implications the use of the component conveyed in regard to anchoring in particular groups in his own words his professor came from reduced complexity modeling which represented a whole field of scientists in which the approach enjoyed popularity in contrast others would not really appreciate this type of modeling we break a lot of rules in spite of his change of environment position and task the interviewee still strongly identified with the general modeling current he had implicitly been anchored in and defended it several times during the interview his professor had not only transferred a simple algorithm but a complete epistemic stance ecologist e s citation in section 3 3 1 shows similarities his colleague s interference leading him to adopt a simpler representation of plant growth and parameterize terms of the time transfer function was an input to a reevaluation of his practice it ultimately anchored him more firmly in an approach which he had identified himself with simplicity and mini modeling the explicit description by hydrogeologist d of the role a member of his thesis committee had played in his choice is also compelling in this regard by underscoring the practical mind and experience of his professor the interviewee rooted not only his professor but also himself through the use of the technique in a collective different from that of mathematicians who have their heads in the clouds as he defined them the technique which was innovative and required particular skills in numerical methods also enabled him to depart from the dominant approach of modeling that prevailed at that time which conveyed advantages in terms of funding opportunities the examples described above epitomize the left side of fig 1 characterized by a transfer and the resulting anchoring in a network of users sharing the same choice of representation yet not all interviewees alluded explicitly to these initial steps other narratives such as hydrologist b s ecologist e s and biogeoscientist g s narratives which predominantly engaged generic collectives see section 3 3 2 can rather be related to the right hand extremity of the figure the use of the representation seemed evident to the modelers imposing itself and dissipating the fact that it had been preceded by a choice the choice precisely appeared as a non choice it was fully incorporated it had anchored the modelers in a collective whose neighboring groups the interviewees did not hesitate to criticize however the transfer of the representation could not be isolated in their narratives we can hypothesize on the reasons for the more explicit mention of the transfer by some of the interviewees in astrophysicist f s competitive and controversy laden context the use of the representation acted as structuring and amounted to choose one s side while the presence of an alternative was prominent the history of the divisive representation in one own s practices was hence likely to be more conscious but the very act of the transfer may also be impressed on a more durable basis because of the personification of the choice related for example to a professor who profoundly marked either the modeler hydrogeologist d or the modeling project itself geomorphologist a 6 6 personification of modeling decisions appeared less prominent when the modeling project was not conducted by the modeler individually but by a team as in the case of geochemist c and biogeoscientist g further intra disciplinary research could enable to assess the role of collective functioning of a discipline in enabling or encouraging personal models versus consensual building similarly the intervention of ecologist e s colleague leading him to discard terms of his time transfer function describing plant density acted as an epistemic turn in his own history which rendered the choice conspicuous yet in other cases possibly less controversial personified or far reaching the choices of the same interviewee were loosely rooted back as textbook just as others had described theirs as standard or consensual all in all some decisions seem to be deemed structuring enough for their origin to be fixed in consciousness memory and narratives the path of others fade leaving us with nothing less but an apparent self evidence we cannot then but say that we use these representations precisely because we use them used them and because they are used by others around us we cannot remember why in first stance we started speaking this language we became over time so fluent with did we get acquainted with it during education under the impulsion of a supervisor through literature or by collaborating with peers in everyday situations such incorporated schemes of actions would commonly be described as habits the word choice is less trivial than it appears the concept of habit has enjoyed repeated attention and analysis from social scientists and philosophers over the last centuries up until today habit might offer the required conceptual framework to sum up our findings we shall briefly define it before exploring its implications 3 6 habits there is an inherent risk in using a nowadays colloquial word to refer to a particular concept that of a turmoil of signifieds eclipsing its actual pertinence and delineations daston and galison 2007 portrayed the tumultuous history of the concept of objectivity which went on to carry opposite meanings in the course of time the concept of habit has not much to envy in this regard first conceptualized by aristoteles camic 1986 habits were amply theorized before becoming a collateral damage of the endeavor of sociologists of the beginning of the 20th century to depart their field from psychology with the rise of behaviorism habits had indeed been restricted to mere reflex actions hence inherently individual centered sociologists progressively abandoned the term but the concept used to be richer than that in fact the very sociologists who discarded it for the sake of their discipline s institutionalization had previously used the concept as a cornerstone of their own theories most notably among them durkheim had been considering habits as the real forces that govern us camic 1986 what was meant by it were not reflex actions rather and here lies its interest for the analysis of modeler s decision making habits were understood as patterns of conduct incorporated schemes of actions which could involve reflexivity this middle range of habits as opposed to the biological automatisms implied by behaviorists and the structured structures of bourdieu s habitus bourdieu 1990 recently attracted new interest see for example latour 2013 kaufmann 2001 sloterdijk 2014 in line with camic we shall define habits as a more or less self actuating disposition or tendency to engage in a previously adopted or acquired form of action camic 1986 camic s definition seems indeed to fit the self evident depiction the interviewees rendered of some of their choices as stated in section 3 4 some choices seemed to impose themselves without always implying conscious reasoning while the colloquial usage of the word habit is often taut with negative perception a banal act social scientists have underscored its necessity if schemes of actions were never to be incorporated the modeler would at each time be confronted with decisions monopolizing his full attention similarly to an individual who would re consider alternatives to her road to work at each intersection every day of the year as latour 2013 posits habits act as smoothing discontinuities in courses of action they are what enables the individual to move forward instead of stagnating in ever recurring doubt and interrogation they are what enables the individual to gain skills expertise in other words the ones of astrophysicist f fluency in biogeoscientist g s and hydrologist b s examples taking over a set of time transfer functions describing photosynthesis for the former evapotranspiration for the latter deemed as standard or of reference and that they or their team had used before made it possible to concentrate more explicitly on other parts of the model where they considered the real innovation to be habits are needed but while some increase our skillfulness latour asserts others might degenerate into mechanical gestures and routines the difference between habits that bring us forward and automatisms that confine us in obtuseness lies in our level of attention habits smooth discontinuities the path of our decisions but they do not make them disappear completely using latour s terminology habits merely veil them what we witnessed in the interviews was this very unveiling a progressive reappearance of crossroads of intersections where actors whether individual or collective had acted as road signs in the course of action geomorphologist a s hydrogeologist d s astrophysicist f s professors and ecologist e s colleague had been these very road signs impetus to follow a particular trajectory that the interviewees progressively made their own we do not generally think about these discontinuities but we are able to retrieve them to take the control over again when a disruption occurs whenever these discontinuities are not just veiled but totally erased the automatism is looming our attention has faded we apply but are unable to tell why when adopted rather than self acquired habits convey another distinctive feature summing up much of our findings that of embedding social knowledge this property less investigated by latour has been particularly highlighted by kaufmann 1997 2001 following the theoretical contribution of the latter habits can then be considered as mediating between exteriority and interiority between the transfer from an external source to the individual incorporation as fig 1 portrays the habit that of using one representation in our modeling context cannot be detached from the network of actors which used it earlier the interviewees representations all inscribe and record a knowledge shared by individuals and which is inherently engaged through the use of the representation the habit incorporates collective practice sociotechnical and epistemic components by incorporating the habit the modelers anchor themselves in the collective too 3 7 implications our study shows that in model construction choices of representations are not made anew every time they can be transferred and evolve through incorporation to become a modeler s own modeling habit whether habits are supporting one s work in increasing expertise and efficiency or locking one up in automatisms amounts to examine our level of attention and alertness can we retrace the path of initial decisions the discontinuities the habit progressively smoothed could we revert it if we wished so or as latour 2013 portrayed with humor can we still identify the ip addresses of our modeling habits the interviews we conducted did not aim at asserting whether the interviewees could answer these questions or not we did not track habits down the concept of habit emerged from our analysis as a suitable theoretical framework to embrace the incorporation and the self evidence of decisions the interviewees depicted the above mentioned questions ought to be personal ones for all of us in some cases which we covered earlier the path of habits might be profoundly impressed on one s consciousness due to the controversial far reaching context or because of the personification of decisions in other cases the path having led to habits might be thinner requiring deeper self reflexivity whether conscious or veiled all modeling decisions have implications in regard to collectives choosing one representation rather than another amounts to anchor oneself in a social network rather than another the anchoring might be the consequence as for astrophysicist f s alpha representation but also one of the reasons of the choice see hydrogeologist d a choice is a statement that of establishing oneself in relationship to others or apart from them that of situating oneself in keeping with previous work or in dissonance with them yet as loaded with epistemic stances as the representations were the interviewees had mostly perceived them as choices only in later stages of their career at the moment of their transfer usually during the interviewee s doctorate or shortly after it these representations were non choices the modelers were not necessarily conscious of the existence of alternatives these findings should question our own awareness of choices we inherently transfer to novices and which they do not always recognize as such the issue at stake after all is that of asking ourselves whether we know why we do what we do why are we using the alpha representation if we may refer a last time to it rather than the zeta one which implicit decisions did we or others make which networks are we engaging in the choice and through it anchoring ourselves in answering these questions might not per se lead to better models but it might enable to raise one s attention and hence control on incorporated habits and lead to even more thought out weighed modeling it might too enable one to render decisions more explicit during education so as to keep alternatives visible for upcoming researchers involved in modeling presenting a representation to novices as a choice amounts to unveil a crossroad an opening to possibilities rather than the tunnel of an automatism upon which the attention long faded while the present study sheds light on habits we do not believe them to subjugate the other actants latour 1987 commonly identified as impacting decisions during the modeling process such as data availability computational power or technical constraints even though these were less spontaneously appearing in the interviewees narratives 7 7 we had expected these aspects to appear forefront in the answers of the interviewees a possible explanation might be that the interviewees considered them to be obvious self speaking constraints for the interviewer too either unworthy of mentioning or less strikingly inscribed into their memory of the course of events rather we conceive habits as intertwined with them habits play a role among other actants this articulation would deserve additional research in order to assess more accurately their conjoined roles we sketched social networks we may now need to dive into the materiality of the modeling practice in order to embrace models in their sociotechnical mialet 2012 perspective similarly habits represent only one among several theoretical concepts aiming at revealing practices progressively rendered invisible the transfer of modeling skills and not only representations for example would gain to be studied through the lens of the neighboring concept of tacit knowledge collins 2010 polanyi 1966 1958 it should also be noted that showing the influence of habits does not imply that modeling decisions are completely determined by them studies exploring the conditions of emergence of new process representations could enable to explore the limits of their influence finally other methodologies most notably direct ethnographical observation could now be deployed to observe the processes framed into words by the interviewees diversifying the methods of qualitative data collection might enable to overcome limitations inherent to interviews such as possible a posteriori rationalizations induced by the perceived necessity by the interviewee to provide a compelling story of his or her own practices or the omission of particular aspects either regarded as unworthy of interest or disadvantageous 3 8 navigating through different disciplines and types of models the limited number of interviewees does not enable all encompassing generalizations for which our exploratory study was not designed however we had wished to account for some of the diversity within earth and universe sciences by selecting interviewees from different disciplines and whose models ranged from very simple to highly complex and from local to global our findings did not seem to be restricted to one specific class of models or disciplines the analysis presented in section 3 2 to 3 4 linked examples from models generally partitioned within distinctive categories and covered by different specific literature similar results appeared to emerge from varied contexts and contents future research could be conducted to explore this diversity by encompassing both an even wider range of disciplines and more modelers from a same discipline in order to explore internal diversity conversely limiting oneself to one case study within one discipline could enable to observe in greater details and in the making the processes addressed herein such ethnographical case studies could prove profitable to study the conjoint role of other factors in decision making which the interviewees did not spontaneously allude to such as institutional and political triggers as well as technical and economical constraints similarly we call for studies tailoring a specific type of models within one discipline such as process based models in hydrology or simple models in ecology see section 3 3 1 unseen correlations between the model type and its context could explain habits not determined by personal or inter personal influences 4 conclusion we presented the outcomes of the first research basing itself on the methodological and theoretical framework of science and technology studies to investigate decision making in environmental model construction we hereby aimed at exploring the modelers own narratives as opposed to the written accounts in scientific articles extensive face to face semi directed interviews were conducted with european and north american senior scientists from various disciplines of earth and universe sciences the interviews were recorded and entirely transcribed this methodology was well accepted by the interviewees who displayed particular openness when asked to explain choices they had made during the process of model construction the interviewees engaged a variety of actors in their narratives the description of personal inter individual and collective influence on modeling decisions was not sought for in the interview grid but spontaneously emerged from the modelers narratives we showed how individual actors predominantly members of the interviewees thesis committees were often credited with the choice of a particular representation of a phenomenon which was transferred to the modeler and progressively incorporated to become his own this transfer played a paramount role in the interviewees justifications of using a representation rather than another even in competitive and controversy laden contexts a thesis director s or a colleague s own modeling practices were spontaneously referred to as the origin of a choice which in several cases still marked the interviewee s modeling decades later next to individual actors modelers also made frequent mention of generic collectives in which they deemed the representation to be established or even normative they appeared to be strikingly conscious of their practice being specific to a school or field in their own discipline by using a particular representation the modelers anchored themselves in a collective this anchoring could either be a mere consequence or a pursued objective these results emerged from varied contexts and contents across different disciplines and types of models we engaged the sociological concept of habit to discuss the incorporation of choices evolving from a transfer from a former professor colleague or alike to a self evident practice in line with latour 2013 and kaufmann 2001 habits were presented as i smoothing discontinuities in the course of actions ii embedding social knowledge the importance of modeling habits in enabling expertise and efficiency was emphasized yet made conditional on one s awareness of the decisions initially made and their reasons habits are never far from automatisms we are not describing modelers as being determined by habits however at the level of both the individual and the community tracking modeling habits in reverse hereby unveiling and analyzing the reasons for made choices may lead to a better understanding not only of existing practices but also of the individual preferences collective inclinations and epistemic stances which are embedded in choices transferred to novices this study is hence an important step in exploring the inter individual and collective influence on the model building process which necessarily impact the modeling outputs we see the need for additional ethnographic studies scrutinizing the role of other conjoint triggers of model decision that the interviewees did not

26154,the first stages of the modeling process remain thus far poorly studied in particular the modeler s decision making in regard to the inclusion and representation of environmental phenomena within the model anchoring itself in the theoretical and methodological framework of science and technology studies the present study aims at identifying and retracing the origin of the modeler s choices extensive semi constructed interviews were conducted with european and north american modelers in a variety of disciplines within earth and universe sciences the outcome of the interviews sheds light on the role of different actors in transferring choices progressively incorporated in the modelers practice up to becoming self evident we introduce and engage the sociological concept of habits as an additional layer of analysis modeling habits can contribute to efficiency and expertise provided their origin epistemic load and implications in regard to collectives are assessed keywords model construction model structure identification decision making sociology habits 1 introduction the modeling community aims at sound modeling practices the ubiquity of numerical models computer simulation models of processes occurring within a system in scientific research and their use for decision making processes framed in a context of political and public defiance has led environmental modelers to pay increasing attention towards enhancing the credibility of their models a vast number of studies have been devoted to the assessment of model uncertainty refsgaard et al 2007 notably through sensitivity analyses error propagation calculations or multi modeling approaches climate science has witnessed an almost exponential rise of model intercomparison projects eyring et al 2016 a nowadays spreading practice in various disciplines e g kim et al 2018 krysanova et al 2017 rosenzweig et al 2013 thielen et al 2008 in parallel the evaluation of model performance remains a sensitive topic academically and when collaborating with stakeholders not surprisingly it has triggered extensive discussion in the modeling community numerous studies can be found on approaches to model evaluation see e g bennett et al 2013 harmel et al 2014 its philosophical relevance oreskes et al 1994 and terminological and epistemological alternatives rykiel 1996 beven and young 2013 augusiak et al 2014 the above mentioned body of literature focuses primarily on the last stages of the modeling process uncertainty assessments model intercomparison and performance evaluations are generally realized after the construction of the model in comparison the initial steps of the modeling process including the selection of processes to be represented their associated equations software etc are far from having been addressed as closely in the context of water management and environmental decision making some authors have called for more global consideration of the modeling process from start to finish in the aim to establish good practices and to head towards quality assurance of models grimm et al 2014 jakeman et al 2006 refsgaard et al 2007 sound modeling practices after all shall not be restricted to a particular stage of modeling in this perspective the present research precisely focuses on the least studied steps of the modeling process the very initial steps of the model building activity which are just as likely to impact the end of the pipe product as later stages when reflecting on the practices of modeling a striking aspect of model construction lies in the number of decisions that have to be made by the modeler or his group beck and krueger 2016 related the existence of these choices to the scientific uncertainty inherent to environmental modeling 1 1 in the case of integrated assessment modeling beck and krueger 2016 distinguish scientific uncertainty from ethical uncertainty the latest being associated to the different possible approaches to address ethical implications of climate change most natural processes and their interactions are far from being theoretically completely understood and hence do not enable scientific determinism additionally a model always amounts to a simplification of reality while some natural processes and interactions will be chosen to be integrated in the model others will be disregarded but even when a particular natural process has been selected the modeler may still face a wide range of representations to choose from guillemot 2010 indeed many different approaches to the inclusion of one and the same process can generally be contemplated which process representation is selected significantly influences the model behavior and the modeling outputs we asked ourselves on which basis the modeler does then select one of the representations of the process under consideration and not another one we can think of several explanations which are not new to the modeling community jakeman et al 2006 and radchuk et al 2016 extensively showed how model objectives and available data do and should constrain model construction existing paradigms and theoretical accounts also guide the choice of particular representations or suggest relationships between different model variables on the intricate relationship between models and theories see for example morgan and morrison 1999 and winsberg 2010 1999 the same applies to technical constraints the modeler necessarily has to make choices based on the limitations of available software and computational power while these explanations were handled in the modeling literature as external factors discussion emerged on their internal psychological ethical counterparts beven 2008 1991 and westerberg et al 2017 engaged the concept of perceptual models encompassing the modeler s personal representation of the hydrological system or of uncertainty azadi et al 2017 investigated the philosophical paradigms underlying land use change models van der sluijs 2002 and krueger et al 2012 stressed the subjective and implicit nature of modeling assumptions voinov et al 2014 advocated appropriate assessment and communication of values of both modelers and users during the process of modeling drawing from operational research hämäläinen 2015 shed light on possible behavioral issues related to the modeler such as cognitive and motivational biases while lahtinen et al 2017 insisted on the path dependence of decisions in model construction we however identify a rarely studied link between the seemingly external theoretical data driven technical and internal roots for decision making in the process of model construction indeed the modeler has seldom been considered as a social actor within networks a notable exception concerns the interface between the political decision making spheres and modeling which has been approached among others in the context of climate modeling and integrated model assessments by shackley et al 1999 and beck and krueger 2016 the two studies insisted on the mutual construction of modeling and policy the former displayed how the modeler s implicit view of the policy process is likely to influence his epistemological stance and his modeling practices while the latter highlighted the political and ethical implications of each modeling choice addressing more broadly the embedding of water science research in its social context krueger et al 2012 presented an account of the coproduction of knowledge by experts and non certified expert stakeholders and citizens while these studies have contributed significantly to the understanding of interactions of modeling practices and policy the modeler also acts within scientific networks which has been studied less extensively however she is part of a group within an institute or a research department attached to an institution she was maybe member of other groups before she has been interacting with other individuals in and outside of her institute for years and became part of an international network she reads meets discusses presents submits defends reviews prior to that she was educated in a particular university or in several ones where others have taught and supervised her how could this not influence her modeling within science and technology studies krueck and borchers 1999 shackley 2001 and sundberg 2010 approached institutional and disciplinary cultures of modeling in climate science and astrophysics modelers so we think are not unaware of these aspects playing an important role in model construction the existence of modeling schools peculiar to certain universities for instance or differences in modeling approaches depending on the institute s country of origin are commonly yet informally discussed 2 2 a recent exception consists of the text mining research of addor and melsen 2019 who highlight regional preferences for the choice of hydrological models the problem we fundamentally lack empirical studies that enable us to better understand the social construction of environmental modeling amidst the plethora of best practice modeling guidelines we miss data on how modelers the individuals themselves actually make decisions when building a new model we lack observations and based upon them analyses and conceptualizations which could help the community to reflect on existing practices consequently lane 2014 called for a constructivist exploration of the modeling process beck and krueger 2016 regretted the absence of empirical investigations on how modeling choices are made in practice these empirical studies are required to pave the way for increased reflexivity on implicit and explicit mechanisms within model building which are likely to significantly impact modeling outputs the present research is a first step in this direction anchoring ourselves in the theoretical framework of science and technology studies we pursue the objective of identifying the origin of modelers decision making in model construction conceptualizing it and discussing its relevance and implications to this end we employ an established methodology from social sciences based on extensive semi directed interviews conducted with scientists constructing models in a variety of disciplines within earth and universe sciences many of which with high relevance for current societal issues related to climate change we consider choices related to representations of natural processes through time transfer functions and numerical schemes this methodology is presented in section 2 along with its epistemological justification we then explore the obtained material in section 3 and propose a conceptualization of the observed mechanisms of transfer and incorporation of choices the sociological concept of habits is then introduced and discussed as an additional suitable layer of analysis the relevance and implications of this concept for the modeling community are accordingly discussed section 4 summarizes our main findings 2 methodology the present section introduces in subsection 2 1 and 2 2 the epistemic stance adopted in the research and its justification the general design of the research the selection of the interviewees the interview grid and considerations on anonymity are addressed in subsections 2 3 to 2 7 2 1 modeling choices decision making in model construction encompasses a high number of choices made by the modeler sometimes in an iterative process it should be noted that while the existence of these choices might appear evident to the modeler they have long been overlooked by philosophical accounts which considered models to be fully derived from theory or observations see the analysis of morgan and morrison 1999 suggesting a form of scientific determinism however the modeler needs to select the temporal and spatial scale at which to simulate the system at stake as well as the desired type of output he or she has to choose the processes which he or she wants to incorporate their interactions their representation through physical equations or parametrization their numerical implementation the source of data the programming language in which to code the model the hardware and software at use many other choices are already blackboxed into the existing tools and infrastructure which are used e g programming language software data sets mathematical formalism etc this study does not address decision making in its globality but explicitly chooses to focus on one of these choices the choices considered herein concern the representations of natural processes through time transfer functions model equations representing processes over time within the system considered or numerical schemes the numerical solutions used for time transfer functions table 1 specifies whether time transfer functions or numerical schemes were addressed in the interviews we concentrate hence not on the choice of processes to incorporate but on the representation of these processes furthermore the focus lies on decisions made by individuals the model builders related to a single model equation or component 2 2 methodological stance identifying the root of decisions made during the modeling process is not a straightforward task as pointed out by guillemot 2009 and sundberg 2010 the model building activity of a researcher can prove particularly opaque to analyze through direct ethnological observation one of the dominating methodologies of science and technology studies since the pioneering work of latour and woolgar 1979 such an undertaking could provide relevant data as shown by jaton 2017a 2017b for the neighboring domain of algorithm construction however addressing the origins of decisions in model building through direct observation would require limiting oneself to decisions that are verbalized through discussions with colleagues notes and alike during the process itself in order to enlarge one s analysis to also encompass the substantial number of decisions which do not leave traces during the process one necessarily has to rely on a posteriori verbalization words hence but which words a rather straightforward approach would consist of basing one s analysis on written words only studying the literature accompanying the release of a model isolating the reasons behind modeling choices could then amount to a text analysis however the format and the purpose of the document most notably peer reviewed articles deeply reshape the narration rinck 2010 in his work on the imrad introduction methodology results analysis and discussion format pontille 2007 insists on the recomposition of the temporality of research activities that this format implies the interweaving and the superposition of research operations as they appear in the real path of empirical investigations are masked in favor of a linear narration that necessarily omits selects cuts flattens and impersonalizes objectivates the course of actions moreover and partly as a consequence far from all decisions are being documented in articles technical documentation or user manuals authors will detail the process representation they used in the model but not necessarily explain the justification of this choice we do not believe that this lack of justification represents a conscious omission rather it could indicate that the choice of this representation is a stabilized practice in the community so common that neither the authors nor the possible reviewers deem any justification necessary it is hence not the presence of words in written material justifying choices which forms our starting point but their very absence on the basis of articles or manuals we would be uncapable of retracing the origins of the modeler s choice another source another type of verbalization is required oral narration obtained in face to face meetings with the modeler herself can be just this other source of course in this case too will we not no more than with written material pretend to have access to the intangible reality of the highly complex intra and interindividual mechanism of decision making oral words too are chosen facts can be modified recomposed or eluded yet interviews through their dynamical and spontaneous nature enable a constant adaptation to the discourse of the researcher there where silence reigns questions can be asked upon there where words flow these can be collected with no maximum number of words limit which would restrict the level of detail of the information retrieved interviews have hence been a privileged methodology of science and technology studies scholars when exploring various facets of modeling see for example daniel 2018 on odor dispersion models lahsen 2005 and guillemot 2009 on global circulation models sundberg 2010 on models in astrophysics and meteorology landström et al 2011 on modeling in flood risk management kouw 2016 on hydraulic models an abundant literature has been devoted to the methodology of interviews in qualitative research one can refer to the work of among many others gubrium and holstein 2001 seidman 2013 kvale 1996 weiss 1995 or spradley 2016 2 3 general design we chose to conduct semi directed interviews one of the most widely used methods of interviews in social research quivy and van campenhoudt 1995 semi directed interviews are based on an interview grid detailed at the end of this section which is designed prior to the interviews but does not consist of a constraining listing of questions the semi prefix of the method indicates that the guiding of the interview is constantly re adapted by the interviewer to the course of the interview see mason 2004 semi directed interviews predominantly make use of open questions which call for narrative or argumentative content priority is given to the flow of the interviewee s discourse 2 4 interviewees we decided not to limit ourselves to one scientific discipline when selecting interviewees we assume that numerical modeling practices in earth and universe sciences share common issues or puzzles in kuhn s understanding of the word kuhn 1962 related to the representation of natural phenomena and their temporal and spatial scales these issues such as the trade offs between the simplifications necessarily required and the appropriate level of detail for the modeling projects objectives as well as the discretization of time and space are embracing the disciplines well beyond their traditional frontiers while the answers developed to tackle these issues can be of a specific nature we hypothesize that the process of decision making itself reaches a more generic level testing this hypothesis implies to explore the internal and external variability of modeling choices and led us to interview modelers from different scientific disciplines many of which with high relevance for current societal issues are modelers from various disciplines taking similar aspects into account when selecting representations of processes can we identify common threads beyond disciplines and specific models we consequently conducted interviews with modelers in astrophysics biogeosciences ecology geochemistry geomorphology hydrology and hydrogeology our focus on the roots of decision making led us to select researchers who actually developed the model from the earliest stages of the modeling project on additionally as the starting point of our reflection was based on the absence of justifications in accompanying written material we decided to consider models which had already been presented to the community through peer reviewed articles an uncomplicated way of choosing interviewees could then have consisted of singling out in our direct academic accountancies the modelers who satisfied these criteria yet the risk of remaining in one and the same network of researchers would be latent not that we aimed for exhaustivity an irrelevant grail whenever the complexity of human thoughts actions and interactions is at stake but we did want to account for some of the diversity in earth and universe sciences except for two none of the interviewees did hence belong to any of our professional or academic networks the interviewees were selected on the basis of their models which we identified as suiting the diversity we wished to attain in the types of models considered see section 2 5 the results presented in section 3 are predominantly based on the content of seven of the interviews a total of fourteen extensive interviews were however conducted encompassing researchers involved in different stages of the modeling process while these interviews are not explicitly considered in the analysis they formed an additional background which enabled to test the interview grid as well as to prolongate and investigate the modelers discourses the seven interviewees under consideration came from five universities or research institutes located in four different countries in europe and north america five of the interviewees were now working at a different university than the one where they had obtained their phd four of these in a different country except for one postdoctoral researcher the interviewees were senior scientists or professors 2 5 types of models an overview of the natural systems simulated by the models of the interviewees as well as their spatial scale can be found in table 1 a diversity in the types of models from models openly presented as simplistic up to highly complex ones was sought across disciplines some could run on a laptop while others required access to national supercomputing centers all interviewees constructed the model during their phd or as young postdoctoral researchers except for two researchers whose models were constructed in cooperation with others in later stages of their careers yet all interviewees who had started constructing their model more than five years prior to the interview were still actively developing it the models at stake represented a significant part of their current professional activity all models are nowadays used by groups outside of their institute and country of origin four of the seven models can be considered as highly prominent in their associated field of research yielding important yearly literature and for two of them annual or bi annual international user conferences are held 2 6 interview grid prior to the interviews the interviewees had been contacted via e mail and been solely informed of the general theme of the interview the construction of models in their field its purpose a sociological research and the geoscientific background of the interviewer they did not have access to the interview grid nor to the research objectives the interviews all face to face were conducted by the first author at the working place of the interviewee four of the interviews were conducted in french the mother tongue of these interviewees the remaining ones in english the interviews were open ended but generally lasted from one to two hours the literature surrounding the models had been carefully studied by the interviewer in forehand enabling precise questions about specific components of the models due to the nature of these semi directed interviews open questions giving priority to the interviewee s discourse this duration almost equated to the actual speaking time of the modeler and warranted in depth narratives the interviews started with an introductive question about the general context and the reasons that lead to the construction of the model this apparently trifling question pursued a double objective put the interviewee at ease by enabling him to start with a biographic narrative and shape a general understanding of the base of the construction of the model would the modeler engage theoretical technical related to data hardware or software or societal issues in his narration of the model s origin how much would the modeler intertwin his own academic biography in the initial threads of the model s story would he mention colleagues or supervisors and if so which role would he grant them what place would other pre existing models take in his explanations in some cases this introductive question could lead to up to 25 min of uninterrupted narration depending on the elements that surfaced additional questions were asked to clarify or obtain information on parts of the interviewee s story this introductive question granted a common ground of discussion and enabled the interviewer to move on to questions on more detailed aspects of the model a second set of questions focused on a particular component of the model which could either be a time transfer function representing a natural phenomenon or a specific numerical scheme the time transfer function or numerical scheme had been explicitly chosen by the interviewer because the accompanying literature did not enable one to identify the reasons of its selection by the modeler through her questions the interviewer attempted to obtain enough information enabling her to retrace the origin of the component we should point out here that we did not strive for the historical origin of the component itself in the manner of mackenzie 2003 in economics or lane 2014 in hydrology instead information was sought on the origin of the component in the modeler s experience by answering the general why did you use this component question the interviewee was naturally encouraged to cover the content of other unasked questions was it a component that the modeler had already been using in earlier work if so why did he use it in the first place was he asked or advised by others to implement it did he use other alternatives before or afterwards these aspects were often entangled by the interviewee in an argumentative net leading him to detail the added value that he perceived in the use of this component the interviewee was then asked about the reception of the model by the community this question would of course reveal more about the modeler s own perception of the reception and about how willing he was to report on criticism to a stranger yet shifting the focus to an external point of view the point of view of others on his modeling work could prove useful to assess how the modeler regarded his own community would he place himself in opposition to particular criticism referring to modeling groups inside of his discipline or would he justify alternative points of view on his work the interview was then concluded by a reverse question focusing this time on his glance on the modeling work of others the interviewee was asked what he generally deemed necessary in order to assess the quality of a new model which he would read about in a peer reviewed article what type of justifications or explanations would he require would the use of particular components be considered unavoidable would certain approaches be favored if so why this wide question the only of its kind in the interview as it did not focus on the interviewee s model enabled the interviewer to approach the interviewee s perception of the modeling activity from yet another angle time was left at the end of the interview for the interviewee to add whatever he felt had been missing during the conversation the interviews were recorded and entirely transcribed the equivalent for the interviews considered for the content analysis presented in the next section of an 80 000 words document 2 7 anonymity the names and affiliation of the interviewees quoted in section 3 remain undisclosed the interviewees are referred to through single letters from a to g their field of research can be looked up in table 1 along with the description of the system simulated by the model and its spatial scale we deem these indications necessary for the reader to picture himself the types of models at stake it should be noted that we do not conceive the interviewees as spoke persons of their disciplines representing the epistemic stance of a complete group neither do we intend to shift the emphasis of the present research on a hazardous comparison among disciplines for which our methodology was not designed however exploring the disciplinary diversity enables to question the origin of influences on modeling choices as arising from field specific differences regarding the modeling content or from inter personal dynamics 3 results and discussion this section is divided into six subsections we shall first assess the implementation of the method section 3 1 before continuing with the content analysis the interviewees accounts of the origins of the construction of their model are displayed in subsection 3 2 subsection 3 3 presents and discusses the interviewees explanations of the choice of particular representations in their model these findings are conceptualized in subsection 3 4 and framed within existing sociological accounts in section 3 5 section 3 6 explores the implications of the employed conceptualization for existing practices 3 1 epistemic position the results of this study just like any outcome from a field research whether in the disciplines under consideration or in sociology and anthropology are highly dependent on the methodological set up employed we were aware of the fact that the detail of the answers the degree of introspection the readiness to open oneself up to the questions of a stranger would derive from the interviewee s perception of the research in this respect we were surprised by the interest the interviewees displayed in the study and the confidence they placed in the interviewer the discussions proved considerably more open and franker than we would have expected part of it can probably be explained through the epistemic position of the interviewer even though the interviewees had been informed of her original background in environmental sciences they regarded the interviewer as a social scientist she had not carried out extensive research in their fields was nowadays anchored in the domain of science and technology studies and hence not perceived as a rival while the risk of facing overly controlled and contained answers vanished that of hovering at a too general level was looming in many of the interviews the modelers were tempted to explain their field of study to the interviewer as to a layman she then had to demonstrate that the discussion could engage on more detailed aspects of the modeling process the turn was generally reached when the interviewer started asking questions on a particular component of the model using the modeler s article as reference for the discussion the most manifest illustration of such a tipping point appeared in an interview conducted with a modeler who straight after the interviewer quoted the work from a scientist of the same field expressed his surprise and immediately dropped the formal french vous for the colloquial tu you the interview could then continue on a more detailed and technical basis the position of the interviewer might hence be considered as two fold simultaneously in and outside the domain of study it guaranteed both a distance and a proximity to the interviewee which could explain some of the density of the collected answers 3 2 narrating the origins of the modeling process the methodological choice to use oral narratives as a source stemmed from the assumption that scientific articles exert significant reshaping and cutting out of the course of events when they were asked about the general context and the reasons that lead to the construction of the model the interviewees narratives were indeed convoluted drifting away from the motivations reported in their academic research article s on the model considered the geomorphologist a whose article strongly underlined the drawbacks of pre existing models high computational demands or predictive uncertainty as a justification for the model s construction immediately weakened the importance of the role these drawbacks had actually played in the modeling process that s more to that s very common when you write a paper about modeling you show the strength of the other models but then this is the limitation and you continue to do that for several models and your model is trying to address those limitations it s almost like selling the model so why do we need this model you know so that s usually how i phrase all my papers the reality or the interviewee s narrative about the historicity of events proved more complex rather than involving other preexisting models the interviewee assigned significant emphasis to the role of individual actors and coincidental encounters the professor who interviewee a was working with anchored in fluvial geomorphology indeed met a field person from another research area wetland sciences during a meeting this wetland scientist told him about an erratic phenomenon they had observed in the field which seemed hard to predict the professor being a modeler could see the link between that phenomenon which he had not previously worked on and a modeling technique based on cellular automata that was quite well known and had a bit of popularity in his own field geomorphology he subsequently told his conversation partner that a model could possibly explain this behavior and instructed interviewee a to build the model so he came back to the office and he explained to me this whole dialog he had and he said hey would you like to build it on your free time i said sure why not so that s how that started the role of interviewee a then amounted to code the model according to the method identified by his professor but also in a later stage to squeeze the model s intricate coincidental genesis in the mold of scientific writing several actors were indeed intertwined in interviewee s a narrative from the very beginning on yet entirely replaced within the article in favor of a posteriori rationalization a particular environmental issue leading to a research question the drawbacks of existing models to tackle it leading to the necessity of this innovation etc the puzzle encountered by the wetland scientist his fortuitous discussion with the professor in geomorphology the community within which the modeling technique was quite well known and to which the professor belonged however all played a substantial role in the commencement of the modeling project these first answers on the general context of model construction of which as we will see below interviewee a s narrative seemed rather representative than outlying appeared to confirm our methodological stance to go beyond what could have been deduced from scientific articles only indeed before even approaching during the interviews particular choices in the representation of natural phenomena the very rationale underlying the construction of the models already appeared to unfurl rich and manifold interactions between individuals collectives institutions and their sociotechnical networks the narrative of interviewee b is a further example in this regard as a hydrologist interviewee b was hired in his current university to build a global hydrological model his director had identified the construction of a global model as a niche a decision interviewee b refers to as strategical the only question that we had was we had to build a model and yeah that was it there was no direct scientific question other than just getting the model going so laughs yeah so it was a bit of a strange deal constructing a new model rather than using a pre existing one could prove profitable in the long term interviewee b reported that while no direct application was determined the model would contribute to establish an innovative orientation of the research group in hydrology its existence would open up collaborations with other groups and funding opportunities as well as enable to attract researchers whose expertise would be durably beneficial for the institute with the construction of the model progressing investments were made in technical infrastructure high performance computing devices which significantly increased over time a growing number of researchers were involved in the development maintenance and use of the model contributing to its positioning on the international scene and to the constitution of a geocomputational group within the institute the model was thus an actant in structuring and stabilizing a network of scientists equipment and computing machines in the institution on the structuring role of objects in scientific practice see for example the work of latour and woolgar 1979 1993 and vinck 1999 2011 2012 far from being unique these motivations were echoed by other interviewees hydrogeologist d reported on funding opportunities related to societal issues on waste disposal steering the construction of his model geochemist c and biogeoscientist g involved strategical orientations of their university or institute in their models genesis which were coupled to a global circulation model while astrophysicist f underlined competition against other groups see section 3 4 as motivating the rapid development of an efficient and innovative alternative for the simulation of galaxy formation these first answers highlight the impossibility to separate the initial impulses to the construction of the models from their collective and institutional context of emergence which co shape them along with their designed scientific objectives having now elaborated the motivations of the construction of models we will delve into the details of the modelers choices in the representation of natural phenomena in the next sections aiming to approach this collective co shaping at closer sight 3 3 explaining choices in model construction the interviewees had constructed either all for the majority of them or substantial parts of the first version of their model themselves yet in the second part of the interview where the interviewees were invited to explain precise modeling decisions all modelers were quick to involve many other actors in their narratives the unfolding of actors in the narratives was of two kinds the actors were either individualized identified and named by the interviewees a particular person or diffusely mentioned a collective these two different cases will be treated hereafter in section 3 3 1 and section 3 3 2 it should be remembered that no question had been asked on these actors the general question as presented in section 2 6 remained that of why the interviewees had chosen this particular transfer function or numerical scheme to represent the natural phenomena at stake we expected answers involving mainly technical constraints associated to hardware and software limitations issues related to data availability results of comparisons between the application of several alternatives and observational data successful preceding experience with the implementation of the equation or numerical scheme the spontaneous immediate involvement of other actors in the answers surprised us 3 3 1 involvement of individual actors and epistemic stances whenever the interviewees engaged individuals in their narrative their role was explicitly delineated often chronologically hydrogeologist d for example whose model simulated the hydrological cycle of the earth s surface and subsurface explained that he attended courses by a professor member of his thesis committee a person he deemed really brilliant because of his knowledge of numerical methods and with a very very practical mind due to his past in industry this professor had used the method in one of his models and taught it in his course the interviewee reported to have decided straight away to use the method which became one of the distinctive features of his model 3 3 in this case precising the type of numerical method employed would be likely to reveal the identity of the modeler we hence keep it undisclosed interestingly it is only after having mentioned his professor in his narrative that interviewee d started to list technical reasons for the implementation of the method efficiency stability and rapidity these characteristics which were advantages compared to what most people were using at that time indubitably played a paramount role yet the intellectual and biographic authority of the professor stood at the forefront of the interviewee s justification of the use of the method we will not engage on a hierarchization of the actual influence of each aspect the intellectual and biographic authority of the professor versus the advantages of the use of the method for computing purposes and for departing oneself from groups competing for the same sources of funding played in the decision oral narratives let room for a posteriori rationalization too the interviewee might have wanted to emphasize through highlighting his influence the gratitude towards a professor he considered as his mentor or reversely justify the use of the method by listing its advantages however the fact that the interviewee from the very beginning of his answer on spontaneously involved another actor in his justification referred to his own education and opposed himself to other groups enables us to retrieve first glimpses at sociological aspects of decision making invisible in the accompanying literature and rarely analyzed in the modeling context members of the thesis committee most notably the thesis director himself were the individual actors that most frequently appeared in the interviewees narratives about the choice of model components colleagues though often referred to generically and less precisely identified were involved in the discourse too as acting on modeling choices for example ecologist e explained how his local model of vegetation dynamics was at first quite complicated until a colleague of his department forced him to make it as simple as possible leading him to discard terms in the time transfer function describing plant density selecting linear functions and removing any differentiation between plant components he briefly reported on the discussion with his colleague as a series of repeated questions which initiated a change of perspective on his own approach so he referring to his colleague said why do you need that points at one term of the transfer function why do you need that points at a second term of the transfer function why do you need that ecologist e consequently parameterized or suppressed the terms of the transfer function the colleague had addressed while they had been physically represented before the colleague probably never exerted an actual external constraint to parameterize or suppress these terms however the use of the verb force in forcing him to make it as simple as possible stated above is interesting in this regard because of the externality of decisions it suggests in the same way that data scarcity or computational limitations are often described in literature as constraining the choice of representations here data and computational power appeared to be available the suggestion of his colleague which ecologist e reported about as a decisive bottleneck in the development of the model seemed to be rooted into considerations of epistemic nature interestingly while ecologist e seemingly easily accepted the input of his colleague he rejected comments of the reviewers of the first journal he submitted the manuscript on his model to which deemed it too simplistic just like the comments of hydrologists who called for a more explicit representation of overland flow within his model conversely the interviewee modified the nowadays widely used model towards even greater simplicity with one of his doctoral students in later stages of model development simplicity was repeatedly advocated in the course of the interview as a form of epistemic virtue to which the interviewee was increasingly tending over his career while he had already built very simple models during his phd he had started to complexify them after it the encounter with his colleague appeared to have resonated with his epistemic stance and brought him back to an approach of modeling which he nowadays strongly identified himself with his colleague s questions we could interpret had steered the representation towards their shared epistemic stance the reviewers and hydrologists comments distant from it had been disregarded ecologist e was the interviewee who most clearly established a link between his modeling choice and his and his colleague s epistemic stance however five of the remaining six modelers also spontaneously alluded during the interviews to what they frequently defined as their modeling philosophy the consistent and repeated use of the term simplicity in ecologist e s discourse could be linked to the simplicity complexity dichotomy being often discussed within the discipline e g peck 2004 merow et al 2014 simplicity having historically been a well established epistemic view on modeling in ecology see the analysis of evans et al 2013 the strong discipline specific past discussions on process based or physically based versus conceptual modeling see for example freeze and harlan 1969 beven 1989 1993 grayson et al 1992 could also explain hydrologist b s and hydrogeologist d s up front framing of their models within one of the two approaches at the very beginning of the interviews noteworthily the sociotechnical implications of these epistemic views on modeling appeared to be very different from one discipline to another describing his cosmological model as being of the discovery type as opposed to models designed for forecasting purposes astrophysicist f appeared very close to ecologist e s and geomorphologist a s approach when he stated that in this discovery mode we have to simplify the equations up to the extremes you should not get troubled by a whole bunch of thorny considerations yet the geomorphological and the ecological simple models required only a few lines of code and very limited computational time while the simple cosmological model was run on a national supercomputing center and demanded extensive numerical solving techniques while the dichotomy between competing epistemic views seemed very common across disciplines the underlying implications appeared discipline specific these epistemic dimensions of modeling surfacing in the interviews connect two social dimensions of the origin of modeling choices the inter personal one which we outlined in this section and the collective one which will be treated into more details in section 3 3 2 3 3 2 allusion to collectives beside the role of individual actors on modeling choices and epistemic dimensions of modeling being amply mentioned modelers recurrently referred in their narratives to collectives this case was most obvious for geochemist c who incorporated in his answers his institute or the entire community of scientists from his field of study his model which simulated the distribution and evolution of greenhouse gases and aerosols within the atmosphere was coupled to a global circulation model gcm and regularly participated in international model intercomparison projects which he repeatedly made mention of the interviewee seemed not to perceive his model as a singularity but as one representative of a set of models which all pursued an identical objective accordingly whenever the interviewee started his sentence with this model he automatically corrected himself and replaced the words by each model the wall of collectivity could not be broken his practices were that of an entire group which he very coherently identified himself with this represented a peculiarity in comparison to the other interviews in which the modelers all started a case specific narrative a possible explanation could lie in geochemist c s research field the modeler emphasized how in his domain the ensemble median forecast obtained from model intercomparison projects and based on forecasts from a set of different models is considered to yield better results than any of these models alone what seemed to be sought for was not the one model displaying outcomes in best accordance with observations but a diversity of models that enabled to represent the scientific uncertainty at play in climatic processes the fact that his model simulated particular aerosols such as desert dust with increased physical accuracy while focusing less on marine salts for example was hence deemed by the interviewee as serving the community by increasing the diversity of representations this collective endeavor was particularly striking in geochemist c s narrative and could not be explained by his participation to model intercomparison projects alone indeed biogeoscientist g s model just as geochemist c s was also coupled to a gcm and took part in a high number of intercomparison projects too yet interviewee g did not adopt a similar collective mode of narration while frequently mentioning and comparing his approach to that of other models he dove into its singularities and its individual genesis a main difference between these two cases may reside in the strong structural and epistemic divergences between biogeoscientist g s model which simulated the phenology and carbon cycle of the biosphere and the alternative ones geochemist c appeared to find these divergences less prominent in his own discipline which facilitated his identification with an entire set of models while geochemist c s answers represented an outlier through his constant collective mode of narration collectives were not absent from the other interviews these collectives were loosely and atemporally called upon they were utterly generic in a striking opposition to the explicit mention of individuals reported about in section 3 3 1 hydrologist b described an equation he used to represent evapotranspiration within his global hydrological model as being a kind of hydrological practice more or less the standard adding later on that if people have the data they will then use it here data availability appeared to act as a first filter among alternatives excluding representations that required data for example root fraction and canopy resistance the modeler did not possess the extent of their use within the community or more precisely within the collective sharing a similar epistemic stance acted as a second one while explaining his choice of another transfer function to represent snow melt and snow accumulation he outlined a general approach to component selection one of the first things that you do when starting to build a model is that you start looking at what are the typical components of models that exist and this component is i think one of the most well known this thought was rephrased in a later stage of the interview but often of course you look at yeah what is a kind of consensus within hydrological practice and that that s your starting point the description of a representation as standard typical or as belonging to a consensus or disciplinary practice was echoed by geormophologist a who considered the cellular automaton representation his professor had chosen to have a bit of popularity in his field or by biogeoscientist g who reported that everybody almost all models use this representation of photosynthesis which is a bit the one of reference even though alternatives existed ecologist e described a time transfer function he used for plant growth as very common typically used for that and five other parts of time transfer functions as textbook he seemed surprised to be asked about the origin of the implementation of these representations which he precisely considered to be so common yet this apparent triviality was exactly what we aim to scrutinize the common typical popular or well known nature of the representation suggests the absence of choice the representation imposes itself through its wide use in the community in the eyes of the modelers the choice of that representation is hence well nigh not perceived as one a choice was still made since alternatives existed in each of the cases detailed above but the interviewees narratives seemed to imply that the choice had been made by others embraced in the above cited terminology engaging collectives not only had these implied collectives rendered the choice trivial through its ubiquity they had also set it as a standard hydrologist b or as a reference biogeoscientist g by using that one representation the modeler was thus within the norm which implied collectives these norms referred to remained however unclear typical standard very common or well known for whom everybody was a generalization the interviewees were often gradually whittling down in the course of the interview they first reduced it to their own discipline as in the case of geomorphologist a and hydrologist b cited above ecologist e asserted that hydrologists and meteorologists would defensively stand up when confronted to the transfer functions used within his model biogeoscientist g criticized the fact that ecologists would seek for simplicity in global models while he considered that the more generic 4 4 by generic the interviewee meant close to processes and hence less dependent on the type of vegetation the representation of photosynthesis was the easier it could be applied to the globe but even within the suggested frontiers of their discipline the interviewees progressively distanced themselves from an all embracing generality except for interviewee c and g they directly mentioned having faced critics from peers whose approaches and sometimes epistemic stances were different interviewee a e or criticized competing alternatives in their field b d f the peers they alluded to could slowly be excluded from the picture of the implied and norm creating collective who then were these crowds hiding behind the consensus the practice the popularity the picture remained utterly blurry should we maybe consider the interviewees generalizations to be a sign that they too could not pinpoint the exact origin of the choice that had imposed itself that it was so embodied kaufmann 2001 interiorized that its origin in the model as well as in the modeler s practice had faded away if so how to make it resurge in order to better apprehend the processes at hand the interviewees involvement of particular individuals in their narratives which we outlined in section 3 3 1 might offer a grip in order to engage on this reverse journey in the next section we dissect these individual accounts in the search of a process which could ultimately have led to the observed generalizations and to the perceived absence of choice 3 4 transfer and path dependence the involvement of human actors represented a cornerstone in the interviewees explanations about the choice of representations in their models as stated in section 3 3 1 members of the thesis committee belonged to the most cited individuals regardless of the time from five up to twenty six years that had elapsed since the interviewees who cited them had earned their doctorate through the example of hydrogeologist d we showed how the intellectual and biographic authority of a supervising professor could be intertwined in the narration of the implementation of a particular representation interviewee d reported the use of the numerical scheme as a seemingly direct transfer the choice of the professor who had used the method for his own model had been adopted by the interviewee and was still nowadays a distinctive feature of his hydrogeological model the case of interviewee f detailed below depicts a lengthier less conscious process which will be used as a starting point for our conceptual model interviewee f started to construct his model as a post doctoral researcher twenty years prior to the interview he still continues to develop this model which is nowadays used by a wide network of scientists in his research field astrophysics the model ought to simulate galaxy formation in the course of the interview the modeler spoke about rivals who were using a different numerical method to represent fluid dynamics of hydrogen this numerical method will be named hereafter zeta he went on to relate a quite spectacular quite famous controversy which had opposed the supporters of one numerical method against the other two schools which referred to specific groups across the globe 5 5 according to the interviewee these groups were not specifically found in particular regions but could co exist within a same institution the financial and institutional consequences of the controversy presented hereafter were however significantly more important in northern america than in europe and who competed with each other across different subdisciplines from galaxy formation to planet formation the two numerical methods had such strong implications on the representation of fluid dynamics that the interviewee considered them to be structuring the entire modeling approach in some particular modeling cases the alpha representation the interviewee used proved complex a bit wobbly to apply a limitation the zeta representation could overcome however when comparisons were carried out it was realized that the zeta representation had an abominable problem and was a total disaster hydrogen simulated by zeta had the viscosity of honey even though the alpha representation also showed drawbacks the thing should not be idealized the interviewee specified several times the zeta representation was at least momentarily crushed he conveyed the impression to have stood on the right side of history the comparisons had temporary revealed winners and losers which for the latter resulted in declining funding but why did he at the very beginning long before the controversy broke out and established alpha choose to use this one rather than zeta the full answer of the interviewee to this exact question is transcribed hereunder it is an interesting question because indeed during my phd my phd director was only working with alpha and so i was educated with it and so i couldn t imagine doing something else because by lack of knowledge when we are phd students we don t know much so we and so after my thesis i naturally evolved with this approach because it was what i knew it was a natural evolution it is as yes when we can speak a language we evolve with this language so here it is a bit the same i knew how to speak alpha and so i naturally kept on evolving with this approach but it is true that yes it is the main reason i believe this answer contrasted with the vehemence displayed in the prior account of the controversy the fact that the interviewee stood on the winning side depended on his thesis director two decades ago had the latter been working with zeta the interviewee suggests he would himself have been likely to use this alternative numerical method in addition to this relativistic perspective the interviewee s answer deserves attention for another aspect it underscores that of a process an evolution as the repetitive use of the related verb furthermore emphasizes the interviewee depicts himself as a doctoral student without a priori preference for either of the two approaches in contact with a user of the alpha approach moreover holding the academic responsibility to guide his work his thesis director the interviewee is progressively educated to use it the evolution continues well beyond his doctorate having gained particular skills in using alpha the interviewee is naturally inclined to pursue that direction drifting away from what originally could be considered as a coincidence this process appears self reinforcing the more the interviewee uses alpha the more the probability of him switching to zeta in the course of his career diminishes the interviewee s analogy with languages is enlightening in this regard implementing a numerical method requires learning the gain of particular skills in other words time and efforts the re use of a numerical method mastered by the modeler hence smooths out the friction edwards 2013 of this process by speaking a language he is already fluent with he avoids having to invest supplementary time and cognitive resources in starting from scratch anew the astrophysicist f is not anymore under the academic influence of his phd director but both explicit and tacit knowledge accumulated through the repetitive use of alpha induce a path dependence david 1985 lahtinen et al 2017 this path dependence is of course reinforced or rendered less reversible by the suitability of the alpha method to the interviewee s objectives and its success in comparison to zeta this aspect of path dependence was also evoked by geomorphologist a and hydrologist b geomorphologist a witnessed with skepticism current external endeavors to increase physical descriptions of processes within his model it s like something is working why do you want to change it when being asked by the end of the interview whether he had anything to add hydrologist b started to outline that for him a funny thing in model building was that a lot of choices you make are to a certain extent subjective and went on to describe what he called the legacy effect at a given moment you have the legacy effect in the model you know stuff you put in a long time ago and yes maybe you want to change it but then at a given moment it becomes difficult to change it and also there are things in a model that are still relatively you know you put them in at initial steps and well they function the legacy effect mentioned by hydrologist b can be understood as a synonym of path dependence here the internal structure of the model is seemingly presented as an additional factor contributing to the modeler keeping the same representation changing of representation could require modifying the very structure of the model while many developments were based on it implying considerable time investment and technical difficulties just as for geomorphologist a the fact that the model functions functioning being regularly defined by the interviewees as producing results in accordance with available observations reinforces the path dependence and diminishes the likeliness of the modeler throwing himself into the challenges of the modification of a representation additionally and albeit not directly mentioned by the interviewees funding opportunities can also contribute to the reinforcement of the path dependence by encouraging the extension of a specialized track the modeler already embarked upon 3 5 incorporation and anchoring the evolution astrophysicist f refers to can be split into two phases displayed in fig 1 we shall describe the first phase as the transfer of a choice of a particular representation alpha from an external actor the thesis director to the modeler interviewee f the representation is progressively incorporated by the modeler in his practice up to becoming his own a second phase defined as incorporation in the language analogy the modeler becomes fluent he gains skills and expertise which render the use of the representation increasingly evident note that these two phases are not divided by a sharp line rather the choice for a particular representation is gradually interiorized as the modeler keeps on using the representation we believe that another process runs in parallel to the progressive incorporation in the case of interviewee f the alpha representation was not used solely by his thesis director but by other peers too put in other words the transferred choice was or had been shared by other astrophysicists in or outside his university or institute additionally and in contrary to the zeta method it had been used by engineers too a collective the interviewee made repeated reference to in the course of the interview and which in his opinion seemed to speak for the efficiency of the method by using the alpha representation the interviewee hence implicitly joined a collective a network of researchers and engineers sharing a similar approach and epistemic stance we insist here on the implicit character this anchoring may have at the beginning of the process during his doctorate interviewee f was indeed most likely unaware of embracing a particular current distinct of that of the zeta users through his use of alpha he describes himself as not knowing of alternatives to alpha at that time it is only in later stages of his career that the anchoring in a collective became explicit and that the modeler could refer as he did to the two different schools one of which was rival through the shading line of fig 1 we postulate that the more the modeler uses the representation the more his anchoring in the network of its users solidifies collaborations with other researchers sharing a similar approach participations in conferences and publications in journals within which the representation is well accepted contribute to stabilizing the modeler s anchoring in the collective but the anchoring may in turn reinforce the incorporation itself as the dotted line on the right of the figure displays in the alpha versus zeta rivalry the outcome of the controversy acted as deepening the furrow already ploughed by the modeler the controversy confirmed him in the already incorporated use of the representation changing of representation would not only have challenged two decades of work and expertise but also implied to turn away from a relatively clear cut collective in which the modeler had established himself the initiated conceptualization represented by the two phased transfer incorporation arrow and the progressive anchoring fig 1 can prove useful to re interpret the accounts provided in section 3 3 along with interviewee f interviewees a e and d made explicit reference to the transfer of a choice of a representation geormophologist a explained how his professor had the idea of a cellular automaton approach that would allow to reproduce observed patterns in wetlands see section 3 2 and asked him to use it the interviewee had to become familiar with it which he did through a book that explained the algorithm in the modeler s own words the approach was very simple he rapidly assimilated incorporated it here his path however diverged from that of astrophysicist f while the transfer and the progressive incorporation was still observed it happened on a shorter definite time span indeed the project he worked on was limited in time and arising from wetland sciences did not correspond to his main discipline the interviewee moved away from the topic in his new position yet he showed particular consciousness of the implications the use of the component conveyed in regard to anchoring in particular groups in his own words his professor came from reduced complexity modeling which represented a whole field of scientists in which the approach enjoyed popularity in contrast others would not really appreciate this type of modeling we break a lot of rules in spite of his change of environment position and task the interviewee still strongly identified with the general modeling current he had implicitly been anchored in and defended it several times during the interview his professor had not only transferred a simple algorithm but a complete epistemic stance ecologist e s citation in section 3 3 1 shows similarities his colleague s interference leading him to adopt a simpler representation of plant growth and parameterize terms of the time transfer function was an input to a reevaluation of his practice it ultimately anchored him more firmly in an approach which he had identified himself with simplicity and mini modeling the explicit description by hydrogeologist d of the role a member of his thesis committee had played in his choice is also compelling in this regard by underscoring the practical mind and experience of his professor the interviewee rooted not only his professor but also himself through the use of the technique in a collective different from that of mathematicians who have their heads in the clouds as he defined them the technique which was innovative and required particular skills in numerical methods also enabled him to depart from the dominant approach of modeling that prevailed at that time which conveyed advantages in terms of funding opportunities the examples described above epitomize the left side of fig 1 characterized by a transfer and the resulting anchoring in a network of users sharing the same choice of representation yet not all interviewees alluded explicitly to these initial steps other narratives such as hydrologist b s ecologist e s and biogeoscientist g s narratives which predominantly engaged generic collectives see section 3 3 2 can rather be related to the right hand extremity of the figure the use of the representation seemed evident to the modelers imposing itself and dissipating the fact that it had been preceded by a choice the choice precisely appeared as a non choice it was fully incorporated it had anchored the modelers in a collective whose neighboring groups the interviewees did not hesitate to criticize however the transfer of the representation could not be isolated in their narratives we can hypothesize on the reasons for the more explicit mention of the transfer by some of the interviewees in astrophysicist f s competitive and controversy laden context the use of the representation acted as structuring and amounted to choose one s side while the presence of an alternative was prominent the history of the divisive representation in one own s practices was hence likely to be more conscious but the very act of the transfer may also be impressed on a more durable basis because of the personification of the choice related for example to a professor who profoundly marked either the modeler hydrogeologist d or the modeling project itself geomorphologist a 6 6 personification of modeling decisions appeared less prominent when the modeling project was not conducted by the modeler individually but by a team as in the case of geochemist c and biogeoscientist g further intra disciplinary research could enable to assess the role of collective functioning of a discipline in enabling or encouraging personal models versus consensual building similarly the intervention of ecologist e s colleague leading him to discard terms of his time transfer function describing plant density acted as an epistemic turn in his own history which rendered the choice conspicuous yet in other cases possibly less controversial personified or far reaching the choices of the same interviewee were loosely rooted back as textbook just as others had described theirs as standard or consensual all in all some decisions seem to be deemed structuring enough for their origin to be fixed in consciousness memory and narratives the path of others fade leaving us with nothing less but an apparent self evidence we cannot then but say that we use these representations precisely because we use them used them and because they are used by others around us we cannot remember why in first stance we started speaking this language we became over time so fluent with did we get acquainted with it during education under the impulsion of a supervisor through literature or by collaborating with peers in everyday situations such incorporated schemes of actions would commonly be described as habits the word choice is less trivial than it appears the concept of habit has enjoyed repeated attention and analysis from social scientists and philosophers over the last centuries up until today habit might offer the required conceptual framework to sum up our findings we shall briefly define it before exploring its implications 3 6 habits there is an inherent risk in using a nowadays colloquial word to refer to a particular concept that of a turmoil of signifieds eclipsing its actual pertinence and delineations daston and galison 2007 portrayed the tumultuous history of the concept of objectivity which went on to carry opposite meanings in the course of time the concept of habit has not much to envy in this regard first conceptualized by aristoteles camic 1986 habits were amply theorized before becoming a collateral damage of the endeavor of sociologists of the beginning of the 20th century to depart their field from psychology with the rise of behaviorism habits had indeed been restricted to mere reflex actions hence inherently individual centered sociologists progressively abandoned the term but the concept used to be richer than that in fact the very sociologists who discarded it for the sake of their discipline s institutionalization had previously used the concept as a cornerstone of their own theories most notably among them durkheim had been considering habits as the real forces that govern us camic 1986 what was meant by it were not reflex actions rather and here lies its interest for the analysis of modeler s decision making habits were understood as patterns of conduct incorporated schemes of actions which could involve reflexivity this middle range of habits as opposed to the biological automatisms implied by behaviorists and the structured structures of bourdieu s habitus bourdieu 1990 recently attracted new interest see for example latour 2013 kaufmann 2001 sloterdijk 2014 in line with camic we shall define habits as a more or less self actuating disposition or tendency to engage in a previously adopted or acquired form of action camic 1986 camic s definition seems indeed to fit the self evident depiction the interviewees rendered of some of their choices as stated in section 3 4 some choices seemed to impose themselves without always implying conscious reasoning while the colloquial usage of the word habit is often taut with negative perception a banal act social scientists have underscored its necessity if schemes of actions were never to be incorporated the modeler would at each time be confronted with decisions monopolizing his full attention similarly to an individual who would re consider alternatives to her road to work at each intersection every day of the year as latour 2013 posits habits act as smoothing discontinuities in courses of action they are what enables the individual to move forward instead of stagnating in ever recurring doubt and interrogation they are what enables the individual to gain skills expertise in other words the ones of astrophysicist f fluency in biogeoscientist g s and hydrologist b s examples taking over a set of time transfer functions describing photosynthesis for the former evapotranspiration for the latter deemed as standard or of reference and that they or their team had used before made it possible to concentrate more explicitly on other parts of the model where they considered the real innovation to be habits are needed but while some increase our skillfulness latour asserts others might degenerate into mechanical gestures and routines the difference between habits that bring us forward and automatisms that confine us in obtuseness lies in our level of attention habits smooth discontinuities the path of our decisions but they do not make them disappear completely using latour s terminology habits merely veil them what we witnessed in the interviews was this very unveiling a progressive reappearance of crossroads of intersections where actors whether individual or collective had acted as road signs in the course of action geomorphologist a s hydrogeologist d s astrophysicist f s professors and ecologist e s colleague had been these very road signs impetus to follow a particular trajectory that the interviewees progressively made their own we do not generally think about these discontinuities but we are able to retrieve them to take the control over again when a disruption occurs whenever these discontinuities are not just veiled but totally erased the automatism is looming our attention has faded we apply but are unable to tell why when adopted rather than self acquired habits convey another distinctive feature summing up much of our findings that of embedding social knowledge this property less investigated by latour has been particularly highlighted by kaufmann 1997 2001 following the theoretical contribution of the latter habits can then be considered as mediating between exteriority and interiority between the transfer from an external source to the individual incorporation as fig 1 portrays the habit that of using one representation in our modeling context cannot be detached from the network of actors which used it earlier the interviewees representations all inscribe and record a knowledge shared by individuals and which is inherently engaged through the use of the representation the habit incorporates collective practice sociotechnical and epistemic components by incorporating the habit the modelers anchor themselves in the collective too 3 7 implications our study shows that in model construction choices of representations are not made anew every time they can be transferred and evolve through incorporation to become a modeler s own modeling habit whether habits are supporting one s work in increasing expertise and efficiency or locking one up in automatisms amounts to examine our level of attention and alertness can we retrace the path of initial decisions the discontinuities the habit progressively smoothed could we revert it if we wished so or as latour 2013 portrayed with humor can we still identify the ip addresses of our modeling habits the interviews we conducted did not aim at asserting whether the interviewees could answer these questions or not we did not track habits down the concept of habit emerged from our analysis as a suitable theoretical framework to embrace the incorporation and the self evidence of decisions the interviewees depicted the above mentioned questions ought to be personal ones for all of us in some cases which we covered earlier the path of habits might be profoundly impressed on one s consciousness due to the controversial far reaching context or because of the personification of decisions in other cases the path having led to habits might be thinner requiring deeper self reflexivity whether conscious or veiled all modeling decisions have implications in regard to collectives choosing one representation rather than another amounts to anchor oneself in a social network rather than another the anchoring might be the consequence as for astrophysicist f s alpha representation but also one of the reasons of the choice see hydrogeologist d a choice is a statement that of establishing oneself in relationship to others or apart from them that of situating oneself in keeping with previous work or in dissonance with them yet as loaded with epistemic stances as the representations were the interviewees had mostly perceived them as choices only in later stages of their career at the moment of their transfer usually during the interviewee s doctorate or shortly after it these representations were non choices the modelers were not necessarily conscious of the existence of alternatives these findings should question our own awareness of choices we inherently transfer to novices and which they do not always recognize as such the issue at stake after all is that of asking ourselves whether we know why we do what we do why are we using the alpha representation if we may refer a last time to it rather than the zeta one which implicit decisions did we or others make which networks are we engaging in the choice and through it anchoring ourselves in answering these questions might not per se lead to better models but it might enable to raise one s attention and hence control on incorporated habits and lead to even more thought out weighed modeling it might too enable one to render decisions more explicit during education so as to keep alternatives visible for upcoming researchers involved in modeling presenting a representation to novices as a choice amounts to unveil a crossroad an opening to possibilities rather than the tunnel of an automatism upon which the attention long faded while the present study sheds light on habits we do not believe them to subjugate the other actants latour 1987 commonly identified as impacting decisions during the modeling process such as data availability computational power or technical constraints even though these were less spontaneously appearing in the interviewees narratives 7 7 we had expected these aspects to appear forefront in the answers of the interviewees a possible explanation might be that the interviewees considered them to be obvious self speaking constraints for the interviewer too either unworthy of mentioning or less strikingly inscribed into their memory of the course of events rather we conceive habits as intertwined with them habits play a role among other actants this articulation would deserve additional research in order to assess more accurately their conjoined roles we sketched social networks we may now need to dive into the materiality of the modeling practice in order to embrace models in their sociotechnical mialet 2012 perspective similarly habits represent only one among several theoretical concepts aiming at revealing practices progressively rendered invisible the transfer of modeling skills and not only representations for example would gain to be studied through the lens of the neighboring concept of tacit knowledge collins 2010 polanyi 1966 1958 it should also be noted that showing the influence of habits does not imply that modeling decisions are completely determined by them studies exploring the conditions of emergence of new process representations could enable to explore the limits of their influence finally other methodologies most notably direct ethnographical observation could now be deployed to observe the processes framed into words by the interviewees diversifying the methods of qualitative data collection might enable to overcome limitations inherent to interviews such as possible a posteriori rationalizations induced by the perceived necessity by the interviewee to provide a compelling story of his or her own practices or the omission of particular aspects either regarded as unworthy of interest or disadvantageous 3 8 navigating through different disciplines and types of models the limited number of interviewees does not enable all encompassing generalizations for which our exploratory study was not designed however we had wished to account for some of the diversity within earth and universe sciences by selecting interviewees from different disciplines and whose models ranged from very simple to highly complex and from local to global our findings did not seem to be restricted to one specific class of models or disciplines the analysis presented in section 3 2 to 3 4 linked examples from models generally partitioned within distinctive categories and covered by different specific literature similar results appeared to emerge from varied contexts and contents future research could be conducted to explore this diversity by encompassing both an even wider range of disciplines and more modelers from a same discipline in order to explore internal diversity conversely limiting oneself to one case study within one discipline could enable to observe in greater details and in the making the processes addressed herein such ethnographical case studies could prove profitable to study the conjoint role of other factors in decision making which the interviewees did not spontaneously allude to such as institutional and political triggers as well as technical and economical constraints similarly we call for studies tailoring a specific type of models within one discipline such as process based models in hydrology or simple models in ecology see section 3 3 1 unseen correlations between the model type and its context could explain habits not determined by personal or inter personal influences 4 conclusion we presented the outcomes of the first research basing itself on the methodological and theoretical framework of science and technology studies to investigate decision making in environmental model construction we hereby aimed at exploring the modelers own narratives as opposed to the written accounts in scientific articles extensive face to face semi directed interviews were conducted with european and north american senior scientists from various disciplines of earth and universe sciences the interviews were recorded and entirely transcribed this methodology was well accepted by the interviewees who displayed particular openness when asked to explain choices they had made during the process of model construction the interviewees engaged a variety of actors in their narratives the description of personal inter individual and collective influence on modeling decisions was not sought for in the interview grid but spontaneously emerged from the modelers narratives we showed how individual actors predominantly members of the interviewees thesis committees were often credited with the choice of a particular representation of a phenomenon which was transferred to the modeler and progressively incorporated to become his own this transfer played a paramount role in the interviewees justifications of using a representation rather than another even in competitive and controversy laden contexts a thesis director s or a colleague s own modeling practices were spontaneously referred to as the origin of a choice which in several cases still marked the interviewee s modeling decades later next to individual actors modelers also made frequent mention of generic collectives in which they deemed the representation to be established or even normative they appeared to be strikingly conscious of their practice being specific to a school or field in their own discipline by using a particular representation the modelers anchored themselves in a collective this anchoring could either be a mere consequence or a pursued objective these results emerged from varied contexts and contents across different disciplines and types of models we engaged the sociological concept of habit to discuss the incorporation of choices evolving from a transfer from a former professor colleague or alike to a self evident practice in line with latour 2013 and kaufmann 2001 habits were presented as i smoothing discontinuities in the course of actions ii embedding social knowledge the importance of modeling habits in enabling expertise and efficiency was emphasized yet made conditional on one s awareness of the decisions initially made and their reasons habits are never far from automatisms we are not describing modelers as being determined by habits however at the level of both the individual and the community tracking modeling habits in reverse hereby unveiling and analyzing the reasons for made choices may lead to a better understanding not only of existing practices but also of the individual preferences collective inclinations and epistemic stances which are embedded in choices transferred to novices this study is hence an important step in exploring the inter individual and collective influence on the model building process which necessarily impact the modeling outputs we see the need for additional ethnographic studies scrutinizing the role of other conjoint triggers of model decision that the interviewees did not spontaneously alluded to such as the sociotechnical context of model development declarations of interest none acknowledgement the anonymous interviewees are most gratefully thanked for their time
