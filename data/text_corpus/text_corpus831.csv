4155,calibration is necessary for improving raw forecasts generated by global climate models gcms to fully utilize potential benefits of the forecasts in practical applications based on quantile mapping qm this paper proposes a five parameter gamma gaussian model to calibrate monthly and seasonal gcm precipitation forecasts while qm directly maps forecasts to observations without accounting for the dependency relationship the gamma gaussian model employs the gamma distribution to normalize precipitation forecasts and observations using normal quantile transform nqt and then formulates a bivariate gaussian distribution to characterize the dependency relationship a case study is devised to calibrate global precipitation forecasts generated by the climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 using both qm and gamma gaussian models the results show that both qm and gamma gaussian models can effectively correct biases while qm can improve forecast reliability to some degree by reducing biases reliability is not always satisfactory the gamma gaussian model outperforms qm because it can ensure forecast reliability and coherence to facilitate the selection of marginal distributions for the purpose of calibrating gcm precipitation forecasts six alternative distributions i e gamma lognormal generalized extreme value generalized logistic pearson type iii and kappa distributions are employed to characterize the marginal distribution of forecasts observations in nqt it is observed that the gamma distribution is overall the most suitable and that the alternative distributions tend to fit sample specific noises and get penalized under cross validation overall the gamma gaussian model can serve as an effective tool to calibrate raw gcm forecasts for hydrological modeling and water resources management keywords precipitation forecast calibration quantile mapping gamma distribution gaussian distribution 1 introduction monthly and seasonal precipitation forecasts generated by global climate models gcms are valuable for hydrological modeling and water resources management li et al 2014 mo et al 2012 mo and lettenmaier 2014 ray et al 2015 sheffield et al 2014 yuan et al 2015b operational climate centers for example united states national centers for environmental prediction ncep and european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf develop their seasonal forecasting systems and provide operational forecast products kirtman et al 2014 saha et al 2014 jia et al 2015 kay et al 2015 johnson et al 2019 gcm forecasts are used as input to drive hydrological models and generate ensemble forecasts of streamflow and soil moisture yuan et al 2011 cannon et al 2015 thober et al 2015 yuan 2016 furthermore decision support systems informed by monthly and seasonal gcm forecasts are established to mitigate negative impacts of extreme events and increase social benefits in the united states europe australia and east asia li et al 2014 sheffield et al 2014 thober et al 2015 yuan 2016 strazzo et al 2019 calibration that is also called bias correction or post processing shrestha et al 2015 moghim and bras 2017 yang et al 2020 is a necessary step to improve the quality of gcm precipitation forecasts for their practical applications ehret et al 2012 murphy 1993 roy et al 2020 wood 2002 schefzik and möller 2018 it is because raw forecasts from gcms are generally biased unreliable and sometimes may not be as skillful as reference climatology forecasts that is raw forecasts are usually persistently larger or smaller than observations their ensemble spreads can be either too narrow or too wide and they can be less accurate than the climatology forecasts that are usually used as references by decision makers roy et al 2020 slater et al 2017 wang et al 2019a zhao et al 2017 strazzo et al 2019 these issues hinder direct applications of raw forecasts in hydrological modeling and water resources management sikder 2016 yuan 2016 in the meantime previous studies showed that calibration models can correct systematic biases and dispersion errors in raw forecasts and therefore improve forecast skill wood 2002 cannon et al 2015 yuan et al 2015a li et al 2017 stauffer et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 quantile mapping qm is a popular method to calibrate raw ensemble forecasts from gcms wood 2002 yuan 2016 monhart et al 2018 this model essentially maps the cumulative distribution function cdf of forecasts to the cdf of observations in order to correct distributional attributes like mean and variance li and babovic 2019 xu et al 2019 qm is relatively easy to implement and does not require substantial computational time and it is highly effective in bias correction rajczak et al 2016 liu et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 previous studies applied qm to calibrate not only monthly and seasonal forecasts of precipitation from gcms but also streamflow forecasts obtained from hydrological models wood 2002 hashino et al 2007 murdock et al 2015 vogel et al 2021 it is shown that qm can not only correct the climatologic mean but also the frequency and intensity of the target variable by adjusting the marginal distribution of forecasts monhart et al 2018 ngai et al 2020 besides qm has been extensively used to eliminate climatologic biases in climate projections from gcms for climate change impact assessment and correct bias in satellite precipitation estimation using reference ground based data li et al 2010 wong et al 2014 mehrotra and sharma 2016 serrat capdevila et al 2016 katiraie boroujerdy et al 2020 lv et al 2020 this paper builds a gamma gaussian model upon qm to calibrate raw forecasts of monthly and seasonal precipitation from gcms the gamma gaussian model can generally be considered as a case of the classic meta gaussian model that integrates the normal quantile transform nqt to characterize marginal distributions and the bivariate gaussian distribution to formulate dependency relationships kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 while previous studies applied the meta gaussian model to forecast calibration schaake et al 2007 schaake and wood 2008 wu et al 2011 liu et al 2013 demargne et al 2014 khajehei and moradkhani 2017 ye et al 2017 li et al 2019 this paper presents a comprehensive comparison of the meta gaussian model to qm for calibrating monthly and seasonal gcm precipitation forecasts by testing six popular alternative marginal distributions which are gamma lognormal lno generalized extreme value gev generalized logistic glo pearson type iii p3 and kappa kap distributions khedun et al 2014 stagge et al 2015 svensson et al 2017 as will be demonstrated through the case study of the ncep climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 in the north american multi model ensemble nmme project the gamma gaussian model tends to outperform the other candidates in generating reliable and skillful calibrated forecasts 2 methods 2 1 quantile mapping qm matches the cdf of raw ensemble forecasts to the cdf of observations wood 2002 piani et al 2010 liu et al 2018 it is formulated as 1 f i cdf o 1 cdf f f i where f i denotes a forecast value which is to be quantile mapped from the set of raw forecasts f i denotes the quantile mapped forecast value cdf f represents the cdf constructed by all ensemble members of raw forecasts from training samples and cdf o 1 represents the inverse cdf constructed by observations from training samples as is illustrated there are overall two steps to implement qm 1 f i is transformed into a cumulative probability value that ranges from 0 to 1 using cdf f and 2 the cumulative probability value is converted into an observed value i e calibrated forecast through cdf o 1 both cdf f and cdf o 1 can be derived by fitting parametric distributions or using the empirical distribution function wood 2002 bennett et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 qm based on parametric distributions is less influenced by sample errors and does not require frequent operations of interpolation and extrapolation zhao et al 2017 liu et al 2018 for monthly and seasonal precipitation the gamma distribution is probably the most popularly used in qm to fit the marginal distributions of forecasts and observations piani et al 2010 lafon et al 2013 liu et al 2018 the cdfs of the gamma distributions are formulated as 2 cdf f 1 γ α f γ α f β f x cdf o 1 γ α o γ α o β o x where α f α o and β f β o respectively represent shape and rate parameters of the fitted gamma distribution of precipitation forecasts observations γ α 0 w α 1 e w d w is the gamma function and γ α β x 0 β x t α 1 e t d t is the lower incomplete gamma function as shown in eqs 1 and 2 qm based on the gamma distribution has four parameters i e α f β f α o and β o 2 2 gamma gaussian model this paper develops the gamma gaussian model on the basis of qm by adding one additional parameter the correlation coefficient to characterize the dependency relationship between forecasts and observations the gamma gaussian model that falls into the category of meta gaussian model kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 is comprised of six steps as shown in fig 1 there are three steps of model fitting and three steps of model application for the gamma gaussian model ye et al 2017 li et al 2019 the first step is to transform raw forecasts to standard normal variables by nqt kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 3 f cdf normal 1 cdf f f where f represents raw forecasts f represents the normalized forecasts cdf normal 1 represents the inverse cdf of the standard normal distribution and cdf f represents the cdf derived by the fitted gamma distribution of f while forecasts are mapped by qm to cumulative probabilities that are between 0 and 1 they can also be transformed into standard normal variables by making use of cdf normal 1 which is the essence of nqt kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 krzysztofowicz and maranzano 2004 montanari and brath 2004 schaake et al 2007 bogner et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 the second step is to transform observed precipitation into standard normal variables by nqt 4 o cdf normal 1 cdf o o where o represents observations o represents the normalized observations and cdf o represents the cdf derived by the fitted gamma distribution of o through nqt f and o tend to follow standard normal distributions kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 schaake et al 2007 bogner et al 2012 5 f n 0 1 2 o n 0 1 2 the third step is to construct a bivariate gaussian distribution to characterize the relationship between normalized forecasts f and normalized observations o kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 6 f o n 0 0 1 ρ ρ 1 the correlation coefficient ρ indicates how strong the association between f and o is schaake et al 2007 wang et al 2009 its value naturally falls within the range from 1 to 1 it is 0 when there is no association between forecasts and observations it tends toward 1 when there is a positive correlation i e large small forecast values correspond to large small observed values and it tends toward 1 when there is a negative correlation i e large small forecast values coincide with small large observed values there are in total five parameters in eqs 3 to 6 the nqt parameters α f and β f for forecasts eqs 2 and 3 and α o and β o for observations eqs 2 and 4 are respectively estimated by the maximum likelihood method khedun et al 2014 stagge et al 2015 svensson et al 2017 mahmoudi et al 2019 afterwards the correlation coefficient is obtained by the standard formula of the pearson s correlation kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 therefore the gamma gaussian model is fitted in the first three steps upper part of fig 1 the next three steps utilize the fitted model to calibrate raw forecasts the fourth step is to normalize a new raw forecast by making use of the nqt in the first step the fifth step is to derive the conditional distribution of the normalized observation on the new normalized forecast from the bivariate gaussian distribution kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 7 o n ρ f 1 ρ 2 where o follows a normal distribution with mean and variance respectively given by μ o ρ f and σ o 2 1 ρ 2 schaake et al 2007 schaake and wood 2008 when raw forecasts are uninformative ρ is close to 0 and thus the conditional distribution of o turns to be like the standard normal distribution as raw forecasts become informative ρ increases and leads to the reduction of predictive uncertainty owing to the decrease of σ o 2 1 ρ 2 the sixth step is to back transform random samples drawn from the condition distribution in eq 7 by the inverse nqt kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 8 f cdf o 1 cdf normal o where o denotes samples the number is 1000 in this paper from o cdf normal denotes the cdf of the standard normal distribution and cdf o 1 denotes the inverse cdf of the fitted gamma distribution for observations therefore through steps 4 to 6 calibrated forecasts are generated from a raw forecast 2 3 alternative marginal distributions in nqt the marginal distribution plays a critical part in the above formulations of qm and gamma gaussian models the classic meta gaussian model proposed by kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 uses the nqt to handle the marginal distributions of hydrological variables that is hydrological variables are normalized by using the cdfs of different distributions and then modeled by the bivariate gaussian distribution kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 for monthly and seasonal precipitation there are a range of candidate marginal distributions including gamma yazdandoost et al 2020 lno angelidis et al 2012 gev raziei 2021 glo stagge et al 2015 p3 guttman 1999 and kap hosking and wallis 2005 distributions the alternative distributions can have two three or four parameters and their cdfs are listed in table 1 notably two parameter distributions the gamma and lno distributions have a lower bound at zero as precipitation does there are three three parameter distributions i e gev glo and p3 and there is one four parameter distribution i e kap the more flexible three and four parameter distributions generally do not have a lower bound at zero svensson et al 2017 these six statistical distributions are all used in nqt for the normalization of forecasts and observations of monthly and seasonal precipitation generally statistical distribution tends to be more flexible when it has more parameters the alternative distributions exhibit different characteristics rather than empirically choosing a best one they are tested to investigate their applicability for forecast calibration the gamma gaussian model and the tests of alternative distributions are implemented in python with the scripts presented in the supplementary material 3 experiments of forecast calibration 3 1 forecast and observation datasets numerical experiments calibrating monthly and seasonal cfsv2 precipitation forecasts are devised in this paper to test the effectiveness of the proposed gamma gaussian model in comparison with qm the cfsv2 forecasts saha et al 2014 are obtained from the data library of international research institute iri at the columbia university https iridl ldeo columbia edu sources models nmme ncep cfsv2 hindcast cfsv2 is the current operational gcm at ncep and it is developed based on cfsv1 by new modules of sea ice and land surface and improved atmosphere ocean land data assimilation systems jiang et al 2013 saha et al 2014 halder and dirmeyer 2017 the cfsv2 hindcasts are from 1982 to 2010 they are initialized by month and provide ensemble forecasts for the next 10 months with 24 ensemble members the spatial resolution of cfsv2 hindcasts has been regridded to 1 by 1 in the nmme project kirtman et al 2014 the climate prediction center cpc merged analysis of precipitation cmap is used as the observation corresponding to the forecasts xie and arkin 1997 zhao et al 2018 this dataset is also downloaded from the iri data library https iridl ldeo columbia edu sources models nmme cpc cmap similar to cfsv2 forecasts the cpc cmap precipitation dataset has also been regridded to the spatial resolution of 1 by 1 in this way observed monthly precipitation obtained from the cpc cmap has the same spatial resolution as cfsv2 hindcasts in the nmme project and is directly used to evaluate the performance of the hindcasts 3 2 experimental design this paper focuses on the forecasts of precipitation in jja which is generally summer winter in the northern southern hemisphere strazzo et al 2019 wang et al 2019a cfsv2 forecasts of monthly precipitation in june july and august and of seasonal precipitation in june july august jja are calibrated there are generally three steps firstly hindcasts and observations of precipitation for the four target periods june july august and jja are extracted from the cfsv2 and cpc cmap datasets respectively secondly qm and gamma gaussian models are applied to calibrate raw cfsv2 forecasts under leave one year out cross validation thirdly different marginal distributions are applied in nqt and then they are used for forecast calibration to examine their applicability the analysis focuses on the forecasts initialized in june specifically the monthly forecasts are generated at the same initialization time i e the beginning of june as a result the forecasts for june july and august are respectively at 0 month 1 month and 2 month lead time the seasonal forecasts for jja are obtained by adding up the monthly forecasts at the three lead times which follows previous studies slater et al 2016 slater et al 2017 strazzo et al 2019 zhao et al 2020a zhao et al 2020b similarly monthly precipitation observations for june july and august are aligned with monthly forecasts and they are also added up to form observed precipitation in jja there are in total 16 643 land grid cells in the forecast and observation datasets for the four target periods grid cells without zero precipitation values are retrieved for forecast calibration and grid cells with zero precipitation values are not considered the calibration is conducted independently for each target period and each grid cell under investigation all 24 ensemble members of raw forecasts are used to fit the cdfs in qm while the mean values of ensemble members are used to train the gamma gaussian model zhao et al 2017 lucatero et al 2018 forecast calibration is performed under the framework of leave one year out cross validation zhao et al 2017 strazzo et al 2019 when calibrating raw forecasts for the given target period in one year the pair of samples raw forecasts and observations for that year is excluded from the training samples in other words the qm and gamma gaussian models are developed using the remaining 28 pairs of samples and then used to generate calibrated forecasts for the given target period in the excluded year for each year the qm and gamma gaussian models are trained independently and then used for calibration raw forecasts for the target period in the 29 years are one by one calibrated i e cross validation and the cross validated forecasts are pooled in the verification in this way the testing sample is not implied by the training samples so that the performances of qm and gamma gaussian models are not artificially inflated to conduct a comparative analysis of marginal distributions six statistical distributions i e the gamma lno gev glo p3 and kap distributions are all incorporated into nqt specifically they are used to fit the marginal distributions of precipitation forecasts and observations and then to transform forecasts observations into standard normal variables therefore calibration models are constructed from forecasts and observations normalized by different marginal distributions the inter comparison facilitates a test of the performances of different statistical distributions in forecast calibration 3 3 forecast verification forecasts are verified in terms of bias reliability and skill murphy 1993 climatological means of ensemble forecasts m f and observations m o are calculated as 9 m f 1 n i 1 n f i m o 1 n i 1 n o i where n is the number of years under investigation here is 29 f i represents the ensemble mean of forecasts for the i th year and o i represents the observed value corresponding to f i climatological means of observations m o are plotted against those of ensemble forecasts m f in the scatterplots to illustrate the bias zhao et al 2017 when the scatter point is along the 1 1 line the corresponding climatologic mean of ensemble forecasts and observations are similar indicating that ensemble forecasts are unbiased forecast reliability describes whether the ensemble spreads of forecasts accurately represent the predictive uncertainty it is assessed by probability integral transform pit 10 pi t i cdf i o i where cdf i denotes the empirical cdf ecdf of ensemble forecasts for the i th year and pi t i represents the cumulative probability of observation o i in the cdf i if ensemble forecasts reliably capture the distribution of observations o i can statistically be regarded as random samples drawn from ensemble forecasts in this case the pit values for all observations should collectively be uniformly distributed therefore the alpha index α index is calculated using the sorted pit values renard et al 2010 bourgin et al 2014 crochemore et al 2016 bennett et al 2017 xiong et al 2019 11 α 1 2 n i 1 n pi t i i n 1 where pi t i denotes the sorted pi t i from small to large the α index represents the total deviation of pi t i from the corresponding uniform distribution when ensemble forecasts are perfectly reliable the value of α index is equal to 1 a lower value of α index indicates less reliable forecasts and the reliability is the worst when the value of α index is 0 the α index summarizes the information of pit and enables direct comparison of reliability between different target periods and grid cells bennett et al 2017 the continuous ranked probability score crps is used to evaluate the overall accuracy of ensemble forecasts pappenberger et al 2015 12 crps 1 n i 1 n cdf i x h x o i 2 d x where cdf i x denotes the cdf of ensemble forecasts for the i th year and h x o i denotes the heaviside function that represents the cdf of observation o i that is the value of h x o i is 0 when x o i and 1 when x o i huang et al 2020 the crps is calculated through numerical integration and it measures the probability weighted average of error of ensemble members of forecasts hersbach 2000 the crps is zero when cdf i x perfectly matches h x o i and its value increases as the difference between cdfs of forecasts and observations widens forecast skill indicates the performances of raw and calibrated forecasts relative to reference forecasts based on the crps forecast skill is assessed through the crps skill score crpss 13 crpss calibrated crps reference crps calibrated crps reference 100 crpss raw crps reference crps raw crps reference 100 in which crps calibrated represents the crps of calibrated forecasts obtained by qm or gamma gaussian models crps raw represents the crps of raw forecasts and crps reference represents the crps of reference forecasts which are generated by using the gamma distribution under the leave one year out cross validation a positive crpss indicates that the corresponding ensemble forecasts outperform reference forecasts and vice versa in the meantime calibrated forecasts are also verified to investigate whether they can be at least as skillful as climatology forecasts when raw forecasts are uninformative a property termed coherence krzysztofowicz 1999 4 results 4 1 performance of raw forecasts the correlation coefficient which plays a critical role in the gamma gaussian model has been extensively used to characterize the performance of raw gcm forecasts kirtman et al 2014 khajehei et al 2017 slater et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 zhao et al 2020a the correlation coefficients between raw cfsv2 forecasts and observations are presented by spatial plotting in fig 2 raw forecasts for june july august and jja which are all initialized in june are shown in separate subplots red color denotes positive correlation coefficient while blue color negative correlation coefficient overall the correlation exhibits considerable spatial and temporal variations positive correlation is observed for a substantial amount of grid cells in the western united states south america southeast asia and western and eastern australia where precipitation tends to be influenced by el niño southern oscillation zhao et al 2020a the correlation tends to be higher for forecasts for june with a lead time of 0 months than forecasts with a longer lead time which implies that raw forecasts at a shorter lead time tend to be more informative roy et al 2020 4 2 forecast bias reliability and skill for monthly precipitation in june july and august and total precipitation in jja the climatologic means of observations y axis are plotted against the climatologic means of ensemble forecasts x axis in fig 3 for raw forecasts there are a large number of points above or below the 1 1 line for the four target periods the implication is that raw forecasts are generally biased for qm calibrated forecasts points are mostly along the 1 1 line indicating that there is little difference between the climatologic mean values of qm calibrated forecasts and the corresponding observations for most grid cells this result highlights the effectiveness of qm in correcting biases of raw forecasts rajczak et al 2016 liu et al 2017 monhart et al 2018 for the gamma gaussian model climatologic means of calibrated forecasts are also virtually indistinguishable from those of corresponding observations for most grid cells that is the gamma gaussian model is also effective in removing biases in the raw forecasts and generating unbiased ensemble forecasts boxplots of the α index of raw and calibrated forecasts are shown by subplots in fig 4 the boxes illustrate the interquartile range iqr between 25th q1 and 75th q3 percentile the upper and low whiskers extend to the largest and smallest datum falling within q1 1 5iqr q3 1 5iqr and the outliers beyond whiskers are marked by blue points for the four target periods the values of α index of raw forecasts range from 0 to 1 and the median and mean values are smaller than 0 6 indicating that raw forecasts are unreliable for a large number of grid cells compared with raw forecasts qm calibrated forecasts have relatively higher α index because the biases have been effectively corrected the α index is further improved after the use of the gamma gaussian model with the values being higher than 0 8 for most of the grid cells in addition the α index of the gamma gaussian calibrated forecasts is plotted against that of the qm calibrated forecasts in fig s1 of the supplementary material it is observed that scatter points tend to distribute above the 1 1 line the indications are that the gamma gaussian model generally generates more reliable ensemble forecasts and that the reliability of qm calibrated forecasts can be unsatisfactory in some cases the crpss of calibrated forecasts obtained by qm red and gamma gaussian blue models are plotted against the correlation coefficients between raw ensemble means and observations in fig 5 while raw forecasts are far less skillful than climatology forecasts due to biases and unreliable ensemble spreads both qm and gamma gaussian models can improve forecast skill to some degree it is observed that both qm and gamma gaussian models can produce positively skillful forecasts when there is a strong positive correlation forecast skill tends to increase with correlation coefficient meanwhile when the correlation coefficient is low or negative qm tends to adjust raw forecasts in the wrong direction leading to low forecast skill wood and schaake 2008 khajehei et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 by contrast calibrated forecasts by the gamma gaussian model generally have similar accuracy to climatology forecasts when the corresponding correlation coefficient is low indicating that the calibrated forecasts are coherent krzysztofowicz 1999 it is pointed out that some negative correlation coefficients can lead to positively skillful calibrated forecasts this result can be explained by eq 7 this equation illustrates that under negative correlation raw forecasts can be flipped due to the mean value μ o ρ f of the conditional distribution and forecast uncertainty is also adjusted by the variance term σ o 2 1 ρ 2 that depends on the absolute value but not the sign of correlation coefficient strazzo et al 2019 in this case the gamma gaussian model can derive some skill by making use of negative correlation coefficients nevertheless the skill is noted to be cautious because raw forecasts are generally wrong in that they are significantly but negatively correlated with observations strazzo et al 2019 zhao et al 2020a 4 3 performances of alternative marginal distributions six alternative distributions are used to fit marginal distributions of forecasts and observations of precipitation when using nqt for the normalization seasonal observed precipitation in jja for four selected grid cells are taken as examples and their histograms and fitted pdfs are plotted in fig 6 different colors represent different marginal distributions including the gamma lno gev glo p3 and kap distributions it is observed that the two two parameter distributions i e gamma and lno are positively skewed with the lower bound at zero the gev glo and p3 distributions have three parameters and have no lower bound at zero their performances are generally similar to these of two parameter distributions when the precipitation data is positively skewed meanwhile they can become negatively skewed when the precipitation data have a slight or pronounced negative skewness as shown in fig 6d as the sole four parameter distribution under investigation the kap distribution is very flexible but it has sharp bounds at both lower and upper ends of the sample values svensson et al 2017 when the marginal distribution fitted by training samples cannot encompass all the training samples or a new raw forecast i e the corresponding cumulative probability is 0 or 1 the fitted marginal distribution is considered to be failed for june july august and jja the number of grid cells in which alternative marginal distributions succeed blue or fail grey is shown in fig 7 it is observed that there is no failed grid cell for the two parameter distributions indicating the robustness of the gamma and lno distributions three parameter distributions fail for some grid cells while the kap distribution fails for most grid cells it is mainly because raw forecasts are calibrated under cross validation when the calibration model is developed under cross validation the more flexible marginal distributions tend to overly fit sample specific noise and cannot encompass training samples or testing samples as the sole four parameter distribution under investigation the kap distribution is the most impacted by overfitting 4 4 forecast skill under six marginal distributions crpss of calibrated forecasts through cross validation are shown by boxplots in fig 8 the boxplots are for all the grid cells in which raw forecasts are successfully calibrated overall it is observed that calibration models with different distributions except kap can produce ensemble forecasts with positive skill in the meantime the gamma gaussian model tends to outperform the other models for the lno and gev distributions the models can produce ensemble forecasts with extremely negative skill and triangles are not observed for the gev due to low mean values it indicates that the coherence of the corresponding calibrated forecasts is relatively poor while models with the glo and p3 distributions can generate skillful forecasts when they are successfully applied the coherence of calibrated forecasts is slightly worse than the gamma distribution because there are more outliers below the lower whiskers than the gamma distribution for gamma lno and gev distributions precipitation observations for four grid cells are taken as examples to examine the reason for the extremely low skill observed in fig 8 as shown in fig 9 the ecdfs of the observed precipitation are shown by grey curves while the cdfs of the fitted gamma lno and gev distributions are shown by different colors monthly precipitation for the four selected grid cells is generally below 150 mm and exhibits a highly positive skewness the cdfs of the gamma distributions tend to approximate the ecdfs indicating that the gamma distributions reasonably fit the marginal distributions of precipitation observations by contrast the cdfs of the lno and gev distributions tend to deviate from the ecdfs in the meantime the cumulative probability is still smaller than 1 when precipitation exceeds 300 mm indicating that there are heavy tails for the fitted lno fig 9a and b and gev fig 9c and d distributions calibrated forecasts are generated through back transforming samples from the conditional distribution using the inverse nqt as described by eq 8 in section 2 2 the heavy tails can lead to extremely large values in calibrated forecasts and eventually diminish the forecast skill 5 discussion 5 1 extended analysis of forecasts initialized in may this paper has extended the experiments of forecast calibration to cfsv2 forecasts of jja precipitation initialized at the beginning of may compared to forecasts initialized at the beginning of june the lead time has been increased by one month specifically monthly forecasts for june july and august initialized at the beginning of may are respectively at the 1 month 2 month and 3 month lead time and seasonal forecasts are obtained by adding up the monthly forecasts similarly raw forecasts are calibrated under leave one year out cross validation and the results are shown in figs s2 to s7 in the supplementary material compared with forecasts initialized in june correlation coefficients for forecasts initialized in may fig s2 tend to be overall lower due to a longer lead time roy et al 2020 while both qm and gamma gaussian models are effective in removing biases in raw forecasts fig s3 the gamma gaussian model further improves the forecast reliability fig s4 as a result calibrated ensemble forecasts generated by the gamma gaussian model tend to be more skillful fig s5 the gamma gaussian model is built upon qm to calibrate monthly and seasonal precipitation forecasts from gcms compared with qm the gamma gaussian model has only one additional parameter which is the correlation coefficient in the bivariate gaussian distribution of normalized precipitation forecasts and observations kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 schaake et al 2007 for forecast calibration qm assumes a perfect correlation between raw forecasts and observations specifically qm directly maps the cdf of raw forecasts to the cdf of observations when there is a low or negative correlation qm can adjust raw forecasts in the wrong direction which leads to relatively unreliable spread and negative forecast skill maraun 2013 wong et al 2014 the correlation coefficient is considered in the gamma gaussian model to characterize the strength of association between forecasts and observations the results of calibrated forecasts highlight that the correlation coefficient contributes to the more promising predictive performance of the gamma gaussian model in comparison to qm schaake and wood 2008 zhao et al 2017 5 2 alternative marginal and joint distributions six alternative distributions svensson et al 2017 are used in the nqt to test which distribution is suitable in calibrating monthly and seasonal gcm precipitation forecasts the results of figs 6 to 9 and s6 to s7 generally suggest that the gamma distribution outperforms the other distributions compared with the gamma distribution the p3 distribution tends to produce less skillful ensemble forecasts and even fail for some gird cells the kap distribution is quite flexible but it results in a model with nine parameters in total which performs poorly for a large number of grid cells due to overfitting michaelsen 1987 generally in the numerical experiments statistical distributions with more parameters are observed to tend to overly fit sample specific noise and get penalized under cross validation michaelsen 1987 therefore this paper proposes the use of the gamma distribution due to its robustness and effectiveness stagge et al 2015 liu et al 2018 yazdandoost et al 2020 the bivariate gaussian distribution has been a popular method to characterize the dependency relationship between two variables due to its simplicity and effectiveness schaake et al 2007 wang et al 2009 yang et al 2021 it is noted that the copula sklar 1959 joe 1997 nelsen 2007 provides a more general approach to model the dependency relationship between hydrological variables and that the copula has been widely used in drought assessment and statistical downscaling ben alaya et al 2015 hao et al 2016 sharifi et al 2019 there are various copula families including archimedean extreme value and elliptical khedun et al 2014 among them the gaussian copula in the elliptical family is one of the most popular copulas khedun et al 2014 valle and kaplan 2019 it applies a correlation matrix to model the dependence structure of the multivariate gaussian distribution when it comes to two variables the gaussian copula can be simplified as the bivariate gaussian distribution that is used in this paper bárdossy 2006 renard and lang 2007 in the future other copula models can be used to characterize the relationship between raw forecasts and observations and the applicability of different copula models in precipitation forecast calibration can be further investigated khajehei and moradkhani 2017 5 3 relationship with existing models the gamma gaussian model that is derived by adding the correlation coefficient to qm can generally be regarded as a case of the classic meta gaussian model kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 for statistical hydrological modeling the meta gaussian model exhibits two desirable properties that are the flexibility in selecting marginal distributions and the capability to explicitly characterize the association between hydrological variables kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 the meta gaussian model has been extensively used for drought modeling and prediction feng et al 2019 feng et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 given the critical part of the marginal distribution in the meta gaussian model a comprehensive comparison of marginal distributions is conducted in this paper to facilitate the use of the meta gaussian model in calibrating monthly and seasonal precipitation forecasts from gcms six statistical distributions are tested and the results show that the gamma distribution tends to outperform the other distributions therefore the five parameter gamma gaussian model is proposed to calibrate precipitation forecasts besides the gamma gaussian model there are other calibration models such as the bayesian joint probability bjp model wang et al 2009 the censored shifted gamma distribution csgd model scheuerer and hamill 2015 the rainfall post processing rpp model robertson et al 2013 and the seasonally coherent calibration scc model wang et al 2019b compared to the gamma gaussian model these models generally have more parameters and their parameters are estimated by more sophisticated algorithms for example bjp has in total nine parameters that are estimated through bayesian inference wang et al 2009 the csgd model constructs a nonhomogeneous regression model with eight regression coefficients to link three parameters of marginal distribution to four statistics of ensemble forecasts calibrated by qm and the model parameters are estimated by implementing the linearly constrained optimization algorithm scheuerer and hamill 2015 furthermore rpp and scc models are developed to calibrate raw forecasts from numerical weather prediction nwp models robertson et al 2013 wang et al 2019b these models can readily be applied to calibrate raw forecasts and to generate reliable and skillful calibrated forecasts 6 conclusions this paper has built upon qm a gamma gaussian model by applying nqt to normalize precipitation forecasts and observations and constructing a bivariate gaussian distribution to characterize the dependency relationship between the normalized forecasts and observations a case study is devised to calibrate monthly and seasonal precipitation forecasts from the ncep cfsv2 using both qm and gamma gaussian models with six alternative marginal distributions implemented in nqt to compare the applicability and robustness the precipitation forecasts for june july august and jja are calibrated under the framework of leave one year out cross validation the results show raw forecasts are reasonably correlated with observations for a considerable number of grid cells around the globe but raw forecasts are generally biased both qm and gamma gaussian models are highly effective in correcting biases in raw forecasts compared with qm the gamma gaussian model can furthermore generate reliable and coherent forecasts overall the gamma gaussian model can serve as an effective tool to calibrate monthly and seasonal gcm precipitation forecasts for hydrological modeling and

4155,calibration is necessary for improving raw forecasts generated by global climate models gcms to fully utilize potential benefits of the forecasts in practical applications based on quantile mapping qm this paper proposes a five parameter gamma gaussian model to calibrate monthly and seasonal gcm precipitation forecasts while qm directly maps forecasts to observations without accounting for the dependency relationship the gamma gaussian model employs the gamma distribution to normalize precipitation forecasts and observations using normal quantile transform nqt and then formulates a bivariate gaussian distribution to characterize the dependency relationship a case study is devised to calibrate global precipitation forecasts generated by the climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 using both qm and gamma gaussian models the results show that both qm and gamma gaussian models can effectively correct biases while qm can improve forecast reliability to some degree by reducing biases reliability is not always satisfactory the gamma gaussian model outperforms qm because it can ensure forecast reliability and coherence to facilitate the selection of marginal distributions for the purpose of calibrating gcm precipitation forecasts six alternative distributions i e gamma lognormal generalized extreme value generalized logistic pearson type iii and kappa distributions are employed to characterize the marginal distribution of forecasts observations in nqt it is observed that the gamma distribution is overall the most suitable and that the alternative distributions tend to fit sample specific noises and get penalized under cross validation overall the gamma gaussian model can serve as an effective tool to calibrate raw gcm forecasts for hydrological modeling and

seasonal gcm forecasts are established to mitigate negative impacts of extreme events and increase social benefits in the united states europe australia and east asia li et al 2014 sheffield et al 2014 thober et al 2015 yuan 2016 strazzo et al 2019 calibration that is also called bias correction or post processing shrestha et al 2015 moghim and bras 2017 yang et al 2020 is a necessary step to improve the quality of gcm precipitation forecasts for their practical applications ehret et al 2012 murphy 1993 roy et al 2020 wood 2002 schefzik and möller 2018 it is because raw forecasts from gcms are generally biased unreliable and sometimes may not be as skillful as reference climatology forecasts that is raw forecasts are usually persistently larger or smaller than observations their ensemble spreads can be either too narrow or too wide and they can be less accurate than the climatology forecasts that are usually used as references by decision makers roy et al 2020 slater et al 2017 wang et al 2019a zhao et al 2017 strazzo et al 2019 these issues hinder direct applications of raw forecasts in hydrological modeling and water resources management sikder 2016 yuan 2016 in the meantime previous studies showed that calibration models can correct systematic biases and dispersion errors in raw forecasts and therefore improve forecast skill wood 2002 cannon et al 2015 yuan et al 2015a li et al 2017 stauffer et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 quantile mapping qm is a popular method to calibrate raw ensemble forecasts from gcms wood 2002 yuan 2016 monhart et al 2018 this model essentially maps the cumulative distribution function cdf of forecasts to the cdf of observations in order to correct distributional attributes like mean and variance li and babovic 2019 xu et al 2019 qm is relatively easy to implement and does not require substantial computational time and it is highly effective in bias correction rajczak et al 2016 liu et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 previous studies applied qm to calibrate not only monthly and seasonal forecasts of precipitation from gcms but also streamflow forecasts obtained from hydrological models wood 2002 hashino et al 2007 murdock et al 2015 vogel et al 2021 it is shown that qm can not only correct the climatologic mean but also the frequency and intensity of the target variable by adjusting the marginal distribution of forecasts monhart et al 2018 ngai et al 2020 besides qm has been extensively used to eliminate climatologic biases in climate projections from gcms for climate change impact assessment and correct bias in satellite precipitation estimation using reference ground based data li et al 2010 wong et al 2014 mehrotra and sharma 2016 serrat capdevila et al 2016 katiraie boroujerdy et al 2020 lv et al 2020 this paper builds a gamma gaussian model upon qm to calibrate raw forecasts of monthly and seasonal precipitation from gcms the gamma gaussian model can generally be considered as a case of the classic meta gaussian model that integrates the normal quantile transform nqt to characterize marginal distributions and the bivariate gaussian distribution to formulate dependency relationships kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 while previous studies applied the meta gaussian model to forecast calibration schaake et al 2007 schaake and wood 2008 wu et al 2011 liu et al 2013 demargne et al 2014 khajehei and moradkhani 2017 ye et al 2017 li et al 2019 this paper presents a comprehensive comparison of the meta gaussian model to qm for calibrating monthly and seasonal gcm precipitation forecasts by testing six popular alternative marginal distributions which are gamma lognormal lno generalized extreme value gev generalized logistic glo pearson type iii p3 and kappa kap distributions khedun et al 2014 stagge et al 2015 svensson et al 2017 as will be demonstrated through the case study of the ncep climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 in the north american multi model ensemble nmme project the gamma gaussian model tends to outperform the other candidates in generating reliable and skillful calibrated forecasts 2 methods 2 1 quantile mapping qm matches the cdf of raw ensemble forecasts to the cdf of observations wood 2002 piani et al 2010 liu et al 2018 it is formulated as 1 f i cdf o 1 cdf f f i where f i denotes a forecast value which is to be quantile mapped from the set of raw forecasts f i denotes the quantile mapped forecast value cdf f represents the cdf constructed by all ensemble members of raw forecasts from training samples and cdf o 1 represents the inverse cdf constructed by observations from training samples as is illustrated there are overall two steps to implement qm 1 f i is transformed into a cumulative probability value that ranges from 0 to 1 using cdf f and 2 the cumulative probability value is converted into an observed value i e calibrated forecast through cdf o 1 both cdf f and cdf o 1 can be derived by fitting parametric distributions or using the empirical distribution function wood 2002 bennett et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 qm based on parametric distributions is less influenced by sample errors and does not require frequent operations of interpolation and extrapolation zhao et al 2017 liu et al 2018 for monthly and seasonal precipitation the gamma distribution is probably the most popularly used in qm to fit the marginal distributions of forecasts and observations piani et al 2010 lafon et al 2013 liu et al 2018 the cdfs of the gamma distributions are formulated as 2 cdf f 1 γ α f γ α f β f x cdf o 1 γ α o γ α o β o x where α f α o and β f β o respectively represent shape and rate parameters of the fitted gamma distribution of precipitation forecasts observations γ α 0 w α 1 e w d w is the gamma function and γ α β x 0 β x t α 1 e t d t is the lower incomplete gamma function as shown in eqs 1 and 2 qm based on the gamma distribution has four parameters i e α f β f α o and β o 2 2 gamma gaussian model this paper develops the gamma gaussian model on the basis of qm by adding one additional parameter the correlation coefficient to characterize the dependency relationship between forecasts and observations the gamma gaussian model that falls into the category of meta gaussian model kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 is comprised of six steps as shown in fig 1 there are three steps of model fitting and three steps of model application for the gamma gaussian model ye et al 2017 li et al 2019 the first step is to transform raw forecasts to standard normal variables by nqt kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 3 f cdf normal 1 cdf f f where f represents raw forecasts f represents the normalized forecasts cdf normal 1 represents the inverse cdf of the standard normal distribution and cdf f represents the cdf derived by the fitted gamma distribution of f while forecasts are mapped by qm to cumulative probabilities that are between 0 and 1 they can also be transformed into standard normal variables by making use of cdf normal 1 which is the essence of nqt kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 krzysztofowicz and maranzano 2004 montanari and brath 2004 schaake et al 2007 bogner et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 the second step is to transform observed precipitation into standard normal variables by nqt 4 o cdf normal 1 cdf o o where o represents observations o represents the normalized observations and cdf o represents the cdf derived by the fitted gamma distribution of o through nqt f and o tend to follow standard normal distributions kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 schaake et al 2007 bogner et al 2012 5 f n 0 1 2 o n 0 1 2 the third step is to construct a bivariate gaussian distribution to characterize the relationship between normalized forecasts f and normalized observations o kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 6 f o n 0 0 1 ρ ρ 1 the correlation coefficient ρ indicates how strong the association between f and o is schaake et al 2007 wang et al 2009 its value naturally falls within the range from 1 to 1 it is 0 when there is no association between forecasts and observations it tends toward 1 when there is a positive correlation i e large small forecast values correspond to large small observed values and it tends toward 1 when there is a negative correlation i e large small forecast values coincide with small large observed values there are in total five parameters in eqs 3 to 6 the nqt parameters α f and β f for forecasts eqs 2 and 3 and α o and β o for observations eqs 2 and 4 are respectively estimated by the maximum likelihood method khedun et al 2014 stagge et al 2015 svensson et al 2017 mahmoudi et al 2019 afterwards the correlation coefficient is obtained by the standard formula of the pearson s correlation kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 therefore the gamma gaussian model is fitted in the first three steps upper part of fig 1 the next three steps utilize the fitted model to calibrate raw forecasts the fourth step is to normalize a new raw forecast by making use of the nqt in the first step the fifth step is to derive the conditional distribution of the normalized observation on the new normalized forecast from the bivariate gaussian distribution kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 7 o n ρ f 1 ρ 2 where o follows a normal distribution with mean and variance respectively given by μ o ρ f and σ o 2 1 ρ 2 schaake et al 2007 schaake and wood 2008 when raw forecasts are uninformative ρ is close to 0 and thus the conditional distribution of o turns to be like the standard normal distribution as raw forecasts become informative ρ increases and leads to the reduction of predictive uncertainty owing to the decrease of σ o 2 1 ρ 2 the sixth step is to back transform random samples drawn from the condition distribution in eq 7 by the inverse nqt kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 8 f cdf o 1 cdf normal o where o denotes samples the number is 1000 in this paper from o cdf normal denotes the cdf of the standard normal distribution and cdf o 1 denotes the inverse cdf of the fitted gamma distribution for observations therefore through steps 4 to 6 calibrated forecasts are generated from a raw forecast 2 3 alternative marginal distributions in nqt the marginal distribution plays a critical part in the above formulations of qm and gamma gaussian models the classic meta gaussian model proposed by kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 uses the nqt to handle the marginal distributions of hydrological variables that is hydrological variables are normalized by using the cdfs of different distributions and then modeled by the bivariate gaussian distribution kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 for monthly and seasonal precipitation there are a range of candidate marginal distributions including gamma yazdandoost et al 2020 lno angelidis et al 2012 gev raziei 2021 glo stagge et al 2015 p3 guttman 1999 and kap hosking and wallis 2005 distributions the alternative distributions can have two three or four parameters and their cdfs are listed in table 1 notably two parameter distributions the gamma and lno distributions have a lower bound at zero as precipitation does there are three three parameter distributions i e gev glo and p3 and there is one four parameter distribution i e kap the more flexible three and four parameter distributions generally do not have a lower bound at zero svensson et al 2017 these six statistical distributions are all used in nqt for the normalization of forecasts and observations of monthly and seasonal precipitation generally statistical distribution tends to be more flexible when it has more parameters the alternative distributions exhibit different characteristics rather than empirically choosing a best one they are tested to investigate their applicability for forecast calibration the gamma gaussian model and the tests of alternative distributions are implemented in python with the scripts presented in the supplementary material 3 experiments of forecast calibration 3 1 forecast and observation datasets numerical experiments calibrating monthly and seasonal cfsv2 precipitation forecasts are devised in this paper to test the effectiveness of the proposed gamma gaussian model in comparison with qm the cfsv2 forecasts saha et al 2014 are obtained from the data library of international research institute iri at the columbia university https iridl ldeo columbia edu sources models nmme ncep cfsv2 hindcast cfsv2 is the current operational gcm at ncep and it is developed based on cfsv1 by new modules of sea ice and land surface and improved atmosphere ocean land data assimilation systems jiang et al 2013 saha et al 2014 halder and dirmeyer 2017 the cfsv2 hindcasts are from 1982 to 2010 they are initialized by month and provide ensemble forecasts for the next 10 months with 24 ensemble members the spatial resolution of cfsv2 hindcasts has been regridded to 1 by 1 in the nmme project kirtman et al 2014 the climate prediction center cpc merged analysis of precipitation cmap is used as the observation corresponding to the forecasts xie and arkin 1997 zhao et al 2018 this dataset is also downloaded from the iri data library https iridl ldeo columbia edu sources models nmme cpc cmap similar to cfsv2 forecasts the cpc cmap precipitation dataset has also been regridded to the spatial resolution of 1 by 1 in this way observed monthly precipitation obtained from the cpc cmap has the same spatial resolution as cfsv2 hindcasts in the nmme project and is directly used to evaluate the performance of the hindcasts 3 2 experimental design this paper focuses on the forecasts of precipitation in jja which is generally summer winter in the northern southern hemisphere strazzo et al 2019 wang et al 2019a cfsv2 forecasts of monthly precipitation in june july and august and of seasonal precipitation in june july august jja are calibrated there are generally three steps firstly hindcasts and observations of precipitation for the four target periods june july august and jja are extracted from the cfsv2 and cpc cmap datasets respectively secondly qm and gamma gaussian models are applied to calibrate raw cfsv2 forecasts under leave one year out cross validation thirdly different marginal distributions are applied in nqt and then they are used for forecast calibration to examine their applicability the analysis focuses on the forecasts initialized in june specifically the monthly forecasts are generated at the same initialization time i e the beginning of june as a result the forecasts for june july and august are respectively at 0 month 1 month and 2 month lead time the seasonal forecasts for jja are obtained by adding up the monthly forecasts at the three lead times which follows previous studies slater et al 2016 slater et al 2017 strazzo et al 2019 zhao et al 2020a zhao et al 2020b similarly monthly precipitation observations for june july and august are aligned with monthly forecasts and they are also added up to form observed precipitation in jja there are in total 16 643 land grid cells in the forecast and observation datasets for the four target periods grid cells without zero precipitation values are retrieved for forecast calibration and grid cells with zero precipitation values are not considered the calibration is conducted independently for each target period and each grid cell under investigation all 24 ensemble members of raw forecasts are used to fit the cdfs in qm while the mean values of ensemble members are used to train the gamma gaussian model zhao et al 2017 lucatero et al 2018 forecast calibration is performed under the framework of leave one year out cross validation zhao et al 2017 strazzo et al 2019 when calibrating raw forecasts for the given target period in one year the pair of samples raw forecasts and observations for that year is excluded from the training samples in other words the qm and gamma gaussian models are developed using the remaining 28 pairs of samples and then used to generate calibrated forecasts for the given target period in the excluded year for each year the qm and gamma gaussian models are trained independently and then used for calibration raw forecasts for the target period in the 29 years are one by one calibrated i e cross validation and the cross validated forecasts are pooled in the verification in this way the testing sample is not implied by the training samples so that the performances of qm and gamma gaussian models are not artificially inflated to conduct a comparative analysis of marginal distributions six statistical distributions i e the gamma lno gev glo p3 and kap distributions are all incorporated into nqt specifically they are used to fit the marginal distributions of precipitation forecasts and observations and then to transform forecasts observations into standard normal variables therefore calibration models are constructed from forecasts and observations normalized by different marginal distributions the inter comparison facilitates a test of the performances of different statistical distributions in forecast calibration 3 3 forecast verification forecasts are verified in terms of bias reliability and skill murphy 1993 climatological means of ensemble forecasts m f and observations m o are calculated as 9 m f 1 n i 1 n f i m o 1 n i 1 n o i where n is the number of years under investigation here is 29 f i represents the ensemble mean of forecasts for the i th year and o i represents the observed value corresponding to f i climatological means of observations m o are plotted against those of ensemble forecasts m f in the scatterplots to illustrate the bias zhao et al 2017 when the scatter point is along the 1 1 line the corresponding climatologic mean of ensemble forecasts and observations are similar indicating that ensemble forecasts are unbiased forecast reliability describes whether the ensemble spreads of forecasts accurately represent the predictive uncertainty it is assessed by probability integral transform pit 10 pi t i cdf i o i where cdf i denotes the empirical cdf ecdf of ensemble forecasts for the i th year and pi t i represents the cumulative probability of observation o i in the cdf i if ensemble forecasts reliably capture the distribution of observations o i can statistically be regarded as random samples drawn from ensemble forecasts in this case the pit values for all observations should collectively be uniformly distributed therefore the alpha index α index is calculated using the sorted pit values renard et al 2010 bourgin et al 2014 crochemore et al 2016 bennett et al 2017 xiong et al 2019 11 α 1 2 n i 1 n pi t i i n 1 where pi t i denotes the sorted pi t i from small to large the α index represents the total deviation of pi t i from the corresponding uniform distribution when ensemble forecasts are perfectly reliable the value of α index is equal to 1 a lower value of α index indicates less reliable forecasts and the reliability is the worst when the value of α index is 0 the α index summarizes the information of pit and enables direct comparison of reliability between different target periods and grid cells bennett et al 2017 the continuous ranked probability score crps is used to evaluate the overall accuracy of ensemble forecasts pappenberger et al 2015 12 crps 1 n i 1 n cdf i x h x o i 2 d x where cdf i x denotes the cdf of ensemble forecasts for the i th year and h x o i denotes the heaviside function that represents the cdf of observation o i that is the value of h x o i is 0 when x o i and 1 when x o i huang et al 2020 the crps is calculated through numerical integration and it measures the probability weighted average of error of ensemble members of forecasts hersbach 2000 the crps is zero when cdf i x perfectly matches h x o i and its value increases as the difference between cdfs of forecasts and observations widens forecast skill indicates the performances of raw and calibrated forecasts relative to reference forecasts based on the crps forecast skill is assessed through the crps skill score crpss 13 crpss calibrated crps reference crps calibrated crps reference 100 crpss raw crps reference crps raw crps reference 100 in which crps calibrated represents the crps of calibrated forecasts obtained by qm or gamma gaussian models crps raw represents the crps of raw forecasts and crps reference represents the crps of reference forecasts which are generated by using the gamma distribution under the leave one year out cross validation a positive crpss indicates that the corresponding ensemble forecasts outperform reference forecasts and vice versa in the meantime calibrated forecasts are also verified to investigate whether they can be at least as skillful as climatology forecasts when raw forecasts are uninformative a property termed coherence krzysztofowicz 1999 4 results 4 1 performance of raw forecasts the correlation coefficient which plays a critical role in the gamma gaussian model has been extensively used to characterize the performance of raw gcm forecasts kirtman et al 2014 khajehei et al 2017 slater et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 zhao et al 2020a the correlation coefficients between raw cfsv2 forecasts and observations are presented by spatial plotting in fig 2 raw forecasts for june july august and jja which are all initialized in june are shown in separate subplots red color denotes positive correlation coefficient while blue color negative correlation coefficient overall the correlation exhibits considerable spatial and temporal variations positive correlation is observed for a substantial amount of grid cells in the western united states south america southeast asia and western and eastern australia where precipitation tends to be influenced by el niño southern oscillation zhao et al 2020a the correlation tends to be higher for forecasts for june with a lead time of 0 months than forecasts with a longer lead time which implies that raw forecasts at a shorter lead time tend to be more informative roy et al 2020 4 2 forecast bias reliability and skill for monthly precipitation in june july and august and total precipitation in jja the climatologic means of observations y axis are plotted against the climatologic means of ensemble forecasts x axis in fig 3 for raw forecasts there are a large number of points above or below the 1 1 line for the four target periods the implication is that raw forecasts are generally biased for qm calibrated forecasts points are mostly along the 1 1 line indicating that there is little difference between the climatologic mean values of qm calibrated forecasts and the corresponding observations for most grid cells this result highlights the effectiveness of qm in correcting biases of raw forecasts rajczak et al 2016 liu et al 2017 monhart et al 2018 for the gamma gaussian model climatologic means of calibrated forecasts are also virtually indistinguishable from those of corresponding observations for most grid cells that is the gamma gaussian model is also effective in removing biases in the raw forecasts and generating unbiased ensemble forecasts boxplots of the α index of raw and calibrated forecasts are shown by subplots in fig 4 the boxes illustrate the interquartile range iqr between 25th q1 and 75th q3 percentile the upper and low whiskers extend to the largest and smallest datum falling within q1 1 5iqr q3 1 5iqr and the outliers beyond whiskers are marked by blue points for the four target periods the values of α index of raw forecasts range from 0 to 1 and the median and mean values are smaller than 0 6 indicating that raw forecasts are unreliable for a large number of grid cells compared with raw forecasts qm calibrated forecasts have relatively higher α index because the biases have been effectively corrected the α index is further improved after the use of the gamma gaussian model with the values being higher than 0 8 for most of the grid cells in addition the α index of the gamma gaussian calibrated forecasts is plotted against that of the qm calibrated forecasts in fig s1 of the supplementary material it is observed that scatter points tend to distribute above the 1 1 line the indications are that the gamma gaussian model generally generates more reliable ensemble forecasts and that the reliability of qm calibrated forecasts can be unsatisfactory in some cases the crpss of calibrated forecasts obtained by qm red and gamma gaussian blue models are plotted against the correlation coefficients between raw ensemble means and observations in fig 5 while raw forecasts are far less skillful than climatology forecasts due to biases and unreliable ensemble spreads both qm and gamma gaussian models can improve forecast skill to some degree it is observed that both qm and gamma gaussian models can produce positively skillful forecasts when there is a strong positive correlation forecast skill tends to increase with correlation coefficient meanwhile when the correlation coefficient is low or negative qm tends to adjust raw forecasts in the wrong direction leading to low forecast skill wood and schaake 2008 khajehei et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 by contrast calibrated forecasts by the gamma gaussian model generally have similar accuracy to climatology forecasts when the corresponding correlation coefficient is low indicating that the calibrated forecasts are coherent krzysztofowicz 1999 it is pointed out that some negative correlation coefficients can lead to positively skillful calibrated forecasts this result can be explained by eq 7 this equation illustrates that under negative correlation raw forecasts can be flipped due to the mean value μ o ρ f of the conditional distribution and forecast uncertainty is also adjusted by the variance term σ o 2 1 ρ 2 that depends on the absolute value but not the sign of correlation coefficient strazzo et al 2019 in this case the gamma gaussian model can derive some skill by making use of negative correlation coefficients nevertheless the skill is noted to be cautious because raw forecasts are generally wrong in that they are significantly but negatively correlated with observations strazzo et al 2019 zhao et al 2020a 4 3 performances of alternative marginal distributions six alternative distributions are used to fit marginal distributions of forecasts and observations of precipitation when using nqt for the normalization seasonal observed precipitation in jja for four selected grid cells are taken as examples and their histograms and fitted pdfs are plotted in fig 6 different colors represent different marginal distributions including the gamma lno gev glo p3 and kap distributions it is observed that the two two parameter distributions i e gamma and lno are positively skewed with the lower bound at zero the gev glo and p3 distributions have three parameters and have no lower bound at zero their performances are generally similar to these of two parameter distributions when the precipitation data is positively skewed meanwhile they can become negatively skewed when the precipitation data have a slight or pronounced negative skewness as shown in fig 6d as the sole four parameter distribution under investigation the kap distribution is very flexible but it has sharp bounds at both lower and upper ends of the sample values svensson et al 2017 when the marginal distribution fitted by training samples cannot encompass all the training samples or a new raw forecast i e the corresponding cumulative probability is 0 or 1 the fitted marginal distribution is considered to be failed for june july august and jja the number of grid cells in which alternative marginal distributions succeed blue or fail grey is shown in fig 7 it is observed that there is no failed grid cell for the two parameter distributions indicating the robustness of the gamma and lno distributions three parameter distributions fail for some grid cells while the kap distribution fails for most grid cells it is mainly because raw forecasts are calibrated under cross validation when the calibration model is developed under cross validation the more flexible marginal distributions tend to overly fit sample specific noise and cannot encompass training samples or testing samples as the sole four parameter distribution under investigation the kap distribution is the most impacted by overfitting 4 4 forecast skill under six marginal distributions crpss of calibrated forecasts through cross validation are shown by boxplots in fig 8 the boxplots are for all the grid cells in which raw forecasts are successfully calibrated overall it is observed that calibration models with different distributions except kap can produce ensemble forecasts with positive skill in the meantime the gamma gaussian model tends to outperform the other models for the lno and gev distributions the models can produce ensemble forecasts with extremely negative skill and triangles are not observed for the gev due to low mean values it indicates that the coherence of the corresponding calibrated forecasts is relatively poor while models with the glo and p3 distributions can generate skillful forecasts when they are successfully applied the coherence of calibrated forecasts is slightly worse than the gamma distribution because there are more outliers below the lower whiskers than the gamma distribution for gamma lno and gev distributions precipitation observations for four grid cells are taken as examples to examine the reason for the extremely low skill observed in fig 8 as shown in fig 9 the ecdfs of the observed precipitation are shown by grey curves while the cdfs of the fitted gamma lno and gev distributions are shown by different colors monthly precipitation for the four selected grid cells is generally below 150 mm and exhibits a highly positive skewness the cdfs of the gamma distributions tend to approximate the ecdfs indicating that the gamma distributions reasonably fit the marginal distributions of precipitation observations by contrast the cdfs of the lno and gev distributions tend to deviate from the ecdfs in the meantime the cumulative probability is still smaller than 1 when precipitation exceeds 300 mm indicating that there are heavy tails for the fitted lno fig 9a and b and gev fig 9c and d distributions calibrated forecasts are generated through back transforming samples from the conditional distribution using the inverse nqt as described by eq 8 in section 2 2 the heavy tails can lead to extremely large values in calibrated forecasts and eventually diminish the forecast skill 5 discussion 5 1 extended analysis of forecasts initialized in may this paper has extended the experiments of forecast calibration to cfsv2 forecasts of jja precipitation initialized at the beginning of may compared to forecasts initialized at the beginning of june the lead time has been increased by one month specifically monthly forecasts for june july and august initialized at the beginning of may are respectively at the 1 month 2 month and 3 month lead time and seasonal forecasts are obtained by adding up the monthly forecasts similarly raw forecasts are calibrated under leave one year out cross validation and the results are shown in figs s2 to s7 in the supplementary material compared with forecasts initialized in june correlation coefficients for forecasts initialized in may fig s2 tend to be overall lower due to a longer lead time roy et al 2020 while both qm and gamma gaussian models are effective in removing biases in raw forecasts fig s3 the gamma gaussian model further improves the forecast reliability fig s4 as a result calibrated ensemble forecasts generated by the gamma gaussian model tend to be more skillful fig s5 the gamma gaussian model is built upon qm to calibrate monthly and seasonal precipitation forecasts from gcms compared with qm the gamma gaussian model has only one additional parameter which is the correlation coefficient in the bivariate gaussian distribution of normalized precipitation forecasts and observations kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 schaake et al 2007 for forecast calibration qm assumes a perfect correlation between raw forecasts and observations specifically qm directly maps the cdf of raw forecasts to the cdf of observations when there is a low or negative correlation qm can adjust raw forecasts in the wrong direction which leads to relatively unreliable spread and negative forecast skill maraun 2013 wong et al 2014 the correlation coefficient is considered in the gamma gaussian model to characterize the strength of association between forecasts and observations the results of calibrated forecasts highlight that the correlation coefficient contributes to the more promising predictive performance of the gamma gaussian model in comparison to qm schaake and wood 2008 zhao et al 2017 5 2 alternative marginal and joint distributions six alternative distributions svensson et al 2017 are used in the nqt to test which distribution is suitable in calibrating monthly and seasonal gcm precipitation forecasts the results of figs 6 to 9 and s6 to s7 generally suggest that the gamma distribution outperforms the other distributions compared with the gamma distribution the p3 distribution tends to produce less skillful ensemble forecasts and even fail for some gird cells the kap distribution is quite flexible but it results in a model with nine parameters in total which performs poorly for a large number of grid cells due to overfitting michaelsen 1987 generally in the numerical experiments statistical distributions with more parameters are observed to tend to overly fit sample specific noise and get penalized under cross validation michaelsen 1987 therefore this paper proposes the use of the gamma distribution due to its robustness and effectiveness stagge et al 2015 liu et al 2018 yazdandoost et al 2020 the bivariate gaussian distribution has been a popular method to characterize the dependency relationship between two variables due to its simplicity and effectiveness schaake et al 2007 wang et al 2009 yang et al 2021 it is noted that the copula sklar 1959 joe 1997 nelsen 2007 provides a more general approach to model the dependency relationship between hydrological variables and that the copula has been widely used in drought assessment and statistical downscaling ben alaya et al 2015 hao et al 2016 sharifi et al 2019 there are various copula families including archimedean extreme value and elliptical khedun et al 2014 among them the gaussian copula in the elliptical family is one of the most popular copulas khedun et al 2014 valle and kaplan 2019 it applies a correlation matrix to model the dependence structure of the multivariate gaussian distribution when it comes to two variables the gaussian copula can be simplified as the bivariate gaussian distribution that is used in this paper bárdossy 2006 renard and lang 2007 in the future other copula models can be used to characterize the relationship between raw forecasts and observations and the applicability of different copula models in precipitation forecast calibration can be further investigated khajehei and moradkhani 2017 5 3 relationship with existing models the gamma gaussian model that is derived by adding the correlation coefficient to qm can generally be regarded as a case of the classic meta gaussian model kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 for statistical hydrological modeling the meta gaussian model exhibits two desirable properties that are the flexibility in selecting marginal distributions and the capability to explicitly characterize the association between hydrological variables kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 the meta gaussian model has been extensively used for drought modeling and prediction feng et al 2019 feng et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 given the critical part of the marginal distribution in the meta gaussian model a comprehensive comparison of marginal distributions is conducted in this paper to facilitate the use of the meta gaussian model in calibrating monthly and seasonal precipitation forecasts from gcms six statistical distributions are tested and the results show that the gamma distribution tends to outperform the other distributions therefore the five parameter gamma gaussian model is proposed to calibrate precipitation forecasts besides the gamma gaussian model there are other calibration models such as the bayesian joint probability bjp model wang et al 2009 the censored shifted gamma distribution csgd model scheuerer and hamill 2015 the rainfall post processing rpp model robertson et al 2013 and the seasonally coherent calibration scc model wang et al 2019b compared to the gamma gaussian model these models generally have more parameters and their parameters are estimated by more sophisticated algorithms for example bjp has in total nine parameters that are estimated through bayesian inference wang et al 2009 the csgd model constructs a nonhomogeneous regression model with eight regression coefficients to link three parameters of marginal distribution to four statistics of ensemble forecasts calibrated by qm and the model parameters are estimated by implementing the linearly constrained optimization algorithm scheuerer and hamill 2015 furthermore rpp and scc models are developed to calibrate raw forecasts from numerical weather prediction nwp models robertson et al 2013 wang et al 2019b these models can readily be applied to calibrate raw forecasts and to generate reliable and skillful calibrated forecasts 6 conclusions this paper has built upon qm a gamma gaussian model by applying nqt to normalize precipitation forecasts and observations and constructing a bivariate gaussian distribution to characterize the dependency relationship between the normalized forecasts and observations a case study is devised to calibrate monthly and seasonal precipitation forecasts from the ncep cfsv2 using both qm and gamma gaussian models with six alternative marginal distributions implemented in nqt to compare the applicability and robustness the precipitation forecasts for june july august and jja are calibrated under the framework of leave one year out cross validation the results show raw forecasts are reasonably correlated with observations for a considerable number of grid cells around the globe but raw forecasts are generally biased both qm and gamma gaussian models are highly effective in correcting biases in raw forecasts compared with qm the gamma gaussian model can furthermore generate reliable and coherent forecasts overall the gamma gaussian model can serve as an effective tool to calibrate monthly and seasonal gcm precipitation forecasts for hydrological modeling and

4156,the fragile ecosystem of the desiccated amu darya river basin adrb has experienced profound local hydrological havoc these changes are associated with temperature evapotranspiration precipitation and human induced effects however previous long term analyses have inadequately addressed these problems at the basin scale therefore this study applied the elasticity coefficient method coupled with the water balance and budyko framework using hydro meteorological observation data from three stations termez atamurat and kiziljar to assess the long term 1960 2017 runoff dynamics within the adrb the findings revealed that runoff at the three stations decreased at rates of 0 52 mm a 0 80 mm a and 0 97 mm a respectively during the study period additionally the relative contribution of climate change to runoff reduction ranged from 14 25 to 5 43 while that of human activities exceeded 100 at all three stations in addition the total population across the basin has doubled within 33 years to approximately 80 million people coupled with an expansion of cropland areas at a rate of 42 6 corresponding to a net increase of 2 520 249 ha furthermore the construction of reservoirs that were implemented before cropland expansion activities reduced the amount of water flowing downstream since runoff needs to be stored before being released for irrigation this demonstrates that long term runoff reduction was mainly due to human activities with construction of reservoirs for cropland expansion being the most direct factor the study findings provide essential information for water resource management in the adrb more attention should be paid to the construction and operation of reservoirs and sustainable cropland development should be implemented for improved ecological environment keywords amu darya river basin runoff climate change cropland expansion reservoirs construction budyko framework 1 introduction water resources are essential to the environment and society however with the impacts of climate and land use changes dam reservoir construction and unsustainable human water consumption the water cycle has undergone rapid changes abbott et al 2019 some of the primary resulting manifestations are the spatio temporal changes in hydrometeorological elements piao et al 2010 su et al 2021 and the more frequent occurrence of extreme events duan et al 2016 trenberth et al 2015 these can cause severe alterations in local ecosystems such as vegetation degradation jiang et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 soil salinization jiang et al 2019 zavialov et al 2009 and soil erosion fang et al 2013 particularly in arid areas thus profound local hydrological problems must be addressed to improve water resource management the amu darya river adr is a critical water resource in central asia and one of the main rivers flowing into the aral sea with an average annual runoff of 78 5 km3 its riparian countries include tajikistan kyrgyzstan afghanistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan since 1960 the water budget of the aral sea has destabilized due to the unsustainable allocation of river runoff for irrigation purposes which has led to the gradual shrinkage of the aral sea kostianoy and kosarev 2010 moreover after the collapse of the soviet union in 1990 the adr in central asia became a transboundary river and consequently water resource management became a struggle between upstream power generation and downstream irrigation the water of the adr is primarily fed by meltwater and precipitation which are greatly affected by climate change as several studies have argued that the rise in temperature is an indisputable fact in central asia hu et al 2014 lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 yu et al 2020 particularly in winter lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 as a matter of fact glaciers have been declining in central asia and this trend has accelerated since the 1970s aizen et al 2006 narama et al 2010 which impacts runoff patterns in addition compared with high mountain stations climate warming observed at low mountain stations is more intense in central asia under future climate scenarios agal tseva et al 2011 therefore climate change may significantly increase the potential evapotranspiration and affect not only plant growth mechanisms but also intensify the water pressure furthermore under socio economic development the population of central asia is expected to rise to approximately 90 million from its current size of 72 million by the end of this century as reported by the united nations this population growth is expected to increase the municipal water consumption meanwhile dams reservoirs have affected the adr hydrological system for example the ongoing construction of the rogun dam whose storage capacity is approximately one sixth of the annual adr runoff will not only reduce the water volume by increasing water surface evaporation and unavoidable leakage but will also evoke water related disputes between upstream and downstream countries jalilov et al 2016 found that the potential operation mode of the dam is to meet the tajikistan hydropower needs subsequently reducing the agricultural income of downstream countries by 37 however if downstream irrigation is guaranteed it will bring greater agricultural benefits notwithstanding the inconsistency with the seasonal energy demand of tajikistan these issues introduce more significant challenges to the already fragile river ecosystem in the adrb several studies have been conducted in the adrb to address existing and expected ecological water related problems as the total discharge of the adr and syr darya river to the aral sea has already shrunk from 60 km3 a before 1950 to less than 10 km3 a jarsjö et al 2012 hagg et al 2013 depicted a slight reduction in the annual runoff across the rukhk catchment and wang et al 2016 reported a decrease of 15 in upstream runoff due to decreased precipitation but an increment in the runoff of 0 2 due to the increased temperature furthermore xu et al 2016 studied the vegetation dynamics in response to summer droughts in the area of interest and observed signs of vegetation degradation that were closely associated with water deficit as a consequence of the combined effects of increased potential evapotranspiration and decreased precipitation between 2000 and 2012 as previously mentioned climate and anthropogenic induced changes have induced the reduction of runoff in the adrb this is exemplified by the zarafshan river which no longer flows into the adr due to water extraction for irrigation groll et al 2013 consequently reducing the total size of the catchment from 131 000 km2 to 40 600 km2 as determined by olsson et al 2010 moreover some scholars have simulated future water related catastrophes in the study area finding that summer temperatures are projected to rise by 5 c by 2070 2099 and runoff is expected to decline by 10 to 20 of its current level white et al 2014 similarly kure et al 2013 predicted an increase in the annual mean river discharge until 2060 which is associated with an increase in air temperature however they found a decrease due to the subsequent disappearance of small glaciers within the pyanj and vakhsh rivers which are glacier dominated areas given that water has been always the source of life prosperity and wellbeing in central asia comprehensive and quantitative reports on the influence of climate change and anthropological factors on the entire adrb are rare in addition the summit of the heads of the international fund for saving the aral sea ifas founder states in 2018 called the countries to enhance regional cooperation in the field of water conservation and interstate water management and use however certain studies have only focused on a single portion of the basin while others investigated the entire basin within a short period which leave gaps to sufficiently address the aforementioned related water challenges therefore as it is necessary to improve our understanding of water use management we provide the first analysis of runoff dynamics of the entire basin over a long period to improve the understanding of the response of runoff to climate change and human activities several methods have been developed to distinguish between the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff including numerical models based on physical processes zeng et al 2020 however the parameters required for these hydrological models are scarce in central asia therefore this study applied the elasticity coefficient method coupled with the water balance and budyko framework budyko 1974 the latter simulates actual evapotranspiration which is determined according to the balance between the atmospheric water supply precipitation and evaporation capacity potential evapotranspiration and requires fewer parameters this approach has recently been proven effective in the quantitative analysis of water resources changes in central asia bissenbayeva et al 2019 xue et al 2017 and has been extensively documented ning et al 2016 tang and wang 2021 xu et al 2014 therefore the current study seeks to 1 analyze the hydrological and meteorological factors in the adrb 2 assess the spatio temporal variabilities in the elasticity coefficients of runoff to climatic and human activity factors and 3 quantify the contributions of these factors to the runoff variation during 1960 2017 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the adr one of the most important water suppliers in the aral sea originates from the tian shan and pamir alai mountains after the vakhsh and pyanj river confluences the runoff flows northwestward based on the terrain passing through the arid desert before discharging into the aral sea fig 1 it is also the largest river in central asia containing approximately two thirds of the water resources of the aral sea basin agal tseva et al 2011 as well 11 122 km2 is covered by glaciers in the upper region wang et al 2016 which along with precipitation and snow cover are critical adrb water sources furthermore with a typical continental climate the interannual distribution of runoff in the adrb is uneven 77 80 of annual runoff occurs in april through september while only 10 13 in december through february agal tseva et al 2011 in addition to residential areas and snow cover the adrb landscape is mainly covered by cropland grassland shrubland water bodies and barren land which occupies a large proportion jiang et al 2017 the hydrological infrastructures controlling water in the adrb includes reservoirs situated upstream in tajikistan and kyrgyzstan the soviet union constructed this crucial water infrastructure mainly for irrigation specially in uzbekistan and turkmenistan the hydropower produced upstream is however the secondary purpose with the development of agriculture large scale water diversion projects and reservoirs have been built in uzbekistan and turkmenistan such as the karakum canal and tuaymuyun reservoir the basin includes 60 constructed large reservoirs with a total useful volume of 22 629 5 mm3 oecd 2020 the overexploitation of the adr has led to a sharp decrease in the aral sea area causing a severe ecological crisis because the aral sea was divided into the big and small aral sea in 1986 stulina and eshchanov 2013 the adr can only supply water to the big aral sea additionally climate change economic development and population growth are driving changes regarding the quantity quality and form of water resources in the adrb 2 2 data due to a lack of long term meteorological observation data the precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration data from 1960 to 2017 for the basin were retrieved from the climate research unit cru ts v 4 04 dataset http www cru uea ac uk data which is a daily high resolution gridded dataset with 0 5 resolution this dataset is based on the penman monteith equation recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations to calculate potential evapotranspiration in addition the cru dataset is produced by interpolating observed data at numerous stations harris et al 2014 and recent studies have demonstrated that this dataset is suitable for hydrometeorological research in central asia deng and chen 2017 white et al 2014 furthermore data from cawater a portal of knowledge for water and environment issues in central asia http www cawater info net for kiziljar station located downstream and the atamurat kerki station in the midstream were obtained to assess runoff changes and attribution during 1960 2017 because data for termez station located upstream was not accessible as it is an officially accepted control post by uzbekistan and turkmenistan and does not provide open access this study retrieved data from the grun dataset https figshare com articles grun global runoff reconstruction 9228176 which is an observation based global gridded runoff dataset at a monthly time step with a spatial resolution of 0 5 from 1902 to 2014 ghiggi et al 2019 global runoff reconstruction grun provides datasets that outperforms a collection of 13 state of the art global hydrological model runoff simulations additionally the global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms normalized difference vegetation index version 3 ndvi3g datasets were retrieved from https glam1 gsfc nasa gov with a half month interval and spatial resolution of 1 12 these were atmospherically and terrain corrected for radio geometric accuracy pinzon and tucker 2014 then the vegetation coverage during the period of 1982 2015 was computed through the following equation 1 vc ndvi ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min where ndvi min and ndvi max are the minimum and maximum ndvi values of bare and completely covered land respectively in addition the land cover datasets of the adrb are based on global land surface satellite global land cover glass glc products with a spatial resolution of 5 km during the period of 1982 to 2015 available at http data ess tsinghua edu cn the land cover of glass glc is classified into seven categories including cropland forest grassland shrubland tundra barren land and snow ice the classification accuracy of these datasets was performed based on finer resolution observation and monitoring of global land cover product version 2 from glc v2 and fluxnet test samples which is a global network of micrometeorological flux measurement sites with overall accuracy of 86 51 and 82 1 respectively liu et al 2020 furtheremore the reservoir capacity dam data were obtained from the fao http www fao org faostat and cawater info and the total population data of the revevant riparian countries were obtained from the world bank https data worldbank org 2 3 method 2 3 1 trend analysis and change point test the current study applied the mann kendall mk test kendall 1948 mann 1945 which has been recommended by the world meteorological organization to analyze trends and abruptions of hydrometeorological factors over time hamed and rao 1998 moreover the double mass curve dmc method searcy et al 1960 was used to synthetically diagnose the change points to reduce omissions and errors from only using a single method the double mass curve is based on the fact that the cumulative value of one variable and the cumulative value of the other variable can be expressed as a straight line in right angled coordinates provided that the data are proportional in the same time period searcy et al 1960 thus the dmc of runoff and precipitation were used to study the slope change that is the point where the slope of the straight line deviates significantly corresponding to the year when the runoff begins to change gao et al 2011 the relationship between the cumulative runoff and precipitation in the base period can be expressed as follows 2 i 1 j q b i m i 1 j p b i n where m represents the responsiveness of the cumulative runoff to changes in cumulative precipitation n is the intercept and j is the length of the annual runoff time series when runoff is affected by human activities in change period the expression is as follows 3 i 1 j q c i m i 1 j p c i n furthermore based on the mk break test and dmc method different breaking points were detected at the stations in a time perspective and thereby different period were distinguished 2 3 2 attribution of runoff changes the contributions of climatic and human activity factors to runoff variations were quantitatively evaluated using the elasticity coefficient method coupled with the water balance and budyko framework this framework is an effective technique for evaluating the nexus and feedbacks on land water climate forcing and land surface characteristics it is known for its proficiency in describing the mean annual partitioning of precipitation into runoff and evaporation as a function of the ratio between the atmospheric water supply precipitation and water demand potential evaporation berghuijs and greve 2015 the catchment water balance is computed as follows 4 r p e t δ s where r is the runoff mm p is the precipitation mm et is the actual evapotranspiration mm and δ s is the change in the basin water storage mm at the catchment scale the value of actual evapotranspiration cannot be observed nonetheless it can be measured using the budyko framework which suggests that on longer time scales the actual evapotranspiration of the watershed is determined by the supply condition of the water and energy et p f et 0 p thus scholars have proposed a series of modified budyko models choudhury 1999 pike 1964 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 considering the actual situation of the study area the choudhury yang equation choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 was applied to the retrieved et 5 et p et 0 p n et 0 n 1 n where et 0 and n represent the potential evapotranspiration mm and model parameter for the underlying surface characteristics respectively watershed properties can be altered by human activities such as reservoirs land use changes irrigation and urban expansion wu et al 2017 tang and wang 2021 for instance urban expansion or the conversion of uncultivated areas to cultivated land alter the surface properties such as soil imperviousness and saturated hydraulic conductivity on the other hand reservoirs may change the topography while irrigation activities may change the soil water content and table consequently this research considered that changes in n are due to the influence of human activities the n is calculated using equations 4 and 5 when r p and et are known by combining equations 4 and 5 the water balance equation can be expressed as 6 r p p et 0 p n et 0 n 1 n and the variation in runoff caused by climate change and the watershed n can be expressed as follows 7 dr r et 0 d et 0 r p d p r n d n the elasticity coefficients of runoff to the selected variable x i can be determined using the following equation 8 ε x i r x i x i r where x i represents the et 0 p or n from eq 6 we obtain 9 r et 0 et 0 n p p et 0 n p n p n et 0 n 1 n 1 10 r p p n et 0 n 1 n 1 et 0 n 1 p n et 0 n 1 n 1 11 r n p e t 0 p n e t 0 n 1 n ln p n e t 0 n n 2 p n ln p e t 0 l n e t 0 n p n e t 0 n 12 e t 0 r e t 0 p n e t 0 n 1 n p p n e t 0 n 1 n p e t 0 13 p r p n et 0 n 1 n p n et 0 n 1 n et 0 14 n r n p n et 0 n 1 n p p n et 0 n 1 n p e t 0 substituting eqs 9 10 11 12 13 14 to eq 8 and assuming that φ et 0 p the elasticities of runoff can be written as follows xu et al 2014 15 ε et 0 r et 0 et 0 r 1 1 φ n 1 1 φ n 1 n 16 ε p r p p r 1 φ n 1 n 1 φ n 1 1 φ n 1 φ n 1 n φ 17 ε n r n n r ln 1 φ n φ n ln 1 φ n n 1 φ n 1 φ n 1 n 1 therefore the contribution of each influencing factor to runoff is given as 18 d r x i ε x i r x i d x i 19 c x i d r x i dr 100 where d x i represents the change in et 0 p or n the methodological framework used in this study for quantifying climatic and anthropogenic contributions to streamflow changes is shown in fig 2 which includes the above datasets and methods 3 results 3 1 the variation of hydro meteorological factors the spatio temporal variations in meteorological factors such as temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were determined for the adrb the temperature increased over time as shown in fig 3 a where the highest and lowest average recorded temperatures of 13 26 and 9 87 occured in 2016 and 1972 respectively the peak temperature observed is in accordance with independent analyses by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration who reported that the global temperature in 2016 was the warmest on record since 1880 particularly in arid areas this increased temperature trend is largely driven by increased carbon dioxide and other anthropogenic emissions being released into the atmosphere the temperature of the entire basin fluctuated significantly fig 3b with a smaller increment in the upstream runoff producing area compared to that of downstream in uzbekistan and turkmenistan where there was a higher increase partly occurring in the aral sea and with a maximum increase rate of 0 35 10 a 1 in the past 58 year study period the temperature exhibited an upward trend of 0 30 10 a 1 which is much higher than the global warming rate of 0 175 10 a 1 indicating that glacier and snow melting is changing the composition of runoff in the adrb in addition potential evapotranspiration similar to the temperature variation was observed to be high in the northern part of the adrb where the aral sea is located fig 3d the potential evapotranspiration varied from 1253 02 mm in 1960 to 1343 13 mm in 2017 at a rate of 11 30 mm 10 a 1 fig 3c more recently the precipitation exhibited a positive trend of 2 90 mm 10 a 1 from 1960 to 2017 fig 3e regional precipitation shifts were inconsistent except for the southwest of the basin where it demonstrated a downward trend at a change rate of 10 16 mm 10 a 1 fig 3f overall the results revealed that the basin climate has changed in the past 58 years which may affect the hydrological system of the adrb fig 4 presents the spatio temporal trend of annual runoff at three stations termez attamurat and kiziljar demonstrating that runoff decreased at all stations during the study period as summarized in table 1 at both kiziljar and atamurat stations the measured runoff magnitude sharply declined by 0 97 mm a and 0 80 mm a respectively compared to that from termez station which declined at a rate of 0 52 mm a table 1 these results are consistent with those of the soil and water assessment tool simulation of the upper basin including its main tributaries pyanj vakhsh kafirnigan surkhandarya and kunduz wang et al 2016 furthermore the runoff at the kelif station located at the boundary between the upper and middle reaches of the adrb also exhibited a downward trend fig 5 a and the correlation between the observed and grun results was r 0 7 p 0 01 fig 5b which was considered feasible for analysing the runoff variation at termez using the grun dataset the declining rate of the runoff magnitude grew spatially from upstream to downstream as previously mentioned the mk test and dmc were applied to diagnose the runoff change point table 1 and fig 4 the mk test table 1 showed that the change point at the atamurat and kiziljar stations occurred in the mid 1970s while that at the termez station occurred in the mid 1990s moreover the dmc detected a second change point at the end of the 1990s at atamurat fig 4e and kiziljar fig 4f an abruption point was only detected in 2000 at termez fig 4d although the difference in the mk test 1994 and dmc 2000 findings at termez changes in the hydrometeorological elements occur within a period rather than at a certain point in time which is a common phenomenon by combining the runoff changes of the two stations kiziljar and atamurat with the time series of termez we selected 2000 as the change point the change points in the annual runoff at termez atamurat and kiziljar were 2000 1974 and 1999 and 1974 and 1997 respectively therefore three phases were defined the base period first human impact and second human impact phases hence 1960 2000 and 2001 2014 were regarded as the base period and human impact phase at the termez station respectively additionally 1960 1974 1975 1999 and 2000 2017 were considered the base period first human impact and second human impact phases at the atamurat station respectively finally 1960 1974 1975 1997 and 1998 2017 were designated as the base period first human impact and second human impact phases respectively at the kiziljar station 3 2 the elasticity of runoff to climatic and human activity factor table 2 demonstrates the characteristics of hydrometeorological elements and the elasticity coefficients of runoff to potential evapotranspiration precipitation and underlying surface characteristics n in each period the human impact phases exhibited lower runoff change statistics but higher in precipitation potential evapotranspiration and n statistics at all three stations than those of the base period which may imply the warming and wetting in central asia overall runoff was positively correlated with p but negatively correlated with both et 0 and n according to the value of elasticity coefficients at each stage the elasticity coefficients ranged from 2 32 to 0 35 for et 0 from 1 35 to 3 32 for p and from 3 63 to 0 92 for n these results implied that a single unit increase in et 0 p and n resulted in an adrb runoff decrease of 0 35 mm to 2 32 mm increase of 1 35 mm to 3 35 mm and a decline of 0 92 mm to 3 63 mm respectively additionally the elasticity coefficient of each factor in the basin exhibited spatio temporal changes as displayed in fig 6 the absolute values of the elasticity coefficients exhibited temporal increasing trends at all three stations as previously established the change stage of the elasticity coefficient was consistent with the runoff at the corresponding station furthermore fig 7 shows that the elasticity coefficients were more widely dispersed during the human impact phases compared with that during the base period especially the n dispersion which varied across all three stations this implies that the sensitivity of runoff to both climate change and human activities increased according to both absolute values and dispersions of the elasticity coefficients the findings revealed that the downstream runoff was more sensitive to climatic and human activity factors than upstream runoff 3 3 attribution of climate change and human activity impacts on runoff the statistics displayed in table 3 were considered feasible and effective according to the study method as the computed value d r of the runoff changes was roughly consistent with the observed value dr and they were therefore used to evaluate the contribution of each factor to runoff changes in the basin table 3 displays the runoff changes from the base period to human impact phases at all three stations whereby precipitation was primarily seen to positively contribute to runoff runoff increment in contrast the potential evapotranspiration and n parameter exhibited a negative runoff change runoff reduction at the termez station the proportion of runoff change to the base period was 10 46 from which climate change et 0 p and human activities accounted for 14 23 and 114 24 respectively to the runoff reduction at the atamurat station the results demonstrated that climate change relatively influenced runoff reduction at a percentage of 11 79 from the base period to the first human impact phase reaching up to 13 38 in the second human impact phase the corresponding relative contribution of human activities shifted from 111 79 to 113 38 finally a significant runoff change was observed at the kiziljar station over the 58 years this is explained by the fact that the annual average of runoff from the base period to the first human impact phase decreased by 70 63 and then reached 85 50 in the second human impact phase the relative influence of climate change on runoff reduction was also negative but small approximately 0 1 while the relative contribution of human activity was large up to 100 1 in the first human impact phase climatic and human activity factors relatively influenced runoff changes by 5 43 and 105 42 respectively in the second human impact phase the downward trends of runoff at all three stations and the absolute value of the runoff reduction influenced by human activities dr n informed that the midstream and downstream were more significantly impacted than the upstream overall the results indicated that climate change exerted a negative influence on runoff reduction ranging from 14 25 to 5 43 while the relative contribution rate of human activities in each period to runoff exceeded 100 which suggested that human activities exhibited the most significant impact on runoff reduction in the study area 4 discussion 4 1 contributions of factors to runoff variation during 1960 2017 it is well known that both climate change and human activities can disrupt hydrological regimes duan et al 2020 the shortage of water resources is one of the most critical reasons for the ecological havoc of the aral sea the adr which is the largest river that flows into the aral sea has changed dramatically thus the attribution of runoff changes in the adrb is urgent however it has not yet been well established therefore this study evaluated the runoff dynamics at the termez atamurat and kiziljar stations within the adrb using the elasticity coefficient method coupled with the water balance and the budyko framework the results revealed that the runoff in the adrb decreased due to both climatic and human factors 4 1 1 climatic factor contributions water systems are expected to undergo tremendous alterations due to climate change especially in arid areas in addition to the hydrological significance of the adr scholars have reported temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration variations as evidence of changing climate across adrb which has influenced the runoff in the area hagg et al 2007 wang et al 2016 furthermore the area and number of glacial lakes in the adrb greatly fluctuated as a result of glacial meltwater caused by an increasing temperature zhang et al 2015 from a regional perspective deng and chen 2017 found the terrestrial water storage tws to be positively correlated with both temperature turkmenistan and uzbekistan and precipitation tajikistan and krygyzstan and they reported a decreasing trend in tws at a rate of 4 44 2 2 mm a during 2003 2013 similarly we found that the temperature increased at a rate of 0 30 10a 1 in the adrb the high temperatures exacerbated evapotranspiration reducing the amount of water reaching the river channel and peak discharge although the precipitation was inconsistent it increased overall from 1960 to 2017 which is beneficial for runoff these findings indicate that changes in factors other than precipitation led to the decline in runoff this includes potential evapotranspiration and multiple human activities that were demonstrated to be the dominant factor driving the decline in runoff in the adrb 4 1 2 human activity factors contributions the n parameter representing anthropogenic disturbances within the budyko framework revealed that human activities strongly influenced the change in runoff magnitude particularly in the vicinity of the middle and lower reaches of the adrb acknowledging the significant impact observed in the upstream region generally watersheds are more sensitive to external stressors and the impacts are more felt in arid semi arid landscapes where modifications in land use patterns can affect the land surface characteristics huang et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 to better understand human induced changes in the basin we assessed satellite images registering land cover land use changes fig 8 shows the spatio temporal changes possible transitions and net change among vegetations types between 1982 and 2015 the possible transitions were barren land to grassland 30 grassland to barren land 23 grassland and barren land to cropland 33 cropland to grassland 9 and cropland to barren land 5 from our findings cropland areas have expanded at a rate of 42 6 corresponding to a net increase of 2 520 249 ha the cropland expansion and transitions mainly appeared in the south region of uzbekistan considering the anthropogenic activities cropland expansion may affect the natural hydrological process and alter the spatio temporal distribution of water resources across the adrb since the expanded cropland irrigation areas consume much water and rise the evapotranspiration as well as surface imperviousness leading to a runoff reduction our findings agree with those of previous studies yang et al 2020 which reported irrigation and damming as the dominant factors influencing the long term variations in the aral sea which is ecologically connected to the adrb similarly chen et al 2018 realized that the irrigated area of the adrb increased by 253 8 104 ha between 1960 and 2010 which led to the increment in agricultural water consumption and was considered to be the reason for the runoff reduction generally the n parameter is associated with soil properties topography and vegetation coverage yang et al 2009 yang et al 2007 zhang et al 2001 however soil properties and topography are nearly constant in the short term therefore the vegetation coverage which is influenced by the aforementioned cropland expansion is considered to be the major factor controlling the n parameter he et al 2019 xu et al 2014 nevertheless for the adrb the famous construction of reservoirs dams transformed the original topography which subsequently impacted the runoff by changing the law of river continuity and destroying its connectivity it was also found that reservoir dam construction is the reason for the runoff abruption in the syr darya river basin which parallels that of our study zou et al 2019 similarly tang and wang 2021 stated that streamflow changes in the mekong river basin were primarily due to the construction of water infrastructures the calculated capacity of new reservoirs in the study area between 1960 and 2010 demonstrated that newly added reservoir capacities in the 1960s 1970s and 1980s were significant fig 9 this construction type is linked to the runoff reduction during the same period as previously discussed fig 4 additionally except for the reservoirs on the vakhsh river which are predominately used for power generation the reservoirs are used for agricultural irrigation to understand the effects of cropland irrigation and reservoirs construction on n parameter yang et al 2009 first assessed vegetation coverage based on ndvi and established their relationship similarly we assessed the vegetation coverage fig 10 and demonstrated their relationship to n parameter fig 11 the findings showed high vegetation coverage values to be primarily concentrated in the three irrigation areas of the adrb with the most apparent increase in the center of the irrigation areas expanding to the surrounding zones such findings are linked to the cropland expansion fig 8 that was spatially observed to increase at the same zones of high vegetation coverage thus considering the study period 1982 2015 the n parameter and vegetation coverage at the kiziljar station consistently increased while they appeared to be negatively correlated r 0 53 in contrast ning et al 2016 conducted the same approach on the jing river catchment in china and found n parameter to be weakly but positively correlated to vegetation coverage which might have been related to ongoing vegetation projects to understand the negative correlation observed in this study the inherent low precipitation of the adrb as an arid landscape and intense dependence on irrigation should be considered benjamin pohl et al 2017 reported in the outlook report rethinking water in central asia that the building of major dams and reservoirs in kyrgyzstan and tajikistan by the soviet union was to store water primarily for summer cropland irrigation purposes in uzbekistan kazakhstan and turkmenistan also our findings showed that the cropland expansion was also detected in 1982 2015 fig 8 after the newly added reservoir capacity in 1960s 1980s fig 9 as a consequence reservoirs construction activities that were implemented before cropland expansion activities reduced the amount of water flowing downstream as water running off needs to be stored before being released for irrigation in a such case the n parameter is negatively correlated with vegetation coverage although there is a positive influence of reservoirs on vegetation a hysteresis effect in the adrb may be expected all these revealed that reservoir construction across the study area had the most direct impact on the n parameter thus the reduction of runoff as an instance the construction of the manwan dam and xiaowan hydropower station in the mekong river basin initially perturbed the downstream vegetation which was then restored after few years yi et al 2019 in addition the dam type e g cascading hydropower or single dam li et al 2012 and dam height yi et al 2019 affected the vegetation furthermore many dams reservoirs affected each other in the study area thus the influence of dams reservoirs on vegetation can be further investigated in addition to the introduced argument on socio economic development the study further evaluated the population explosion that caused a range of biochemical and physical perturbations to hydrological systems li et al 2018 which started with the conversion of different land cover areas into agricultural and construction land according to our findings the total population across the basin has doubled increasing to approximately 80 million within 33 years fig 12 with the increase in cropland area fig 8 nonetheless the expansion of the urban surfaces impermeability is likely to affect the infiltration and result in a critical influence on surface runoff dynamics walsh et al 2005 moreover socio economic development including cropland expansion and population explosion caused an increase demand for water withdrawals for cropland irrigation and industries furthermore the extraction of water for human consumption and industry may alter the transfer path by deteriorating the water quality leading to river pollution all of which would complexly impact runoff because population was found to be positively correlated with the n parameter urban expansion and population growth might had decreased the runoff in central asia chen et al 2020 zou et al 2019 however in our study the n parameter was found to be more strongly correlated with vegetation coverage than with population growth thus considering the land surface characteristics the reservoir construction for cropland expansion is the most influential factor leading to the reduction in runoff with reservoirs being the most directly correlated factor 4 1 3 comparison of climate change and human activities impacts on runoff variations in watershed runoff are not only linked to precipitation but also to modifications in underlying land surface conditions caused by both climate and human activities this means that runoff variations respond differently depending on which of these two casual effects dominates as shown in table 3 the findings revealed climate change to exert a negative influence on runoff reduction ranging from 14 25 to 5 43 although climate change was mainly related to the geographical location of the area impacts cannot be neglected on the other hand the relative contribution rate of human activities in each period to runoff exceeded 100 which implies that human activities including reservoir construction cropland expansion and population growth contributed more to runoff reduction than climate change did in the study area this argument is supported by the fact that the adrb is an arid landscape receiving insufficient precipitation where crop growth heavily depends on irrigation as a consequence of the growing population and rapid development an agricultural expansion has been adopted to increase food security and production to ensure people thrive zabel et al 2019 the development of irrigation along with the construction of reservoirs inevitably impacted the runoff variations in the adrb given that the effect of climate change on runoff is small in the study area the focus should be on implementing effective measures that can limit the influence of multiple human activities and improve water resource management countries in the central asia have already responded to the shortage of water resources and executed the complex management of transboundary rivers although these countries endeavoured to formulate a single policy to resolve water related issues little effect has been observed subsequently organizations were established to manage the allocation of water resources such as the water users association and the informal water users groups regrettably these initiatives have resulted in various limitations including the lack of funds and technical support abdullaev et al 2010 the study findings are relevant to water management organization and policymakers as the insights into runoff changes and their multiple influencing factors across the adrb can be used to improve the management of water resources in the area more attention should also be paid to the construction and operation of reservoirs and cropland development for enhanced management and ecological sustainability 4 2 uncertainties the elasticity method coupled with the water balance and budyko framework produced informative findings on runoff changes in the adrb however to calculate the sensitivity of runoff to precipitation potential evapotranspiration and underlying surface characteristics we assumed that δ s was 0 this is a reasonable assumption considering a long term scale potter and zhang 2009 yang et al 2007 however for the short term its rationality should be carefully considered for example wang and alimohammadi 2012 reported that if the annual water balance changes in storage are negligible then the evaporation variability will be overestimated in the united states in addition using gravity recovery and climate experiment products deng and chen 2017 found that the water storage in the adrb changed by roughly 8 to 0 mm a between 2003 and 2013 therefore we assumed that the maximum change in δs is 8 mm a which means that the annual et is underestimated by 8 mm according to the following water balance equation p r e t δ s the underestimated et n and the elasticity coefficients of et 0 p n at the termez atamurat and kiziljar stations are presented in table 4 the results demonstrate that when the assumption of water storage change is 8 mm a the error of the elasticity coefficients is predominately within 10 which makes it feasible to calculate the elasticity coefficients of et 0 p and n by ignoring the changes in water storage ning et al 2016 in addition due to lack of adequate observational data the cru datasets were used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration and precipitation while its spatial resolution 0 5 that may not perfectly capture the real meteorological estimates could be a source of some uncertainties therefore for future studies this study calls upon the fusion of gridded and ground based observation data to provide adequate datasets resolution for future climatic studies across central asia 5 conclusions this study quantitatively assessed the runoff changes in the adrb using the elasticity coefficient method coupled with the water balance and budyko framework for three stations termez atamurat and kiziljar during 1960 2017 the findings from the current investigation provides some reference value for monitoring and managing water resources in the adrb since dramatic water related changes have been reported the findings revealed that runoff decreased at the termez atamurat and kiziljar stations at rates of 0 52 mm a 0 80 mm a and 0 97 mm a respectively with regards to climate and human factors considered as dual casual effects on runoff variations the relative contribution of climate change to runoff reduction ranged from 14 25 to 5 43 while that of human activities exceeded 100 at all three stations in addition to the doubling of the population size to 80 million within 33 years spatial evidence showed that cropland areas have expanded at a rate of 42 6 corresponding to a net increase of 2 520 249 ha furthermore reservoirs construction activities that were implemented before cropland expansion reduced the amount of water flowing downstream since water running off needs to be stored before being released for irrigation this demonstrated that runoff reduction was mainly due to human activities with construction of reservoirs for cropland expansion being the most direct factor therefore the results of this research provide the latest information that can be used to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the spatio temporal changes in runoff which is vital to support water resource management in

4156,the fragile ecosystem of the desiccated amu darya river basin adrb has experienced profound local hydrological havoc these changes are associated with temperature evapotranspiration precipitation and human induced effects however previous long term analyses have inadequately addressed these problems at the basin scale therefore this study applied the elasticity coefficient method coupled with the water balance and budyko framework using hydro meteorological observation data from three stations termez atamurat and kiziljar to assess the long term 1960 2017 runoff dynamics within the adrb the findings revealed that runoff at the three stations decreased at rates of 0 52 mm a 0 80 mm a and 0 97 mm a respectively during the study period additionally the relative contribution of climate change to runoff reduction ranged from 14 25 to 5 43 while that of human activities exceeded 100 at all three stations in addition the total population across the basin has doubled within 33 years to approximately 80 million people coupled with an expansion of cropland areas at a rate of 42 6 corresponding to a net increase of 2 520 249 ha furthermore the construction of reservoirs that were implemented before cropland expansion activities reduced the amount of water flowing downstream since runoff needs to be stored before being released for irrigation this demonstrates that long term runoff reduction was mainly due to human activities with construction of reservoirs for cropland expansion being the most direct factor the study findings provide essential information for water resource management in the adrb more attention should be paid to the construction and operation of reservoirs and sustainable cropland development should be implemented for improved ecological environment keywords amu darya river basin runoff climate change cropland expansion reservoirs construction budyko framework 1 introduction water resources are essential to the environment and society however with the impacts of climate and land use changes dam reservoir construction and unsustainable human water consumption the water cycle has undergone rapid changes abbott et al 2019 some of the primary resulting manifestations are the spatio temporal changes in hydrometeorological elements piao et al 2010 su et al 2021 and the more frequent occurrence of extreme events duan et al 2016 trenberth et al 2015 these can cause severe alterations in local ecosystems such as vegetation degradation jiang et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 soil salinization jiang et al 2019 zavialov et al 2009 and soil erosion fang et al 2013 particularly in arid areas thus profound local hydrological problems must be addressed to improve water resource management the amu darya river adr is a critical water resource in central asia and one of the main rivers flowing into the aral sea with an average annual runoff of 78 5 km3 its riparian countries include tajikistan kyrgyzstan afghanistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan since 1960 the water budget of the aral sea has destabilized due to the unsustainable allocation of river runoff for irrigation purposes which has led to the gradual shrinkage of the aral sea kostianoy and kosarev 2010 moreover after the collapse of the soviet union in 1990 the adr in central asia became a transboundary river and consequently water resource management became a struggle between upstream power generation and downstream irrigation the water of the adr is primarily fed by meltwater and precipitation which are greatly affected by climate change as several studies have argued that the rise in temperature is an indisputable fact in central asia hu et al 2014 lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 yu et al 2020 particularly in winter lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 as a matter of fact glaciers have been declining in central asia and this trend has accelerated since the 1970s aizen et al 2006 narama et al 2010 which impacts runoff patterns in addition compared with high mountain stations climate warming observed at low mountain stations is more intense in central asia under future climate scenarios agal tseva et al 2011 therefore climate change may significantly increase the potential evapotranspiration and affect not only plant growth mechanisms but also intensify the water pressure furthermore under socio economic development the population of central asia is expected to rise to approximately 90 million from its current size of 72 million by the end of this century as reported by the united nations this population growth is expected to increase the municipal water consumption meanwhile dams reservoirs have affected the adr hydrological system for example the ongoing construction of the rogun dam whose storage capacity is approximately one sixth of the annual adr runoff will not only reduce the water volume by increasing water surface evaporation and unavoidable leakage but will also evoke water related disputes between upstream and downstream countries jalilov et al 2016 found that the potential operation mode of the dam is to meet the tajikistan hydropower needs subsequently reducing the agricultural income of downstream countries by 37 however if downstream irrigation is guaranteed it will bring greater agricultural benefits notwithstanding the inconsistency with the seasonal energy demand of tajikistan these issues introduce more significant challenges to the already fragile river ecosystem in the adrb several studies have been conducted in the adrb to address existing and expected ecological water related problems as the total discharge of the adr and syr darya river to the aral sea has already shrunk from 60 km3 a before 1950 to less than 10 km3 a jarsjö et al 2012 hagg et al 2013 depicted a slight reduction in the annual runoff across the rukhk catchment and wang et al 2016 reported a decrease of 15 in upstream runoff due to decreased precipitation but an increment in the runoff of 0 2 due to the increased temperature furthermore xu et al 2016 studied the vegetation dynamics in response to summer droughts in the area of interest and observed signs of vegetation degradation that were closely associated with water deficit as a consequence of the combined effects of increased potential evapotranspiration and decreased precipitation between 2000 and 2012 as previously mentioned climate and anthropogenic induced changes have induced the reduction of runoff in the adrb this is exemplified by the zarafshan river which no longer flows into the adr due to water extraction for irrigation groll et al 2013 consequently reducing the total size of the catchment from 131 000 km2 to 40 600 km2 as determined by olsson et al 2010 moreover some scholars have simulated future water related catastrophes in the study area finding that summer temperatures are projected to rise by 5 c by 2070 2099 and runoff is expected to decline by 10 to 20 of its current level white et al 2014 similarly kure et al 2013 predicted an increase in the annual mean river discharge until 2060 which is associated with an increase in air temperature however they found a decrease due to the subsequent disappearance of small glaciers within the pyanj and vakhsh rivers which are glacier dominated areas given that water has been always the source of life prosperity and wellbeing in central asia comprehensive and quantitative reports on the influence of climate change and anthropological factors on the entire adrb are rare in addition the summit of the heads of the international fund for saving the aral sea ifas founder states in 2018 called the countries to enhance regional cooperation in the field of water conservation and interstate water management and use however certain studies have only focused on a single portion of the basin while others investigated the entire basin within a short period which leave gaps to sufficiently address the aforementioned related water challenges therefore as it is necessary to improve our understanding of water use management we provide the first analysis of runoff dynamics of the entire basin over a long period to improve the understanding of the response of runoff to climate change and human activities several methods have been developed to distinguish between the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff including numerical models based on physical processes zeng et al 2020 however the parameters required for these hydrological models are scarce in central asia therefore this study applied the elasticity coefficient method coupled with the water balance and budyko framework budyko 1974 the latter simulates actual evapotranspiration which is determined according to the balance between the atmospheric water supply precipitation and evaporation capacity potential evapotranspiration and requires fewer parameters this approach has recently been proven effective in the quantitative analysis of water resources changes in central asia bissenbayeva et al 2019 xue et al 2017 and has been extensively documented ning et al 2016 tang and wang 2021 xu et al 2014 therefore the current study seeks to 1 analyze the hydrological and meteorological factors in the adrb 2 assess the spatio temporal variabilities in the elasticity coefficients of runoff to climatic and human activity factors and 3 quantify the contributions of these factors to the runoff variation during 1960 2017 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the adr one of the most important water suppliers in the aral sea originates from the tian shan and pamir alai mountains after the vakhsh and pyanj river confluences the runoff flows northwestward based on the terrain passing through the arid desert before discharging into the aral sea fig 1 it is also the largest river in central asia containing approximately two thirds of the water resources of the aral sea basin agal tseva et al 2011 as well 11 122 km2 is covered by glaciers in the upper region wang et al 2016 which along with precipitation and snow cover are critical adrb water sources furthermore with a typical continental climate the interannual distribution of runoff in the adrb is uneven 77 80 of annual runoff occurs in april through september while only 10 13 in december through february agal tseva et al 2011 in addition to residential areas and snow cover the adrb landscape is mainly covered by cropland grassland shrubland water bodies and barren land which occupies a large proportion jiang et al 2017 the hydrological infrastructures controlling water in the adrb includes reservoirs situated upstream in tajikistan and kyrgyzstan the soviet union constructed this crucial water infrastructure mainly for irrigation specially in uzbekistan and turkmenistan the hydropower produced upstream is however the secondary purpose with the development of agriculture large scale water diversion projects and reservoirs have been built in uzbekistan and turkmenistan such as the karakum canal and tuaymuyun reservoir the basin includes 60 constructed large reservoirs with a total useful volume of 22 629 5 mm3 oecd 2020 the overexploitation of the adr has led to a sharp decrease in the aral sea area causing a severe ecological crisis because the aral sea was divided into the big and small aral sea in 1986 stulina and eshchanov 2013 the adr can only supply water to the big aral sea additionally climate change economic development and population growth are driving changes regarding the quantity quality and form of water resources in the adrb 2 2 data due to a lack of long term meteorological observation data the precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration data from 1960 to 2017 for the basin were retrieved from the climate research unit cru ts v 4 04 dataset http www cru uea ac uk data which is a daily high resolution gridded dataset with 0 5 resolution this dataset is based on the penman monteith equation recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations to calculate potential evapotranspiration in addition the cru dataset is produced by interpolating observed data at numerous stations harris et al 2014 and recent studies have demonstrated that this dataset is suitable for hydrometeorological research in central asia deng and chen 2017 white et al 2014 furthermore data from cawater a portal of knowledge for water and environment issues in central asia http www cawater info net for kiziljar station located downstream and the atamurat kerki station in the midstream were obtained to assess runoff changes and attribution during 1960 2017 because data for termez station located upstream was not accessible as it is an officially accepted control post by uzbekistan and turkmenistan and does not provide open access this study retrieved data from the grun dataset https figshare com articles grun global runoff reconstruction 9228176 which is an observation based global gridded runoff dataset at a monthly time step with a spatial resolution of 0 5 from 1902 to 2014 ghiggi et al 2019 global runoff reconstruction grun provides datasets that outperforms a collection of 13 state of the art global hydrological model runoff simulations additionally the global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms normalized difference vegetation index version 3 ndvi3g datasets were retrieved from https glam1 gsfc nasa gov with a half month interval and spatial resolution of 1 12 these were atmospherically and terrain corrected for radio geometric accuracy pinzon and tucker 2014 then the vegetation coverage during the period of 1982 2015 was computed through the following equation 1 vc ndvi ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min where ndvi min and ndvi max are the minimum and maximum ndvi values of bare and completely covered land respectively in addition the land cover datasets of the adrb are based on global land surface satellite global land cover glass glc products with a spatial resolution of 5 km during the period of 1982 to 2015 available at http data ess tsinghua edu cn the land cover of glass glc is classified into seven categories including cropland forest grassland shrubland tundra barren land and snow ice the classification accuracy of these datasets was performed based on finer resolution observation and monitoring of global land cover product version 2 from glc v2 and fluxnet test samples which is a global network of micrometeorological flux measurement sites with overall accuracy of 86 51 and 82 1 respectively liu et al 2020 furtheremore the reservoir capacity dam data were obtained from the fao http www fao org faostat and cawater info and the total population data of the revevant riparian countries were obtained from the world bank https data worldbank org 2 3 method 2 3 1 trend analysis and change point test the current study applied the mann kendall mk test kendall 1948 mann 1945 which has been recommended by the world meteorological organization to analyze trends and abruptions of hydrometeorological factors over time hamed and rao 1998 moreover the double mass curve dmc method searcy et al 1960 was used to synthetically diagnose the change points to reduce omissions and errors from only using a single method the double mass curve is based on the fact that the cumulative value of one variable and the cumulative value of the other variable can be expressed as a straight line in right angled coordinates provided that the data are proportional in the same time period searcy et al 1960 thus the dmc of runoff and precipitation were used to study the slope change that is the point where the slope of the straight line deviates significantly corresponding to the year when the runoff begins to change gao et al 2011 the relationship between the cumulative runoff and precipitation in the base period can be expressed as follows 2 i 1 j q b i m i 1 j p b i n where m represents the responsiveness of the cumulative runoff to changes in cumulative precipitation n is the intercept and j is the length of the annual runoff time series when runoff is affected by human activities in change period the expression is as follows 3 i 1 j q c i m i 1 j p c i n furthermore based on the mk break test and dmc method different breaking points were detected at the stations in a time perspective and thereby different period were distinguished 2 3 2 attribution of runoff changes the contributions of climatic and human activity factors to runoff variations were quantitatively evaluated using the elasticity coefficient method coupled with the water balance and budyko framework this framework is an effective technique for evaluating the nexus and feedbacks on land water climate forcing and land surface characteristics it is known for its proficiency in describing the mean annual partitioning of precipitation into runoff and evaporation as a function of the ratio between the atmospheric water supply precipitation and water demand potential evaporation berghuijs and greve 2015 the catchment water balance is computed as follows 4 r p e t δ s where r is the runoff mm p is the precipitation mm et is the actual evapotranspiration mm and δ s is the change in the basin water storage mm at the catchment scale the value of actual evapotranspiration cannot be observed nonetheless it can be measured using the budyko framework which suggests that on longer time scales the actual evapotranspiration of the watershed is determined by the supply condition of the water and energy et p f et 0 p thus scholars have proposed a series of modified budyko models choudhury 1999 pike 1964 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 considering the actual situation of the study area the choudhury yang equation choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 was applied to the retrieved et 5 et p et 0 p n et 0 n 1 n where et 0 and n represent the potential evapotranspiration mm and model parameter for the underlying surface characteristics respectively watershed properties can be altered by human activities such as reservoirs land use changes irrigation and urban expansion wu et al 2017 tang and wang 2021 for instance urban expansion or the conversion of uncultivated areas to cultivated land alter the surface properties such as soil imperviousness and saturated hydraulic conductivity on the other hand reservoirs may change the topography while irrigation activities may change the soil water content and table consequently this research considered that changes in n are due to the influence of human activities the n is calculated using equations 4 and 5 when r p and et are known by combining equations 4 and 5 the water balance equation can be expressed as 6 r p p et 0 p n et 0 n 1 n and the variation in runoff caused by climate change and the watershed n can be expressed as follows 7 dr r et 0 d et 0 r p d p r n d n the elasticity coefficients of runoff to the selected variable x i can be determined using the following equation 8 ε x i r x i x i r where x i represents the et 0 p or n from eq 6 we obtain 9 r et 0 et 0 n p p et 0 n p n p n et 0 n 1 n 1 10 r p p n et 0 n 1 n 1 et 0 n 1 p n et 0 n 1

given as 18 d r x i ε x i r x i d x i 19 c x i d r x i dr 100 where d x i represents the change in et 0 p or n the methodological framework used in this study for quantifying climatic and anthropogenic contributions to streamflow changes is shown in fig 2 which includes the above datasets and methods 3 results 3 1 the variation of hydro meteorological factors the spatio temporal variations in meteorological factors such as temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were determined for the adrb the temperature increased over time as shown in fig 3 a where the highest and lowest average recorded temperatures of 13 26 and 9 87 occured in 2016 and 1972 respectively the peak temperature observed is in accordance with independent analyses by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration who reported that the global temperature in 2016 was the warmest on record since 1880 particularly in arid areas this increased temperature trend is largely driven by increased carbon dioxide and other anthropogenic emissions being released into the atmosphere the temperature of the entire basin fluctuated significantly fig 3b with a smaller increment in the upstream runoff producing area compared to that of downstream in uzbekistan and turkmenistan where there was a higher increase partly occurring in the aral sea and with a maximum increase rate of 0 35 10 a 1 in the past 58 year study period the temperature exhibited an upward trend of 0 30 10 a 1 which is much higher than the global warming rate of 0 175 10 a 1 indicating that glacier and snow melting is changing the composition of runoff in the adrb in addition potential evapotranspiration similar to the temperature variation was observed to be high in the northern part of the adrb where the aral sea is located fig 3d the potential evapotranspiration varied from 1253 02 mm in 1960 to 1343 13 mm in 2017 at a rate of 11 30 mm 10 a 1 fig 3c more recently the precipitation exhibited a positive trend of 2 90 mm 10 a 1 from 1960 to 2017 fig 3e regional precipitation shifts were inconsistent except for the southwest of the basin where it demonstrated a downward trend at a change rate of 10 16 mm 10 a 1 fig 3f overall the results revealed that the basin climate has changed in the past 58 years which may affect the hydrological system of the adrb fig 4 presents the spatio temporal trend of annual runoff at three stations termez attamurat and kiziljar demonstrating that runoff decreased at all stations during the study period as summarized in table 1 at both kiziljar and atamurat stations the measured runoff magnitude sharply declined by 0 97 mm a and 0 80 mm a respectively compared to that from termez station which declined at a rate of 0 52 mm a table 1 these results are consistent with those of the soil and water assessment tool simulation of the upper basin including its main tributaries pyanj vakhsh kafirnigan surkhandarya and kunduz wang et al 2016 furthermore the runoff at the kelif station located at the boundary between the upper and middle reaches of the adrb also exhibited a downward trend fig 5 a and the correlation between the observed and grun results was r 0 7 p 0 01 fig 5b which was considered feasible for analysing the runoff variation at termez using the grun dataset the declining rate of the runoff magnitude grew spatially from upstream to downstream as previously mentioned the mk test and dmc were applied to diagnose the runoff change point table 1 and fig 4 the mk test table 1 showed that the change point at the atamurat and kiziljar stations occurred in the mid 1970s while that at the termez station occurred in the mid 1990s moreover the dmc detected a second change point at the end of the 1990s at atamurat fig 4e and kiziljar fig 4f an abruption point was only detected in 2000 at termez fig 4d although the difference in the mk test 1994 and dmc 2000 findings at termez changes in the hydrometeorological elements occur within a period rather than at a certain point in time which is a common phenomenon by combining the runoff changes of the two stations kiziljar and atamurat with the time series of termez we selected 2000 as the change point the change points in the annual runoff at termez atamurat and kiziljar were 2000 1974 and 1999 and 1974 and 1997 respectively therefore three phases were defined the base period first human impact and second human impact phases hence 1960 2000 and 2001 2014 were regarded as the base period and human impact phase at the termez station respectively additionally 1960 1974 1975 1999 and 2000 2017 were considered the base period first human impact and second human impact phases at the atamurat station respectively finally 1960 1974 1975 1997 and 1998 2017 were designated as the base period first human impact and second human impact phases respectively at the kiziljar station 3 2 the elasticity of runoff to climatic and human activity factor table 2 demonstrates the characteristics of hydrometeorological elements and the elasticity coefficients of runoff to potential evapotranspiration precipitation and underlying surface characteristics n in each period the human impact phases exhibited lower runoff change statistics but higher in precipitation potential evapotranspiration and n statistics at all three stations than those of the base period which may imply the warming and wetting in central asia overall runoff was positively correlated with p but negatively correlated with both et 0 and n according to the value of elasticity coefficients at each stage the elasticity coefficients ranged from 2 32 to 0 35 for et 0 from 1 35 to 3 32 for p and from 3 63 to 0 92 for n these results implied that a single unit increase in et 0 p and n resulted in an adrb runoff decrease of 0 35 mm to 2 32 mm increase of 1 35 mm to 3 35 mm and a decline of 0 92 mm to 3 63 mm respectively additionally the elasticity coefficient of each factor in the basin exhibited spatio temporal changes as displayed in fig 6 the absolute values of the elasticity coefficients exhibited temporal increasing trends at all three stations as previously established the change stage of the elasticity coefficient was consistent with the runoff at the corresponding station furthermore fig 7 shows that the elasticity coefficients were more widely dispersed during the human impact phases compared with that during the base period especially the n dispersion which varied across all three stations this implies that the sensitivity of runoff to both climate change and human activities increased according to both absolute values and dispersions of the elasticity coefficients the findings revealed that the downstream runoff was more sensitive to climatic and human activity factors than upstream runoff 3 3 attribution of climate change and human activity impacts on runoff the statistics displayed in table 3 were considered feasible and effective according to the study method as the computed value d r of the runoff changes was roughly consistent with the observed value dr and they were therefore used to evaluate the contribution of each factor to runoff changes in the basin table 3 displays the runoff changes from the base period to human impact phases at all three stations whereby precipitation was primarily seen to positively contribute to runoff runoff increment in contrast the potential evapotranspiration and n parameter exhibited a negative runoff change runoff reduction at the termez station the proportion of runoff change to the base period was 10 46 from which climate change et 0 p and human activities accounted for 14 23 and 114 24 respectively to the runoff reduction at the atamurat station the results demonstrated that climate change relatively influenced runoff reduction at a percentage of 11 79 from the base period to the first human impact phase reaching up to 13 38 in the second human impact phase the corresponding relative contribution of human activities shifted from 111 79 to 113 38 finally a significant runoff change was observed at the kiziljar station over the 58 years this is explained by the fact that the annual average of runoff from the base period to the first human impact phase decreased by 70 63 and then reached 85 50 in the second human impact phase the relative influence of climate change on runoff reduction was also negative but small approximately 0 1 while the relative contribution of human activity was large up to 100 1 in the first human impact phase climatic and human activity factors relatively influenced runoff changes by 5 43 and 105 42 respectively in the second human impact phase the downward trends of runoff at all three stations and the absolute value of the runoff reduction influenced by human activities dr n informed that the midstream and downstream were more significantly impacted than the upstream overall the results indicated that climate change exerted a negative influence on runoff reduction ranging from 14 25 to 5 43 while the relative contribution rate of human activities in each period to runoff exceeded 100 which suggested that human activities exhibited the most significant impact on runoff reduction in the study area 4 discussion 4 1 contributions of factors to runoff variation during 1960 2017 it is well known that both climate change and human activities can disrupt hydrological regimes duan et al 2020 the shortage of water resources is one of the most critical reasons for the ecological havoc of the aral sea the adr which is the largest river that flows into the aral sea has changed dramatically thus the attribution of runoff changes in the adrb is urgent however it has not yet been well established therefore this study evaluated the runoff dynamics at the termez atamurat and kiziljar stations within the adrb using the elasticity coefficient method coupled with the water balance and the budyko framework the results revealed that the runoff in the adrb decreased due to both climatic and human factors 4 1 1 climatic factor contributions water systems are expected to undergo tremendous alterations due to climate change especially in arid areas in addition to the hydrological significance of the adr scholars have reported temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration variations as evidence of changing climate across adrb which has influenced the runoff in the area hagg et al 2007 wang et al 2016 furthermore the area and number of glacial lakes in the adrb greatly fluctuated as a result of glacial meltwater caused by an increasing temperature zhang et al 2015 from a regional perspective deng and chen 2017 found the terrestrial water storage tws to be positively correlated with both temperature turkmenistan and uzbekistan and precipitation tajikistan and krygyzstan and they reported a decreasing trend in tws at a rate of 4 44 2 2 mm a during 2003 2013 similarly we found that the temperature increased at a rate of 0 30 10a 1 in the adrb the high temperatures exacerbated evapotranspiration reducing the amount of water reaching the river channel and peak discharge although the precipitation was inconsistent it increased overall from 1960 to 2017 which is beneficial for runoff these findings indicate that changes in factors other than precipitation led to the decline in runoff this includes potential evapotranspiration and multiple human activities that were demonstrated to be the dominant factor driving the decline in runoff in the adrb 4 1 2 human activity factors contributions the n parameter representing anthropogenic disturbances within the budyko framework revealed that human activities strongly influenced the change in runoff magnitude particularly in the vicinity of the middle and lower reaches of the adrb acknowledging the significant impact observed in the upstream region generally watersheds are more sensitive to external stressors and the impacts are more felt in arid semi arid landscapes where modifications in land use patterns can affect the land surface characteristics huang et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 to better understand human induced changes in the basin we assessed satellite images registering land cover land use changes fig 8 shows the spatio temporal changes possible transitions and net change among vegetations types between 1982 and 2015 the possible transitions were barren land to grassland 30 grassland to barren land 23 grassland and barren land to cropland 33 cropland to grassland 9 and cropland to barren land 5 from our findings cropland areas have expanded at a rate of 42 6 corresponding to a net increase of 2 520 249 ha the cropland expansion and transitions mainly appeared in the south region of uzbekistan considering the anthropogenic activities cropland expansion may affect the natural hydrological process and alter the spatio temporal distribution of water resources across the adrb since the expanded cropland irrigation areas consume much water and rise the evapotranspiration as well as surface imperviousness leading to a runoff reduction our findings agree with those of previous studies yang et al 2020 which reported irrigation and damming as the dominant factors influencing the long term variations in the aral sea which is ecologically connected to the adrb similarly chen et al 2018 realized that the irrigated area of the adrb increased by 253 8 104 ha between 1960 and 2010 which led to the increment in agricultural water consumption and was considered to be the reason for the runoff reduction generally the n parameter is associated with soil properties topography and vegetation coverage yang et al 2009 yang et al 2007 zhang et al 2001 however soil properties and topography are nearly constant in the short term therefore the vegetation coverage which is influenced by the aforementioned cropland expansion is considered to be the major factor controlling the n parameter he et al 2019 xu et al 2014 nevertheless for the adrb the famous construction of reservoirs dams transformed the original topography which subsequently impacted the runoff by changing the law of river continuity and destroying its connectivity it was also found that reservoir dam construction is the reason for the runoff abruption in the syr darya river basin which parallels that of our study zou et al 2019 similarly tang and wang 2021 stated that streamflow changes in the mekong river basin were primarily due to the construction of water infrastructures the calculated capacity of new reservoirs in the study area between 1960 and 2010 demonstrated that newly added reservoir capacities in the 1960s 1970s and 1980s were significant fig 9 this construction type is linked to the runoff reduction during the same period as previously discussed fig 4 additionally except for the reservoirs on the vakhsh river which are predominately used for power generation the reservoirs are used for agricultural irrigation to understand the effects of cropland irrigation and reservoirs construction on n parameter yang et al 2009 first assessed vegetation coverage based on ndvi and established their relationship similarly we assessed the vegetation coverage fig 10 and demonstrated their relationship to n parameter fig 11 the findings showed high vegetation coverage values to be primarily concentrated in the three irrigation areas of the adrb with the most apparent increase in the center of the irrigation areas expanding to the surrounding zones such findings are linked to the cropland expansion fig 8 that was spatially observed to increase at the same zones of high vegetation coverage thus considering the study period 1982 2015 the n parameter and vegetation coverage at the kiziljar station consistently increased while they appeared to be negatively correlated r 0 53 in contrast ning et al 2016 conducted the same approach on the jing river catchment in china and found n parameter to be weakly but positively correlated to vegetation coverage which might have been related to ongoing vegetation projects to understand the negative correlation observed in this study the inherent low precipitation of the adrb as an arid landscape and intense dependence on irrigation should be considered benjamin pohl et al 2017 reported in the outlook report rethinking water in central asia that the building of major dams and reservoirs in kyrgyzstan and tajikistan by the soviet union was to store water primarily for summer cropland irrigation purposes in uzbekistan kazakhstan and turkmenistan also our findings showed that the cropland expansion was also detected in 1982 2015 fig 8 after the newly added reservoir capacity in 1960s 1980s fig 9 as a consequence reservoirs construction activities that were implemented before cropland expansion activities reduced the amount of water flowing downstream as water running off needs to be stored before being released for irrigation in a such case the n parameter is negatively correlated with vegetation coverage although there is a positive influence of reservoirs on vegetation a hysteresis effect in the adrb may be expected all these revealed that reservoir construction across the study area had the most direct impact on the n parameter thus the reduction of runoff as an instance the construction of the manwan dam and xiaowan hydropower station in the mekong river basin initially perturbed the downstream vegetation which was then restored after few years yi et al 2019 in addition the dam type e g cascading hydropower or single dam li et al 2012 and dam height yi et al 2019 affected the vegetation furthermore many dams reservoirs affected each other in the study area thus the influence of dams reservoirs on vegetation can be further investigated in addition to the introduced argument on socio economic development the study further evaluated the population explosion that caused a range of biochemical and physical perturbations to hydrological systems li et al 2018 which started with the conversion of different land cover areas into agricultural and construction land according to our findings the total population across the basin has doubled increasing to approximately 80 million within 33 years fig 12 with the increase in cropland area fig 8 nonetheless the expansion of the urban surfaces impermeability is likely to affect the infiltration and result in a critical influence on surface runoff dynamics walsh et al 2005 moreover socio economic development including cropland expansion and population explosion caused an increase demand for water withdrawals for cropland irrigation and industries furthermore the extraction of water for human consumption and industry may alter the transfer path by deteriorating the water quality leading to river pollution all of which would complexly impact runoff because population was found to be positively correlated with the n parameter urban expansion and population growth might had decreased the runoff in central asia chen et al 2020 zou et al 2019 however in our study the n parameter was found to be more strongly correlated with vegetation coverage than with population growth thus considering the land surface characteristics the reservoir construction for cropland expansion is the most influential factor leading to the reduction in runoff with reservoirs being the most directly correlated factor 4 1 3 comparison of climate change and human activities impacts on runoff variations in watershed runoff are not only linked to precipitation but also to modifications in underlying land surface conditions caused by both climate and human activities this means that runoff variations respond differently depending on which of these two casual effects dominates as shown in table 3 the findings revealed climate change to exert a negative influence on runoff reduction ranging from 14 25 to 5 43 although climate change was mainly related to the geographical location of the area impacts cannot be neglected on the other hand the relative contribution rate of human activities in each period to runoff exceeded 100 which implies that human activities including reservoir construction cropland expansion and population growth contributed more to runoff reduction than climate change did in the study area this argument is supported by the fact that the adrb is an arid landscape receiving insufficient precipitation where crop growth heavily depends on irrigation as a consequence of the growing population and rapid development an agricultural expansion has been adopted to increase food security and production to ensure people thrive zabel et al 2019 the development of irrigation along with the construction of reservoirs inevitably impacted the runoff variations in the adrb given that the effect of climate change on runoff is small in the study area the focus should be on implementing effective measures that can limit the influence of multiple human activities and improve water resource management countries in the central asia have already responded to the shortage of water resources and executed the complex management of transboundary rivers although these countries endeavoured to formulate a single policy to resolve water related issues little effect has been observed subsequently organizations were established to manage the allocation of water resources such as the water users association and the informal water users groups regrettably these initiatives have resulted in various limitations including the lack of funds and technical support abdullaev et al 2010 the study findings are relevant to water management organization and policymakers as the insights into runoff changes and their multiple influencing factors across the adrb can be used to improve the management of water resources in the area more attention should also be paid to the construction and operation of reservoirs and cropland development for enhanced management and ecological sustainability 4 2 uncertainties the elasticity method coupled with the water balance and budyko framework produced informative findings on runoff changes in the adrb however to calculate the sensitivity of runoff to precipitation potential evapotranspiration and underlying surface characteristics we assumed that δ s was 0 this is a reasonable assumption considering a long term scale potter and zhang 2009 yang et al 2007 however for the short term its rationality should be carefully considered for example wang and alimohammadi 2012 reported that if the annual water balance changes in storage are negligible then the evaporation variability will be overestimated in the united states in addition using gravity recovery and climate experiment products deng and chen 2017 found that the water storage in the adrb changed by roughly 8 to 0 mm a between 2003 and 2013 therefore we assumed that the maximum change in δs is 8 mm a which means that the annual et is underestimated by 8 mm according to the following water balance equation p r e t δ s the underestimated et n and the elasticity coefficients of et 0 p n at the termez atamurat and kiziljar stations are presented in table 4 the results demonstrate that when the assumption of water storage change is 8 mm a the error of the elasticity coefficients is predominately within 10 which makes it feasible to calculate the elasticity coefficients of et 0 p and n by ignoring the changes in water storage ning et al 2016 in addition due to lack of adequate observational data the cru datasets were used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration and precipitation while its spatial resolution 0 5 that may not perfectly capture the real meteorological estimates could be a source of some uncertainties therefore for future studies this study calls upon the fusion of gridded and ground based observation data to provide adequate datasets resolution for future climatic studies across central asia 5 conclusions this study quantitatively assessed the runoff changes in the adrb using the elasticity coefficient method coupled with the water balance and budyko framework for three stations termez atamurat and kiziljar during 1960 2017 the findings from the current investigation provides some reference value for monitoring and managing water resources in the adrb since dramatic water related changes have been reported the findings revealed that runoff decreased at the termez atamurat and kiziljar stations at rates of 0 52 mm a 0 80 mm a and 0 97 mm a respectively with regards to climate and human factors considered as dual casual effects on runoff variations the relative contribution of climate change to runoff reduction ranged from 14 25 to 5 43 while that of human activities exceeded 100 at all three stations in addition to the doubling of the population size to 80 million within 33 years spatial evidence showed that cropland areas have expanded at a rate of 42 6 corresponding to a net increase of 2 520 249 ha furthermore reservoirs construction activities that were implemented before cropland expansion reduced the amount of water flowing downstream since water running off needs to be stored before being released for irrigation this demonstrated that runoff reduction was mainly due to human activities with construction of reservoirs for cropland expansion being the most direct factor therefore the results of this research provide the latest information that can be used to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the spatio temporal changes in runoff which is vital to support water resource management in

4157,it is crucial to investigate how a precipitation deficit is transformed into hydrological drought and how climate change and human activities affect this transformation process which is helpful to gain a deep understanding of drought propagation process in this changing environment this study proposed an observation based natural and human impacted catchment comparison method to assess the impacts of climate change and human activities on propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought the method mainly consists of the following three steps 1 selection of natural catchments through analysis of trends and change points of hydro meteorological data as well as statistics analysis of human influence based on land use and socio economic indicators data sets 2 calculation of drought propagation characteristics e g drought severity duration and propagation time based on run theory and the pearson correlation coefficient and 3 comparison of drought propagation characteristics of natural catchments between undisturbed and disturbed periods to identify the impacts of climate change on drought propagation and comparison of the propagation characteristics between natural and human impacted catchments during the disturbed period to investigate human influence on drought propagation the laohahe basin with eleven sub catchments located in northern china was evaluated via the proposed procedure and standardized precipitation index spi and standardized runoff index sri were used to characterize meteorological and hydrological droughts respectively the results demonstrate that the proposed method is suitable tool for distinguishing natural and human impacted catchments and separating the impacts of climate change and human activities on drought propagation furthermore the comparison results of different schemes show that climate change accelerates the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought in the laohahe basin shortening it by approximately 3 months human activities however disturb and then delay the natural propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought retarding it by 11 12 months although the laohahe basin was selected as a case study in this paper the proposed method can be applied in other regions as well to improve drought prediction and water resources management keywords meteorological drought hydrological drought drought propagation climate change human activities nonparametric standardized drought index 1 introduction drought is widely recognized as a complex multidimensional phenomenon that occurs in most parts of the world wang et al 2020 tijdeman and menzel 2020 jiang et al 2019 van loon et al 2016 barker et al 2016 sheffield et al 2012 dai 2011 mishra and singh 2010 drought starts with negative hydro climatic signals i e meteorological drought and propagates through interconnected hydrological subsystems such as soil systems i e soil moisture drought surface water systems and groundwater bodies i e hydrological drought and then extends from water stored in the landscape to vegetation stress i e agriculture and natural plants and human water demand i e socio economic drought apurv and cai 2020 this concept is referred to as drought propagation eltahir and yeh 1999 peters et al 2003 which is commonly characterized by four features pooling attenuation lag and lengthening van loon 2015 many investigations have examined the driving mechanisms and controlling factors of drought propagation such as climate catchment properties and human influences peters et al 2003 tallaksen et al 2009 vidal et al 2010 van loon and van lanen 2012 tijdeman et al 2018 under global change the driving force for the occurrence development spread and evolution of drought has gradually transitioned from a single natural factor i e climate variability to a combination of natural human factors i e climate change and human activities van loon et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 severe recent drought events that occurred in california china spain and australia cannot be viewed as purely natural hazards lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 aghakouchak et al 2015 anthropogenic changes to the land surface have significantly altered hydrological processes mainly including surface runoff and water storage which in turn affect the development of drought van loon et al 2016 huang et al 2017 therefore it is important to investigate how climate change and human activities alter drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought which is helpful for improving drought prediction and water resources management for evaluating diverse drought events a number of drought indices have been developed and then applied widely across the world in recent decades wells et al 2004 shukla and wood 2008 lópez moreno et al 2013 farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 among all the drought indices the standard precipitation index spi and the standard runoff index sri have been used the most widely for evaluation of meteorological and hydrological drought respectively because they have the following advantages robust and flexible time scale relatively simple calculation and limited data requirement however spi and sri usually rely on different parametric distribution functions to fit the corresponding sample data i e precipitation and runoff which will result in different fitting behaviours and then impact the statistical consistency and comparability of these two drought indices farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 furthermore because the complicated interactions among surface water atmosphere vegetation soil and groundwater have substantial impacts on hydrologic processes different catchments may have different representative parametric distribution functions which will impact the comparability of drought indices between different catchments hence a generalized framework for deriving non parametric standardized drought indicators farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 huang et al 2015 was used in this study to calculate the non parametric spi and sri series because it leads to statistically consistent drought indicators based on different climate and land surface variables without assuming representative parametric distributions which can ensure the comparability of different drought indexes in different catchments moreover the run theory yevjevich 1967 a widely used method for extracting drought characteristics was applied in this study if the drought index in a certain period remain below the threshold e g drought index 0 of the run theory the run during this period will be regarded as a drought event and the corresponding drought duration and severity can be identified currently commonly used methods for studying drought propagation can be categorized into two groups i e those using statistical analysis lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 lópez moreno et al 2013 veettil et al 2018 konapala and mishra 2020 veettil and mishra 2020 apurv and cai 2020 and those using hydrologic models longobardi and van loon 2018 tallaksen et al 2009 van lanen et al 2013 van loon and van lanen 2012 methods based on hydrological models are often used to explore the physical mechanisms of drought propagation statistical analysis methods such as correlation analysis and machine learning are usually applied to identify the climate and watershed properties that control drought propagation in this study the widely used statistical method i e pearson correlation coefficient pcc proposed by pearson 1895 was selected to quantitatively identify the correlation between the sri and the spi series and the spi accumulation period with the strongest pcc was used as an indicator of the drought propagation time barker et al 2016 wu et al 2018 in addition a common method for assessing the impacts of climate change and human activities on hydrological processes is to find a natural reference catchment and compare the hydrological processes in natural catchments with those in impacted or managed catchments to distinguish the effects of different factors ficklin et al 2018 roodari et al 2021 there are several approaches that focus on finding natural catchments from observation data and perform comparison analysis such as the following six 1 the large scale screening approach wagener et al 2010 2 the paired catchments approach van loon et al 2019 3 the observation modelling approach van loon and van lanen 2013 4 the upstream downstream approach rangecroft et al 2019 5 the pre post disturbance approach liu et al 2016 and 6 the tributary comparison approach li et al 2020 wang et al 2020 downsides of the first two methods are that they require a large number of catchments with long time series of hydrological data li et al 2020 van loon et al 2019 downsides of the third method are that the simulated data often have uncertainties and a pre disturbed period is needed for calibration to reduce those rangecroft et al 2019 roodari et al 2021 meanwhile another disadvantage of the third method is that before a model can be used in climate change studies we must first ensure that it is climate transferable stephens et al 2021 the approaches 4 and 5 either have uncertainties that come from the possible non linear relationship between the upstream and downstream gauging stations van loon et al 2019 or have some difficulties separating the human influence from climatic variability peñas et al 2016 the tributary comparison approach li et al 2020 establishes an indicator system for the selection of natural reference tributary according to the drought propagation intensity reservoir and land use conditions but does not consider socio economic indicators in general most of existing studies did not establish a unified index system to divide natural and human impacted catchments a few methods established index systems but do not consider the socio economic indicators closely related to human activities e g gdp and population density according to the above limitations the present study establishes a preliminary indicator system to evaluate the land use data and socio economic indicators i e gdp population and night light density to quantify human influence and combines its results with the analysis results of trends and change points of hydro meteorological data to select natural catchments this is a novelty of the study then this study proposed a natural and human impacted catchment comparison method to use observation data to separate the effects of climate change and human activities on drought propagation so as to ensure the climate transferability of this method the whole calculation framework mainly consists of three steps 1 selecting natural catchments through combing the analysis results of hydrological variations with the quantification results of human influence 2 calculating drought propagation characteristics e g drought severity duration and propagation time based on the pearson correlation coefficient and run theory method and 3 comparison of drought propagation characteristics of natural catchments between undisturbed and disturbed periods to identify the impacts of climate change on drought propagation and comparison of the ones between natural and human impacted catchments during the disturbed period to investigate human influence on drought propagation the laohahe basin located in northern china with a high degree of human influence was chosen as the study area to perform the proposed method 2 study area and data source 2 1 study area the laohahe basin located in a typical semiarid region of northeast china 41 0 n 42 75 n 117 25 e 120 e covers an area of 18 112 km2 with the xinglongpo hydrological station at the basin outlet as shown in fig 1 the elevation of the laohahe basin ranges between 2054 m and 427 m above mean sea level with a generally declining trend from southwest to northeast summer is the main rainy season and approximately 60 70 of the annual precipitation occurs during june august runoff in the laohahe basin exhibits the similar seasonality with about 70 of the annual runoff concentrated in june september yong et al 2013 wang et al 2020 similar to other semiarid basins the annual potential evapotranspiration pet of the laohahe basin exceeds annual precipitation and about 60 70 of the annual pet focus on april august sunshine duration an insolation variable closely related to pet shows a similar seasonality with pet i e the sunshine hours in march august are significant higher than those in other months in this study we selected 11 catchments fig 1 including seven headwater catchments from north to south catchments 1 7 independent of each other three midstream catchments catchments 8 10 indicated with the red solid line boundaries in fig 1 and the whole basin i e catchment 11 including all the sub catchments table 1 lists the geographic and hydrological information of these 11 catchments the ranges of average annual precipitation and runoff in these catchments are 390 580 mm and 20 120 mm respectively with a gradual declining trend from south catchments 4 7 to north catchments 1 3 and 8 11 it is worth noting that jiang et al 2011 found that human activities were the main factors with contributions of 89 93 contributing to the runoff decrease in the laohahe basin after 1979 and recent studies shows the decreasing trend of runoff in this basin is continuing yong et al 2013 liu et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 2 2 data source the data used in this study mainly consists of three parts hydro meteorological data agricultural and industrial production data and remote sensing inversion and reanalysis data 1 monthly precipitation data measured by 52 rain gauges monthly streamflow data measured by 11 hydrological stations and monthly meteorological data measured by 7 meteorological stations including maximum mean and minimum air temperatures wind speed and insolation from 1964 to 2016 were provided by the water resources department of the inner mongolia autonomous region precipitation data were interpolated through the inverse distance weighting idw method to calculate the areal average of precipitation in each catchment meteorological data were interpolated through the idw method to calculate the areal average of pet though the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 whilst corresponding actual evaporation was calculated through water balance equation yong et al 2013 huang et al 2017 moreover monthly streamflow were divided by the catchment area to get the runoff areal average depth in each catchment shukla and wood 2008 wu et al 2018 to compare with the precipitation and pet annual human water use data of each catchment during 2006 2016 and information of three large reservoirs were also provided by the water resources department of the inner mongolia autonomous region 2 agricultural and industrial production data for the laohahe basin during 1964 2016 including the annual food production number of livestock irrigated area and gross industrial product gip were collected from the local statistical bureau website http tjj chifeng gov cn these data are selected to reflect the temporal changes of the degree of human agricultural and industrial activities in the laohahe basin during the entire study period 1964 2016 3 remote sensing inversion and reanalysis data used in this study and their detail information are listed in table 2 large scale climate indices i e annual enso pdo ao and sunspot data were applied in this study to investigate the impact of climate change on drought propagation surface soil moisture and grace data were used to analyse the surface soil moisture and terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa of the study area grid remote sensing inversion and reanalysis data sets including land use population density gdp density and night light density were collected to analyse the human influence on the study area and then to support for the selection of natural catchments 3 methodology in this study we proposed an observation based natural and human impacted catchment comparison method illustrated in fig 2 for assessing the impacts of climate change and human activities on drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought the three steps of the proposed method are described below 1 selection of natural catchments the first step focuses on the selection of natural catchments a preliminary knowledge of the hydrological regime changes in each catchment can be identified based on the results of mmk trend analyses and change point tests of annual precipitation pet and runoff during the entire research period in addition the precipitation runoff double cumulative curve dcc reflects the consistency of precipitation and runoff series and is helpful to identify change points visually note that based on previous studies wang et al 2020 jiang et al 2019 van loon and van lanen 2013 the entire research period is usually divided into two parts by the first change point for further comparison schemes design undisturbed period the period before the change point and disturbed period the period after the change point furthermore socio economic indicators including average population gdp and night light density and land use data for each catchment are collected and then are used to calculate human influence scores through an indicator system finally according to the analysis results of trend and change point of hydro meteorological variables human influence scores and reservoir information all the studied catchments can be divided into two types natural catchments and human impacted catchments 2 calculation of drought propagation characteristics the second step is the calculation of drought propagation characteristics including drought duration severity and propagation time run theory is first used to identify drought duration and severity of spi and sri at different timescales e g spi x and sri x x 1 3 12 months in addition a comparison between sri and spi provides an indication of the time taken for precipitation deficits to propagate through the hydrological cycle to hydrological drought barker et al 2016 in this study spi accumulation periods of 1 48 months spi n n 1 2 48 months and sri 1 time series were cross correlated using the pcc to investigate the most appropriate propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought the spi accumulation period with the strongest correlation with sri 1 was regarded as the appropriate drought propagation time where sri 1 was most strongly correlated with short spi accumulation periods the propagation time was also short and vice versa 3 assessment of the impacts of different factors on drought propagation in the final step different comparison schemes as shown in step 3 in fig 2 are designed to assess the impacts of climate change and human activities on drought propagation in comparison ⅰ propagation time of natural and human impacted catchments during the undisturbed period are compared to investigate the similarity of drought propagation pattern in these two types of catchments in comparison ii for a natural catchment the difference of drought propagation time between undisturbed and disturbed periods can reflect the impact of climate change on drought propagation under the condition that the underlying surface properties e g catchment area soil types vegetation types etc remain approximately unchanged in comparison iii natural and human impacted catchments are all affected by climate change in the disturbed period and differences in propagation characteristics between natural and human impacted catchments should be attributed to effects of human activities the concept underlying this approach and the methods used are described in detail in the following sections 3 1 trend and change point analysis 3 1 1 modified mann kendall mmk trend test method the traditional mann kendall mk trend test method recommended by the world meteorological organization is a widely used nonparametric method for trend tests of time series however hamed and rao 1998 found that the persistence of hydro meteorological series impacts the robustness of the mk test results then they used lag i autocorrelation to remove the persistence to make the test result more reliable and robust which is known as the modified mann kendall mmk trend test method in this study therefore we adopted the mmk method to identify the trend of the spi and sri series the detailed computational processes can be found in hamed and rao 1998 and huang et al 2015 3 1 2 change point test methods the pettitt test pettitt 1979 is a widely used nonparametric test method to determine a change point of hydro meteorological variable time series at a given significance level e g α 0 05 this approach is based on rank statistics and considers a time series as two samples represented by x1 x2 xt and xt 1 xn n is the length of the time series the pettitt indices ut n can be calculated as follows 1 u t n j 1 t i 1 n sgn x j x i t 1 2 n where 2 sgn θ 1 θ 0 0 θ 0 1 θ 0 then we can calculate the series of probabilities of change points for each time step 3 p 1 exp 6 u t n 2 n 3 n 2 in addition to the pettitt test the heuristic segmentation method and the precipitation runoff double cumulative curve dcc method were applied in this study to ensure robustness of the change point test results the heuristic segmentation method proposed by bernaola galvan et al 2001 is developed on the basis of the sliding t test and has been widely used to identify change points of nonlinear and non stationary time series because the detailed calculation processes of the method are well introduced in bernaola galvan et al 2001 and huang et al 2015 they are omitted in this study for the sake of brevity the precipitation and runoff double cumulative curve dcc method can visually illustrate the consistency of precipitation and runoff data jiang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 generally a change in the gradient of the curve may infer that the characteristics of precipitation or runoff have changed and the inflection point of the curve is generally regarded as a change point 3 2 establishment of an indicator system for accessing human influence in the proposed method as shown in step 1 in fig 2 we selected four representative socio economic indicator data sets to analyse human influence including gdp population night light density data sets and land use data set listed in table 2 firstly gdp and population density data sets can intuitively reflect the economic activities and human settlement conditions respectively so they are often used to evaluate the intensity of regional human impacts woolmer et al 2008 yue et al 2014 secondly remotely sensed night time lights dataset is widely used to characterize trends in urban sprawl over time and can monitor dynamics in human settlement and economic activity at regional to global scales ma et al 2012 finally the proportion of cropland and urban land is closely related to agriculture residential and industrial development and is also usually used to reflect the degree of human influence in the basin li et al 2020 wang et al 2020 based on the above four data sets an indicator system is built to quantify human influence and then to support for the division of natural and human impacted catchments in this indicator system we used a method similar to that of sanderson et al 2002 and woolmer et al 2008 to combine the four datasets we express each dataset as overlaying grids at a resolution of about 1 square kilometre km2 and scored each dataset to reflect their contribution to human influence sum of the scores of all indicators are the human influence index hi these scoring criteria are based on published scientific studies as summarized in table 3 higher scores indicate greater human influence and vice versa the areal average hi scores of each catchment can be calculated as follows 4 h i k i 1 n h i i n where hik means the areal average hi score of a catchment k 1 2 11 hii means the hi score of a grid cell in the catchment n is the total number of grids in the catchment 3 3 drought calculation 3 3 1 nonparametric standardized drought index for standardized drought index parametric distribution functions are commonly adopted to fit the probability distribution of hydro meteorological variables including precipitation soil moisture and runoff then the cumulative probability is converted to the cumulative distribution function cdf of the standard normal distribution finally the standardized index si value is calculated through the inverse of the standard normal distribution farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 huang et al 2015 for the nonparametric standardized drought index the empirical probability that is distribution free can replace the cumulative probability to derive a nonparametric si without having to assume representative parametric distributions here we take a runoff series x x 1 x 2 x n as an example to derive its probability distribution 5 p x i i 0 44 n 0 12 where i is the rank of the runoff value xi from the smallest n is the sample size of the runoff series and p xi is the corresponding empirical probability the outputs of eq 5 can be transformed to a si as follows 6 si ϕ 1 p where ϕ is the standard normal distribution function and p is the probability derived from eq 5 more detailed calculation processes of nonparametric standardized drought indicators can be found in farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 one advantage of the si is its ability to investigate drought at different timescales in this study different timescales of nonparametric standardized precipitation index spi x and standardized runoff index sri x were calculated to describe short or long term meteorological and hydrological drought for example spi 3 and sri 12 denote a 3 month precipitation accumulation period and a 12 month runoff accumulation period respectively wu et al 2018 the drought grade is divided into five levels based on previous studies vicente serrano et al 2012 spi or sri 0 1 spi 0 1 5 spi 1 0 2 0 spi 1 5 and spi 2 which correspond to no drought mild drought moderate drought severe drought and extreme drought respectively 3 3 2 run theory in run theory proposed by yevjevich 1967 drought events are defined as a period where indicator values are continuously below a certain threshold huang et al 2015 wu et al 2018 so a threshold level tl of 0 is selected in this study to determine drought conditions the calculation process of these characteristics is as follows using spi as an example the drought state ds is given by 7 ds t 1 for s p i t t l 0 for s p i t t l the drought severity s per time step is defined by 8 s t t l s p i for d s t 1 0 for d s t 0 the drought duration d and severity s for drought event i are calculated with 9 d i t f i l i d s t 10 s i t f i l i s t where spi t is the spi value at a given time t tl is the threshold level in this study we set the tl to 0 ds t is a binary variable indicating if drought occurs at a given time t di is the drought duration of event i si is the total drought severity of event i and fi and li are the first and last time steps of event i 3 4 correlation analysis 3 4 1 pearson correlation coefficient the pearson correlation coefficient pcc developed by pearson 1895 has been widely used throughout hydrological correlation analyses in this study we used the pcc to identify the correlation between the sri and the spi at different timescales according to previous studies barker et al 2016 wu et al 2018 the spi accumulation period with the strongest pcc is used as an indicator for drought propagation the pcc is calculated as follows 11 pcc i 1 n φ i φ ω i ω i 1 n φ i φ 2 i 1 n ω i ω 2 i 1 2 n where φ i and ω i denote two time series and φ and ω denote the average values of the two series the pcc ranges from 1 to 1 where 1 0 and 1 indicate total positive linear correlation no linear correlation and total negative linear correlation respectively 3 4 2 cross wavelet analysis cross wavelet analysis hudgins and huang 1996 torrence and compo 1998 is a technique coupled with cross spectrum analysis and wavelet transform this method can effectively identify the correlation between two time series in the time frequency domain the cross wavelet transforms cwt of two specific time series e g xn and yn can be defined as wxy wxwy where denotes their complex conjugation the cross wavelet power can be expressed as wxy and the complex argument arg wxy can be regarded as the local relative phase between xn and yn in the time frequency domain the theoretical distribution of the cross wavelet power of the two time series is defined as follows 12 d w n x s w n y s σ x σ y p z v p v p k x p k y where zv p is the confidence level associated with probability p for a probability distribution function defined by the square root of the product of two χ2 distributions p k x and p k y are background power spectra of time series xn and yn respectively grinsted et al 2004 4 results 4 1 selection of natural catchments fig 3 visually shows the significant changes in the relationship between precipitation and runoff in the 11 selected catchments except for the yswz js and xq catchments fig 3 c d and f the gradients of the runoff accumulation curve were significantly different from those of the precipitation accumulation curve for the remaining eight catchments fig 3 a b e and g k after 1979 and or 1999 furthermore table 4 shows the results of the mmk trend analysis and change point tests of annual precipitation pet and runoff for the 11 selected catchments during the period from 1964 to 2016 expect for pet in the tpz catchment which showed an upward trend pet and precipitation of all the catchments showed a downward trend without reaching a significant level α 0 05 there were also no significant α 0 05 change points in the precipitation and pet series for the 11 catchments different from the above two variables runoff in most catchments showed a significant downward trend α 0 05 except for the yswz js and xq catchments for the eight catchments with significant downward trends in runoff series change points were identified in 1979 through pettitt and heuristic segmentation test methods based on the results of trend and change point analyses we found that the relationship between precipitation and runoff for the yswz js and xq catchments was relatively stable and consistent throughout the entire research period 1964 2016 fig 4 shows the temporal changes of socio economic indicators average population gdp and night light density proportion of cropland and urban land and human influence scores for the catchments in the laohahe basin for the average population density fig 4 a cf tpz and xlp catchments show a slight downward trend during 2000 2015 while the other catchments remain almost unchanged for the average gdp density fig 4 b all catchments show an upward trend but the growth rate of the xlp and cf catchments is significantly faster than that of the remain catchments during 2000 2015 similarly night light density also has an increasing trend for all catchments but cf tpz and xlp catchments are obviously growing faster than the other catchments for the land use situation i e proportion of cropland and urban land during 1980 2015 which are directly related to human activities shows a slight upward trend in xcz xd cf tpz and xlp catchments but remain constant in the other catchments finally the human influence scores which are calculated based on the above four indictors increased rapidly in cf tpz and xlp catchment but increased slowly in remain catchments table 5 indicates that areal average human influence scores of the yswz js and xq catchments during 2000 2015 were the three lowest while those of the other catchments all exceeded these three catchments furthermore fig 5 shows the spatial distributions of socio economic indicators land use data and human influence scores generally all these indicators showed an upward trend from headwater catchments catchments 1 7 i e ctl xjd yswz js xcz xq and dz catchments to midstream catchments catchments 8 10 i e xd cf and tpz catchments and downstream catchments catchment 11 i e xlp catchment in summary combined with results of trend and change points analysis of hydrological variables human influence scores and reservoir information listed in table 5 yswz js and xq catchments can be selected as natural catchments because the three catchments have consistent relationships between precipitation and runoff and are affected by weak human activities i e low human influence scores and no reservoir regulations remain eight catchments are either affected by reservoir regulations or strong human activities i e high human influence scores so they are classified into human impacted catchments meanwhile according to the analysis results of the first change point for each catchment and temporal change of socio economic indicators and land use data the entire research period can be divided into two periods the undisturbed period 1964 1979 and the disturbed period 1980 2016 for further design of comparison scheme 4 2 propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought to identify propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought in the laohahe basin we first used the mmk method to analyse the trends of these two categories of drought during 1964 2016 for 11 catchments in the laohahe basin fig 6 based on the spi and sri measured over 1 3 and 12 month timescales these three timescales represent monthly seasonal and annual drought and can adequately depict the evolution of drought in the study area then drought evolutionary characteristics for the undisturbed and disturbed periods were calculated through run theory including drought duration and severity fig 7 and table 6 in addition the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought was identified by the spi accumulation period spi n most strongly correlated with sri 1 based on the pcc fig 8 and fig 9 4 2 1 trend analysis of meteorological and hydrological drought fig 6 shows the trends of long term spi and sri time series at 1 3 and 12 month scales in 11 catchments in the laohahe basin during the period 1964 2016 all catchments except dz catchment showed downward trends in spi 1 and spi 3 but none of these downward trends were significant fig 6 a and b spi 12 in most catchments except for the js and xcz catchments exhibited significant α 0 05 downward trends fig 6 c with the largest z values for spi 12 in the xd catchment 4 18 for hydrological drought all catchments except yswz js and xq showed significant downward trends α 0 05 in the sri 1 sri 3 and sri 12 time series fig 6 d e xd catchment experienced the worst hydrological drought with z values of 8 79 11 16 and 6 04 for sri 1 sri 3 and sri 12 respectively in general the sri series measured over 1 3 and 12 month time scales showed a clear spatial distribution with stronger downward trends in the midstream and downstream catchments i e xd cf tpz and xlp catchments than in the headwater catchments i e ctl xjd yswz js xcz xq and dz catchments 4 2 2 evolutionary characteristics of meteorological and hydrological drought as shown in fig 7 drought severity calculated from spi 3 and sri 3 series are selected as an example to show drought propagation characteristics during different periods in the undisturbed period for each catchment except xq ctl and xjd average drought severity calculated from of spi 3 series fig 7 a was larger than that calculated from of sri 3 series fig 7 c the largest drought severity were in the ctl 10 38 and xq 9 20 catchments for spi 3 and sri 3 respectively for the disturbed period however drought severity was larger for hydrological drought fig 7 d than meteorological drought fig 7 b across all human impacted catchments in the laohahe basin for example the average drought severity calculated from sri 3 in disturbed period was 13 1 in the xlp catchment but that calculated from spi 3 in the same catchment was only 2 2 with a six fold difference between the two values furthermore table 6 shows the difference in average drought characteristics calculated from spi 3 and sri 3 series between undisturbed and disturbed periods for all catchments meteorological drought measured by spi 3 had no significant change between undisturbed and disturbed periods for all catchments differences in the average meteorological drought duration and severity between the two periods were 0 8 and 0 5 for natural catchments 2 1 and 8 9 for human impacted catchments i and 2 6 and 7 8 for human impacted catchments ii respectively however for hydrological drought the average drought duration and severity during the disturbed period were significant higher than those during the undisturbed period in particular increases of 114 6 and 110 7 for drought duration and severity in human impacted catchments i and 193 2 and 518 8 for those in human impacted catchments ii were higher than those for natural catchments i e 47 4 and 43 8 therefore hydrological drought of human impacted catchments in the laohahe basin was influenced not only by climate change e g precipitation and temperature but also by human activities e g human water withdrawal reservoir regulations and land use and cover change 4 3 propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought to investigate the most appropriate accumulation period for propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought the sri 1 series was cross correlated with the spi series at various timescales spanning 1 48 months fig 8 all the catchments were divided into three groups according to catchment area to avoid its impact on drought propagation as shown in table 5 the first and second groups include the three natural catchments i e yswz js and xq catchments fig 8 a and d and three human impacted catchments i e xjd xcz and dz catchments fig 8 b and e because all their catchment area are 2000 km2 remain catchments are classed into the third group fig 8 c and f because all their catchments are 2000 km2 the pcc for natural catchments during the undisturbed period fig 8 a increased rapidly and reached the maximum value in the range of 11 15 months the highest pccs for the yswz js and xq catchments were 0 72 0 75 and 0 70 respectively and the corresponding propagation times were 12 12 and 14 months respectively for human impacted catchments i during the undisturbed period xcz dz and xjd catchments reached the maximum pcc value in the range of 6 13 months fig 8 b and the maximum pcc values for human impacted catchments ii were concentrated in the range of 8 13 months fig 8 c with the highest pcc varying from 0 36 to 0 59 in the disturbed period the most appropriate accumulation periods for drought propagation time in natural catchments concentrated in the range of 7 12 months fig 8 d for the human impacted catchments the pcc values of the xcz dz and xjd catchments reached the maximum value in the range of 9 13 months fig 8 e while remain catchments reached the highest pcc values in the range of 17 24 months fig 8 f in addition fig 9 shows the seasonal variability in the drought propagation time and the corresponding strongest pcc values during undisturbed and disturbed periods for natural catchments i e yswz js and xq propagation times in spring march may and summer june august during undisturbed times were relatively consistent with those during the disturbed period however the propagation times in autumn september november and winter december february during the disturbed period were shorter than those during the undisturbed period which result in that the drought propagation time during the disturbed period is shorter than that in the undisturbed period for human impacted catchments i e the remaining eight catchments except in summer propagation times in the other three seasons were longer for the disturbed period than for the undisturbed period therefore increases in propagation times during disturbed period for human impacted catchments were mainly concentrated in spring autumn and winter 4 4 impact of climate change and human activities on drought propagation in this study we designed three comparisons to reveal the impacts of climate change and human activities on drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought fig 2 and table 7 first of all we compared the propagation time of natural and human impacted catchments during the undisturbed period in comparison ⅰ the differences between natural and human impacted i catchments for the mean median and maximum drought propagation time are 3 3 and 2 months respectively and the above differences between natural and human impacted ii catchments are 2 1 and 2 months respectively indicating that drought propagation patterns of all catchments in laohahe basin are generally consistent then the drought propagation time of natural catchments between the undisturbed and disturbed periods was compared in comparison ⅱ to reflect the influence of climate change on drought propagation the results revealed that the average median and maximum drought propagation times in the natural catchments during the disturbed period were reduced by approximately 3 months indicating that drought propagation is accelerating under the influence of climate change finally in comparison iii the propagation time of human impacted catchments was compared with those of natural catchments during the disturbed period the former was influenced by climate change and human activities and the latter was influenced by climate change only difference between them can reveal the impacts of human activities on the drought propagation process the mean median and maximum values of the propagation time for human impacted i catchments increased by approximately 2 2 and 1 months respectively and the above increase for human impacted ii catchments are 12 11 and 12 months indicating that human activities significantly disturb and delay natural drought propagation processes of the midstream and downstream catchments i e xd cf tpz and xlp catchments during disturbed periods 5 discussion 5 1 rationality analysis of the natural and human impacted catchment comparison method under the background of global change we need to improve our understanding of the impacts of different factors on drought propagation these processes can be deeply explored through observation based data in this study we proposed the natural and human impacted catchment comparison method which selects natural catchments though analysis of hydrological variations as well as statistics analysis of human influence based on an indicator system more importantly it used only observation data to analyse the impacts of climate change and human activities on drought propagation which can improve the accuracy of the impact assessment on the one hand the selection results of natural catchments in the laohahe basin were consistent with previous studies yong et al 2013 found that the yswz and js catchments had no significant change points in runoff based on the pettitt test and dcc method wang et al 2020 selected the xq catchment as a natural catchment to analyse the uncertainty of hydrological models because it has a consistent relationship between precipitation and runoff therefore the natural catchments selected in this study including the yswz js and xq catchments were reasonable on the other hand the analysis of the impacts of climate change and human activities on drought propagation in this study were also consistent with other studies jiang et al 2019 liu et al 2016 barker et al 2016 lópez moreno et al 2013 liu et al 2009 han et al 2019 pointed out that the phase transformation and amplitude fluctuation of pdo and enso are obviously enhanced in the 21st century which intensifies the changes in meteorological elements such as temperature precipitation and evaporation and then accelerates the propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought for human influence lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 stated that human activities have significantly altered the natural hydrological response e g hydrological drought to meteorological droughts delaying the response of hydrological drought to precipitation deficits over long timescales thus the results obtained by the proposed method are consistent with previous studies i e climate change tends to accelerate drought propagation and human influence tends to delay drought propagation in the laohahe basin furthermore the proposed method provides a new idea for the selection of natural catchments i e using an indicator system that involving socio economic indices to quantify human influence and combining its results with hydrological variation results to support catchment division with the increasing development of earth observation technology a large number of remote sensing inversion and reanalysis data sets have appeared tapley et al 2004 theobald et al 2010 small et al 2011 ma et al 2012 yue et al 2014 perkl et al 2016 sheffield et al 2017 these data sets provide new reference indicators that is socio economic attributes e g population and gdp density and land use situation for catchment division in addition to the traditional hydrological attributes therefore when it is difficult to use exciting methods to select natural catchments the proposed method may be a good supplement or choice for example when we cannot find suitable paired catchments using the paired catchments comparison method or want to remove the concern of variations across paired catchments the proposed method can be used to determine natural and human impacted catchments more importantly different comparison schemes in the proposed method can identify the changes of drought propagation process in different types of catchments natural or human impacted catchment which are equally important for water resource managers for natural catchments understanding the changes of drought propagation due to climate change is helpful to the improvement of drought prediction huang et al 2017 han et al 2019 aghakouchak et al 2021 for human impacted catchments realizing that changes of drought propagation pattern caused by human influence is important for water resource managers to adjust water resources allocation to cope with the possible water supply crisis and ecological crisis caused by the above changes van loon et al 2016 apurv and cai 2020 aghakouchak et al 2021 in general the case study results in laohahe basin proved that the proposed method is an effective tool for selection of natural catchments and assessing climatic and anthropogenic influences on drought propagation and can be applied to other regions as well to improve drought prediction and regional water resources management 5 2 possible factors influencing drought propagation 5 2 1 influence of teleconnection factors on drought propagation in comparison ii as shown in fig 2 and table 7 the results showed that climate change accelerates the drought propagation in natural catchment and recent studies have found that large scale atmospheric circulation anomalies which are closely related to climate change may have impacts on the drought propagation time huang et al 2017 meanwhile evaporation plays an important role in the drought propagation process from meteorological to hydrological drought han et al 2019 thus wavelet cross analysis was applied to analyse the correlations between the actual evaporation in a natural catchment i e js catchment and teleconnection factors i e enso ao pdo and sunspots series during 1964 2016 fig 10 the results showed that actual evaporation had significant positive linkages with enso events fig 10 a with periods of 3 7 years during 1985 2005 and pdo events fig 10 c with periods of 4 7 years and 8 12 years during 1990 2000 at the 95 confidence level moreover actual evaporation had strong negative correlations with ao and sunspots specifically it exhibited a negative correlation with ao with periods of 8 10 years during 1980 1995 and a strong negative correlation with sunspots with periods of 7 14 years during 1973 2005 therefore large scale atmospheric circulation anomalies show strong linkages with actual evaporation during the disturbed period 1980 2016 thus strongly affecting the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought in this period these findings are similar to those from other studies huang et al 2017 han et al 2019 and closely related to the changes of drought propagation time in natural catchments during the disturbed period 5 2 2 impact of human factors on drought propagation in the comparison iii as shown in fig 2 and table 7 the results showed that human activities including economic development reservoir construction and land use and cover change significantly altered and then delayed the drought propagation time firstly population and economic development have significant impacts on drought propagation as shown in fig 4 a c population density of the two highly industrialized human impacted catchments i e cf and xlp catchments reached approximately 200 persons km2 and gdp and night light density of these two catchments increased rapidly after 2000 more intuitively fig 11 a shows that in 2006 2016 the total annual human water withdrawal of the human impacted catchments account for more than half of the natural runoff for the laohahe basin and the highest proportion is approximately 80 except for the xjd catchment all the human impacted catchments were directly impacted by human water withdrawal thus sustained increase of domestic water and industrial water for economic development causes serious loss of surface water and then extends the response times of hydrological drought to meteorological drought reservoir constructions and regulations might be another factor affecting drought propagation for example the dahushi reservoir located in dz catchment with a storage capacity of 1 2 108 m3 focused on agricultural irrigation and usually maintained storage in spring autumn and winter and then released water in summer to guarantee agriculture irrigation yong et al 2013 ren et al 2014 jiang et al 2021 these seasonal regulations are closely related to the shifts of seasonal pattern of drought propagation as shown in fig 9 except for summer june july and august drought propagation time of the other seasons in human impacted catchments e g ctl xd cf tpz and xlp become longer for disturbed period than for undisturbed period indicating that reservoir regulations modifies the response pattern of hydrological drought to meteorological drought in different seasons and tends to smooth the impacts of meteorological drought over a longer time scale in addition to economic development and reservoir regulations land use change and intensification of agriculture activities may also impacted drought propagation as shown in fig 4 d compared with the three natural catchments i e yswz xq and js remain eight human impacted catchments have a higher proportion of cropland and urban land especially the midstream and downstream catchment e g cf tpz and xlp catchments the proportion of cropland and urban land for the tpz catchment increased from 55 in 1980 to 60 in 2015 and that for cf catchment increased from 46 in 1980 to 50 in 2015 in addition fig 11 b shows that agriculture production data including irrigated area livestock and food production and the gip have a substantial increase during the disturbed period 1980 2016 and fig 11 c shows that surface soil moisture increases significantly after 2000 which is closely related to the large scale intensive agricultural irrigation activities thus increase of area of cropland and intensification of agriculture production activities consume a large amount of surface water leading to a sharp decrease in river runoff which in turn delays the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought finally terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa data were used to reveal the changes in total water resources in the laohahe basin fig 11 d water storage in the laohahe basin declined significantly during 2003 2016 especially after 2007 0 63 cm a and the largest negative anomaly reached approximately 16 cm year approximately equal to 6 times the average annual runoff of the laohahe basin in general human activities such as socio economic development e g population gdp and night light density reservoir constructions and regulations and land use change have significantly modified the total amount and temporal distribution of the surface runoff in the laohahe basin which in turn lead a delayed and more sustained response of hydrological drought to meteorological drought 5 3 uncertainties and limitations the results demonstrated that the proposed method is a suitable tool to analyse the impacts of climate change and human activities on drought propagation however this approach still has some uncertainties most observation based methods have uncertainties with regard to temporal or spatial resolution and data quality rangecroft et al 2019 limitations in the accuracy of hydrometric gauges particularly during low flows and the evolution of hydrological stations over time mean that it is often difficult to have an accurate homogeneous flow record margariti et al 2019 which creates uncertainty and then influences the calculation accuracy of meteorological and hydrological droughts however it has been recognized that the benefit of using these longer records for our analysis outweighs the disadvantages of uncertain hydrometric accuracy besides many previous studies have proven that the drought propagation time is closely linked with climate and catchment properties e g land use and soil types barker et al 2016 van loon and laaha 2015 even if the selected natural catchments and human impacted catchments are distributed in the same basin differences in climate and catchment properties still bring some uncertainties to the comparison results nevertheless comparison ⅰ fig 2 in the proposed method is used to assess the similarity of drought propagation pattern in different sub catchments comparison results fig 8 a c indicated that in the undisturbed period the drought propagation time of natural catchments is close to that of human impacted catchments which means that differences in climate and catchment properties for the selected catchments did not cause significant differences in the drought propagation time meanwhile it is worth noting that directly comparing the drought propagation characteristics of the two periods before and after the change point in natural catchments to quantify the impacts of climate change may also bring uncertainties because climate change is a gradual changing process its impact on drought propagation may continuously increase since the beginning of the study period stochastic weather generator semenov 2008 wilks and wilby 1999 will be a good choice to solve the gradually changing weather patterns for its strong advantage of generating long time series of weather variables with statistical properties identical to those of observed series sohrabi et al 2021 in future research we can use the stochastic weather generator to simulate the weather variables in the disturbed period the period after the change point based on the those in the undisturbed period the period before the change point so as to ensure that the statistical characteristics of the two series are the same then the corresponding drought propagation characteristics under the observed and simulated weather conditions in the disturbed period can be compared to quantify the impacts of climate change in this period in addition to the uncertainty there are some limitations to this approach firstly this method needs specific and numerous data to divide natural and human impacted catchments long time series of hydrological data are needed to identify whether there are change points in hydrological processes more specific land use data and socio economic indicators based on remote sensing inversion and reanalysis i e gdp population and night light density are needed to quantify human influence to support for the selection of natural catchments however the above data are not always available or known van loon et al 2019 wang et al 2020 moreover because monthly data e g precipitation and streamflow were used the baseflow separation is not considered in this study which will also affect the study results so we suggest when using the proposed approach in other regions it is necessary to separate runoff from baseflow based on data with shorter time scale e g daily data to ensure the accuracy of the results secondly it remains difficult to select natural catchments using this indicator system for catchment with more complex situation thus other indicators representing human activities can be developed in future studies and then appropriately applied to the index system so as to provide a more accurate selection li et al 2020 meanwhile there is another challenge i e how to comprehensively consider various types of indicators to characterize the influence of human activities and apply them in the selection of natural catchments because subjective choices might lead to the deviation of the selection results sanderson et al 2002 woolmer et al 2008 in this study different indicators were scored based on the existing researches as shown in table 3 and then the catchments were divided according to the results of hi and hydrological variation analysis in the future research more case studies on the indicator system are needed to make the division criteria e g threshold of hi more reasonable and objective in view of the benefits and limitations we suggest that when using this method in other regions the selection of socio economic indicators and setting of threshold of hi should be modified and improved appropriately according to specific situation of the catchment itself and the types of human activities furthermore the approach can be used for a first estimate of the human influence to guide campaigns to collect more data and to complement other existing methods e g large scale screening paired catchments and observation modelling approaches 6 conclusions in this study we proposed an observation based natural and human impacted catchment comparison method for separating the effects of climate change and human activities on drought propagation the main parts of this method are the selection of natural catchments and the comparison of natural and human impacted situations in different periods first observed data i e hydro meteorological data as well as land use data and socio economic indicators based on remote sensing inversion and reanalysis are used to select natural catchments then three comparisons can be performed to separate the effects of climate change and human activities on drought propagation i e comparison ⅰ during the undisturbed period to analyse the consistency of drought propagation pattern in natural and human impacted catchments comparison ⅱ between the disturbed and undisturbed periods to identify the possible influence of climate change and comparison iii during the disturbed period to investigate human impacts the combination of these three comparison schemes to separate the effects of climate change and human activities on drought propagation is the innovative part of this research we demonstrate the application of the proposed natural and human impacted catchment comparison method in a heavily human influenced basin in northeast china i e the laohahe basin in this basin we found that human activities caused longer hydrological drought durations and larger hydrological drought severities during the disturbed period with average increases of 163 7 and 365 9 respectively furthermore comparison results revealed that climate change accelerated the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought in the laohahe basin shortening it by approximately 3 months human activities however disturbed and then delayed the natural propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought extending it by 11 12 months the proposed natural and human impacted catchment comparison method gives water managers a suitable tool to divide natural and human impacted catchments based on hydrological and socio economic data and then to investigate how climatic and anthropogenic influences alter drought propagation through different comparison schemes this is critical for improving drought prediction and establishing a drought management system credit authorship

4157,it is crucial to investigate how a precipitation deficit is transformed into hydrological drought and how climate change and human activities affect this transformation process which is helpful to gain a deep understanding of drought propagation process in this changing environment this study proposed an observation based natural and human impacted catchment comparison method to assess the impacts of climate change and human activities on propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought the method mainly consists of the following three steps 1 selection of natural catchments through analysis of trends and change points of hydro meteorological data as well as statistics analysis of human influence based on land use and socio economic indicators data sets 2 calculation of drought propagation characteristics e g drought severity duration and propagation time based on run theory and the pearson correlation coefficient and 3 comparison of drought propagation characteristics of natural catchments between undisturbed and disturbed periods to identify the impacts of climate change on drought propagation and comparison of the propagation characteristics between natural and human impacted catchments during the disturbed period to investigate human influence on drought propagation the laohahe basin with eleven sub catchments located in northern china was evaluated via the proposed procedure and standardized precipitation index spi and standardized runoff index sri were used to characterize meteorological and hydrological droughts respectively the results demonstrate that the proposed method is suitable tool for distinguishing natural and human impacted catchments and separating the impacts of climate change and human activities on drought propagation furthermore the comparison results of different schemes show that climate change accelerates the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought in the laohahe basin shortening it by approximately 3 months human activities however disturb and then delay the natural propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought retarding it by 11 12 months although the laohahe basin was selected as a case study in this paper the proposed method can be applied in other regions as well to improve drought prediction and water resources management keywords meteorological drought hydrological drought drought propagation climate change human activities nonparametric standardized drought index 1 introduction drought is widely recognized as a complex multidimensional phenomenon that occurs in most parts of the world wang et al 2020 tijdeman and menzel 2020 jiang et al 2019 van loon et al 2016 barker et al 2016 sheffield et al 2012 dai 2011 mishra and singh 2010 drought starts with negative hydro climatic signals i e meteorological drought and propagates through interconnected hydrological subsystems such as soil systems i e soil moisture drought surface water systems and groundwater bodies i e hydrological drought and then extends from water stored in the landscape to vegetation stress i e agriculture and natural plants and human water demand i e socio economic drought apurv and cai 2020 this concept is referred to as drought propagation eltahir and yeh 1999 peters et al 2003 which is commonly characterized by four features pooling attenuation lag and lengthening van loon 2015 many investigations have examined the driving mechanisms and controlling factors of drought propagation such as climate catchment properties and human influences peters et al 2003 tallaksen et al 2009 vidal et al 2010 van loon and van lanen 2012 tijdeman et al 2018 under global change the driving force for the occurrence development spread and evolution of drought has gradually transitioned from a single natural factor i e climate variability to a combination of natural human factors i e climate change and human activities van loon et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 severe recent drought events that occurred in california china spain and australia cannot be viewed as purely natural hazards lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 aghakouchak et al 2015 anthropogenic changes to the land surface have significantly altered hydrological processes mainly including surface runoff and water storage which in turn affect the development of drought van loon et al 2016 huang et al 2017 therefore it is important to investigate how climate change and human activities alter drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought which is helpful for improving drought prediction and water resources management for evaluating diverse drought events a number of drought indices have been developed and then applied widely across the world in recent decades wells et al 2004 shukla and wood 2008 lópez moreno et al 2013 farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 among all the drought indices the standard precipitation index spi and the standard runoff index sri have been used the most widely for evaluation of meteorological and hydrological drought respectively because they have the following advantages robust and flexible time scale relatively simple calculation and limited data requirement however spi and sri usually rely on different parametric distribution functions to fit the corresponding sample data i e precipitation and runoff which will result in different fitting behaviours and then impact the statistical consistency and comparability of these two drought indices farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 furthermore because the complicated interactions among surface water atmosphere vegetation soil and groundwater have substantial impacts on hydrologic processes different catchments may have different representative parametric distribution functions which will impact the comparability of drought indices between different catchments hence a generalized framework for deriving non parametric standardized drought indicators farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 huang et al 2015 was used in this study to calculate the non parametric spi and sri series because it leads to statistically consistent drought indicators based on different climate and land surface variables without assuming representative parametric distributions which can ensure the comparability of different drought indexes in different catchments moreover the run theory yevjevich 1967 a widely used method for extracting drought characteristics was applied in this study if the drought index in a certain period remain below the threshold e g drought index 0 of the run theory the run during this period will be regarded as a drought event and the corresponding drought duration and severity can be identified currently commonly used methods for studying drought propagation can be categorized into two groups i e those using statistical analysis lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 lópez moreno et al 2013 veettil et al 2018 konapala and mishra 2020 veettil and mishra 2020 apurv and cai 2020 and those using hydrologic models longobardi and van loon 2018 tallaksen et al 2009 van lanen et al 2013 van loon and van lanen 2012 methods based on hydrological models are often used to explore the physical mechanisms of drought propagation statistical analysis methods such as correlation analysis and machine learning are usually applied to identify the climate and watershed properties that control drought propagation in this study the widely used statistical method i e pearson correlation coefficient pcc proposed by pearson 1895 was selected to quantitatively identify the correlation between the sri and the spi series and the spi accumulation period with the strongest pcc was used as an indicator of the drought propagation time barker et al 2016 wu et al 2018 in addition a common method for assessing the impacts of climate change and human activities on hydrological processes is to find a natural reference catchment and compare the hydrological processes in natural catchments with those in impacted or managed catchments to distinguish the effects of different factors ficklin et al 2018 roodari et al 2021 there are several approaches that focus on finding natural catchments from observation data and perform comparison analysis such as the following six 1 the large scale screening approach wagener et al 2010 2 the paired catchments approach van loon et al 2019 3 the observation modelling approach van loon and van lanen 2013 4 the upstream downstream approach rangecroft et al 2019 5 the pre post disturbance approach liu et al 2016 and 6 the tributary comparison approach li et al 2020 wang et al 2020 downsides of the first two methods are that they require a large number of catchments with long time series of hydrological data li et al 2020 van loon et al 2019 downsides of the third method are that the simulated data often have uncertainties and a pre disturbed period is needed for calibration to reduce those rangecroft et al 2019 roodari et al 2021 meanwhile another disadvantage of the third method is that before a model can be used in climate change studies we must first ensure that it is climate transferable stephens et al 2021 the approaches 4 and 5 either have uncertainties that come from the possible non linear relationship between the upstream and downstream gauging stations van loon et al 2019 or have some difficulties separating the human influence from climatic variability peñas et al 2016 the tributary comparison approach li et al 2020 establishes an indicator system for the selection of natural reference tributary according to the drought propagation intensity reservoir and land use conditions but does not consider socio economic indicators in general most of existing studies did not establish a unified index system to divide natural and human impacted catchments a few methods established index systems but do not consider the socio economic indicators closely related to human activities e g gdp and population density according to the above limitations the present study establishes a preliminary indicator system to evaluate the land use data and socio economic indicators i e gdp population and night light density to quantify human influence and combines its results with the analysis results of trends and change points of hydro meteorological data to select natural catchments this is a novelty of the study then this study proposed a natural and human impacted catchment comparison method to use observation data to separate the effects of climate change and human activities on drought propagation so as to ensure the climate transferability of this method the whole calculation framework mainly consists of three steps 1 selecting natural catchments through combing the analysis results of hydrological variations with the quantification results of human influence 2 calculating drought propagation characteristics e g drought severity duration and propagation time based on the pearson correlation coefficient and run theory method and 3 comparison of drought propagation characteristics of natural catchments between undisturbed and disturbed periods to identify the impacts of climate change on drought propagation and comparison of the ones between natural and human impacted catchments during the disturbed period to investigate human influence on drought propagation the laohahe basin located in northern china with a high degree of human influence was chosen as the study area to perform the proposed method 2 study area and data source 2 1 study area the laohahe basin located in a typical semiarid region of northeast china 41 0 n 42 75 n 117 25 e 120 e covers an area of 18 112 km2 with the xinglongpo hydrological station at the basin outlet as shown in fig 1 the elevation of the laohahe basin ranges between 2054 m and 427 m above mean sea level with a generally declining trend from southwest to northeast summer is the main rainy season and approximately 60 70 of the annual precipitation occurs during june august runoff in the laohahe basin exhibits the similar seasonality with about 70 of the annual runoff concentrated in june september yong et al 2013 wang et al 2020 similar to other semiarid basins the annual potential evapotranspiration pet of the laohahe basin exceeds annual precipitation and about 60 70 of the annual pet focus on april august sunshine duration an insolation variable closely related to pet shows a similar seasonality with pet i e the sunshine hours in march august are significant higher than those in other months in this study we selected 11 catchments fig 1 including seven headwater catchments from north to south catchments 1 7 independent of each other three midstream catchments catchments 8 10 indicated with the red solid line boundaries in fig 1 and the whole basin i e catchment 11 including all the sub catchments table 1 lists the geographic and hydrological information of these 11 catchments the ranges of average annual precipitation and runoff in these catchments are 390 580 mm and 20 120 mm respectively with a gradual declining trend from south catchments 4 7 to north catchments 1 3 and 8 11 it is worth noting that jiang et al 2011 found that human activities were the main factors with contributions of 89 93 contributing to the runoff decrease in the laohahe basin after 1979 and recent studies shows the decreasing trend of runoff in this basin is continuing yong et al 2013 liu et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 2 2 data source the data used in this study mainly consists of three parts hydro meteorological data agricultural and industrial production data and remote sensing inversion and reanalysis data 1 monthly precipitation data measured by 52 rain gauges monthly streamflow data measured by 11 hydrological stations and monthly meteorological data measured by 7 meteorological stations including maximum mean and minimum air temperatures wind speed and insolation from 1964 to 2016 were provided by the water resources department of the inner mongolia autonomous region precipitation data were interpolated through the inverse distance weighting idw method to calculate the areal average of precipitation in each catchment meteorological data were interpolated through the idw method to calculate the areal average of pet though the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 whilst corresponding actual evaporation was calculated through water balance equation yong et al 2013 huang et al 2017 moreover monthly streamflow were divided by the catchment area to get the runoff areal average depth in each catchment shukla and wood 2008 wu et al 2018 to compare with the precipitation and pet annual human water use data of each catchment during 2006 2016 and information of three large reservoirs were also provided by the water resources department of the inner mongolia autonomous region 2 agricultural and industrial production data for the laohahe basin during 1964 2016 including the annual food production number of livestock irrigated area and gross industrial product gip were collected from the local statistical bureau website http tjj chifeng gov cn these data are selected to reflect the temporal changes of the degree of human agricultural and industrial activities in the laohahe basin during the entire study period 1964 2016 3 remote sensing inversion and reanalysis data used in this study and their detail information are listed in table 2 large scale climate indices i e annual enso pdo ao and sunspot data were applied in this study to investigate the impact of climate change on drought propagation surface soil moisture and grace data were used to analyse the surface soil moisture and terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa of the study area grid remote sensing inversion and reanalysis data sets including land use population density gdp density and night light density were collected to analyse the human influence on the study area and then to support for the selection of natural catchments 3 methodology in this study we proposed an observation based natural and human impacted catchment comparison method illustrated in fig 2 for assessing the impacts of climate change and human activities on drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought the three steps of the proposed method are described below 1 selection of natural catchments the first step focuses on the selection of natural catchments a preliminary knowledge of the hydrological regime changes in each catchment can be identified based on the results of mmk trend analyses and change point tests of annual precipitation pet and runoff during the entire research period in addition the precipitation runoff double cumulative curve dcc reflects the consistency of precipitation and runoff series and is helpful to identify change points visually note that based on previous studies wang et al 2020 jiang et al 2019 van loon and van lanen 2013 the entire research period is usually divided into two parts by the first change point for further comparison schemes design undisturbed period the period before the change point and disturbed period the period after the change point furthermore socio economic indicators including average population gdp and night light density and land use data for each catchment are collected and then are used to calculate human influence scores through an indicator system finally according to the analysis results of trend and change point of hydro meteorological variables human influence scores and reservoir information all the studied catchments can be divided into two types natural catchments and human impacted catchments 2 calculation of drought propagation characteristics the second step is the calculation of drought propagation characteristics including drought duration severity and propagation time run theory is first used to identify drought duration and severity of spi and sri at different timescales e g spi x and sri x x 1 3 12 months in addition a comparison between sri and spi provides an indication of the time taken for precipitation deficits to propagate through the hydrological cycle to hydrological drought barker et al 2016 in this study spi accumulation periods of 1 48 months spi n n 1 2 48 months and sri 1 time series were cross correlated using the pcc to investigate the most appropriate propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought the spi accumulation period with the strongest correlation with sri 1 was regarded as the appropriate drought propagation time where sri 1 was most strongly correlated with short spi accumulation periods the propagation time was also short and vice versa 3 assessment of the impacts of different factors on drought propagation in the final step different comparison schemes as shown in step 3 in fig 2 are designed to assess the impacts of climate change and human activities on drought propagation in comparison ⅰ propagation time of natural and human impacted catchments during the undisturbed period are compared to investigate the similarity of drought propagation pattern in these two types of catchments in comparison ii for a natural catchment the difference of drought propagation time between undisturbed and disturbed periods can reflect the impact of climate change on drought propagation under the condition that the underlying surface properties e g catchment area soil types vegetation types etc remain approximately unchanged in comparison iii natural and human impacted catchments are all affected by climate change in the disturbed period and differences in propagation characteristics between natural and human impacted catchments should be attributed to effects of human activities the concept underlying this approach and the methods used are described in detail in the following sections 3 1 trend and change point analysis 3 1 1 modified mann kendall mmk trend test method the traditional mann kendall mk trend test method recommended by the world meteorological organization is a widely used nonparametric method for trend tests of time series however hamed and rao 1998 found that the persistence of hydro meteorological series impacts the robustness of the mk test results then they used lag i autocorrelation to remove the persistence to make the test result more reliable and robust which is known as the modified mann kendall mmk trend test method in this study therefore we adopted the mmk method to identify the trend of the spi and sri series the detailed computational processes can be found in hamed and rao 1998 and huang et al 2015 3 1 2 change point test methods the pettitt test pettitt 1979 is a widely used nonparametric test method to determine a change point of hydro meteorological variable time series at a given significance level e g α 0 05 this approach is based on rank statistics and considers a time series as two samples represented by x1 x2 xt and xt 1 xn n is the length of the time series the pettitt indices ut n can be calculated as follows 1 u t n j 1 t i 1 n sgn x j x i t 1 2 n where 2 sgn θ 1 θ 0 0 θ 0 1 θ 0 then we can calculate the series of probabilities of change points for each time step 3 p 1 exp 6 u t n 2 n 3 n 2 in addition to the pettitt test the heuristic segmentation method and the precipitation runoff double cumulative curve dcc method were applied in this study to ensure robustness of the change point test results the heuristic segmentation method proposed by bernaola galvan et al 2001 is developed on the basis of the sliding t test and has been widely used to identify change points of nonlinear and non stationary time series because the detailed calculation processes of the method are well introduced in bernaola galvan et al 2001 and huang et al 2015 they are omitted in this study for the sake of brevity the precipitation and runoff double cumulative curve dcc method can visually illustrate the consistency of precipitation and runoff data jiang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 generally a change in the gradient of the curve may infer that the characteristics of precipitation or runoff have changed and the inflection point of the curve is generally regarded as a change point 3 2 establishment of an indicator system for accessing human influence in the proposed method as shown in step 1 in fig 2 we selected four representative socio economic indicator data sets to analyse human influence including gdp population night light density data sets and land use data set listed in table 2 firstly gdp and population density data sets can intuitively reflect the economic activities and human settlement conditions respectively so they are often used to evaluate the intensity of regional human impacts woolmer et al 2008 yue et al 2014 secondly remotely sensed night time lights dataset is widely used to characterize trends in urban sprawl over time and can monitor dynamics in human settlement and economic activity at regional to global scales ma et al 2012 finally the proportion of cropland and urban land is closely related to agriculture residential and industrial development and is also usually used to reflect the degree of human influence in the basin li et al 2020 wang et al 2020 based on the above four data sets an indicator system is built to quantify human influence and then to support for the division of natural and human impacted catchments in this indicator system we used a method similar to that of sanderson et al 2002 and woolmer et al 2008 to combine the four datasets we express each dataset as overlaying grids at a resolution of about 1 square kilometre km2 and scored each dataset to reflect their contribution to human influence sum of the scores of all indicators are the human influence index hi these scoring criteria are based on published scientific studies as summarized in table 3 higher scores indicate greater human influence and vice versa the areal average hi scores of each catchment can be calculated as follows 4 h i k i 1 n h i i n where hik means the areal average hi score of a catchment k 1 2 11 hii means the hi score of a grid cell in the catchment n is the total number of grids in the catchment 3 3 drought calculation 3 3 1 nonparametric standardized drought index for standardized drought index parametric distribution functions are commonly adopted to fit the probability distribution of hydro meteorological variables including precipitation soil moisture and runoff then the cumulative probability is converted to the cumulative distribution function cdf of the standard normal distribution finally the standardized index si value is calculated through the inverse of the standard normal distribution farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 huang et al 2015 for the nonparametric standardized drought index the empirical probability that is distribution free can replace the cumulative probability to derive a nonparametric si without having to assume representative parametric distributions here we take a runoff series x x 1 x 2 x n as an example to derive its probability distribution 5 p x i i 0 44 n 0 12 where i is the rank of the runoff value xi from the smallest n is the sample size of the runoff series and p xi is the corresponding empirical probability the outputs of eq 5 can be transformed to a si as follows 6 si ϕ 1 p where ϕ is the standard normal distribution function and p is the probability derived from eq 5 more detailed calculation processes of nonparametric standardized drought indicators can be found in farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 one advantage of the si is its ability to investigate drought at different timescales in this study different timescales of nonparametric standardized precipitation index spi x and standardized runoff index sri x were calculated to describe short or long term meteorological and hydrological drought for example spi 3 and sri 12 denote a 3 month precipitation accumulation period and a 12 month runoff accumulation period respectively wu et al 2018 the drought grade is divided into five levels based on previous studies vicente serrano et al 2012 spi or sri 0 1 spi 0 1 5 spi 1 0 2 0 spi 1 5 and spi 2 which correspond to no drought mild drought moderate drought severe drought and extreme drought respectively 3 3 2 run theory in run theory proposed by yevjevich 1967 drought events are defined as a period where indicator values are continuously below a certain threshold huang et al 2015 wu et al 2018 so a threshold level tl of 0 is selected in this study to determine drought conditions the calculation process of these characteristics is as follows using spi as an example the drought state ds is given by 7 ds t 1 for s p i t t l 0 for s p i t t l the drought severity s per time step is defined by 8 s t t l s p i for d s t 1 0 for d s t 0 the drought duration d and severity s for drought event i are calculated with 9 d i t f i l i d s t 10 s i t f i l i s t where spi t is the spi value at a given time t tl is the threshold level in this study we set the tl to 0 ds t is a binary variable indicating if drought occurs at a given time t di is the drought duration of event i si is the total drought severity of event i and fi and li are the first and last time steps of event i 3 4 correlation analysis 3 4 1 pearson correlation coefficient the pearson correlation coefficient pcc developed by pearson 1895 has been widely used throughout hydrological correlation analyses in this study we used the pcc to identify the correlation between the sri and the spi at different timescales according to previous studies barker et al 2016 wu et al 2018 the spi accumulation period with the strongest pcc is used as an indicator for drought propagation the pcc is calculated as follows 11 pcc i 1 n φ i φ ω i ω i 1 n φ i φ 2 i 1 n ω i ω 2 i 1 2 n where φ i and ω i denote two time series and φ and ω denote the average values of the two series the pcc ranges from 1 to 1 where 1 0 and 1 indicate total positive linear correlation no linear correlation and total negative linear correlation respectively 3 4 2 cross wavelet analysis cross wavelet analysis hudgins and huang 1996 torrence and compo 1998 is a technique coupled with cross spectrum analysis and wavelet transform this method can effectively identify the correlation between two time series in the time frequency domain the cross wavelet transforms cwt of two specific time series e g xn and yn can be defined as wxy wxwy where denotes their complex conjugation the cross wavelet power can be expressed as wxy and the complex argument arg wxy can be regarded as the local relative phase between xn and yn in the time frequency domain the theoretical distribution of the cross wavelet power of the two time series is defined as follows 12 d w n x s w n y s σ x σ y p z v p v p k x p k y where zv p is the confidence level associated with probability p for a probability distribution function defined by the square root of the product of two χ2 distributions p k x and p k y are background power spectra of time series xn and yn respectively grinsted et al 2004 4 results 4 1 selection of natural catchments fig 3 visually shows the significant changes in the relationship between precipitation and runoff in the 11 selected catchments except for the yswz js and xq catchments fig 3 c d and f the gradients of the runoff accumulation curve were significantly different from those of the precipitation accumulation curve for the remaining eight catchments fig 3 a b e and g k after 1979 and or 1999 furthermore table 4 shows the results of the mmk trend analysis and change point tests of annual precipitation pet and runoff for the 11 selected catchments during the period from 1964 to 2016 expect for pet in the tpz catchment which showed an upward trend pet and precipitation of all the catchments showed a downward trend without reaching a significant level α 0 05 there were also no significant α 0 05 change points in the precipitation and pet series for the 11 catchments different from the above two variables runoff in most catchments showed a significant downward trend α 0 05 except for the yswz js and xq catchments for the eight catchments with significant downward trends in runoff series change points were identified in 1979 through pettitt and heuristic segmentation test methods based on the results of trend and change point analyses we found that the relationship between precipitation and runoff for the yswz js and xq catchments was relatively stable and consistent throughout the entire research period 1964 2016 fig 4 shows the temporal changes of socio economic indicators average population gdp and night light density proportion of cropland and urban land and human influence scores for the catchments in the laohahe basin for the average population density fig 4 a cf tpz and xlp catchments show a slight downward trend during 2000 2015 while the other catchments remain almost unchanged for the average gdp density fig 4 b all catchments show an upward trend but the growth rate of the xlp and cf catchments is significantly faster than that of the remain catchments during 2000 2015 similarly night light density also has an increasing trend for all catchments but cf tpz and xlp catchments are obviously growing faster than the other catchments for the land use situation i e proportion of cropland and urban land during 1980 2015 which are directly related to human activities shows a slight upward trend in xcz xd cf tpz and xlp catchments but remain constant in the other catchments finally the human influence scores which are calculated based on the above four indictors increased rapidly in cf tpz and xlp catchment but increased slowly in remain catchments table 5 indicates that areal average human influence scores of the yswz js and xq catchments during 2000 2015 were the three lowest while those of the other catchments all exceeded these three catchments furthermore fig 5 shows the spatial distributions of socio economic indicators land use data and human influence scores generally all these indicators showed an upward trend from headwater catchments catchments 1 7 i e ctl xjd yswz js xcz xq and dz catchments to midstream catchments catchments 8 10 i e xd cf and tpz catchments and downstream catchments catchment 11 i e xlp catchment in summary combined with results of trend and change points analysis of hydrological variables human influence scores and reservoir information listed in table 5 yswz js and xq catchments can be selected as natural catchments because the three catchments have consistent relationships between precipitation and runoff and are affected by weak human activities i e low human influence scores and no reservoir regulations remain eight catchments are either affected by reservoir regulations or strong human activities i e high human influence scores so they are classified into human impacted catchments meanwhile according to the analysis results of the first change point for each catchment and temporal change of socio economic indicators and land use data the entire research period can be divided into two periods the undisturbed period 1964 1979 and the disturbed period 1980 2016 for further design of comparison scheme 4 2 propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought to identify propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought in the laohahe basin we first used the mmk method to analyse the trends of these two categories of drought during 1964 2016 for 11 catchments in the laohahe basin fig 6 based on the spi and sri measured over 1 3 and 12 month timescales these three timescales represent monthly seasonal and annual drought and can adequately depict the evolution of drought in the study area then drought evolutionary characteristics for the undisturbed and disturbed periods were calculated through run theory including drought duration and severity fig 7 and table 6 in addition the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought was identified by the spi accumulation period spi n most strongly correlated with sri 1 based on the pcc fig 8 and fig 9 4 2 1 trend analysis of meteorological and hydrological drought fig 6 shows the trends of long term spi and sri time series at 1 3 and 12 month scales in 11 catchments in the laohahe basin during the period 1964 2016 all catchments except dz catchment showed downward trends in spi 1 and spi 3 but none of these downward trends were significant fig 6 a and b spi 12 in most catchments except for the js and xcz catchments exhibited significant α 0 05 downward trends fig 6 c with the largest z values for spi 12 in the xd catchment 4 18 for hydrological drought all catchments except yswz js and xq showed significant downward trends α 0 05 in the sri 1 sri 3 and sri 12 time series fig 6 d e xd catchment experienced the worst hydrological drought with z values of 8 79 11 16 and 6 04 for sri 1 sri 3 and sri 12 respectively in general the sri series measured over 1 3 and 12 month time scales showed a clear spatial distribution with stronger downward trends in the midstream and downstream catchments i e xd cf tpz and xlp catchments than in the headwater catchments i e ctl xjd yswz js xcz xq and dz catchments 4 2 2 evolutionary characteristics of meteorological and hydrological drought as shown in fig 7 drought severity calculated from spi 3 and sri 3 series are selected as an example to show drought propagation characteristics during different periods in the undisturbed period for each catchment except xq ctl and xjd average drought severity calculated from of spi 3 series fig 7 a was larger than that calculated from of sri 3 series fig 7 c the largest drought severity were in the ctl 10 38 and xq 9 20 catchments for spi 3 and sri 3 respectively for the disturbed period however drought severity was larger for hydrological drought fig 7 d than meteorological drought fig 7 b across all human impacted catchments in the laohahe basin for example the average drought severity calculated from sri 3 in disturbed period was 13 1 in the xlp catchment but that calculated from spi 3 in the same catchment was only 2 2 with a six fold difference between the two values furthermore table 6 shows the difference in average drought characteristics calculated from spi 3 and sri 3 series between undisturbed and disturbed periods for all catchments meteorological drought measured by spi 3 had no significant change between undisturbed and disturbed periods for all catchments differences in the average meteorological drought duration and severity between the two periods were 0 8 and 0 5 for natural catchments 2 1 and 8 9 for human impacted catchments i and 2 6 and 7 8 for human impacted catchments ii respectively however for hydrological drought the average drought duration and severity during the disturbed period were significant higher than those during the undisturbed period in particular increases of 114 6 and 110 7 for drought duration and severity in human impacted catchments i and 193 2 and 518 8 for those in human impacted catchments ii were higher than those for natural catchments i e 47 4 and 43 8 therefore hydrological drought of human impacted catchments in the laohahe basin was influenced not only by climate change e g precipitation and temperature but also by human activities e g human water withdrawal reservoir regulations and land use and cover change 4 3 propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought to investigate the most appropriate accumulation period for propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought the sri 1 series was cross correlated with the spi series at various timescales spanning 1 48 months fig 8 all the catchments were divided into three groups according to catchment area to avoid its impact on drought propagation as shown in table 5 the first and second groups include the three natural catchments i e yswz js and xq catchments fig 8 a and d and three human impacted catchments i e xjd xcz and dz catchments fig 8 b and e because all their catchment area are 2000 km2 remain catchments are classed into the third group fig 8 c and f because all their catchments are 2000 km2 the pcc for natural catchments during the undisturbed period fig 8 a increased rapidly and reached the maximum value in the range of 11 15 months the highest pccs for the yswz js and xq catchments were 0 72 0 75 and 0 70 respectively and the corresponding propagation times were 12 12 and 14 months respectively for human impacted catchments i during the undisturbed period xcz dz and xjd catchments reached the maximum pcc value in the range of 6 13 months fig 8 b and the maximum pcc values for human impacted catchments ii were concentrated in the range of 8 13 months fig 8 c with the highest pcc varying from 0 36 to 0 59 in the disturbed period the most appropriate accumulation periods for drought propagation time in natural catchments concentrated in the range of 7 12 months fig 8 d for the human impacted catchments the pcc values of the xcz dz and xjd catchments reached the maximum value in the range of 9 13 months fig 8 e while remain catchments reached the highest pcc values in the range of 17 24 months fig 8 f in addition fig 9 shows the seasonal variability in the drought propagation time and the corresponding strongest pcc values during undisturbed and disturbed periods for natural catchments i e yswz js and xq propagation times in spring march may and summer june august during undisturbed times were relatively consistent with those during the disturbed period however the propagation times in autumn september november and winter december february during the disturbed period were shorter than those during the undisturbed period which result in that the drought propagation time during the disturbed period is shorter than that in the undisturbed period for human impacted catchments i e the remaining eight catchments except in summer propagation times in the other three seasons were longer for the disturbed period than for the undisturbed period therefore increases in propagation times during disturbed period for human impacted catchments were mainly concentrated in spring autumn and winter 4 4 impact of climate change and human activities on drought propagation in this study we designed three comparisons to reveal the impacts of climate change and human activities on drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought fig 2 and table 7 first of all we compared the propagation time of natural and human impacted catchments during the undisturbed period in comparison ⅰ the differences between natural and human impacted i catchments for the mean median and maximum drought propagation time are 3 3 and 2 months respectively and the above differences between natural and human impacted ii catchments are 2 1 and 2 months respectively indicating that drought propagation patterns of all catchments in laohahe basin are generally consistent then the drought propagation time of natural catchments between the undisturbed and disturbed periods was compared in comparison ⅱ to reflect the influence of climate change on drought propagation the results revealed that the average median and maximum drought propagation times in the natural catchments during the disturbed period were reduced by approximately 3 months indicating that drought propagation is accelerating under the influence of climate change finally in comparison iii the propagation time of human impacted catchments was compared with those of natural catchments during the disturbed period the former was influenced by climate change and human activities and the latter was influenced by climate change only difference between them can reveal the impacts of human activities on the drought propagation process the mean median and maximum values of the propagation time for human impacted i catchments increased by approximately 2 2 and 1 months respectively and the above increase for human impacted ii catchments are 12 11 and 12 months indicating that human activities significantly disturb and delay natural drought propagation processes of the midstream and downstream catchments i e xd cf tpz and xlp catchments during disturbed periods 5 discussion 5 1 rationality analysis of the natural and human impacted catchment comparison method under the background of global change we need to improve our understanding of the impacts of different factors on drought propagation these processes can be deeply explored through observation based data in this study we proposed the natural and human impacted catchment comparison method which selects natural catchments though analysis of hydrological variations as well as statistics analysis of human influence based on an indicator system more importantly it used only observation data to analyse the impacts of climate change and human activities on drought propagation which can improve the accuracy of the impact assessment on the one hand the selection results of natural catchments in the laohahe basin were consistent with previous studies yong et al 2013 found that the yswz and js catchments had no significant change points in runoff based on the pettitt test and dcc method wang et al 2020 selected the xq catchment as a natural catchment to analyse the uncertainty of hydrological models because it has a consistent relationship between precipitation and runoff therefore the natural catchments selected in this study including the yswz js and xq catchments were reasonable on the other hand the analysis of the impacts of climate change and human activities on drought propagation in this study were also consistent with other studies jiang et al 2019 liu et al 2016 barker et al 2016 lópez moreno et al 2013 liu et al 2009 han et al 2019 pointed out that the phase transformation and amplitude fluctuation of pdo and enso are obviously enhanced in the 21st century which intensifies the changes in meteorological elements such as temperature precipitation and evaporation and then accelerates the propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought for human influence lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 stated that human activities have significantly altered the natural hydrological response e g hydrological drought to meteorological droughts delaying the response of hydrological drought to precipitation deficits over long timescales thus the results obtained by the proposed method are consistent with previous studies i e climate change tends to accelerate drought propagation and human influence tends to delay drought propagation in the laohahe basin furthermore the proposed method provides a new idea for the selection of natural catchments i e using an indicator system that involving socio economic indices to quantify human influence and combining its results with hydrological variation results to support catchment division with the increasing development of earth observation technology a large number of remote sensing inversion and reanalysis data sets have appeared tapley et al 2004 theobald et al 2010 small et al 2011 ma et al 2012 yue et al 2014 perkl et al 2016 sheffield et al 2017 these data sets provide new reference indicators that is socio economic attributes e g population and gdp density and land use situation for catchment division in addition to the traditional hydrological attributes therefore when it is difficult to use exciting methods to select natural catchments the proposed method may be a good supplement or choice for example when we cannot find suitable paired catchments using the paired catchments comparison method or want to remove the concern of variations across paired catchments the proposed method can be used to determine natural and human impacted catchments more importantly different comparison schemes in the proposed method can identify the changes of drought propagation process in different types of catchments natural or human impacted catchment which are equally important for water resource managers for natural catchments understanding the changes of drought propagation due to climate change is helpful to the improvement of drought prediction huang et al 2017 han et al 2019 aghakouchak et al 2021 for human impacted catchments realizing that changes of drought propagation pattern caused by human influence is important for water resource managers to adjust water resources allocation to cope with the possible water supply crisis and ecological crisis caused by the above changes van loon et al 2016 apurv and cai 2020 aghakouchak et al 2021 in general the case study results in laohahe basin proved that the proposed method is an effective tool for selection of natural catchments and assessing climatic and anthropogenic influences on drought propagation and can be applied to other regions as well to improve drought prediction and regional water resources management 5 2 possible factors influencing drought propagation 5 2 1 influence of teleconnection factors on drought propagation in comparison ii as shown in fig 2 and table 7 the results showed that climate change accelerates the drought propagation in natural catchment and recent studies have found that large scale atmospheric circulation anomalies which are closely related to climate change may have impacts on the drought propagation time huang et al 2017 meanwhile evaporation plays an important role in the drought propagation process from meteorological to hydrological drought han et al 2019 thus wavelet cross analysis was applied to analyse the correlations between the actual evaporation in a natural catchment i e js catchment and teleconnection factors i e enso ao pdo and sunspots series during 1964 2016 fig 10 the results showed that actual evaporation had significant positive linkages with enso events fig 10 a with periods of 3 7 years during 1985 2005 and pdo events fig 10 c with periods of 4 7 years and 8 12 years during 1990 2000 at the 95 confidence level moreover actual evaporation had strong negative correlations with ao and sunspots specifically it exhibited a negative correlation with ao with periods of 8 10 years during 1980 1995 and a strong negative correlation with sunspots with periods of 7 14 years during 1973 2005 therefore large scale atmospheric circulation anomalies show strong linkages with actual evaporation during the disturbed period 1980 2016 thus strongly affecting the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought in this period these findings are similar to those from other studies huang et al 2017 han et al 2019 and closely related to the changes of drought propagation time in natural catchments during the disturbed period 5 2 2 impact of human factors on drought propagation in the comparison iii as shown in fig 2 and table 7 the results showed that human activities including economic development reservoir construction and land use and cover change significantly altered and then delayed the drought propagation time firstly population and economic development have significant impacts on drought propagation as shown in fig 4 a c population density of the two highly industrialized human impacted catchments i e cf and xlp catchments reached approximately 200 persons km2 and gdp and night light density of these two catchments increased rapidly after 2000 more intuitively fig 11 a shows that in 2006 2016 the total annual human water withdrawal of the human impacted catchments account for more than half of the natural runoff for the laohahe basin and the highest proportion is approximately 80 except for the xjd catchment all the human impacted catchments were directly impacted by human water withdrawal thus sustained increase of domestic water and industrial water for economic development causes serious loss of surface water and then extends the response times of hydrological drought to meteorological drought reservoir constructions and regulations might be another factor affecting drought propagation for example the dahushi reservoir located in dz catchment with a storage capacity of 1 2 108 m3 focused on agricultural irrigation and usually maintained storage in spring autumn and winter and then released water in summer to guarantee agriculture irrigation yong et al 2013 ren et al 2014 jiang et al 2021 these seasonal regulations are closely related to the shifts of seasonal pattern of drought propagation as shown in fig 9 except for summer june july and august drought propagation time of the other seasons in human impacted catchments e g ctl xd cf tpz and xlp become longer for disturbed period than for undisturbed period indicating that reservoir regulations modifies the response pattern of hydrological drought to meteorological drought in different seasons and tends to smooth the impacts of meteorological drought over a longer time scale in addition to economic development and reservoir regulations land use change and intensification of agriculture activities may also impacted drought propagation as shown in fig 4 d compared with the three natural catchments i e yswz xq and js remain eight human impacted catchments have a higher proportion of cropland and urban land especially the midstream and downstream catchment e g cf tpz and xlp catchments the proportion of cropland and urban land for the tpz catchment increased from 55 in 1980 to 60 in 2015 and that for cf catchment increased from 46 in 1980 to 50 in 2015 in addition fig 11 b shows that agriculture production data including irrigated area livestock and food production and the gip have a substantial increase during the disturbed period 1980 2016 and fig 11 c shows that surface soil moisture increases significantly after 2000 which is closely related to the large scale intensive agricultural irrigation activities thus increase of area of cropland and intensification of agriculture production activities consume a large amount of surface water leading to a sharp decrease in river runoff which in turn delays the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought finally terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa data were used to reveal the changes in total water resources in the laohahe basin fig 11 d water storage in the laohahe basin declined significantly during 2003 2016 especially after 2007 0 63 cm a and the largest negative anomaly reached approximately 16 cm year approximately equal to 6 times the average annual runoff of the laohahe basin in general human activities such as socio economic development e g population gdp and night light density reservoir constructions and regulations and land use change have significantly modified the total amount and temporal distribution of the surface runoff in the laohahe basin which in turn lead a delayed and more sustained response of hydrological drought to meteorological drought 5 3 uncertainties and limitations the results demonstrated that the proposed method is a suitable tool to analyse the impacts of climate change and human activities on drought propagation however this approach still has some uncertainties most observation based methods have uncertainties with regard to temporal or spatial resolution and data quality rangecroft et al 2019 limitations in the accuracy of hydrometric gauges particularly during low flows and the evolution of hydrological stations over time mean that it is often difficult to have an accurate homogeneous flow record margariti et al 2019 which creates uncertainty and then influences the calculation accuracy of meteorological and hydrological droughts however it has been recognized that the benefit of using these longer records for our analysis outweighs the disadvantages of uncertain hydrometric accuracy besides many previous studies have proven that the drought propagation time is closely linked with climate and catchment properties e g land use and soil types barker et al 2016 van loon and laaha 2015 even if the selected natural catchments and human impacted catchments are distributed in the same basin differences in climate and catchment properties still bring some uncertainties to the comparison results nevertheless comparison ⅰ fig 2 in the proposed method is used to assess the similarity of drought propagation pattern in different sub catchments comparison results fig 8 a c indicated that in the undisturbed period the drought propagation time of natural catchments is close to that of human impacted catchments which means that differences in climate and catchment properties for the selected catchments did not cause significant differences in the drought propagation time meanwhile it is worth noting that directly comparing the drought propagation characteristics of the two periods before and after the change point in natural catchments to quantify the impacts of climate change may also bring uncertainties because climate change is a gradual changing process its impact on drought propagation may continuously increase since the beginning of the study period stochastic weather generator semenov 2008 wilks and wilby 1999 will be a good choice to solve the gradually changing weather patterns for its strong advantage of generating long time series of weather variables with statistical properties identical to those of observed series sohrabi et al 2021 in future research we can use the stochastic weather generator to simulate the weather variables in the disturbed period the period after the change point based on the those in the undisturbed period the period before the change point so as to ensure that the statistical characteristics of the two series are the same then the corresponding drought propagation characteristics under the observed and simulated weather conditions in the disturbed period can be compared to quantify the impacts of climate change in this period in addition to the uncertainty there are some limitations to this approach firstly this method needs specific and numerous data to divide natural and human impacted catchments long time series of hydrological data are needed to identify whether there are change points in hydrological processes more specific land use data and socio economic indicators based on remote sensing inversion and reanalysis i e gdp population and night light density are needed to quantify human influence to support for the selection of natural catchments however the above data are not always available or known van loon et al 2019 wang et al 2020 moreover because monthly data e g precipitation and streamflow were used the baseflow separation is not considered in this study which will also affect the study results so we suggest when using the proposed approach in other regions it is necessary to separate runoff from baseflow based on data with shorter time scale e g daily data to ensure the accuracy of the results secondly it remains difficult to select natural catchments using this indicator system for catchment with more complex situation thus other indicators representing human activities can be developed in future studies and then appropriately applied to the index system so as to provide a more accurate selection li et al 2020 meanwhile there is another challenge i e how to comprehensively consider various types of indicators to characterize the influence of human activities and apply them in the selection of natural catchments because subjective choices might lead to the deviation of the selection results sanderson et al 2002 woolmer et al 2008 in this study different indicators were scored based on the existing researches as shown in table 3 and then the catchments were divided according to the results of hi and hydrological variation analysis in the future research more case studies on the indicator system are needed to make the division criteria e g threshold of hi more reasonable and objective in view of the benefits and limitations we suggest that when using this method in other regions the selection of socio economic indicators and setting of threshold of hi should be modified and improved appropriately according to specific situation of the catchment itself and the types of human activities furthermore the approach can be used for a first estimate of the human influence to guide campaigns to collect more data and to complement other existing methods e g large scale screening paired catchments and observation modelling approaches 6 conclusions in this study we proposed an observation based natural and human impacted catchment comparison method for separating the effects of climate change and human activities on drought propagation the main parts of this method are the selection of natural catchments and the comparison of natural and human impacted situations in different periods first observed data i e hydro meteorological data as well as land use data and socio economic indicators based on remote sensing inversion and reanalysis are used to select natural catchments then three comparisons can be performed to separate the effects of climate change and human activities on drought propagation i e comparison ⅰ during the undisturbed period to analyse the consistency of drought propagation pattern in natural and human impacted catchments comparison ⅱ between the disturbed and undisturbed periods to identify the possible influence of climate change and comparison iii during the disturbed period to investigate human impacts the combination of these three comparison schemes to separate the effects of climate change and human activities on drought propagation is the innovative part of this research we demonstrate the application of the proposed natural and human impacted catchment comparison method in a heavily human influenced basin in northeast china i e the laohahe basin in this basin we found that human activities caused longer hydrological drought durations and larger hydrological drought severities during the disturbed period with average increases of 163 7 and 365 9 respectively furthermore comparison results revealed that climate change accelerated the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought in the laohahe basin shortening it by approximately 3 months human activities however disturbed and then delayed the natural propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought extending it by 11 12 months the proposed natural and human impacted catchment comparison method gives water managers a suitable tool to divide natural and human impacted catchments based on hydrological and socio economic data and then to investigate how climatic and anthropogenic influences alter drought propagation through different comparison schemes this is critical for improving drought prediction and establishing a drought management system credit authorship

4158,a multiscalar standardized terrestrial water storage index sti is proposed to assess global hydrological droughts in this study sti is defined as the standardized statistical deviation of terrestrial water storage tws measured by grace to the climatology at multiple time scales because of the statistical nature of its definition the proposed index is comparable to other standardized drought indices in different time scales e g standardized precipitation index spi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei across different regions at multiple time scales our comparisons of sti with multiscalar drought indices i e spi and spei and uni scalar indices i e self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi standardized soil moisture index sm z standardized

hydrological droughts and vegetation changes keywords hydrological droughts terrestrial water storage grace meteorological droughts drought indices 1 introduction droughts are one of the most devastating natural hazards that have caused enormous economic losses and causality in the society chou et al 2018 kogan 1997 ma et al 2017 musolino et al 2018 historical observations and model simulations of various hydrological variables such as precipitation soil moisture and discharge have shown drying trends in many areas of the world over the past decades trenberth et al 2014 gu et al 2019 li et al 2013 2016 the drying trends are expected to continue and become more frequent and extreme under the future climate due to the changes in precipitation and increases in evaporation dai 2011 meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic droughts constitute four common categories of drought indices rodell et al 2018 standardized precipitation index spi one of the most popularly used meteorological drought indices defines drought as the relative deficit of precipitation compared to the long term climatology hayes et al 1999 kumar et al 2016 mckee et al 1993 as a multiscalar drought index which can reflect accumulative dryness in short e g monthly or long duration e g yearly spi at long time scales is usually associated with hydrological droughts i e shortage of surface water resources such as river discharges soil moisture and groundwater vicente serrano et al 2010a however such implicit estimations of drought conditions in surface hydrological variables are neither direct measurements of deficit in surface hydrological conditions nor drought assessments with comprehensive consideration of the complex hydrological processes to measure hydrological droughts in situ observations of hydrological variables such as streamflow surface water soil moisture and groundwater levels are required to estimate water deficit but such observations are usually much more limited in temporal and spatial coverages than meteorological variables furthermore direct measurements of surface hydrological variables are mostly at the point scale and often inconsistent and inconsecutive to evaluate changes in hydrological droughts at a global scale chen et al 2009 shahid and hazarika 2010 taylor et al 2009 still it remains challenging to obtain a whole set of high quality hydrological data e g surface water soil moisture and groundwater at reasonable temporal and spatial coverages to evaluate global hydrological droughts jin et al 2014 satellite data provides

index li et al 2018 the grace groundwater drought index thomas et al 2017 and the drought severity index dsi zhao et al 2017a b the existing grace based drought indices are defined at a fixed time scale which makes them difficult to reflect the multiscalar characteristics of droughts as the commonly used standardized indices such as spi and spei the multi types of hydrological components that constitute tws e g groundwater soil moisture surface water snow and ice respond to changes in meteorological variables at different time scales de jager and vogt 2015 lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 mishra et al 2009 moreover the impacts of droughts on society and ecosystems are multiscalar for instance vegetation growth is not just sensitive to hydrological components in one month but also influenced by the accumulative dry wet conditions of these components in the past months chen et al 2020 ma et al 2021 vicente serrano et al 2013 different vegetation species are sensitive to droughts in various time scales hossain and li 2021 therefore a multiscalar drought index based on tws will provide an important tool to evaluate the development and characteristics of hydrological droughts at different time scales furthermore standardized drought indices are defined as statistical deficit of hydrometeorological variables e g precipitation for spi and differences of precipitation and evapotranspiration for spei since the existing grace based drought indices are defined based on different logics and algorithms like the arithmetics utilized by the total storage deficit index and dsi nie et al 2018 zhao et al 2017a b they may not be directly comparable to the standardized indices therefore in this study we propose a new multiscalar standardized terrestrial water storage index sti based on the tws measurements from the grace satellite to assess global hydrological droughts sti is defined as the statistical deviation of tws and therefore it is directly comparable to other standardized drought indices across different regions at multiple time scales to assess the performance of the proposed sti we first compare the spatial distributions and temporal variations of sti with multiscalar standardized meteorological drought indices spi and spei the relationships of the sti and spi spei across different time scales are analyzed second sti is compared with four uni scalar drought indices namely self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi standardized soil moisture index sm z standardized runoff index r z and grace based dsi the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is hence used to evaluate the performance of sti and other drought indices in capturing vegetation variations affected by changes in water availability 2 data and methods 2 1 data grace records provide tws observations with extensive spatial coverage at a global scale the grace data has been widely used in the fields of hydrology to evaluate changes in water availability evapotranspiration ice sheets water balance of aquifers etc gleeson et al 2012 hu et al 2019 kidd et al 2014 long et al 2013 pan et al 2017 rodell et al 2018 in this study the gridded grace release 06 rl06 mascon data at the 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution processed by the center for space research csr at the university of texas austin is used to calculate the proposed hydrological drought index http www2 csr utexas edu grace rl06 mascons html here the grace data from april 2002 to june 2017 which overlaps the span of precipitation and temperature data utilized in the study pretreatment procedures such as replacement of the c20 coefficients with satellite laser ranging analysis rectification of geocenter anomalies based on reference and correction of glacial isostatic adjustment have been conducted before the dataset was released cheng and tapley 2004 jacob et al 2012 save et al 2016 swenson et al 2008 compared to other grace solutions csr grace mascon data has the advantages of avoiding north south stripe error and capturing all signals in the allowed noise level of grace 1b measurements save et al 2016 the spatial resolution of csr is higher than other grace solutions in this study the grace data of land grid cells are considered the mean value of the adjacent months in the same year is used to fill the missing gap of grace precipitation and temperature data of the climatic research unit cru ts version 4 03 http data ceda ac uk badc cru data cru ts cru ts 4 03 are obtained from the uk national centre to calculate spi and spei harris et al 2014 jones et al 2012 this dataset was derived from rain gauge observations of the world meteorological organization and other administrations the discontinuity problems in regions such as northern russia north africa and the amazon basin have been resolved in this new version furthermore compared to other datasets the cru dataset has relatively longer temporal coverage at the monthly scale from january 1901 to december 2018 and a higher spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 and therefore the dataset has been widely used in previous studies philipona et al 2005 sheffield et al 2012 sun et al 2018 vicente serrano et al 2010a comparisons between cru ts precipitation and other datasets have been conducted in different regions of the world such as china the iberian peninsula and the caribbean belo pereira et al 2011 hu et al 2018 jones et al 2016 zhu et al 2018 these assessment studies indicated that the cru precipitation dataset has good agreement with in situ observations shi et al 2017 zhao and fu 2006 furthermore the global soil moisture version 2 dataset during 2002 2017 is obtained from the climate prediction center cpc this monthly mean soil moisture data with a 1 6 meter column at a 0 5 0 5 resolution can be accessed via https psl noaa gov data gridded data cpcsoil html van den dool 2003 a global gridded runoff dataset grun from 2002 to 2014 at a 0 5 0 5 resolution is acquired from the eth zurich https www research collection ethz ch handle 20 500 11850 381388 ghiggi et al 2019 this gridded runoff dataset was developed based on the in situ runoff observations from the global runoff data centre grdc reference dataset grdc 2021 2 2 standardized precipitation index spi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei spi and spei are two commonly used multiscale standardized meteorological drought indices based on the probabilistic behaviors of meteorological variables spi considers the deficit of precipitation only because spi is relatively less data and computation demanding it has been widely used for drought evaluation as well as for validation of other drought indices e g kumar et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 for example cao et al 2015 employed spi to assess the performance of a grace total storage deficit index in this study spi is computed from cru ts precipitation based on the following equation in mckee et al 1993 1 spi m i φ 1 f x m i where m m 1 3 6 36 months is the time scale i represents a month in a year e g january february x m i represents the m month accumulative precipitation of month i f is the cumulative distribution function of the gamma function which is employed to fit the time series of m month accumulative precipitation total x m and φ 1 is the inverse of the standard normal cumulative distribution function we also use spei a meteorological index that considers both atmospheric water supply and demand to compare the proposed tws based index van loon et al 2017 spei also has been used to validate other drought indices in previous studies for example zhao et al zhao et al 2017a used spei to evaluate their proposed grace drought severity index we calculate spei based on the algorithms of vicente serrano et al 2010a potential evapotranspiration pet is estimated based on the thornthwaite equation thornthwaite 1948 following vicente serrano et al 2010a 2010b the difference mm between precipitation p and pet is 2 d p p e t for different time scales m m 1 3 6 36 months the cumulative value of month i for m month time scale is defined by follows 3 d m i p m i pet m i hence spei at time scale m is calculated as follows 4 spei m i φ 1 f d m i where f is the cumulative distribution function of a log logistic distribution fitted for the accumulative d time series and φ 1 is the inverse function of the standard normal distribution 2 3 self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi the scpdsi is able to overcome the inconsistent characteristics of pdsi in different locations and make the spatial comparisons affected by diverse climate regimes more appropriate wells et al 2004 van der schrier et al 2013 the scpdsi index is more accurate than pdsi in reporting the frequencies of extreme wet dry conditions and has been widely used in the global drought measurement especially the drought events affected by soil moisture sousa et al 2011 trnka et al 2009 the scpdsi used here is provided by cru with a 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution https crudata uea ac uk cru data drought which was calculated based on the cru ts 4 03 monthly precipitation and temperature the scpdsi value is divided into nine categories as shown in table 1 2 4 standardized soil moisture index sm z the uni scalar standardized soil moisture index sm z is used in this study to represent the wet and dry conditions of soil moisture the cpc soil moisture version 2 dataset during 2002 2017 is utilized to calculate sm z to make better comparisons to other indices in this study gridded data interpolated into a 0 25 0 25 resolution by the bilinear interpolation method then each new interpolated cell is standardized by z score statistical method y x x σ where x and σ represent the mean and standard deviation of soil moisture of each cell respectively and y refers to sm z mu et al 2013 zhao et al 2017a 2 5 standardized runoff index r z the uni scalar standardized runoff index r z is used in this study to characterise the wet and dry conditions of runoff nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 vicente serrano et al 2012 the grun runoff data during 2002 2014 are interpolated into a 0 25 0 25 resolution by the bilinear interpolation method afterward we standardize the interpolated runoff data by the z score statistical method as mentioned in section 2 4 to compute r z 2 6 grace based drought severity index dsi dsi is a uni scalar drought index based on grace mascon data from jpl proposed by zhao et al 2017a 2017b dsi value is derived based on the z score standardization of grace tws in this study dsi from april 2002 to june 2017 is interpolated into a 0 25 0 25 resolution by using the bilinear interpolation methodology missing data exist in the dsi time series when dsi is compared with other drought indices e g estimation of correlation coefficients between sti and dsi the period with missing data is not considered 2 7 the united states drought monitor usdm the united states drought monitor usdm dataset from 2002 to 2017 is obtained from the national drought mitigation center https droughtmonitor unl edu for further validation of the performance of the proposed grace based index svoboda et al 2002 the dryness conditions in usdm can be divided into five discrete categories namely abnormally dry d0 moderate d1 severe d2 extreme d3 and exceptional d4 the usdm product was developed for the evaluation of drought conditions in the united states this product is a composite measure of drought conditions based on the rich data stream by combining various climate indicators numerical models and historical records 2 8 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi depending on the reflectance difference between the red and near infrared bands of vegetation ndvi can monitor drought conditions by detecting the changes in vegetation caused by insufficient photosynthesis when water and energy are the limiting factors tucker 1979 negative land surface temperature ndvi can be used to identify agricultural drought conditions karnieli et al 2010 and ndvi can be an appropriate metric of groundwater level in shallow water areas bhanja et al 2019 previous studies have found strong relationships between ndvi and drought conditions gu et al 2007 in this paper the avhrr ndvi dataset from april 2002 to december 2015 at the 1 12 spatial resolution is used to assess the extent to which the variations of the proposed index agree with the changes of drought conditions represented by ndvi the avhrr ndvi can be retrieved from https climatedataguide ucar edu climate data ndvi normalized difference vegetation index 3rd generation nasagfsc gimms in the production of avhrr ndvi an empirical mode decomposition reconstruction was adopted to correct the effects of satellite orbital drift on altering solar zenith angle fensholt and proud 2012 tucker et al 2005 to make the spatial resolution consistent with grace the avhrr ndvi is re interpolated to 0 25 0 25 in this study 2 9 the proposed standardized terrestrial water storage index sti we follow the definition of water deficit in multiscale standardized drought indices such as spi and spei to propose a multiscalar tws based hydrological drought index sti in this study the values of standardized drought indices represent the statistical departure from the probability distribution function of a time series of a hydrological variable e g precipitation in spi and difference of precipitation and evapotranspiration in spei therefore sti indicates the statistical deviation of tws from its climatology the same as spi and spei sti can estimate water deficit at multiple time scales e g 1 3 6 12 months and are comparable across multiple locations because sti has similar statistical meanings with other standardized drought indices such as spi and spei it is also directly comparable to these standardized indices let t m i denote the accumulative tws of month i at m month time scale m m 1 3 6 36 months the probability distribution function f t m of the time series t m is fitted by a normal distribution 5 f t m 1 2 π σ 2 e t m μ 2 2 σ 2 where σ is the standard deviation and μ is the average value of t m hence the cumulative distribution function f t m of t m is estimated as 6 f t m 1 2 π σ 2 t m e t m μ 2 2 σ 2 d t m in this study the parameters of the distribution are estimated in each grid cell using the l moment method vogel and fennessey 1993 the lilliefors test shows that the t m time series at 90 of the grid cells can be fitted by the normal distribution at the 5 significant level table 2 lilliefors 1967 therefore sti at m month time scale is calculated as 7 sti m i φ 1 f t m i where φ 1 is the inverse distribution of the standard normal distribution the same as spi and spei dsi sm z r z and sti can be classified into nine categories as shown in table 3 extremely dry 2 severely dry 2 1 5 moderately dry 1 5 1 slightly dry 1 0 5 near normal 0 5 0 5 slightly wet 0 5 1 moderately wet 1 1 5 severely wet 1 5 2 and extremely wet 2 3 results the proposed multiscalar sti characterizes hydrological drought conditions based on the statistical deviation of tws an integration of groundwater soil moisture surface water snow and ice relative to its climatology sti is a multiscale standardized drought index based on the statistical algorithms similar to other standardized drought indices such as spi and spei in the first part of the results sti is compared with these multiscalar standardized drought indices however it shall be noted that sti spi and spei are defined based on different hydrological components to be more specific sti is a hydrological drought index that reflects the variations of tws as an integration of land water components while spi and spei are both meteorological drought indices that show the deficit of meteorological variables second sti is compared with uni scalar drought indices scpdsi sm z r z and dsi the scpdsi and sm z characterize the wet dry condition of soil moisture r z represents the condition of runoff meanwhile soil moisture and runoff are components of tws therefore sti and scpdsi sm z and r z measure the drought conditions in different water components dsi is an existing uni scalar grace based drought index the comparison of multiscalar sti and uni scalar dsi is helpful to understand the contributions of the proposed sti afterward these drought indices are compared with ndvi to further understand the representativeness of these indices on drought conditions 3 1 sti and multiscalar standardized meteorological drought indices spi and spei 3 1 1 spatial distribution of sti spi and spei fig 1 compares the spatial distributions of sti spi and spei at 1 to 36 month scales in july 2010 a month that extensive areas of the world suffered droughts such as eastern and western russia northern china and northern africa aghakouchak et al 2015 kendon et al 2013 lewis et al 2011 seager et al 2014 spinoni et al 2014 2015 zhao et al 2017a 2017b sti spi and spei show comparable spatial distributions of the dry e g eastern europe and wet regions e g north america while 1 to 12 month sti shows less intense drought conditions than spi and spei at the same time scales among the three indices spei exhibits the most severe drought conditions in more extensive spatial coverages especially in eastern and western russia northern china and northern africa the 6 to 24 month sti and spi capture the drought events in central russia which have been reported by previous studies arpe et al 2012 grumm 2011 but 36 month sti and most speis show normal or wet condition in this region all multiscalar indices detect the severe droughts in the sahara desert and spei shows the most severe dry conditions among the indices okonkwo et al 2013 in southern asia sti and longer time scale spi spei show severe and moderate drought conditions in central india and pakistan respectively zhang et al 2017 the drought events have resulted in crop yield reduction in these areas the 3 to 12 month sti 6 to 12 month spi 1 to 3 month spei detect the droughts caused by the la niña phenomenon in northern of southeast asia including myanmar thailand laos cambodia and vietnam adamson and bird 2010 garbero and muttarak 2013 the three standardized drought indices are able to detect drought conditions at various scales for example the 3 to 24 month sti detects the severe drought event in central russia grumm 2011 the intensity of sti drought in this area becomes stronger as the time scale increases from 3 to 9 months and weaker at time scales longer than 12 months spi across multiple timescales also shows similar variations but the transition from increase to decrease is found at a longer time scale specifically more serious drought conditions in central russia are detected in spi at longer time scales till the 24 month scale after which the drought intensity declines different from spi and spei which are the abnormal shortage of meteorological variables sti represents the deficit of tws which is the integration of groundwater soil moisture surface water snow and ice the deficit of these terrestrial hydrological components is associated with long term accumulation of changes in meteorological variables gu et al 2019 guo et al 2020 the changes of tws at a short time scale already reflect the accumulative effects of changes in precipitation and or evapotranspiration at a long time scale therefore the dryness intensities of 1 to 6 month sti are more similar to spi and spei at longer time scales e g longer than 12 months for example the extreme droughts in western australia associated with long term abnormal low precipitation can be detected by sti at short time scales and spi and spei at long time scales van dijk et al 2013 3 1 2 temporal variations of sti spi and spei the temporal variations of the drought indices are compared at four selected regions in different continents namely texas ethiopia southwestern china and southeastern australia fig 2 and the global scale fig 3 the general temporal variations of the three multiscale indices are similar but there are obvious time lags between the tws based sti and the two meteorological drought indices this is because of the time lag effects of tws an integration of different hydrological components to respond to the changes in meteorological variables the southern united states experienced severe droughts during 2010 2015 due to a strongla niña and the worst drought conditions were found in texas in 2011 2012 fig 3a long et al 2013 nielsen gammon 2012 rippey 2015 during the winter of 2011 2012 almost 88 area of texas suffered from exceptional drought as indicated by the severest drought type d4 in the usdm index not shown in this period short term sti as well as spi and spei at all time scales descend to the lowest and the minimum of sti is around two months behind nevertheless spi and spei show relatively wet conditions in spring 2012 when most of the area still was hit by the drought as indicated by usdm the tws based sti shows consistent dryness with much less noise throughout 2010 2015 which is in better agreement with the usdm furthermore the three standardized drought indices based on different hydrological variables can capture drought events in 2006 2007 and 2013 2015 huang et al 2014 rippey 2015 the three indices reach a regional minimum during this period spi and spei are more variable in time and sti values are consistently negative this suggests that sti as hydrological drought index based on tws is a robust indicator for persistent drought conditions and is not as varying as the short term meteorological drought indices spi and spei in ethiopia the rainfall was late and abnormally low in march september 2009 fig 3b nicholson 2014 the extreme droughts triggered by the abnormal rainfall deficit in these periods have caused a considerable reduction in harvests and hence resulted in famine sti and spei detect these drought conditions as their values are far below zero but spi shows no serious droughts implying that evapotranspiration may play an important role in drought development in this region fig 3b a severe drought event hit southwestern china from autumn 2009 to mid 2011 barriopedro et al 2012 yang et al 2012 all drought indices show negative values during this period fig 3c in 2001 2009 australia suffered a millennium drought event caused by extremely low rainfall dai 2011 forootan et al 2019 leblanc et al 2009 van dijk et al 2013 during this persistent drought event spi and spei values are negative most of the time but they increase and turn to positive occasionally sti consistently shows the drought conditions as its values are persistently below zero during the period therefore the hydrological and meteorological drought indices show similar temporal variations and all are able to detect major drought events sti tends to react later and respond slower than spi and spei because sti shows the deficit of tws which is expected to react behind the changes in meteorological variables sti shows more consistent and robust dryness than spi and spei for persistent drought events such as the millennium drought in australia spi and spei may be highly varying in time and occasionally detect wet conditions while sti is more stable and contain less noise in the global land area the three indices have similar temporal variations fig 3e sti tends to react later than spi spei at short time scales while this time lag effect is not obvious at long time scales the amplitudes of sti and spi spei are comparable although sti is much higher than spi and spei from 2002 to 2007 3 1 3 temporal correlations of sti with spi spei across time scales the highest temporal correlation coefficients between monthly sti and spi r sti spi max hereafter and between sti and spei r sti spei max from 2002 to 2017 at different time scales 1 3 6 9 12 24 36 months over the global land are shown in fig 4 only areas with correlation coefficients significant at the 5 significance level are shown in most areas there are high correlations 0 7 between sti and the two meteorological drought indices however sti shows insignificant correlations p 0 05 with spi and spei in eastern asia around 40 n northern and western north america and the west of south america and africa where are not only affected by natural processes but also largely influenced by human induced activities like excessive groundwater consumption and water diversion projects hu et al 2019 long et al 2017 long et al 2020 there are various surface and surface hydrological components and these hydrological variables respond differently to the accumulative changes in meteorological variables at different time scales for example groundwater reacts much slower to meteorological changes compared to soil moisture therefore sti at a particular time scale may be better correlated with spi and spei at another time scale fig 5 a and 5b show the time scales when the correlations between sti and spi and between sti and spei are the maximum shown in fig 4 sti is the statistical deficit of tws which reflects the accumulation of long term shortage of meteorological variables therefore the correlations of sti with spi spei are consistently higher when the time scale of spi spei is longer than sti in most of the areas however the optimal time scales between sti and spi spei vary in space probably due to the spatial differences in climatology and hydrology this also highlights the importance of multiscalar drought indices e g sti spi and spei to represent the drought conditions at various time scales in different regions the response of tws lags the changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration because it takes time for developing meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts apurv et al 2017 bhardwaj et al 2020 guo et al 2020 the time lag at the optimal time scales when the two drought indices have the highest correlation as shown in fig 6 there is almost no time lag between sti and spi spei in eastern russia and south china and the lagged time is 9 months for sti and spi spei in the southwestern united states and west of central asia where the 1 month sti and 36 month sp e i are highly related 3 2 sti and uni scalar drought indices scpdsi sm z r z and grace dsi the scpdsi sm z and r z are uni scalar drought indices and can better characterize the wet dry conditions of soil moisture and runoff which are closer to the definition of tws compared to the meteorological drought indices analyzed in section 3 1 however soil moisture and runoff are only components of tws therefore sti and scpdsi sm z and r z measure the deficit in different water components the comparison between sti and scpdsi sm z and r z in this part illustrates how sti as a hydrological drought index based on tws is different similar to the drought indices that better reflect changes in surface hydrological conditions in addition sti is compared with the uni scalar grace dsi to evaluate the difference similarity of the proposed multiscalar grace drought index from uni scalar grace index the spatial distributions of scpdsi sm z r z and dsi are comparable to sti in july 2010 and scpdsi shows more prominent dry wet conditions compared to sm z while r z displays wetter conditions compared to other indices fig 7 for example all stis and dsi detect the extreme dry situation in western australia while scpdsi shows moderate and slight drought conditions in severity and coverage and sm z and r z reveal the slight dry condition on a smaller area van dijk et al 2013 similar to short time scale sti i e sti1 and sti3 scpdsi sm z and dsi detect an extremely dry condition over western russia lupo et al 2014 but r z indicates a slight dry situation only sti at 3 6 9 12 month scales detect the drought events in central russia driven by the heatwave coumou and rahmstorf 2012 miralles et al 2014 while uni scalar scpdsi sm z r z dsi and 1 month sti do not for all regions and the globe scpdsi sm z r z and dsi solid black line dashed black line dashed red line and solid cyan line in fig 3 have similar temporal variations as stis particularly at short time scales for instance scpdsi sm z r z dsi and sti increase to a peak around 2004 05 winter and then they decrease together to a nadir in 2006 then rise to the second peak in 2007 in texas fig 3a although the variations of sti scpdsi sm z and r z are almost synchronous the intensities of dryness wetness may be different among the indices the hydrological characteristics in temporal distribution showed by dsi and 1 month sti are similar the maximum correlation coefficients between sti and scpdsi are 0 6 in most of the global areas fig 4c the correlations between sti and sm z are lower but still 0 5 for most of the areas fig 4e the correlation coefficients between sti and r z are the lowest among the indices with a range of 0 2 to 0 4 for most regions fig 4f this shows the good consistency between sti and scpdsi sm z and r z though they are based on different hydrological components the 1 month sti has the highest correlations with scpdsi sm z r z than stis at other time scales in most of the globe fig 5c 5e and 5f along a belt around 60 n in asia and europe 3 and 6 month stis are found to have the highest correlations with scpdsi and sm z r z fig 6c shows no time lag between sti and scpdsi over the coastal regions of east asia it takes one month to propagate drought based on scpdsi to drought based on sti in most of the areas of the globe the time lag is 9 months in cold regions such as northern canada and the 40on of asia fig 6e shows there is no time lag between sti and sm z over most parts of the world and a lag of one month exists between r z and sti fig 5f both sti and dsi are derived from grace tws the spatial and temporal distributions between sti especially 1 month sti and dsi are similar figs 4 6 the 1 month sti has the highest correlations with dsi than other time scales and the maximum correlation coefficients between them are 0 8 across the world fig 4d there is no time lag between sti and dsi in most of the global areas fig 6d 3 3 performances of sti spi spei scpdsi sm z r z and dsi in representing vegetation changes in ndvi vegetation growth is affected by the changes in water availability and therefore ndvi also can be used to represent the variations of drought conditions gu et al 2007 a low ndvi value indicates a dry condition the temporal correlations between inter annual avhrr ndvi and multiscalar indices sti spi and spei and uni scalar scpdsi sm z r z and dsi are estimated to evaluate the extent to which the seven drought indices can represent the drought conditions represented by ndvi the numbers of grids with significant and positive correlations between the multiscalar sti and ndvi are considerably higher than the uni scalar grace based dsi demonstrating the better performance of sti than dsi much stronger relationships between multiscalar sti spi and spei with ndvi are observed globally compared with uni scalar scpdsi sm z r z and dsi especially in arid semiarid and dry subhumid regions such as western north america australia and south africa fig 8 the correlation coefficients between r z and ndvi are the lowest between drought indicators and ndvi in the areas where radiation illumination and temperature are the limiting factors for vegetable growth e g high latitude areas all seven indices show weak p 0 05 or negative relationships with ndvi karnieli et al 2010 sruthi and aslam 2015 we also calculate the optimal time scale between sti spi spei and ndvi corresponding to the best correlation coefficient between them fig 9 1 month sti has the highest correlations with ndvi in most of the areas with significant correlation in the globe especially in the southern hemisphere and low latitude near the equator the 36 month sti spi and spei tend to have better agreement with ndvi variations in the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere the time scales of spi and spei with the highest correlations vary across the globe in general 18 month spi is the best correlated with ndvi compared to the indices in other time scales spi and spei are meteorological drought indices that only consider the changes of precipitation and evapotranspiration scpdsi and sm z mainly reflects the dry wet condition of soil moisture r z represents the condition of runoff while sti is a hydrological drought index that reflects the deficit of tws which is a more straightforward indicator of water availability for vegetation growth furthermore the grace based sti is able to monitor the changes in tws caused by meteorological variables surface hydrological processes and human activities the multiscalar sti outperforms the uni scalar grace based dsi and multiscalar drought indices have considerably better agreement with ndvi changes compared with the uni scalar drought indices therefore multiscale sti shows stronger relationships with the vegetation changes in the areas where vegetation growth is limited by water 4 discussion 4 1 sti as a multiscalar standardized hydrological drought index based on easy accessed global hydrological measurements similarity and difference from other drought indices in nature in this study we propose a multiscalar sti to characterize the hydrological drought conditions the same as other multiscalar standardized drought indices e g spi and spei the proposed sti denotes the statistical deviation of a hydrological variable tws for sti which is an integration of groundwater soil moisture surface water snow and ice relative to its climatology therefore sti is directly comparable to the existing multiscalar standardized indices because they have the same statistical meanings although based on different hydrometeorological variables e g precipitation for spi and difference of precipitation and evapotranspiration for spei the proposed sti also owns the advantages of the multiscalar standardized indices it is comparable at multiple time scales and across different locations in our study sti is compared with spi spei scpdsi sm z r z and dsi and the indices can reach consensus on the temporal and spatial variations on droughts to some extent it shall be noted that these indices measure the drought conditions based on different statistics and different hydrological components in other words although these indices can detect drought signals the drought events identified may have different meanings e g deficit in different hydrological components the differences between sti from other indices can be explained by differences of their definitions for example short term sti as a tws based index tends to correlate with long term meteorological indices spi and spei because subsurface and surface hydrological components are reflections of the accumulative effects of meteorological changes the changes in sub surface components such as groundwater are affected by meteorological conditions months or even years ago more details about the comparison between sti and other indices can be found in the results and other parts of the discussion grace tws change can reveal water cycle variations caused by anthropogenic activities such as constructed dams and agricultural irrigation change haddeland et al 2014 for example by combining grace tws data with other auxiliary data long et al 2020 found china s south to north water diversion project has helped cumulatively increase groundwater volume by approximately 3 6 km3 during 2006 2018 in beijing which significantly alleviates beijing s water shortage long et al 2020 since sti is calculated based on tws it also reflects the impacts of human activities on the other hand spi and spei are meteorological variables e g precipitation and potential evapotranspiration which are less affected by human activities on the land surface this also contributes to the differences in the drought indicators data deficit is one of the major limitations of global scale studies of the existing hydrological indices based on observations of surface hydrological variables such as runoff and soil moisture the sti is based on grace resolutions which provide reliable and consistent tws observations with extensive spatial coverage at a global scale the tws measurements of grace can be easily accessed by the public since successfully launched in march 2002 grace has provided unprecedented observations of total hydrologic states and fluxes glacier ice soil moisture surface water groundwater etc at regional to global scales every month almost uninterruptedly from april 2002 to june 2017 wahr et al 2006 although sti is calculated based on csr grace the proposed sti algorithm can be directly applied to the other grace solutions e g jpl tellus and gfz and grace fo grace follow on the grace fo mission has been launched in may 2018 and continues to monitor gravity changes in the future and serve more products over the globe since june 2018 although the consistency of mass balance change records of grace and grace fo have been demonstrated ciracì et al 2020 velicogna et al 2020 there is a continuous data gap between grace and grace fo from july 2017 may 2018 to the best of our knowledge no centers have released solutions with interpolation of this gap because how to interpolate the data gap is still an emerging topic in the field li et al 2019 sun et al 2020 solutions in the future with continuous tws measurements combining grace and grace fo with interpolated gaps will be helpful to extend sti and other grace based drought indices 4 2 sti as a robust retroactive drought index our comparisons of sti with spi spei scpdsi sm z r z and dsi show that the seven drought indices though measure the deficits of different hydrological components reach consensus on the spatial distribution of the dryness across the globe the temporal variations of sti spi spei scpdsi sm z r z and dsi are comparable while sti tends to lag behind the meteorological variables and individual hydrological variables because of the lag time of the propagation from meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts and from single hydrological component drought to total tws deficit huang et al 2017 peters et al 2006 in major drought events such as the persistent millennium drought in australia sti shows more consistent and robust dryness with less noise than spi spei and scpdsi showing that sti is a reliable and robust indicator of drought conditions 1 month sti and uni scalar dsi is similar because both of them are calculated based on 1 month tws although the temporal distribution of dsi is similar to sti at short time scales the spatial characteristics displayed by dsi and sti are different such as the dry wet condition in central russia sti at 1 month scale and uni scalar dsi fail to capture the drought condition in central russia while sti at a longer time scale can capture the dry condition this suggests tws derived drought is an accumulative hydrological process that can develop for several months and therefore a multiscalar drought index is more appropriate for hydrological drought monitoring also compared with dsi the multiscalar properties of sti makes it easier to compare with other widely used standardized drought metrics i e spi and spei since they have the same statistical meanings even stand for different water components sti measures the statistical deficit of tws which is affected by the accumulation of long term shortage of meteorological variables therefore the short term sti has better agreement with long term spi and spei in terms of spatial distributions and temporal correlations for example the correlations are all almost above 0 70 when the time scale of spi spei is longer than that of sti worldwide the time scales at which sti and spi spei have higher correlations vary in different regions because of the differences in climatology and hydrology tws is an integration of multiple types of water components such as groundwater soil moisture surface water snow and ice the proportions and importance of these hydrological components are different across regions the response times of different water components to the changes in meteorological variables also vary therefore the relationships of time scales of sti with other drought indices are different across regions spi spei scpdsi dsi and sti represent different dry conditions that are triggered by precipitation deficit first and then propagated to different hydrological components through the hydrological cycle sti and dsi are based on direct tws change under climate change and anthropogenic activities while spi only reflects precipitation related drought spei considers the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration for drought assessment mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2010b and scpdsi is more sensitive to net water change derived by soil moisture van der schrier et al 2013 although the drought metrics vary similarly in time and space there is a clear time lag of sti as a hydrological drought index compared to spi and spei as meteorological drought indices because hydrological drought usually reacts later than meteorological drought apurv et al 2017 cook et al 2018 for example spi and spei are the first to detect the persistent 2010 2011 texas drought caused by precipitation deficit since october 2010 nielsen gammon 2012 and about three months later dsi and 1 month sti detect the dryness in surface hydrological components driven by consecutive dry weather this implies meteorological drought indices are more powerful in early detection and prediction of droughts compared to hydrological drought indices hydrological drought may occur if the dry weather conditions continue for a long time which may be detected by hydrological drought indices such as sti and dsi although sti responds later than spi and spei sti is more robust with less noise than spi and spei after hydrological drought occurs furthermore compared to dsi sti can exhibit the dryness wetness condition straightforwardly in the long term 4 3 sti as a drought index that effectively reflects variations in ndvi our results show significantly stronger relationships of multiscalar drought indices sti spi and spei with ndvi than the uni scalar indices scpdsi sm z r z and dsi although both derived from grace data the multiscale sti have better agreement with ndvi than the uni scalar dsi across the world suggesting multiple time scale drought metrics are important to understand the impacts of droughts on ecosystems and society for example vegetation growth and crop production are not just sensitive to the deficit of hydrological variables e g precipitation soil moisture and runoff in a month but also the antecedent wet dry conditions of these variables in the previous months different types of vegetation and crop are sensitive to the cumulative effects of hydrological variables for different periods the correlations of sti and ndvi are mostly 0 8 and significant at the 5 level fig 8 in cropland shrubland grassland and barren land regions fig 10 where water is the major limiting factor latham et al 2014 which is similar to the findings of ji and peters 2003 however the relationships are insignificant in forest covered areas owing to the water conservation capability of forests which makes the vegetation growth response later to climate change and tundra covered regions where the water balance system significantly affected by the global warming induced ice wedge degradation which may contribute to the decrease of some vegetation species e g moss and lichen or expansion of tall shrublands biao et al 2010 farooqi et al 2020 frost and epstein 2014 keleş 2019 liljedahl et al 2016 liu et al 2020 among the multiscalar drought indices 1 month sti has the highest correlations with ndvi while the time scales for spi and spei reaching the maximum correlations with ndvi vary across regions fig 10 spi and spei are meteorological drought indices that only consider the changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration meteorological drought in a short duration may not trigger detected impacts on vegetation growth since sti denotes the deficit of tws it is a more straightforward indicator of water availability for vegetation growth furthermore the grace based sti is able to reflect the changes in tws caused by changes in meteorological variables surface hydrological processes and human activities therefore sti shows better agreement with the monitored vegetation changes 5 conclusions we propose a multiscalar standardized terrestrial water storage index sti based on tws observations from the grace satellites sti is a hydrological drought index that reflects the deficit of the integration of subsurface and surface water components including groundwater soil moisture surface water etc at multiple time scales given the statistical nature of sti it can be comparable to other multiscale standardized drought indices e g spi and spei across time and space although caveats shall be made that these drought indices measure the wet dry conditions of different water components different from other observation based hydrological indices which are constrained by the limited availability of in situ hydrological measurements at the global scale sti can provide a global evaluation of drought conditions based on grace tws accessible to the public our comparisons between sti with spi spei scpdsi sm z r z and dsi show that sti is more robust in representing droughts with less noise than indices while meteorological drought indices spi and spei are powerful in early detection of drought events sti at short term time scales e g 3 and 6 months have higher correlations mostly 0 7 with spi spei at long term scales e g 18 and 24 months because tws is a reflection of the accumulative changes of meteorological variables multiscalar sti deficit of the integration of sub surface and surface hydrological components spi and spei deficit of meteorological variables outperform uni scalar drought indices scpdsi and sm z soil moisture as a surface component r z runoff as a surface component and dsi deficit of sub surface and surface hydrological components in representing ndvi changes the multiscale sti has better agreement with ndvi than the uni scalar grace based dsi across the world in this study we use csr grace to calculate sti the proposed sti algorithm can be directly applied to the other grace grace fo solutions such as those from jpl tellus and gfz credit authorship contribution statement aihong cui data curation investigation writing

4158,a multiscalar standardized terrestrial water storage index sti is proposed to assess global hydrological droughts in this study sti is defined as the standardized statistical deviation of terrestrial water storage tws measured by grace to the climatology at multiple time scales because of the statistical nature of its definition the proposed index is comparable to other standardized drought indices in different time scales e g standardized precipitation index spi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei across different regions at multiple time scales our comparisons of sti with multiscalar drought indices i e spi and spei and uni scalar indices i e self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi standardized soil moisture index sm z standardized runoff index r z and grace based drought severity index dsi show that sti can capture drought events with less noise than other indicators in persistent drought events as a hydrological drought index based on tws which includes groundwater soil moisture etc sti at short term time scales e g 3 and 6 months have higher correlations mostly 0 7 with spi spei at long term scales e g 18 and 24 months since the tws measured by grace incorporates the impacts of the accumulated changes in meteorological variables hydrological processes and human activities as well as the advantage of multiscale sti better represents vegetation growth reflected by normalized difference vegetation index ndvi than uni scalar drought indices including the grace based dsi suggesting sti is a robust indicator for hydrological droughts and vegetation changes keywords hydrological droughts terrestrial water storage grace meteorological droughts drought indices 1 introduction droughts are one of the most devastating natural hazards that have caused enormous economic losses and causality in the society chou et al 2018 kogan 1997 ma et al 2017 musolino et al 2018 historical observations and model simulations of various hydrological variables such as precipitation soil moisture and discharge have shown drying trends in many areas of the world over the past decades trenberth et al 2014 gu et al 2019 li et al 2013 2016 the drying trends are expected to continue and become more frequent and extreme under the future climate due to the changes in precipitation and increases in evaporation dai 2011 meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic droughts constitute four common categories of drought indices rodell et al 2018 standardized precipitation index spi one of the most popularly used meteorological drought indices defines drought as the relative deficit of precipitation compared to the long term climatology hayes et al 1999 kumar et al 2016 mckee et al 1993 as a multiscalar drought index which can reflect accumulative dryness in short e g monthly or long duration e g yearly spi at long time scales is usually associated with hydrological droughts i e shortage of surface water resources such as river discharges soil moisture and groundwater vicente serrano et al 2010a however such implicit estimations of drought conditions in surface hydrological variables are neither direct measurements of deficit in surface hydrological conditions nor drought assessments with comprehensive consideration of the complex hydrological processes to measure hydrological droughts in situ observations of hydrological variables such as streamflow surface water soil moisture and groundwater levels are required to estimate water deficit but such observations are usually much more limited in temporal and spatial coverages than meteorological variables furthermore direct measurements of surface hydrological variables are mostly at the point scale and often inconsistent and inconsecutive to evaluate changes in hydrological droughts at a global scale chen et al 2009 shahid and hazarika 2010 taylor et al 2009 still it remains challenging to obtain a whole set of high quality hydrological data e g surface water soil moisture and groundwater at reasonable temporal and spatial coverages to evaluate global hydrological droughts jin et al 2014 satellite data provides consistent hydrological measurements with regional to global coverage and can be used to detect the characteristics of drought conditions such as onset duration and magnitude kimball et al 2012 thiruvengadachari and gopalkrishna 1993 as the only sensor that can provide a complete expression of both the surface and subsurface water reserves grace satellites have been widely used in the measurement of hydrological droughts since the twin satellites launched in march 2002 zaitchik et al 2008 recently several drought indices based on total terrestrial water storage tws estimates with stationary time scale i e uni scalar have been proposed to assess the intensity and spatial distribution of drought conditions such as the total storage deficit index nie et al 2018 the dam influence index li et al 2018 the grace groundwater drought index thomas et al 2017 and the drought severity index dsi zhao et al 2017a b the existing grace based drought indices are defined at a fixed time scale which makes them difficult to reflect the multiscalar characteristics of droughts as the commonly used standardized indices such as spi and spei the multi types of hydrological components that constitute tws e g groundwater soil moisture surface water snow and ice respond to changes in meteorological variables at different time scales de jager and vogt 2015 lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 mishra et al 2009 moreover the impacts of droughts on society and ecosystems are multiscalar for instance vegetation growth is not just sensitive to hydrological components in one month but also influenced by the accumulative dry wet conditions of these components in the past months chen et al 2020 ma et al 2021 vicente serrano et al 2013 different vegetation species are sensitive to droughts in various time scales hossain and li 2021 therefore a multiscalar drought index based on tws will provide an important tool to evaluate the development and characteristics of hydrological droughts at different time scales furthermore standardized drought indices are defined as statistical deficit of hydrometeorological variables e g precipitation for spi and differences of precipitation and evapotranspiration for spei since the existing grace based drought indices are defined based on different logics and algorithms like the arithmetics utilized by the total storage deficit index and dsi nie et al 2018 zhao et al 2017a b they may not be directly comparable to the standardized indices therefore in this study we propose a new multiscalar standardized terrestrial water storage index sti based on the tws measurements from the grace satellite to assess global hydrological droughts sti is defined as the statistical deviation of tws and therefore it is directly comparable to other standardized drought indices across different regions at multiple time scales to assess the performance of the proposed sti we first compare the spatial distributions and temporal variations of sti with multiscalar standardized meteorological drought indices spi and spei the relationships of the sti and spi spei across different time scales are analyzed second sti is compared with four uni scalar drought indices namely self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi standardized soil moisture index sm z standardized runoff index r z and grace based dsi the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is hence used to evaluate the performance of sti and other drought indices in capturing vegetation variations affected by changes in water availability 2 data and methods 2 1 data grace records provide tws observations with extensive spatial coverage at a global scale the grace data has been widely used in the fields of hydrology to evaluate changes in water availability evapotranspiration ice sheets water balance of aquifers etc gleeson et al 2012 hu et al 2019 kidd et al 2014 long et al 2013 pan et al 2017 rodell et al 2018 in this study the gridded grace release 06 rl06 mascon data at the 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution processed by the center for space research csr at the university of texas austin is used to calculate the proposed hydrological drought index http www2 csr utexas edu grace rl06 mascons html here the grace data from april 2002 to june 2017 which overlaps the span of precipitation and temperature data utilized in the study pretreatment procedures such as replacement of the c20 coefficients with satellite laser ranging analysis rectification of geocenter anomalies based on reference and correction of glacial isostatic adjustment have been conducted before the dataset was released cheng and tapley 2004 jacob et al 2012 save et al 2016 swenson et al 2008 compared to other grace solutions csr grace mascon data has the advantages of avoiding north south stripe error and capturing all signals in the allowed noise level of grace 1b measurements save et al 2016 the spatial resolution of csr is higher than other grace solutions in this study the grace data of land grid cells are considered the mean value of the adjacent months in the same year is used to fill the missing gap of grace precipitation and temperature data of the climatic research unit cru ts version 4 03 http data ceda ac uk badc cru data cru ts cru ts 4 03 are obtained from the uk national centre to calculate spi and spei harris et al 2014 jones et al 2012 this dataset was derived from rain gauge observations of the world meteorological organization and other administrations the discontinuity problems in regions such as northern russia north africa and the amazon basin have been resolved in this new version furthermore compared to other datasets the cru dataset has relatively longer temporal coverage at the monthly scale from january 1901 to december 2018 and a higher spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 and therefore the dataset has been widely used in previous studies philipona et al 2005 sheffield et al 2012 sun et al 2018 vicente serrano et al 2010a comparisons between cru ts precipitation and other datasets have been conducted in different regions of the world such as china the iberian peninsula and the caribbean belo pereira et al 2011 hu et al 2018 jones et al 2016 zhu et al 2018 these assessment studies indicated that the cru precipitation dataset has good agreement with in situ observations shi et al 2017 zhao and fu 2006 furthermore the global soil moisture version 2 dataset during 2002 2017 is obtained from the climate prediction center cpc this monthly mean soil moisture data with a 1 6 meter column at a 0 5 0 5 resolution can be accessed via https psl noaa gov data gridded data cpcsoil html van den dool 2003 a global gridded runoff dataset grun from 2002 to 2014 at a 0 5 0 5 resolution is acquired from the eth zurich https www research collection ethz ch handle 20 500 11850 381388 ghiggi et al 2019 this gridded runoff dataset was developed based on the in situ runoff observations from the global runoff data centre grdc reference dataset grdc 2021 2 2 standardized precipitation index spi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei spi and spei are two commonly used multiscale standardized meteorological drought indices based on the probabilistic behaviors of meteorological variables spi considers the deficit of precipitation only because spi is relatively less data and computation demanding it has been widely used for drought evaluation as well as for validation of other drought indices e g kumar et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 for example cao et al 2015 employed spi to assess the performance of a grace total storage deficit index in this study spi is computed from cru ts precipitation based on the following equation in mckee et al 1993 1 spi m i φ 1 f x m i where m m 1 3 6 36 months is the time scale i represents a month in a year e g january february x m i represents the m month accumulative precipitation of month i f is the cumulative distribution function of the gamma function which is employed to fit the time series of m month accumulative precipitation total x m and φ 1 is the inverse of the standard normal cumulative distribution function we also use spei a meteorological index that considers both atmospheric water supply and demand to compare the proposed tws based index van loon et al 2017 spei also has been used to validate other drought indices in previous studies for example zhao et al zhao et al 2017a used spei to evaluate their proposed grace drought severity index we calculate spei based on the algorithms of vicente serrano et al 2010a potential evapotranspiration pet is estimated based on the thornthwaite equation thornthwaite 1948 following vicente serrano et al 2010a 2010b the difference mm between precipitation p and pet is 2 d p p e t for different time scales m m 1 3 6 36 months the cumulative value of month i for m month time scale is defined by follows 3 d m i p m i pet m i hence spei at time scale m is calculated as follows 4 spei m i φ 1 f d m i where f is the cumulative distribution function of a log logistic distribution fitted for the accumulative d time series and φ 1 is the inverse function of the standard normal distribution 2 3 self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi the scpdsi is able to overcome the inconsistent characteristics of pdsi in different locations and make the spatial comparisons affected by diverse climate regimes more appropriate wells et al 2004 van der schrier et al 2013 the scpdsi index is more accurate than pdsi in reporting the frequencies of extreme wet dry conditions and has been widely used in the global drought measurement especially the drought events affected by soil moisture sousa et al 2011 trnka et al 2009 the scpdsi used here is provided by cru with a 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution https crudata uea ac uk cru data drought which was calculated based on the cru ts 4 03 monthly precipitation and temperature the scpdsi value is divided into nine categories as shown in table 1 2 4 standardized soil moisture index sm z the uni scalar standardized soil moisture index sm z is used in this study to represent the wet and dry conditions of soil moisture the cpc soil moisture version 2 dataset during 2002 2017 is utilized to calculate sm z to make better comparisons to other indices in this study gridded data interpolated into a 0 25 0 25 resolution by the bilinear interpolation method then each new interpolated cell is standardized by z score statistical method y x x σ where x and σ represent the mean and standard deviation of soil moisture of each cell respectively and y refers to sm z mu et al 2013 zhao et al 2017a 2 5 standardized runoff index r z the uni scalar standardized runoff index r z is used in this study to characterise the wet and dry conditions of runoff nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 vicente serrano et al 2012 the grun runoff data during 2002 2014 are interpolated into a 0 25 0 25 resolution by the bilinear interpolation method afterward we standardize the interpolated runoff data by the z score statistical method as mentioned in section 2 4 to compute r z 2 6 grace based drought severity index dsi dsi is a uni scalar drought index based on grace mascon data from jpl proposed by zhao et al 2017a 2017b dsi value is derived based on the z score standardization of grace tws in this study dsi from april 2002 to june 2017 is interpolated into a 0 25 0 25 resolution by using the bilinear interpolation methodology missing data exist in the dsi time series when dsi is compared with other drought indices e g estimation of correlation coefficients between sti and dsi the period with missing data is not considered 2 7 the united states drought monitor usdm the united states drought monitor usdm dataset from 2002 to 2017 is obtained from the national drought mitigation center https droughtmonitor unl edu for further validation of the performance of the proposed grace based index svoboda et al 2002 the dryness conditions in usdm can be divided into five discrete categories namely abnormally dry d0 moderate d1 severe d2 extreme d3 and exceptional d4 the usdm product was developed for the evaluation of drought conditions in the united states this product is a composite measure of drought conditions based on the rich data stream by combining various climate indicators numerical models and historical records 2 8 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi depending on the reflectance difference between the red and near infrared bands of vegetation ndvi can monitor drought conditions by detecting the changes in vegetation caused by insufficient photosynthesis when water and energy are the limiting factors tucker 1979 negative land surface temperature ndvi can be used to identify agricultural drought conditions karnieli et al 2010 and ndvi can be an appropriate metric of groundwater level in shallow water areas bhanja et al 2019 previous studies have found strong relationships between ndvi and drought conditions gu et al 2007 in this paper the avhrr ndvi dataset from april 2002 to december 2015 at the 1 12 spatial resolution is used to assess the extent to which the variations of the proposed index agree with the changes of drought conditions represented by ndvi the avhrr ndvi can be retrieved from https climatedataguide ucar edu climate data ndvi normalized difference vegetation index 3rd generation nasagfsc gimms in the production of avhrr ndvi an empirical mode decomposition reconstruction was adopted to correct the effects of satellite orbital drift on altering solar zenith angle fensholt and proud 2012 tucker et al 2005 to make the spatial resolution consistent with grace the avhrr ndvi is re interpolated to 0 25 0 25 in this study 2 9 the proposed standardized terrestrial water storage index sti we follow the definition of water deficit in multiscale standardized drought indices such as spi and spei to propose a multiscalar tws based hydrological drought index sti in this study the values of standardized drought indices represent the statistical departure from the probability distribution function of a time series of a hydrological variable e g precipitation in spi and difference of precipitation and evapotranspiration in spei therefore sti indicates the statistical deviation of tws from its climatology the same as spi and spei sti can estimate water deficit at multiple time scales e g 1 3 6 12 months and are comparable across multiple locations because sti has similar statistical meanings with other standardized drought indices such as spi and spei it is also directly comparable to these standardized indices let t m i denote the accumulative tws of month i at m month time scale m m 1 3 6 36 months the probability distribution function f t m of the time series t m is fitted by a normal distribution 5 f t m 1 2 π σ 2 e t m μ 2 2 σ 2 where σ is the standard deviation and μ is the average value of t m hence the cumulative distribution function f t m of t m is estimated as 6 f t m 1 2 π σ 2 t m e t m μ 2 2 σ 2 d t m in this study the parameters of the distribution are estimated in each grid cell using the l moment method vogel and fennessey 1993 the lilliefors test shows that the t m time series at 90 of the grid cells can be fitted by the normal distribution at the 5 significant level table 2 lilliefors 1967 therefore sti at m month time scale is calculated as 7 sti m i φ 1 f t m i where φ 1 is the inverse distribution of the standard normal distribution the same as spi and spei dsi sm z r z and sti can be classified into nine categories as shown in table 3 extremely dry 2 severely dry 2 1 5 moderately dry 1 5 1 slightly dry 1 0 5 near normal 0 5 0 5 slightly wet 0 5 1 moderately wet 1 1 5 severely wet 1 5 2 and extremely wet 2 3 results the proposed multiscalar sti characterizes hydrological drought conditions based on the statistical deviation of tws an integration of groundwater soil moisture surface water snow and ice relative to its climatology sti is a multiscale standardized drought index based on the statistical algorithms similar to other standardized drought indices such as spi and spei in the first part of the results sti is compared with these multiscalar standardized drought indices however it shall be noted that sti spi and spei are defined based on different hydrological components to be more specific sti is a hydrological drought index that reflects the variations of tws as an integration of land water components while spi and spei are both meteorological drought indices that show the deficit of meteorological variables second sti is compared with uni scalar drought indices scpdsi sm z r z and dsi the scpdsi and sm z characterize the wet dry condition of soil moisture r z represents the condition of runoff meanwhile soil moisture and runoff are components of tws therefore sti and scpdsi sm z and r z measure the drought conditions in different water components dsi is an existing uni scalar grace based drought index the comparison of multiscalar sti and uni scalar dsi is helpful to understand the contributions of the proposed sti afterward these drought indices are compared with ndvi to further understand the representativeness of these indices on drought conditions 3 1 sti and multiscalar standardized meteorological drought indices spi and spei 3 1 1 spatial distribution of sti spi and spei fig 1 compares the spatial distributions of sti spi and spei at 1 to 36 month scales in july 2010 a month that extensive areas of the world suffered droughts such as eastern and western russia northern china and northern africa aghakouchak et al 2015 kendon et al 2013 lewis et al 2011 seager et al 2014 spinoni et al 2014 2015 zhao et al 2017a 2017b sti spi and spei show comparable spatial distributions of the dry e g eastern europe and wet regions e g north america while 1 to 12 month sti shows less intense drought conditions than spi and spei at the same time scales among the three indices spei exhibits the most severe drought conditions in more extensive spatial coverages especially in eastern and western russia northern china and northern africa the 6 to 24 month sti and spi capture the drought events in central russia which have been reported by previous studies arpe et al 2012 grumm 2011 but 36 month sti and most speis show normal or wet condition in this region all multiscalar indices detect the severe droughts in the sahara desert and spei shows the most severe dry conditions among the indices okonkwo et al 2013 in southern asia sti and longer time scale spi spei show severe and moderate drought conditions in central india and pakistan respectively zhang et al 2017 the drought events have resulted in crop yield reduction in these areas the 3 to 12 month sti 6 to 12 month spi 1 to 3 month spei detect the droughts caused by the la niña phenomenon in northern of southeast asia including myanmar thailand laos cambodia and vietnam adamson and bird 2010 garbero and muttarak 2013 the three standardized drought indices are able to detect drought conditions at various scales for example the 3 to 24 month sti detects the severe drought event in central russia grumm 2011 the intensity of sti drought in this area becomes stronger as the time scale increases from 3 to 9 months and weaker at time scales longer than 12 months spi across multiple timescales also shows similar variations but the transition from increase to decrease is found at a longer time scale specifically more serious drought conditions in central russia are detected in spi at longer time scales till the 24 month scale after which the drought intensity declines different from spi and spei which are the abnormal shortage of meteorological variables sti represents the deficit of tws which is the integration of groundwater soil moisture surface water snow and ice the deficit of these terrestrial hydrological components is associated with long term accumulation of changes in meteorological variables gu et al 2019 guo et al 2020 the changes of tws at a short time scale already reflect the accumulative effects of changes in precipitation and or evapotranspiration at a long time scale therefore the dryness intensities of 1 to 6 month sti are more similar to spi and spei at longer time scales e g longer than 12 months for example the extreme droughts in western australia associated with long term abnormal low precipitation can be detected by sti at short time scales and spi and spei at long time scales van dijk et al 2013 3 1 2 temporal variations of sti spi and spei the temporal variations of the drought indices are compared at four selected regions in different continents namely texas ethiopia southwestern china and southeastern australia fig 2 and the global scale fig 3 the general temporal variations of the three multiscale indices are similar but there are obvious time lags between the tws based sti and the two meteorological drought indices this is because of the time lag effects of tws an integration of different hydrological components to respond to the changes in meteorological variables the southern united states experienced severe droughts during 2010 2015 due to a strongla niña and the worst drought conditions were found in texas in 2011 2012 fig 3a long et al 2013 nielsen gammon 2012 rippey 2015 during the winter of 2011 2012 almost 88 area of texas suffered from exceptional drought as indicated by the severest drought type d4 in the usdm index not shown in this period short term sti as well as spi and spei at all time scales descend to the lowest and the minimum of sti is around two months behind nevertheless spi and spei show relatively wet conditions in spring 2012 when most of the area still was hit by the drought as indicated by usdm the tws based sti shows consistent dryness with much less noise throughout 2010 2015 which is in better agreement with the usdm furthermore the three standardized drought indices based on different hydrological variables can capture drought events in 2006 2007 and 2013 2015 huang et al 2014 rippey 2015 the three indices reach a regional minimum during this period spi and spei are more variable in time and sti values are consistently negative this suggests that sti as hydrological drought index based on tws is a robust indicator for persistent drought conditions and is not as varying as the short term meteorological drought indices spi and spei in ethiopia the rainfall was late and abnormally low in march september 2009 fig 3b nicholson 2014 the extreme droughts triggered by the abnormal rainfall deficit in these periods have caused a considerable reduction in harvests and hence resulted in famine sti and spei detect these drought conditions as their values are far below zero but spi shows no serious droughts implying that evapotranspiration may play an important role in drought development in this region fig 3b a severe drought event hit southwestern china from autumn 2009 to mid 2011 barriopedro et al 2012 yang et al 2012 all drought indices show negative values during this period fig 3c in 2001 2009 australia suffered a millennium drought event caused by extremely low rainfall dai 2011 forootan et al 2019 leblanc et al 2009 van dijk et al 2013 during this persistent drought event spi and spei values are negative most of the time but they increase and turn to positive occasionally sti consistently shows the drought conditions as its values are persistently below zero during the period therefore the hydrological and meteorological drought indices show similar temporal variations and all are able to detect major drought events sti tends to react later and respond slower than spi and spei because sti shows the deficit of tws which is expected to react behind the changes in meteorological variables sti shows more consistent and robust dryness than spi and spei for persistent drought events such as the millennium drought in australia spi and spei may be highly varying in time and occasionally detect wet conditions while sti is more stable and contain less noise in the global land area the three indices have similar temporal variations fig 3e sti tends to react later than spi spei at short time scales while this time lag effect is not obvious at long time scales the amplitudes of sti and spi spei are comparable although sti is much higher than spi and spei from 2002 to 2007 3 1 3 temporal correlations of sti with spi spei across time scales the highest temporal correlation coefficients between monthly sti and spi r sti spi max hereafter and between sti and spei r sti spei max from 2002 to 2017 at different time scales 1 3 6 9 12 24 36 months over the global land are shown in fig 4 only areas with correlation coefficients significant at the 5 significance level are shown in most areas there are high correlations 0 7 between sti and the two meteorological drought indices however sti shows insignificant correlations p 0 05 with spi and spei in eastern asia around 40 n northern and western north america and the west of south america and africa where are not only affected by natural processes but also largely influenced by human induced activities like excessive groundwater consumption and water diversion projects hu et al 2019 long et al 2017 long et al 2020 there are various surface and surface hydrological components and these hydrological variables respond differently to the accumulative changes in meteorological variables at different time scales for example groundwater reacts much slower to meteorological changes compared to soil moisture therefore sti at a particular time scale may be better correlated with spi and spei at another time scale fig 5 a and 5b show the time scales when the correlations between sti and spi and between sti and spei are the maximum shown in fig 4 sti is the statistical deficit of tws which reflects the accumulation of long term shortage of meteorological variables therefore the correlations of sti with spi spei are consistently higher when the time scale of spi spei is longer than sti in most of the areas however the optimal time scales between sti and spi spei vary in space probably due to the spatial differences in climatology and hydrology this also highlights the importance of multiscalar drought indices e g sti spi and spei to represent the drought conditions at various time scales in different regions the response of tws lags the changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration because it takes time for developing meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts apurv et al 2017 bhardwaj et al 2020 guo et al 2020 the time lag at the optimal time scales when the two drought indices have the highest correlation as shown in fig 6 there is almost no time lag between sti and spi spei in eastern russia and south china and the lagged time is 9 months for sti and spi spei in the southwestern united states and west of central asia where the 1 month sti and 36 month sp e i are highly related 3 2 sti and uni scalar drought indices scpdsi sm z r z and grace dsi the scpdsi sm z and r z are uni scalar drought indices and can better characterize the wet dry conditions of soil moisture and runoff which are closer to the definition of tws compared to the meteorological drought indices analyzed in section 3 1 however soil moisture and runoff are only components of tws therefore sti and scpdsi sm z and r z measure the deficit in different water components the comparison between sti and scpdsi sm z and r z in this part illustrates how sti as a hydrological drought index based on tws is different similar to the drought indices that better reflect changes in surface hydrological conditions in addition sti is compared with the uni scalar grace dsi to evaluate the difference similarity of the proposed multiscalar grace drought index from uni scalar grace index the spatial distributions of scpdsi sm z r z and dsi are comparable to sti in july 2010 and scpdsi shows more prominent dry wet conditions compared to sm z while r z displays wetter conditions compared to other indices fig 7 for example all stis and dsi detect the extreme dry situation in western australia while scpdsi shows moderate and slight drought conditions in severity and coverage and sm z and r z reveal the slight dry condition on a smaller area van dijk et al 2013 similar to short time scale sti i e sti1 and sti3 scpdsi sm z and dsi detect an extremely dry condition over western russia lupo et al 2014 but r z indicates a slight dry situation only sti at 3 6 9 12 month scales detect the drought events in central russia driven by the heatwave coumou and rahmstorf 2012 miralles et al 2014 while uni scalar scpdsi sm z r z dsi and 1 month sti do not for all regions and the globe scpdsi sm z r z and dsi solid black line dashed black line dashed red line and solid cyan line in fig 3 have similar temporal variations as stis particularly at short time scales for instance scpdsi sm z r z dsi and sti increase to a peak around 2004 05 winter and then they decrease together to a nadir in 2006 then rise to the second peak in 2007 in texas fig 3a although the variations of sti scpdsi sm z and r z are almost synchronous the intensities of dryness wetness may be different among the indices the hydrological characteristics in temporal distribution showed by dsi and 1 month sti are similar the maximum correlation coefficients between sti and scpdsi are 0 6 in most of the global areas fig 4c the correlations between sti and sm z are lower but still 0 5 for most of the areas fig 4e the correlation coefficients between sti and r z are the lowest among the indices with a range of 0 2 to 0 4 for most regions fig 4f this shows the good consistency between sti and scpdsi sm z and r z though they are based on different hydrological components the 1 month sti has the highest correlations with scpdsi sm z r z than stis at other time scales in most of the globe fig 5c 5e and 5f along a belt around 60 n in asia and europe 3 and 6 month stis are found to have the highest correlations with scpdsi and sm z r z fig 6c shows no time lag between sti and scpdsi over the coastal regions of east asia it takes one month to propagate drought based on scpdsi to drought based on sti in most of the areas of the globe the time lag is 9 months in cold regions such as northern canada and the 40on of asia fig 6e shows there is no time lag between sti and sm z over most parts of the world and a lag of one month exists between r z and sti fig 5f both sti and dsi are derived from grace tws the spatial and temporal distributions between sti especially 1 month sti and dsi are similar figs 4 6 the 1 month sti has the highest correlations with dsi than other time scales and the maximum correlation coefficients between them are 0 8 across the world fig 4d there is no time lag between sti and dsi in most of the global areas fig 6d 3 3 performances of sti spi spei scpdsi sm z r z and dsi in representing vegetation changes in ndvi vegetation growth is affected by the changes in water availability and therefore ndvi also can be used to represent the variations of drought conditions gu et al 2007 a low ndvi value indicates a dry condition the temporal correlations between inter annual avhrr ndvi and multiscalar indices sti spi and spei and uni scalar scpdsi sm z r z and dsi are estimated to evaluate the extent to which the seven drought indices can represent the drought conditions represented by ndvi the numbers of grids with significant and positive correlations between the multiscalar sti and ndvi are considerably higher than the uni scalar grace based dsi demonstrating the better performance of sti than dsi much stronger relationships between multiscalar sti spi and spei with ndvi are observed globally compared with uni scalar scpdsi sm z r z and dsi especially in arid semiarid and dry subhumid regions such as western north america australia and south africa fig 8 the correlation coefficients between r z and ndvi are the lowest between drought indicators and ndvi in the areas where radiation illumination and temperature are the limiting factors for vegetable growth e g high latitude areas all seven indices show weak p 0 05 or negative relationships with ndvi karnieli et al 2010 sruthi and aslam 2015 we also calculate the optimal time scale between sti spi spei and ndvi corresponding to the best correlation coefficient between them fig 9 1 month sti has the highest correlations with ndvi in most of the areas with significant correlation in the globe especially in the southern hemisphere and low latitude near the equator the 36 month sti spi and spei tend to have better agreement with ndvi variations in the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere the time scales of spi and spei with the highest correlations vary across the globe in general 18 month spi is the best correlated with ndvi compared to the indices in other time scales spi and spei are meteorological drought indices that only consider the changes of precipitation and evapotranspiration scpdsi and sm z mainly reflects the dry wet condition of soil moisture r z represents the condition of runoff while sti is a hydrological drought index that reflects the deficit of tws which is a more straightforward indicator of water availability for vegetation growth furthermore the grace based sti is able to monitor the changes in tws caused by meteorological variables surface hydrological processes and human activities the multiscalar sti outperforms the uni scalar grace based dsi and multiscalar drought indices have considerably better agreement with ndvi changes compared with the uni scalar drought indices therefore multiscale sti shows stronger relationships with the vegetation changes in the areas where vegetation growth is limited by water 4 discussion 4 1 sti as a multiscalar standardized hydrological drought index based on easy accessed global hydrological measurements similarity and difference from other drought indices in nature in this study we propose a multiscalar sti to characterize the hydrological drought conditions the same as other multiscalar standardized drought indices e g spi and spei the proposed sti denotes the statistical deviation of a hydrological variable tws for sti which is an integration of groundwater soil moisture surface water snow and ice relative to its climatology therefore sti is directly comparable to the existing multiscalar standardized indices because they have the same statistical meanings although based on different hydrometeorological variables e g precipitation for spi and difference of precipitation and evapotranspiration for spei the proposed sti also owns the advantages of the multiscalar standardized indices it is comparable at multiple time scales and across different locations in our study sti is compared with spi spei scpdsi sm z r z and dsi and the indices can reach consensus on the temporal and spatial variations on droughts to some extent it shall be noted that these indices measure the drought conditions based on different statistics and different hydrological components in other words although these indices can detect drought signals the drought events identified may have different meanings e g deficit in different hydrological components the differences between sti from other indices can be explained by differences of their definitions for example short term sti as a tws based index tends to correlate with long term meteorological indices spi and spei because subsurface and surface hydrological components are reflections of the accumulative effects of meteorological changes the changes in sub surface components such as groundwater are affected by meteorological conditions months or even years ago more details about the comparison between sti and other indices can be found in the results and other parts of the discussion grace tws change can reveal water cycle variations caused by anthropogenic activities such as constructed dams and agricultural irrigation change haddeland et al 2014 for example by combining grace tws data with other auxiliary data long et al 2020 found china s south to north water diversion project has helped cumulatively increase groundwater volume by approximately 3 6 km3 during 2006 2018 in beijing which significantly alleviates beijing s water shortage long et al 2020 since sti is calculated based on tws it also reflects the impacts of human activities on the other hand spi and spei are meteorological variables e g precipitation and potential evapotranspiration which are less affected by human activities on the land surface this also contributes to the differences in the drought indicators data deficit is one of the major limitations of global scale studies of the existing hydrological indices based on observations of surface hydrological variables such as runoff and soil moisture the sti is based on grace resolutions which provide reliable and consistent tws observations with extensive spatial coverage at a global scale the tws measurements of grace can be easily accessed by the public since successfully launched in march 2002 grace has provided unprecedented observations of total hydrologic states and fluxes glacier ice soil moisture surface water groundwater etc at regional to global scales every month almost uninterruptedly from april 2002 to june 2017 wahr et al 2006 although sti is calculated based on csr grace the proposed sti algorithm can be directly applied to the other grace solutions e g jpl tellus and gfz and grace fo grace follow on the grace fo mission has been launched in may 2018 and continues to monitor gravity changes in the future and serve more products over the globe since june 2018 although the consistency of mass balance change records of grace and grace fo have been demonstrated ciracì et al 2020 velicogna et al 2020 there is a continuous data gap between grace and grace fo from july 2017 may 2018 to the best of our knowledge no centers have released solutions with interpolation of this gap because how to interpolate the data gap is still an emerging topic in the field li et al 2019 sun et al 2020 solutions in the future with continuous tws measurements combining grace and grace fo with interpolated gaps will be helpful to extend sti and other grace based drought indices 4 2 sti as a robust retroactive drought index our comparisons of sti with spi spei scpdsi sm z r z and dsi show that the seven drought indices though measure the deficits of different hydrological components reach consensus on the spatial distribution of the dryness across the globe the temporal variations of sti spi spei scpdsi sm z r z and dsi are comparable while sti tends to lag behind the meteorological variables and individual hydrological variables because of the lag time of the propagation from meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts and from single hydrological component drought to total tws deficit huang et al 2017 peters et al 2006 in major drought events such as the persistent millennium drought in australia sti shows more consistent and robust dryness with less noise than spi spei and scpdsi showing that sti is a reliable and robust indicator of drought conditions 1 month sti and uni scalar dsi is similar because both of them are calculated based on 1 month tws although the temporal distribution of dsi is similar to sti at short time scales the spatial characteristics displayed by dsi and sti are different such as the dry wet condition in central russia sti at 1 month scale and uni scalar dsi fail to capture the drought condition in central russia while sti at a longer time scale can capture the dry condition this suggests tws derived drought is an accumulative hydrological process that can develop for several months and therefore a multiscalar drought index is more appropriate for hydrological drought monitoring also compared with dsi the multiscalar properties of sti makes it easier to compare with other widely used standardized drought metrics i e spi and spei since they have the same statistical meanings even stand for different water components sti measures the statistical deficit of tws which is affected by the accumulation of long term shortage of meteorological variables therefore the short term sti has better agreement with long term spi and spei in terms of spatial distributions and temporal correlations for example the correlations are all almost above 0 70 when the time scale of spi spei is longer than that of sti worldwide the time scales at which sti and spi spei have higher correlations vary in different regions because of the differences in climatology and hydrology tws is an integration of multiple types of water components such as groundwater soil moisture surface water snow and ice the proportions and importance of these hydrological components are different across regions the response times of different water components to the changes in meteorological variables also vary therefore the relationships of time scales of sti with other drought indices are different across regions spi spei scpdsi dsi and sti represent different dry conditions that are triggered by precipitation deficit first and then propagated to different hydrological components through the hydrological cycle sti and dsi are based on direct tws change under climate change and anthropogenic activities while spi only reflects precipitation related drought spei considers the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration for drought assessment mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2010b and scpdsi is more sensitive to net water change derived by soil moisture van der schrier et al 2013 although the drought metrics vary similarly in time and space there is a clear time lag of sti as a hydrological drought index compared to spi and spei as meteorological drought indices because hydrological drought usually reacts later than meteorological drought apurv et al 2017 cook et al 2018 for example spi and spei are the first to detect the persistent 2010 2011 texas drought caused by precipitation deficit since october 2010 nielsen gammon 2012 and about three months later dsi and 1 month sti detect the dryness in surface hydrological components driven by consecutive dry weather this implies meteorological drought indices are more powerful in early detection and prediction of droughts compared to hydrological drought indices hydrological drought may occur if the dry weather conditions continue for a long time which may be detected by hydrological drought indices such as sti and dsi although sti responds later than spi and spei sti is more robust with less noise than spi and spei after hydrological drought occurs furthermore compared to dsi sti can exhibit the dryness wetness condition straightforwardly in the long term 4 3 sti as a drought index that effectively reflects variations in ndvi our results show significantly stronger relationships of multiscalar drought indices sti spi and spei with ndvi than the uni scalar indices scpdsi sm z r z and dsi although both derived from grace data the multiscale sti have better agreement with ndvi than the uni scalar dsi across the world suggesting multiple time scale drought metrics are important to understand the impacts of droughts on ecosystems and society for example vegetation growth and crop production are not just sensitive to the deficit of hydrological variables e g precipitation soil moisture and runoff in a month but also the antecedent wet dry conditions of these variables in the previous months different types of vegetation and crop are sensitive to the cumulative effects of hydrological variables for different periods the correlations of sti and ndvi are mostly 0 8 and significant at the 5 level fig 8 in cropland shrubland grassland and barren land regions fig 10 where water is the major limiting factor latham et al 2014 which is similar to the findings of ji and peters 2003 however the relationships are insignificant in forest covered areas owing to the water conservation capability of forests which makes the vegetation growth response later to climate change and tundra covered regions where the water balance system significantly affected by the global warming induced ice wedge degradation which may contribute to the decrease of some vegetation species e g moss and lichen or expansion of tall shrublands biao et al 2010 farooqi et al 2020 frost and epstein 2014 keleş 2019 liljedahl et al 2016 liu et al 2020 among the multiscalar drought indices 1 month sti has the highest correlations with ndvi while the time scales for spi and spei reaching the maximum correlations with ndvi vary across regions fig 10 spi and spei are meteorological drought indices that only consider the changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration meteorological drought in a short duration may not trigger detected impacts on vegetation growth since sti denotes the deficit of tws it is a more straightforward indicator of water availability for vegetation growth furthermore the grace based sti is able to reflect the changes in tws caused by changes in meteorological variables surface hydrological processes and human activities therefore sti shows better agreement with the monitored vegetation changes 5 conclusions we propose a multiscalar standardized terrestrial water storage index sti based on tws observations from the grace satellites sti is a hydrological drought index that reflects the deficit of the integration of subsurface and surface water components including groundwater soil moisture surface water etc at multiple time scales given the statistical nature of sti it can be comparable to other multiscale standardized drought indices e g spi and spei across time and space although caveats shall be made that these drought indices measure the wet dry conditions of different water components different from other observation based hydrological indices which are constrained by the limited availability of in situ hydrological measurements at the global scale sti can provide a global evaluation of drought conditions based on grace tws accessible to the public our comparisons between sti with spi spei scpdsi sm z r z and dsi show that sti is more robust in representing droughts with less noise than indices while meteorological drought indices spi and spei are powerful in early detection of drought events sti at short term time scales e g 3 and 6 months have higher correlations mostly 0 7 with spi spei at long term scales e g 18 and 24 months because tws is a reflection of the accumulative changes of meteorological variables multiscalar sti deficit of the integration of sub surface and surface hydrological components spi and spei deficit of meteorological variables outperform uni scalar drought indices scpdsi and sm z soil moisture as a surface component r z runoff as a surface component and dsi deficit of sub surface and surface hydrological components in representing ndvi changes the multiscale sti has better agreement with ndvi than the uni scalar grace based dsi across the world in this study we use csr grace to calculate sti the proposed sti algorithm can be directly applied to the other grace grace fo solutions such as those from jpl tellus and gfz credit authorship contribution statement aihong cui data curation investigation writing

4159,with a copula based probabilistic model this study presents a global view on the propagation of meteorological to soil moisture drought meta gaussian and three dimensional vine copulas were employed to construct the bivariate and trivariate conditional joint drought distributions respectively using the time series of standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and standardized soil moisture index smi derived from the global land data assimilation system gldas simulations three different cases including the probability and magnitude of soil moisture drought smi conditioned on 1 month meteorological drought spei1 seasonal meteorological drought spei3 and the joint effects of spei1 and antecedent soil moisture conditions smilag 1 were analyzed then the duration of soil moisture drought in response to meteorological drought and potentially affected cropland area were analyzed to assess potential agricultural impacts results showed that the likelihood of soil moisture drought conditioned on spei1 in the amazon rainforest southern and eastern china southeast asia southeastern united states and west africa was generally higher than in other regions under the impact of seasonal meteorological drought except for the qinghai tibet plateau in china northern russia and north africa the probability of soil moisture drought occurrence overall increased with significant increments in europe and north america the antecedent soil moisture condition also influenced the probability of drought propagation and this effect was particularly significant for northern china russia the u s midwest canada and australia spatially the western u s northern canada south africa eastern europe north china northern russia and most parts of australia present longer duration of soil moisture drought in response to meteorological drought comprehensive considerations of the conditional probability duration and potentially affected area of soil moisture drought for croplands revealed that among five continents south america was more vulnerable to agricultural drought under the condition of meteorological drought keywords drought propagation probability meteorological drought soil moisture drought 1 introduction drought is a recurring natural phenomenon that occurs in virtually every region of the world wilhite and glantz 1985 in the context of global warming recent years witnessed the growing frequency of extreme drought events e g the millennium drought in australia the 2010 droughts in amazon southwestern china and russia the 2011 droughts in texas mexico and east africa and the u s summer droughts in 2012 and 2016 which caused devastating impacts on agriculture economy and human society lewis et al 2011 schubert et al 2014 hao et al 2014 williams et al 2015 otkin et al 2018 liu et al 2020 to better cope with drought and alleviate its impacts it is essential to understand how droughts evolve and proceed at the atmosphere land interface using historical observations and model projections a multitude of studies have investigated the drying or wetting patterns at regional and global scales the drought conditions under climate change have been established using the long term series of various drought indices and their trends e g sheffield et al 2012 dai 2013 wang et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 several studies extracted historical droughts and analyzed their magnitude or characteristics duration intensity affected area and severity and spatiotemporal migration patterns using the threshold method sheffield and wood 2007 herrera estrada et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 gu et al 2020 focusing on the uncertainties in the assessment of drought some studies discussed the impacts of data selection e g length and temporal coverage of data set formulation of hydrological components e g evapotranspiration and drought indices trenberth et al 2014 these studies provided valuable insights into trends and characteristics of drought however the links between different drought types were neglected in their evaluation from the perspective of causative mechanisms the evolution of drought involves a complicated transition of moisture deficiencies the anomalous meteorological conditions resulting in precipitation deficit and expanding evaporative demand can travel through the terrestrial part of the hydrological cycle leading to the depletion of soil moisture and ultimately developing into a hydrological drought van loon 2015 liu et al 2017 han et al 2019 hellwig et al 2020 wu et al 2020 the transition of drought signal from one type of drought to another is referred to as drought propagation haslinger et al 2014 apurv et al 2017 this suggests that a certain region may suffer more than one drought type at the same time although several studies investigated the nexus between different drought types and drought propagation features e g van loon and van lanen 2012 wong et al 2013 yang et al 2017 liu et al 2019 these were mostly case studies and a global evaluation of drought status with the consideration of propagation behavior was rare in this study we focused on soil moisture drought as the direct successor of meteorological drought and used a probabilistic method to depict the process of drought propagation from a global perspective two issues were addressed one referred to the probability of soil moisture drought conditioned on meteorological drought to recognize globally sensitive regions vulnerable to meteorological drought and the other referred to the characteristics of soil moisture droughts based on the established conditional joint distributions including the probable magnitude of soil moisture drought i e the extent to which the soil moisture condition may be drying given meteorological drought at different severity levels the extended duration of soil moisture droughts in response to meteorological droughts and potential agricultural drought risk analysis the reminder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a brief description of the study area and data used in this study section 3 describes the probabilistic model for inferring the probability of soil moisture drought and the corresponding drought characteristics given meteorological drought under various scenarios section 4 presents the results section 5 discusses the findings and conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 data 2 1 global land data assimilation system the global land data assimilation system gldas is designed to provide globally estimated land surface fluxes and storages of water and energy e g actual evapotranspiration soil moisture surface runoff and subsurface runoff with finer spatiotemporal resolutions rodell et al 2004 the version 1 of gldas hereafter gldas 1 includes four land surface models i e the mosaic noah clm and vic evaluation of the gldas 1 showed that it introduced unnatural trends and led to highly uncertain forcing fields in 1995 1997 as a result of the switched forcing data sources aimed at creating more climatologically consistent data sets recently the version 2 of gldas hereafter gldas 2 was released with the enhancement of updated model version only the simulations of the noah model are available and land surface parameters the gldas 2 consists of 3 hour daily and monthly generated through temporal averaging or summation of the 3 hour products products at 0 25 and 1 0 spatial resolutions it has two different forcing data derived components one refers to the gldas 2 0 which was run entirely with the princeton meteorological forcing data and the other was forced with a combination of model and observation based forcing data sets hereafter gldas 2 1 in this study the monthly product including precipitation potential evapotranspiration pet and soil moisture of gldas 2 0 gldas noah10 m 2 0 was used for drought analysis this product was generated through the temporal averaging of reprocessed 3 hour data and is currently available from january 1948 to december 2015 2 2 international soil moisture network the international soil moisture network ismn https ismn geo tuwien ac at en is an integrated system which hosts globally quality controlled and harmonized in situ soil moisture measurements from various ground validation campaigns and operational networks dorigo et al 2011 since its establishment the ismn has experienced a rapid growth with increasing number of participating networks and stations at present ismn contains data of 59 operational networks and 8398 field observation stations the database stored includes soil water contents of different soil layers in units of volumetric soil moisture m3 m 3 and relevant hydrometeorological variables e g precipitation and air and soil temperatures and serves as an important resource for validating satellite retrievals and land surface model based soil moisture products in this study the ismn was used to validate the soil moisture datasets from gldas although the time period of the entire products in ismn spanned from 1952 until the present the long term time series of in situ soil moisture observations on a global basis are still insufficient for instance rather limited data are available in africa and south america daily soil moisture data from ismn were aggregated into monthly averages and 2455 sites with the temporal data coverage exceeding 120 months were selected to validate the accuracy of gldas see fig 1 for spatial distribution 2 3 esa cci land cover dataset the global land cover product released by the european space agency esa climate change initiative cci https www esa landcover cci org is employed for investigating the ground information with the objective of providing a consistent historical land cover dataset for climate modeling related issues this product is developed by merging multiple earth observation products of the esa the esa cci land cover dataset contains 24 consistent global land cover maps on an annual basis from 1992 to 2015 and the spatial resolution is 300 m for defining land cover classes the united nations land cover classification system which describes the terrestrial land surface in 37 original classes is adopted defourny et al 2017 with strict quality control and validation the accuracy of the esa cci land cover product is approximately 71 1 with particularly high values ranging between 83 and 92 for cropland related classes defourny et al 2017 in this study the most recent map series namely the map of 2015 v2 0 7 was used for analysis given a close relationship between cropland and soil moisture drought we mainly focused on three land cover types i e rainfed cropland irrigated cropland and a mixture of cropland and natural vegetation 3 methods 3 1 standardized drought index the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and standardized soil moisture index smi sheffield et al 2004 were employed to decipher meteorological and soil moisture droughts respectively these two drought indices follow the mathematical algorithm of the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 which uses the normal quantile transformation to standardize the index namely to make the drought index spatiotemporally comparable the difference between the two indices mainly lies in the variables incorporated for estimating the moisture status for spei the difference between precipitation and pet was taken as input while for smi only the soil moisture content was considered like spi spei and smi can also be calculated at multiple time scales by accumulating the moisture deficits in any predetermined time period e g 1 24 months the smi and spei share the same classification criteria values of the index less than 0 5 correspond to mild drought less than 1 to moderate drought less than 1 5 to severe drought and less than 2 to extreme drought in this study smi was accumulated at a 1 month time scale and spei was accumulated at 1 month and 3 month time scales respectively denoted as spei1 and spei3 to investigate the influence of meteorological moisture deficits in the current month and its cumulative effect on the soil moisture drought 3 2 probabilistic drought analysis using copulas copulas are widely used for constructing the joint distributions due to their flexibility to model the dependence structure among random variables regardless of their marginals according to sklar s theorem for n dimensional continuous random variables x1 xn with marginal cumulative distributions f1 x1 fn xn there always exists an n copula which can combine these univariate marginal distributions into a joint distribution function nelsen 2007 1 h x 1 x n c f 1 x 1 f n x n c u 1 u n where h represents the joint distribution of random variables c is the copula function satisfying 0 1 n 0 1 fi xi denoted by ui i 1 n in the copula function represents the marginal distribution the joint density function f x1 xn can be decomposed using the copula density function as 2 f x 1 x n i 1 n f x i c u 1 u n where fi xi and c represent the marginal probability density of the marginal function and the copula function respectively based on the copula concept the conditional distribution of these variables can be derived to realize probabilistic drought prediction by establishing the nonlinear dependence between the predictand and predictors in this study we used variables x 1 x 2 x 3 to represent meteorological drought spei antecedent soil moisture condition denoted as smilag 1 and soil moisture drought smi respectively by constructing their joint distributions we investigated the probability of soil moisture drought under different scenarios 1 the probability of soil moisture drought x 3 conditioned on meteorological drought x 1 2 the probability of soil moisture drought x 3 conditioned on meteorological drought x 1 and antecedent soil moisture condition x 2 fig 2 presents the framework of copula based probabilistic drought analysis obviously the first scenario belongs to a bivariate case and the meta gaussian copula was employed to construct the joint distribution for the second scenario vine copulas were selected to establish the trivariate joint distribution detailed formulas for the above two types of copulas are given below 3 2 1 meta gaussian copula given the capability of the gaussian copula for modeling both positive and negative dependences among random variables the bivariate form of the gaussian copula was employed to construct the joint distribution of x1 x3 3 c u 1 u 3 φ 2 φ 1 u 1 φ 1 u 3 φ 1 u 1 φ 1 u 3 1 2 π 1 ρ 2 exp t 2 2 ρ s t s 2 2 1 ρ 2 d s d t where φ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution function and φ 1 represents the corresponding inverse function ρ is the dependence parameter for the gaussian copula s and t are integral variables accordingly the conditional distribution of x3 given x1 x1 or u1 given u1 can be expressed as 4 p x 3 x 3 x 1 x 1 c u 1 u 3 u 1 u u for the meta gaussian copula the conditional distribution in equation 4 can be expressed as aas et al 2009 5 p x 3 x 3 x 1 x 1 φ φ 1 u 3 ρ φ 1 u 1 ρ 2 since both x 1 and x 3 are the standardized drought indices i e normally distributed it is generally reasonable to assume a multivariate normal distribution function to model their joint behavior wilks 2011 hao et al 2016 accordingly for normal random variables x1 and x3 with the joint normal distribution the analytical form of the conditional distribution of x3 given x1 is given as 6 x 3 x 1 ñ μ x 3 x 1 σ x 3 x 1 where μ x3 x1 and x3 x1 represent the conditional mean i e the peak of the conditional probability density distribution curve in fig 2 and is referred to as the most probable predicted value and conditional covariance matrix respectively which can be derived as 7 μ x 3 x 1 μ x3 σ x 3 x 1 σ x 1 x 1 1 x μ x 1 8 σ x 3 x 1 σ x 3 x 3 σ x 3 x 1 σ x 1 x 1 1 σ x 1 x 3 where μ x 1 and μ x 3 are means of x1 and x3 and x 1 x 1 x 1 x 3 x 3 x 1 and x 3 x 3 are the covariance matrix detailed formulas for calculating the covariance matrix can be found in hao et al 2016 2017 3 2 2 vine copula vine copulas are effective tools for modeling flexible dependences in high dimensions without requiring a conditional independence assumption aas et al 2009 liu et al 2016 liu et al 2018 due to its flexibility in dependence modeling the vine copula shows its superiority for constructing the conditional dependence asymmetries and tail dependence these copulas are based on pair copula constructions pccs which decompose an n dimensional multivariate density into n n 1 2 bivariate copula densities aas et al 2009 for a vine copula structure n n 1 2 pair copulas are arranged in n 1 trees kurowicka and cooke 2006 brechmann et al 2013 there are two general types of vine copulas i e canonical vines c vines and drawable vines d vines in this study we used the c vines to construct the joint distribution the n dimensional density corresponding to a canonical vine is given by aas et al 2009 9 f x 1 x n i 1 n f x i i 1 n 1 j 1 n i c i i j 1 i 1 f x i x 1 x i 1 f x i j x 1 x i 1 where f x 1 xn denotes the joint density function f x i are the marginal densities and ci i j 1 i 1 represents the bivariate copula densities to construct the c vine copula five bivariate copulas i e student t gaussian clayton frank and gumbel hougaard were selected as candidate pair copulas and the optimal one for each pair copula was chosen through the akaike information criterion schepsmeier and brechmann 2015 for the trivariate case the three dimensional density function can be decomposed into three bivariate copula densities and their margins 10 f 123 f 1 f 2 f 3 c 12 c 13 c 23 1 where c 12 is the abbreviated form of c 1 2 f x 1 f x 2 the following step was used to to compute the conditional distribution functions and conditional bivariate copulas in equation 10 according to joe 1996 and aas et al 2009 the conditional distribution function f x w for an m dimensional vector w w 1 wm can be obtained through the following recursive function 11 h x w f x w c x w j w j f x w j f w j w j f w j w j where wj j 1 m denotes any element in w w j represents the vector without element wj and cxwj w j is the bivariate copula function let ui i 1 n f xi then the trivariate case of the conditional distribution function in equation 11 can be written as 12 f u 3 u 1 u 2 c u 3 u 2 u 1 f u 3 u 1 f u 2 u 1 f u 2 u 1 let f u 3 u 1 h u 3 u 1 c u 3 u 1 f u 3 f u 1 f u 1 and f u 2 u 1 h u 2 u 1 c u 2 u 1 f u 2 f u 1 f u 1 accordingly equation 12 can be written as 13 f u 3 u 1 u 2 h h u 3 u 1 h u 2 u 1 the inverse form of equation 13 can be applied for conditional simulations taking the bivariate case as an example assuming h u 2 u 1 is the conditional distribution function of two random variables x 1 and x 2 for fixed probabilities τ e g τ 0 05 0 1 0 95 u 2 can be estimated through an explicit function u 2 c u 2 u 1 1 τ u 1 h 1 τ u 1 where c u 2 u 1 1 is the inverse of τ quantile curve of the copula chen et al 2009 xu and childs 2013 liu et al 2015 the τth copula based conditional quantile function of variable x 2 can be written as 14 x 2 τ x 1 f 1 c u 2 u 1 1 τ u 1 f 1 h 1 τ u 1 where f 1 is the inverse of u 2 similarly for the trivariate case the variable x 3 given variables x 1 and x 2 can be derived as 15 x 3 τ x 1 x 2 f 1 h 1 h 1 τ h u 2 u 1 θ 12 θ 23 1 u 1 θ 13 where θ 12 is the parameter of joint distribution c 12 which measures the dependency of underlying conditional variables x 1 x 2 likewise θ 13 and θ 23 1 represent the parameters of c 13 and c 23 1 respectively to obtain the best estimation of x 3 the monte carlo simulations were employed to generate 1000 random numbers i e τ over the interval 0 1 then equation 15 was used to compute 1000 estimated values of x 3 and the mean value was considered as the best estimate of x 3 3 3 framework the framework of copula based drought propagation analysis is presented in fig 2 employing the time series of spei 1 month and 3 month time scales of spei were employed and smi 1 month time scale generated from the gldas simulations and ismn soil moisture observations the bivariate and trivariate conditional joint distributions were constructed with meta gaussion copula and c vine copula respectively taking the case of smi and spei1 as an example the values of p smi spei1 derived from gldas simulations were evaluated against those of ismn in situ measurements then from a global perspective the probability and most probable magnitude of soil moisture drought smi under varying scenarios were analyzed these included the bivariate cases modeled by using the meta gaussian copula i e the probability of soil moisture drought conditioned on 1 month meteorological drought spei1 3 month meteorological drought spei3 and the triavariate case derived from vine copulas i e the joint effects of spei1 and the antecedent soil moisture status smilag 1 finally based on the esa cci land cover map a further investigation into the proportion of affected cropland area given meteorological drought was carried out to analyze the potential agricultural drought impacts 4 results 4 1 gldas and in situ comparison to provide a direct assessment on the performance of gldas in estimating the probability of drought propagation the conditional probabilities derived from gldas simulations were evaluated against those of ismn stations as an example fig 3 exhibits the relationship between soil moisture and meteorological droughts of different severity levels i e moderate severe and extreme droughts when spei smi was no more than 1 1 5 and 2 respectively for the current month i e spei1 was employed the grey error bars in the figure represent the condition when several ismn stations are located in the same grid cell of gldas and the probabilities derived from gldas would correspond to a couple of ismn based values as expected some disparities were observed between the two estimated probability series with certain scatters from the 1 1 line the scale mismatch between grid based gldas data and point based ismn could be one reason in particular for areas where soil moisture exhibited large spatial heterogeneity the estimated probability values could vary significantly from one site to another these sites were located in the same grid cell of gldas such as the large error bars in fig 3 in addition since most series of ismn were intermittent the different temporal coverages of soil moisture data employed for constructing the propagation relationship might also contribute to the discrepancies aside from the above mentioned aspects there was generally a good agreement between the probabilities estimated from gldas and ismn with the majority of scatters distributed around the 1 1 line implying that the spatial pattern for the probability of drought propagation revealed by these two data sets were basically comparable 4 2 probability of soil moisture drought the probability of drought propagation from meteorological to soil moisture under three different cases was analyzed based on smi and spei1 the spatial patterns of drought propagation from meteorological to soil moisture for the current month were first detected then spei1 was replaced with spei3 to analyze the effect of seasonal meteorological droughts on soil moisture droughts depletion of soil moisture storage is related to the initial condition of soil layer and in the third case the antecedent soil moisture status was also employed as a conditional variable for constructing the joint distribution 4 2 1 probability of soil moisture drought conditioned on meteorological drought fig 4 shows the probability of soil moisture drought given meteorological drought for the current month spei1 under eight scenarios specifically panels in the same row exhibit the varying probabilities of soil moisture drought given gradually enhanced signal of meteorological drought i e conditioned on moderate severe and extreme meteorological drought from left to right while panels in the same column present the varying probabilities of soil moisture drought at mild moderate and severe levels respectively given the same condition of meteorological drought taking the case of the first row as an example fig 4a c and f the probability of soil moisture drought occurrence significantly increased conditioned on meteorological drought of severity levels from moderate to extreme implying that the likelihood of soil moisture drought tended to be higher when the climatic condition was drier in particular the scenario in fig 4f reflected a typical condition where most regions of the world except the extremely dry north africa and extremely cold northeastern areas in russia exhibited rather high values with probabilities above 0 6 for the case under on an extreme condition implying that meteorological drought of an extreme level was very likely to propagate into soil moisture drought at a large scale with globally low values around 0 1 0 3 for fig 4b and e they revealed another phenomenon that the likelihood of soil moisture drought at the same severity level as meteorological drought was generally low besides different regional behaviors on the probability of drought propagation could also be observed spatially the amazon rainforest southern and eastern china southeast asia southeastern united states west and central africa were more sensitive to meteorological drought with the probabilities of soil moisture drought two to three fold higher than were other regions fig 4g fig 5 shows the probability of soil moisture drought conditioned on spei3 it can be seen that except for the cases of soil moisture drought at the same severity level as meteorological drought fig 5b e the probability of drought propagation under the seasonal meteorological drought overall increased compared with fig 4 spatially europe and north america were two major regions which exhibited significant changes taking the occurrence of soil moisture drought given a severe condition fig 5c as an example compared to the pattern in fig 4c the probability of soil moisture drought given severe meteorological drought in europe largely increased with the values varying from 0 5 to 0 8 the change in north america was mainly manifested as the enlarged area from the southeastern united states to the entire north america region fig 4c and 5c with higher probability values to explore the underlying reasons for such a spatial pattern the regionally averaged time series of spei and smi in different climate regions were analyzed it can be seen that for the amazon rainforest which presents the highest value of conditional probability the smi is sensitive to the changes of climatic condition and varies synchronously with spei fig 6 a a general good agreement between smi and spei were also observed in europe however for minor meteorological droughts such as the 1999 drought event right panel in fig 6b the soil moisture presents no response to the dry climate condition similarly the cases for the eastern and western u s fig 7 also suggests a good consistency between the time series of spei and smi contributes to high conditional probability in contrast the qinghai tibet plateau in china northern russia and north africa were less affected by the seasonal cumulative water deficits and maintained rather low probability values around 0 1 0 4 even under an extreme meteorological drought fig 5f this may be related to the specific climate and geographical conditions of these regions the qinghai tibet plateau in china and northern russia are typical permafrost and snow covered regions where snow or permafrost acts as a natural reservoir to store water when the temperature is below zero and to release water to ameliorate water shortage as a result of snowmelt this leads to the land surface e g soil moisture and runoff may have a slower response to meteorological drought than other regions van loon and van lanen 2012 qi et al 2020 liu et al 2020 as for the north africa it is the driest area in the world with annual mean precipitation no more than 50 mm under this tropical desert climate the soil layer maintains a dry status all the year around and is insensitive to the changes of climatic condition 4 2 2 probability of soil moisture drought conditioned on meteorological drought and antecedent soil moisture condition based on equations 10 13 the probability of soil moisture drought conditioned on meteorological drought and previous smi values denoted as smilag 1 can be derived fig 8 shows the likelihood of soil moisture conditioned on meteorological droughts and normal antecedent soil moisture conditions 0 5 smilag 1 0 5 comparing to the patterns in fig 4 it can be seen that globally the probability values of soil moisture drought under the joint condition of moderate severe and extreme meteorological drought and normal antecedent soil moisture status generally decreased with significant reduction from 0 5 0 6 to 0 1 0 2 in northern china russia the american midwest canada and australia the significant changes for the conditional probability of soil moisture drought in these regions are possibly related to the soil moisture temperature coupling effect according to the geographical definition these regions are mostly transitional regions where soil moisture has been shown to have a strong influence on the land atmospheric interactions via the soil moisture temperature coupling effect seneviratne et al 2010 this includes the feedback loops that a positive anomaly of temperature in response to a negative soil moisture anomaly and increased temperature leads to a higher vapor pressure deficit and evaporative demand variations in these climate factors may contribute to a potential increase in evapotranspiration despite the dry conditions which possibly leading to a further decrease in soil moisture obviously soil moisture plays a key role for the drought propagation process from meteorological to soil moisture through its impact on land energy and water balances in transitional regions exceptional cases were observed for the amazon rainforest southern and eastern china southeastern united states west africa and southeast asia where the probability values above 0 7 were as high as in fig 4 indicating that the effect of antecedent soil moisture in these regions was generally minor 4 3 magnitude of soil moisture drought apart from the probability of soil moisture drought it is also essential to figure out the most probable magnitude of drought e g moderate or severe drought which has significance for drought mitigation and drought early warning based on the conditional probability distribution the smi values could be estimated through equations 7 and 15 for the bivariate i e smi conditioned on spei and trivariate cases i e smi conditioned on spei and smilag 1 respectively this may produce smi values of a wide range but with different probabilities see the conditional probability density distribution curve in fig 2 for example supposing the estimated range of smi under a severe meteorological drought i e 1 5 spei 2 is 1 5 to 0 3 this suggests the magnitude of soil moisture drought might be one of the normal mild and moderate drought categories from the conditional probability density distribution curve we can see that the likelihood becomes larger when the interval of estimated smi values getting close to the mean obviously the interval of estimated smi values mostly close to mean is the most probable magnitude of a soil moisture drought and is exactly the information we are concerned fig 9 exhibits the extent to which the soil moisture condition may be drying under six different scenarios it can be seen that the estimated magnitude of soil moisture drought conditioned on spei1 was generally comparable to that conditioned on spei1 and smilag 1 e g fig 9a versus 9d for most parts of the world a moderate meteorological drought may cause little effect on the soil moisture condition while severe and extreme meteorological drought may lead to mild soil moisture drought however for sensitive regions such as the amazon rainforest southern and eastern china west africa southeastern united states and southeast asia a mild soil moisture drought is likely to occur given moderate meteorological drought and the soil moisture condition may become more drier given severe or extreme meteorological drought 4 4 extended duration of soil moisture drought the duration of soil moisture droughts provides important information for estimating potential drought impacts on crop productivity to investigate how the meteorological droughts affect the duration of soil moisture drought fig 10 compares the average duration of soil moisture drought events smi1 against that of meteorological drought events spei1 positive values indicate soil moisture drought lasts longer than meteorological drought and negative values indicate soil moisture drought lasts shorter than meteorological drought as shown in fig 10 for most regions of the world the duration of soil moisture drought is overall longer than that of meteorological drought this phenomenon is generally consistent with findings of previous studies e g van loon 2015 which claimed that the duration of drought would be lengthened during the drought propagation process from atmosphere to the land surface given different climates and underlying surfaces the terrestrial water storage e g soil moisture surface water and groundwater may present different responses with lengthened duration of varying degrees spatially the western u s northern canada south africa eastern europe north china northern russia and most parts of australia present larger values where the average duration of soil moisture drought events are more than three months longer than that of meteorological drought events the time series of spei3 and smi1 for selected regions in figs 6 and 7 also revealed this difference in terms of drought duration for instance from figs 6 and 7 it can also be seen that in regions with low conditional probabilities like europe and western u s climatically europe is drier than amazon and western u s is drier than eastern u s although the meteorological droughts do not immediately initiate soil moisture droughts once the soil moisture droughts do get initiated they last longer than meteorological droughts this is consistent with findings in sheffield et al 2004 which also showed higher persistence of soil moisture droughts in western u s compared to eastern u s several grids in the west and north africa are the exception where negative values were observed this suggests the soil moisture drought events on average persist shorter than meteorological drought events meanwhile it should be noted that the uncertainties of gldas in west and north africa may also be responsible for these negative values see details in section 5 1 4 5 global agricultural drought impact analysis soil moisture has a close relationship with crop productivity and one of the major impacts of soil moisture drought is agricultural losses croplands which threaten the food security when a meteorological drought occurs the likelihood of a soil moisture drought in different regions could be estimated through their conditional joint distributions the occurrence of a soil moisture drought means reduced supply of moisture to the cropland thus estimated conditional probability of the dry condition in soil layer may have some implications for recognizing the potential agricultural drought impacts besides the duration of soil moisture drought reflecting the persistence of moisture deficits of the soil layer and its spatial coverage reflecting how much area suffers from droughts are also informative for estimating the strength of agricultural impacts in this section comprehensive considerations of drought propagation features including the conditional probability extended duration and affected area of soil moisture droughts in response to meteorological droughts for croplands were provided to assess globally potential agricultural drought impacts fig 11 presents the spatial distribution of croplands and the proportion of affected crop area by mild moderate severe and extreme drought given meteorological drought indicated by spei1 for globe and each continent as shown in fig 11a according to the esa cci land cover dataset v2 0 7 asia mainly distributed in china india and southeast asia ranked first among the five continents which accounted for 34 of the global cropland area followed by europe 22 africa 17 north america 13 south america 11 and oceania 3 from a global perspective fig 11b it can be seen that a moderate meteorological drought may lead to approximately 44 of the crop area falling under soil moisture drought and the potential agricultural drought impacts may be further enlarged 78 of the crop area for mild drought and 10 for moderate drought given a severe meteorological drought i e spei 2 when the climatic condition becomes extreme the affected crop area may increase to 98 with 60 for mild drought 35 for moderate drought and 3 for severe drought as the largest crop production base asia generally presents a pattern similar to that of the globe conditioned on a moderate and severe meteorological drought however for the extreme scenario 7 of the crop area may suffer from severe drought which is two fold higher than the global value fig 11c with regard to drought duration fig 10 suggests the north china on average presents higher persistence of soil moisture droughts may last for three to six months in response to meteorological droughts and are more vulnerable to agricultural disaster than other regions of asia for europe the affected crop area rapidly reaches up to 97 under a moderate meteorological drought i e 1 spei1 1 5 although such increments are mostly under mild dry condition fig 11d the moisture deficits may cause substantial damages for crop production given the overall long extended duration persist three to six months on average and negative anomalies of soil moisture over a long time especially in growing seasons may be harmful for crop growths of soil moisture droughts in this continent fig 10 in terms of africa and north america the affected crop area conditioned on different values of spei1 is slightly lower than that of the globe fig 11e f and the middle u s is more likely to suffer agricultural losses in consideration of the longer duration of soil moisture droughts in this region fig 10 the case for south america is not optimistic either although fig 10 suggests the soil moisture drought for cropland in this continent would not persist for a long time it may also induce large agricultural impacts when referring to the affected area of each drought category as shown in fig 11g 77 of the crop area may fall under drought given a mild meteorological drought i e 0 5 spei1 1 while 69 may suffer from moderate drought when spei1 is no more than 2 these proportion values are approximately two fold higher than the global average suggesting that south america is more vulnerable to agricultural drought than other continents 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainties some uncertainties may exist for the derived results regarding the selection of drought indices time series of drought indices selected for constructing the conditional probability distribution and gldas datasets first spei was employed in which precipitation and pet are treated equally for calculating the atmospheric moisture condition several previous studies claimed that the role of pet would be overestimated for estimating the dry status particularly in arid zones e g cook et al 2014 ma et al 2014 to evaluate the impact of spei on the probability of drought propagation the derived results were compared with those derived from spi we found in most regions of the world the probability of soil moisture drought derived from spei is very close to that derived from spi which also suggest high probabilities in the amazon rainforest southern and eastern china southeast asia southeastern u s west and central africa see supplementary figures s1 and s2 major differences are mainly located in water limited regions e g the north africa and northwestern china where the probability of soil moisture drought derived from spei is about 0 2 lower than those from spi fig 12 for arid areas pet i e the evaporative demand by the atmosphere which represents the highest possible evapotranspiration commonly far exceeds the actual moisture supply which may lead to the overestimation of the actual amount of water transferred to the atmosphere raible et al 2017 this leads to the climatic condition indicated by spei may present a dry signal but the soil moisture would not make a response resulted in a lower probability value than derived from spi second the conditional probabilities were calculated by using complete time series of spei and smi and there are uncertainties for estimating agricultural impacts fig 11 since the periods of drought indices in growing seasons are more relevant for obtaining realistic implications of drought propagation to evaluate the influence of time series the conditional probabilities by using data of growing seasons were compared against those from complete time series according to the frequency distributions of the probability of soil moisture drought conditioned on moderate meteorological drought indicated by spei1 as an example in fig 13 it can be seen that the probability values derived from data of growing seasons red dashed line overall increase by 0 1 comparing to those derived from complete time series the blue dashed line fig 14 exhibits the spatial distribution of probability differences except for northern canada south africa western and southern russia where the absolute values of probability difference range between 0 1 and 0 2 for most regions of the world the differences of probability values would not exceed 0 05 plus or minus this suggests there would be tiny differences for estimated probability values between complete series and data of growing seasons but the associated global patterns of drought propagation e g fig 4 11 would not change in a significant way finally limitations of the land surface model e g the inadequate consideration of snow related processes in cold regions and irrigation schemes used in gldas also influence the quality of the simulated datasets and therefore for the conditional probability for instance comparing to in situ observations chen et al 2013 found the four gldas models do not perform well in simulating the surface soil moisture in central tibetan plateau agutu et al 2017 assessed the performance of gldas in characterizing agricultural drought in east african and found gldas perform well in tanzania but mischaracterized the 2005 2006 drought in kenyan and ugandan zaitchik et al 2010 evaluated the performance of gldas in terms of global river discharge and found poor performances in congo river and high latitude basins with snowmelt which may have associated effects on the accuracy of soil moisture estimates in addition the land surface models used in gldas do not include the modules of irrigation schemes a common drawback for most global model simulation products and there are uncertainties for irrigated cropland fig 11 for instance based on hydrological model simulations several previous studies found irrigation leads to increased evapotranspiration decreased runoff increased surface soil moisture and decreased streamflow haddeland et al 2006 ozdogan et al 2010 shah et al 2021 from a climatic perspective several studies found irrigation would impact the water and energy balance near the ground making the near surface atmosphere cooler and moister than non irrigated areas kueppers et al 2007 mishra et al 2020 this cooling effect may create a favorable condition for drought propagation therefore we may speculate that the probability of soil moisture drought under meteorological drought may be underestimated to some extent for irrigated croplands e g northern india and the north china in growing seasons in spite of such limitations kim et al 2020 found the soil moisture datasets from gldas generally perform better than certain satellite based soil moisture products over moderately irrigated areas and is recommended for use when ground based soil moisture data are not available in future researches it is necessary to conduct regional studies by using more sophisticated hydrological models in high resolution to reflect more realistic information of drought propagation for irrigated croplands 5 2 implications previous studies for analyzing the process of drought propagation from meteorological to agricultural or hydrological mostly focused on the drought characteristics of different types with some features associated with lagging lengthening and attenuation recognized van loon 2015 apurv et al 2017 liu et al 2019 from a probabilistic perspective this study uses a copula based model to estimate the likelihood of soil moisture droughts conditioned on meteorological droughts of varying severity levels this probability value could be interpreted as the strength of drought signal during the propagation process where higher values imply that most of the drought information would be conveyed into the territorial hydrological system and soil moisture droughts are more likely to be initiated if a meteorological drought occurs it should be noted that this probability value has essential distinctions from aridity or the frequency of droughts as shown in fig 4 humid regions such as the amazon rainforest and southern china present higher probability values than arid regions such as the north africa this phenomenon is not in contradiction with previous findings associated with the global patterns of drying trends e g arid lands become more drier instead fig 4 suggests that under the same meteorological drought conditions regions in higher probability values like the amazon rainforest and southern china are more vulnerable to soil moisture drought than north africa in this study we found the likelihood of soil moisture drought conditioned on spei1 was generally higher in amazon rainforest southern and eastern china southeast asia southeastern united states and west africa than in other regions comparison of spei and smi in different climate regions suggests for high probability regions the time series of smi generally presents a good consistency with spei and is sensitive to the changes of climate condition figs 6 7 from a climatic perspective these regions are mostly in subtropical and tropical climate with sufficient precipitation i e water supply and high temperature i e evaporative demand a climatic dry spell suggests less water input i e precipitation deficiency is transported to the terrestrial system at the same time pet may also increase resulted from increased temperature radiation wind speed etc which can lead to boosted actual evapotranspiration with an extra loss of water from soil vegetation or open water bodies seneviratne et al 2010 all these contribute to the depletion of soil moisture which may further develop into a soil moisture drought the moisture and heat condition produces a close hydraulic relation among precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture chagas and chaffe 2018 yang et al 2018 leading to a strong nexus between meteorological and soil moisture droughts similar to previous studies e g vicente serrano et al 2005 peña gallardo et al 2019 which related accumulated spei of varying time scales to hydrological variables the time scale effect of droughts was also observed in this study as shown in fig 5 the north america and europe present significant increments in the probability values of soil moisture drought conditioned on spei3 than those conditioned on spei1 fig 4 this reflects the cumulative effects of meteorological water deficits on drought propagation meanwhile the enhanced probabilistic link under spei3 in these regions also indicate a lagged or slower response of soil moisture to the climatic condition than regions of high probability values e g the amazon rainforest this phenomenon agrees with findings in bachmair et al 2018 which also suggest the 3 month meteorological drought indices are best linked to agricultural and forest droughts apart from the current meteorological condition we found that the antecedent soil moisture status also influences the probability of drought propagation comparing to the patterns in fig 4 fig 8 shows that under the joint condition of meteorological droughts indicated by spei1 and normal antecedent soil moisture status 0 5 smilag 1 0 5 the likelihood of soil moisture drought significantly decreases in the northern china the u s midwest australia russia and canada according to the geographical definition these regions are mostly transitional regions where soil moisture has been shown to have a strong influence on the land atmospheric interactions via the soil moisture temperature coupling effect seneviratne et al 2010 this includes the feedback loops that a positive anomaly of temperature in response to a negative soil moisture anomaly and increased temperature contributes to a higher vapor pressure deficit and evaporative demand which possibly leading to a further decrease in soil moisture van loon 2015 this shows the key role of soil moisture in affecting the land energy and water balances in transitional regions which is also the core content of drought propagation process from meteorological to soil moisture findings in this study highlight the varied responses of soil moisture to meteorological drought under different moisture conditions both the atmospheric and the antecedent soil moisture status despite the uncertainties discussed above the probability of drought propagation provides some implications for recognizing the potential impacts of soil droughts fig 11 which also has scientific guidance for water security assessment and drought management ongoing analysis on the propagation behavior in different stages e g onset recover of drought and the seasonality in different regions are needed for improving the understanding of drought propagation mechanism 6 conclusions in this study a copula based probabilistic model i e the meta gaussian and vine copulas for bivariate and trivariate cases respectively was employed to illustrate the propagation of meteorological to soil moisture drought three different cases including the probability of soil moisture drought smi conditioned on 1 month meteorological drought spei1 seasonal meteorological drought spei3 and the joint effects of spei1 and antecedent soil moisture conditions smilag 1 were investigated based on the established conditional joint distributions the characteristics of drought propagation including the probable magnitude of soil moisture drought i e the extent to which the soil moisture condition may be drying the extended duration of soil moisture droughts in response to meteorological droughts and potential agricultural drought risks were analyzed results showed that the likelihood of soil moisture drought given spei1 tended to be higher when the meteorological condition was drier spatially the amazon rainforest southern and eastern china southeast asia southeastern united states and west africa were more sensitive to meteorological drought with high probabilities under the impact of seasonal meteorological drought the probability of soil moisture drought occurrence overall increased with significant increments in europe and north america in contrast the qinghai tibet plateau in china northern russia and north africa were less affected and maintained rather low probability values when conditioned on spei1 the antecedent soil moisture condition also influenced the probability of drought propagation and this effect was particularly significant for northern china russia the american midwest canada and australia in terms of the probable magnitude of soil moisture drought a moderate meteorological drought may cause little effect on the soil moisture condition while severe and extreme meteorological drought may lead to mild soil moisture drought for most parts of the world investigation on drought duration suggests the persistence of drought would be lengthened during the drought propagation process from meteorological to soil moisture with spatially longer duration of soil moisture drought in the western u s northern canada south africa eastern europe north china northern russia and most parts of australia a further investigation into the affected cropland area revealed that a moderate meteorological drought may lead to approximately 44 of the cropland falling under drought and the potential agricultural drought impacts may be further enlarged 78 of the crop area for mild drought and 10 for moderate drought given severe meteorological drought when the climatic condition becomes extreme the affected cropland area may increase to 98 with 60 for mild drought 35 for moderate drought and 3 for severe drought with overall higher proportions of the affected cropland area than the global averages south america is most likely to suffer from agricultural drought under meteorological drought followed by asia africa and north america europe is more sensitive to meteorological drought with 97 of the crop area may be affected under a moderate meteorological drought although these are mostly under mild dry condition they could be damaging to agricultural production given the overall long duration of soil moisture droughts from a global perspective the above results provide a spatial image of the likelihood of soil moisture drought

4159,with a copula based probabilistic model this study presents a global view on the propagation of meteorological to soil moisture drought meta gaussian and three dimensional vine copulas were employed to construct the bivariate and trivariate conditional joint drought distributions respectively using the time series of standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and standardized soil moisture index smi derived from the global land data assimilation system gldas simulations three different cases including the probability and magnitude of soil moisture drought smi conditioned on 1 month meteorological drought spei1 seasonal meteorological drought spei3 and the joint effects of spei1 and antecedent soil moisture conditions smilag 1 were analyzed then the duration of soil moisture drought in response to meteorological drought and potentially affected cropland area were analyzed to assess potential agricultural impacts results showed that the likelihood of soil moisture drought conditioned on spei1 in the amazon rainforest southern and eastern china southeast asia southeastern united states and west africa was generally higher than in other regions under the impact of seasonal meteorological drought except for the qinghai tibet plateau in china northern russia and north africa the probability of soil moisture drought occurrence overall increased with significant increments in europe and north america the antecedent soil moisture condition also influenced the probability of drought propagation and this effect was particularly significant for northern china russia the u s midwest canada and australia spatially the western u s northern canada south africa eastern europe north china northern russia and most parts of australia present longer duration of soil moisture drought in response to meteorological drought comprehensive considerations of the conditional probability duration and potentially affected area of soil moisture drought for croplands revealed that among five continents south america was more vulnerable to agricultural drought under the condition of meteorological drought keywords drought propagation probability meteorological drought soil moisture drought 1 introduction drought is a recurring natural phenomenon that occurs in virtually every region of the world wilhite and glantz 1985 in the context of global warming recent years witnessed the growing frequency of extreme drought events e g the millennium drought in australia the 2010 droughts in amazon southwestern china and russia the 2011 droughts in texas mexico and east africa and the u s summer droughts in 2012 and 2016 which caused devastating impacts on agriculture economy and human society lewis et al 2011 schubert et al 2014 hao et al 2014 williams et al 2015 otkin et al 2018 liu et al 2020 to better cope with drought and alleviate its impacts it is essential to understand how droughts evolve and proceed at the atmosphere land interface using historical observations and model projections a multitude of studies have investigated the drying or wetting patterns at regional and global scales the drought conditions under climate change have been established using the long term series of various drought indices and their trends e g sheffield et al 2012 dai 2013 wang et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 several studies extracted historical droughts and analyzed their magnitude or characteristics duration intensity affected area and severity and spatiotemporal migration patterns using the threshold method sheffield and wood 2007 herrera estrada et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 gu et al 2020 focusing on the uncertainties in the assessment of drought some studies discussed the impacts of data selection e g length and temporal coverage of data set formulation of hydrological components e g evapotranspiration and drought indices trenberth et al 2014 these studies provided valuable insights into trends and characteristics of drought however the links between different drought types were neglected in their evaluation from the perspective of causative mechanisms the evolution of drought involves a complicated transition of moisture deficiencies the anomalous meteorological conditions resulting in precipitation deficit and expanding evaporative demand can travel through the terrestrial part of the hydrological cycle leading to the depletion of soil moisture and ultimately developing into a hydrological drought van loon 2015 liu et al 2017 han et al 2019 hellwig et al 2020 wu et al 2020 the transition of drought signal from one type of drought to another is referred to as drought propagation haslinger et al 2014 apurv et al 2017 this suggests that a certain region may suffer more than one drought type at the same time although several studies investigated the nexus between different drought types and drought propagation features e g van loon and van lanen 2012 wong et al 2013 yang et al 2017 liu et al 2019 these were mostly case studies and a global evaluation of drought status with the consideration of propagation behavior was rare in this study we focused on soil moisture drought as the direct successor of meteorological drought and used a probabilistic method to depict the process of drought propagation from a global perspective two issues were addressed one referred to the probability of soil moisture drought conditioned on meteorological drought to recognize globally sensitive regions vulnerable to meteorological drought and the other referred to the characteristics of soil moisture droughts based on the established conditional joint distributions including the probable magnitude of soil moisture drought i e the extent to which the soil moisture condition may be drying given meteorological drought at different severity levels the extended duration of soil moisture droughts in response to meteorological droughts and potential agricultural drought risk analysis the reminder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a brief description of the study area and data used in this study section 3 describes the probabilistic model for inferring the probability of soil moisture drought and the corresponding drought characteristics given meteorological drought under various scenarios section 4 presents the results section 5 discusses the findings and conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 data 2 1 global land data assimilation system the global land data assimilation system gldas is designed to provide globally estimated land surface fluxes and storages of water and energy e g actual evapotranspiration soil moisture surface runoff and subsurface runoff with finer spatiotemporal resolutions rodell et al 2004 the version 1 of gldas hereafter gldas 1 includes four land surface models i e the mosaic noah clm and vic evaluation of the gldas 1 showed that it introduced unnatural trends and led to highly uncertain forcing fields in 1995 1997 as a result of the switched forcing data sources aimed at creating more climatologically consistent data sets recently the version 2 of gldas hereafter gldas 2 was released with the enhancement of updated model version only the simulations of the noah model are available and land surface parameters the gldas 2 consists of 3 hour daily and monthly generated through temporal averaging or summation of the 3 hour products products at 0 25 and 1 0 spatial resolutions it has two different forcing data derived components one refers to the gldas 2 0 which was run entirely with the princeton meteorological forcing data and the other was forced with a combination of model and observation based forcing data sets hereafter gldas 2 1 in this study the monthly product including precipitation potential evapotranspiration pet and soil moisture of gldas 2 0 gldas noah10 m 2 0 was used for drought analysis this product was generated through the temporal averaging of reprocessed 3 hour data and is currently available from january 1948 to december 2015 2 2 international soil moisture network the international soil moisture network ismn https ismn geo tuwien ac at en is an integrated system which hosts globally quality controlled and harmonized in situ soil moisture measurements from various ground validation campaigns and operational networks dorigo et al 2011 since its establishment the ismn has experienced a rapid growth with increasing number of participating networks and stations at present ismn contains data of 59 operational networks and 8398 field observation stations the database stored includes soil water contents of different soil layers in units of volumetric soil moisture m3 m 3 and relevant hydrometeorological variables e g precipitation and air and soil temperatures and serves as an important resource for validating satellite retrievals and land surface model based soil moisture products in this study the ismn was used to validate the soil moisture datasets from gldas although the time period of the entire products in ismn spanned from 1952 until the present the long term time series of in situ soil moisture observations on a global basis are still insufficient for instance rather limited data are available in africa and south america daily soil moisture data from ismn were aggregated into monthly averages and 2455 sites with the temporal data coverage exceeding 120 months were selected to validate the accuracy of gldas see fig 1 for spatial distribution 2 3 esa cci land cover dataset the global land cover product released by the european space agency esa climate change initiative cci https www esa landcover cci org is employed for investigating the ground information with the objective of providing a consistent historical land cover dataset for climate modeling related issues this product is developed by merging multiple earth observation products of the esa the esa cci land cover dataset contains 24 consistent global land cover maps on an annual basis from 1992 to 2015 and the spatial resolution is 300 m for defining land cover classes the united nations land cover classification system which describes the terrestrial land surface in 37 original classes is adopted defourny et al 2017 with strict quality control and validation the accuracy of the esa cci land cover product is approximately 71 1 with particularly high values ranging between 83 and 92 for cropland related classes defourny et al 2017 in this study the most recent map series namely the map of 2015 v2 0 7 was used for analysis given a close relationship between cropland and soil moisture drought we mainly focused on three land cover types i e rainfed cropland irrigated cropland and a mixture of cropland and natural vegetation 3 methods 3 1 standardized drought index the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and standardized soil moisture index smi sheffield et al 2004 were employed to decipher meteorological and soil moisture droughts respectively these two drought indices follow the mathematical algorithm of the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 which uses the normal quantile transformation to standardize the index namely to make the drought index spatiotemporally comparable the difference between the two indices mainly lies in the variables incorporated for estimating the moisture status for spei the difference between precipitation and pet was taken as input while for smi only the soil moisture content was considered like spi spei and smi can also be calculated at multiple time scales by accumulating the moisture deficits in any predetermined time period e g 1 24 months the smi and spei share the same classification criteria values of the index less than 0 5 correspond to mild drought less than 1 to moderate drought less than 1 5 to severe drought and less than 2 to extreme drought in this study smi was accumulated at a 1 month time scale and spei was accumulated at 1 month and 3 month time scales respectively denoted as spei1 and spei3 to investigate the influence of meteorological moisture deficits in the current month and its cumulative effect on the soil moisture drought 3 2 probabilistic drought analysis using copulas copulas are widely used for constructing the joint distributions due to their flexibility to model the dependence structure among random variables regardless of their marginals according to sklar s theorem for n dimensional continuous random variables x1 xn with marginal cumulative distributions f1 x1 fn xn there always exists an n copula which can combine these univariate marginal distributions into a joint distribution function nelsen 2007 1 h x 1 x n c f 1 x 1 f n x n c u 1 u n where h represents the joint distribution of random variables c is the copula function satisfying 0 1 n 0 1 fi xi denoted by ui i 1 n in the copula function represents the marginal distribution the joint density function f x1 xn can be decomposed using the copula density function as 2 f x 1 x n i 1 n f x i c u 1 u n where fi xi and c represent the marginal probability density of the marginal function and the copula function respectively based on the copula concept the conditional distribution of these variables can be derived to realize probabilistic drought prediction by establishing the nonlinear dependence between the predictand and predictors in this study we used variables x 1 x 2 x 3 to represent meteorological drought spei antecedent soil moisture condition denoted as smilag 1 and soil moisture drought smi respectively by constructing their joint distributions we investigated the probability of soil moisture drought under different scenarios 1 the probability of soil moisture drought x 3 conditioned on meteorological drought x 1 2 the probability of soil moisture drought x 3 conditioned on meteorological drought x 1 and antecedent soil moisture condition x 2 fig 2 presents the framework of copula based probabilistic drought analysis obviously the first scenario belongs to a bivariate case and the meta gaussian copula was employed to construct the joint distribution for the second scenario vine copulas were selected to establish the trivariate joint distribution detailed formulas for the above two types of copulas are given below 3 2 1 meta gaussian copula given the capability of the gaussian copula for modeling both positive and negative dependences among random variables the bivariate form of the gaussian copula was employed to construct the joint distribution of x1 x3 3 c u 1 u 3 φ 2 φ 1 u 1 φ 1 u 3 φ 1 u 1 φ 1 u 3 1 2 π 1 ρ 2 exp t 2 2 ρ s t s 2 2 1 ρ 2 d s d t where φ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution function and φ 1 represents the corresponding inverse function ρ is the dependence parameter for the gaussian copula s and t are integral variables accordingly the conditional distribution of x3 given x1 x1 or u1 given u1 can be expressed as 4 p x 3 x 3 x 1 x 1 c u 1 u 3 u 1 u u for the meta gaussian copula the conditional distribution in equation 4 can be expressed as aas et al 2009 5 p x 3 x 3 x 1 x 1 φ φ 1 u 3 ρ φ 1 u 1 ρ 2 since both x 1 and x 3 are the standardized drought indices i e normally distributed it is generally reasonable to assume a multivariate normal distribution function to model their joint behavior wilks 2011 hao et al 2016 accordingly for normal random variables x1 and x3 with the joint normal distribution the analytical form of the conditional distribution of x3 given x1 is given as 6 x 3 x 1 ñ μ x 3 x 1 σ x 3 x 1 where μ x3 x1 and x3 x1 represent the conditional mean i e the peak of the conditional probability density distribution curve in fig 2 and is referred to as the most probable predicted value and conditional covariance matrix respectively which can be derived as 7 μ x 3 x 1 μ x3 σ x 3 x 1 σ x 1 x 1 1 x μ x 1 8 σ x 3 x 1 σ x 3 x 3 σ x 3 x 1 σ x 1 x 1 1 σ x 1 x 3 where μ x 1 and μ x 3 are means of x1 and x3 and x 1 x 1 x 1 x 3 x 3 x 1 and x 3 x 3 are the covariance matrix detailed formulas for calculating the covariance matrix can be found in hao et al 2016 2017 3 2 2 vine copula vine copulas are effective tools for modeling flexible dependences in high dimensions without requiring a conditional independence assumption aas et al 2009 liu et al 2016 liu et al 2018 due to its flexibility in dependence modeling the vine copula shows its superiority for constructing the conditional dependence asymmetries and tail dependence these copulas are based on pair copula constructions pccs which decompose an n dimensional multivariate density into n n 1 2 bivariate copula densities aas et al 2009 for a vine copula structure n n 1 2 pair copulas are arranged in n 1 trees kurowicka and cooke 2006 brechmann et al 2013 there are two general types of vine copulas i e canonical vines c vines and drawable vines d vines in this study we used the c vines to construct the joint distribution the n dimensional density corresponding to a canonical vine is given by aas et al 2009 9 f x 1 x n i 1 n f x i i 1 n 1 j 1 n i c i i j 1 i 1 f x i x 1 x i 1 f x i j x 1 x i 1 where f x 1 xn denotes the joint density function f x i are the marginal densities and ci i j 1 i 1 represents the bivariate copula densities to construct the c vine copula five bivariate copulas i e student t gaussian clayton frank and gumbel hougaard were selected as candidate pair copulas and the optimal one for each pair copula was chosen through the akaike information criterion schepsmeier and brechmann 2015 for the trivariate case the three dimensional density function can be decomposed into three bivariate copula densities and their margins 10 f 123 f 1 f 2 f 3 c 12 c 13 c 23 1 where c 12 is the abbreviated form of c 1 2 f x 1 f x 2 the following step was used to to compute the conditional distribution functions and conditional bivariate copulas in equation 10 according to joe 1996 and aas et al 2009 the conditional distribution function f x w for an m dimensional vector w w 1 wm can be obtained through the following recursive function 11 h x w f x w c x w j w j f x w j f w j w j f w j w j where wj j 1 m denotes any element in w w j represents the vector without element wj and cxwj w j is the bivariate copula function let ui i 1 n f xi then the trivariate case of the conditional distribution function in equation 11 can be written as 12 f u 3 u 1 u 2 c u 3 u 2 u 1 f u 3 u 1 f u 2 u 1 f u 2 u 1 let f u 3 u 1 h u 3 u 1 c u 3 u 1 f u 3 f u 1 f u 1 and f u 2 u 1 h u 2 u 1 c u 2 u 1 f u 2 f u 1 f u 1 accordingly equation 12 can be written as 13 f u 3 u 1 u 2 h h u 3 u 1 h u 2 u 1 the inverse form of equation 13 can be applied for conditional simulations taking the bivariate case as an example assuming h u 2 u 1 is the conditional distribution function of two random variables x 1 and x 2 for fixed probabilities τ e g τ 0 05 0 1 0 95 u 2 can be estimated through an explicit function u 2 c u 2 u 1 1 τ u 1 h 1 τ u 1 where c u 2 u 1 1 is the inverse of τ quantile curve of the copula chen et al 2009 xu and childs 2013 liu et al 2015 the τth copula based conditional quantile function of variable x 2 can be written as 14 x 2 τ x 1 f 1 c u 2 u 1 1 τ u 1 f 1 h 1 τ u 1 where f 1 is the inverse of u 2 similarly for the trivariate case the variable x 3 given variables x 1 and x 2 can be derived as 15 x 3 τ x 1 x 2 f 1 h 1 h 1 τ h u 2 u 1 θ 12 θ 23 1 u 1 θ 13 where θ 12 is the parameter of joint distribution c 12 which measures the dependency of underlying conditional variables x 1 x 2 likewise θ 13 and θ 23 1 represent the parameters of c 13 and c 23 1 respectively to obtain the best estimation of x 3 the monte carlo simulations were employed to generate 1000 random numbers i e τ over the interval 0 1 then equation 15 was used to compute 1000 estimated values of x 3 and the mean value was considered as the best estimate of x 3 3 3 framework the framework of copula based drought propagation analysis is presented in fig 2 employing the time series of spei 1 month and 3 month time scales of spei were employed and smi 1 month time scale generated from the gldas simulations and ismn soil moisture observations the bivariate and trivariate conditional joint distributions were constructed with meta gaussion copula and c vine copula respectively taking the case of smi and spei1 as an example the values of p smi spei1 derived from gldas simulations were evaluated against those of ismn in situ measurements then from a global perspective the probability and most probable magnitude of soil moisture drought smi under varying scenarios were analyzed these included the bivariate cases modeled by using the meta gaussian copula i e the probability of soil moisture drought conditioned on 1 month meteorological drought spei1 3 month meteorological drought spei3 and the triavariate case derived from vine copulas i e the joint effects of spei1 and the antecedent soil moisture status smilag 1 finally based on the esa cci land cover map a further investigation into the proportion of affected cropland area given meteorological drought was carried out to analyze the potential agricultural drought impacts 4 results 4 1 gldas and in situ comparison to provide a direct assessment on the performance of gldas in estimating the probability of drought propagation the conditional probabilities derived from gldas simulations were evaluated against those of ismn stations as an example fig 3 exhibits the relationship between soil moisture and meteorological droughts of different severity levels i e moderate severe and extreme droughts when spei smi was no more than 1 1 5 and 2 respectively for the current month i e spei1 was employed the grey error bars in the figure represent the condition when several ismn stations are located in the same grid cell of gldas and the probabilities derived from gldas would correspond to a couple of ismn based values as expected some disparities were observed between the two estimated probability series with certain scatters from the 1 1 line the scale mismatch between grid based gldas data and point based ismn could be one reason in particular for areas where soil moisture exhibited large spatial heterogeneity the estimated probability values could vary significantly from one site to another these sites were located in the same grid cell of gldas such as the large error bars in fig 3 in addition since most series of ismn were intermittent the different temporal coverages of soil moisture data employed for constructing the propagation relationship might also contribute to the discrepancies aside from the above mentioned aspects there was generally a good agreement between the probabilities estimated from gldas and ismn with the majority of scatters distributed around the 1 1 line implying that the spatial pattern for the probability of drought propagation revealed by these two data sets were basically comparable 4 2 probability of soil moisture drought the probability of drought propagation from meteorological to soil moisture under three different cases was analyzed based on smi and spei1 the spatial patterns of drought propagation from meteorological to soil moisture for the current month were first detected then spei1 was replaced with spei3 to analyze the effect of seasonal meteorological droughts on soil moisture droughts depletion of soil moisture storage is related to the initial condition of soil layer and in the third case the antecedent soil moisture status was also employed as a conditional variable for constructing the joint distribution 4 2 1 probability of soil moisture drought conditioned on meteorological drought fig 4 shows the probability of soil moisture drought given meteorological drought for the current month spei1 under eight scenarios specifically panels in the same row exhibit the varying probabilities of soil moisture drought given gradually enhanced signal of meteorological drought i e conditioned on moderate severe and extreme meteorological drought from left to right while panels in the same column present the varying probabilities of soil moisture drought at mild moderate and severe levels respectively given the same condition of meteorological drought taking the case of the first row as an example fig 4a c and f the probability of soil moisture drought occurrence significantly increased conditioned on meteorological drought of severity levels from moderate to extreme implying that the likelihood of soil moisture drought tended to be higher when the climatic condition was drier in particular the scenario in fig 4f reflected a typical condition where most regions of the world except the extremely dry north africa and extremely cold northeastern areas in russia exhibited rather high values with probabilities above 0 6 for the case under on an extreme condition implying that meteorological drought of an extreme level was very likely to propagate into soil moisture drought at a large scale with globally low values around 0 1 0 3 for fig 4b and e they revealed another phenomenon that the likelihood of soil moisture drought at the same severity level as meteorological drought was generally low besides different regional behaviors on the probability of drought propagation could also be observed spatially the amazon rainforest southern and eastern china southeast asia southeastern united states west and central africa were more sensitive to meteorological drought with the probabilities of soil moisture drought two to three fold higher than were other regions fig 4g fig 5 shows the probability of soil moisture drought conditioned on spei3 it can be seen that except for the cases of soil moisture drought at the same severity level as meteorological drought fig 5b e the probability of drought propagation under the seasonal meteorological drought overall increased compared with fig 4 spatially europe and north america were two major regions which exhibited significant changes taking the occurrence of soil moisture drought given a severe condition fig 5c as an example compared to the pattern in fig 4c the probability of soil moisture drought given severe meteorological drought in europe largely increased with the values varying from 0 5 to 0 8 the change in north america was mainly manifested as the enlarged area from the southeastern united states to the entire north america region fig 4c and 5c with higher probability values to explore the underlying reasons for such a spatial pattern the regionally averaged time series of spei and smi in different climate regions were analyzed it can be seen that for the amazon rainforest which presents the highest value of conditional probability the smi is sensitive to the changes of climatic condition and varies synchronously with spei fig 6 a a general good agreement between smi and spei were also observed in europe however for minor meteorological droughts such as the 1999 drought event right panel in fig 6b the soil moisture presents no response to the dry climate condition similarly the cases for the eastern and western u s fig 7 also suggests a good consistency between the time series of spei and smi contributes to high conditional probability in contrast the qinghai tibet plateau in china northern russia and north africa were less affected by the seasonal cumulative water deficits and maintained rather low probability values around 0 1 0 4 even under an extreme meteorological drought fig 5f this may be related to the specific climate and geographical conditions of these regions the qinghai tibet plateau in china and northern russia are typical permafrost and snow covered regions where snow or permafrost acts as a natural reservoir to store water when the temperature is below zero and to release water to ameliorate water shortage as a result of snowmelt this leads to the land surface e g soil moisture and runoff may have a slower response to meteorological drought than other regions van loon and van lanen 2012 qi et al 2020 liu et al 2020 as for the north africa it is the driest area in the world with annual mean precipitation no more than 50 mm under this tropical desert climate the soil layer maintains a dry status all the year around and is insensitive to the changes of climatic condition 4 2 2 probability of soil moisture drought conditioned on meteorological drought and antecedent soil moisture condition based on equations 10 13 the probability of soil moisture drought conditioned on meteorological drought and previous smi values denoted as smilag 1 can be derived fig 8 shows the likelihood of soil moisture conditioned on meteorological droughts and normal antecedent soil moisture conditions 0 5 smilag 1 0 5 comparing to the patterns in fig 4 it can be seen that globally the probability values of soil moisture drought under the joint condition of moderate severe and extreme meteorological drought and normal antecedent soil moisture status generally decreased with significant reduction from 0 5 0 6 to 0 1 0 2 in northern china russia the american midwest canada and australia the significant changes for the conditional probability of soil moisture drought in these regions are possibly related to the soil moisture temperature coupling effect according to the geographical definition these regions are mostly transitional regions where soil moisture has been shown to have a strong influence on the land atmospheric interactions via the soil moisture temperature coupling effect seneviratne et al 2010 this includes the feedback loops that a positive anomaly of temperature in response to a negative soil moisture anomaly and increased temperature leads to a higher vapor pressure deficit and evaporative demand variations in these climate factors may contribute to a potential increase in evapotranspiration despite the dry conditions which possibly leading to a further decrease in soil moisture obviously soil moisture plays a key role for the drought propagation process from meteorological to soil moisture through its impact on land energy and water balances in transitional regions exceptional cases were observed for the amazon rainforest southern and eastern china southeastern united states west africa and southeast asia where the probability values above 0 7 were as high as in fig 4 indicating that the effect of antecedent soil moisture in these regions was generally minor 4 3 magnitude of soil moisture drought apart from the probability of soil moisture drought it is also essential to figure out the most probable magnitude of drought e g moderate or severe drought which has significance for drought mitigation and drought early warning based on the conditional probability distribution the smi values could be estimated through equations 7 and 15 for the bivariate i e smi conditioned on spei and trivariate cases i e smi conditioned on spei and smilag 1 respectively this may produce smi values of a wide range but with different probabilities see the conditional probability density distribution curve in fig 2 for example supposing the estimated range of smi under a severe meteorological drought i e 1 5 spei 2 is 1 5 to 0 3 this suggests the magnitude of soil moisture drought might be one of the normal mild and moderate drought categories from the conditional probability density distribution curve we can see that the likelihood becomes larger when the interval of estimated smi values getting close to the mean obviously the interval of estimated smi values mostly close to mean is the most probable magnitude of a soil moisture drought and is exactly the information we are concerned fig 9 exhibits the extent to which the soil moisture condition may be drying under six different scenarios it can be seen that the estimated magnitude of soil moisture drought conditioned on spei1 was generally comparable to that conditioned on spei1 and smilag 1 e g fig 9a versus 9d for most parts of the world a moderate meteorological drought may cause little effect on the soil moisture condition while severe and extreme meteorological drought may lead to mild soil moisture drought however for sensitive regions such as the amazon rainforest southern and eastern china west africa southeastern united states and southeast asia a mild soil moisture drought is likely to occur given moderate meteorological drought and the soil moisture condition may become more drier given severe or extreme meteorological drought 4 4 extended duration of soil moisture drought the duration of soil moisture droughts provides important information for estimating potential drought impacts on crop productivity to investigate how the meteorological droughts affect the duration of soil moisture drought fig 10 compares the average duration of soil moisture drought events smi1 against that of meteorological drought events spei1 positive values indicate soil moisture drought lasts longer than meteorological drought and negative values indicate soil moisture drought lasts shorter than meteorological drought as shown in fig 10 for most regions of the world the duration of soil moisture drought is overall longer than that of meteorological drought this phenomenon is generally consistent with findings of previous studies e g van loon 2015 which claimed that the duration of drought would be lengthened during the drought propagation process from atmosphere to the land surface given different climates and underlying surfaces the terrestrial water storage e g soil moisture surface water and groundwater may present different responses with lengthened duration of varying degrees spatially the western u s northern canada south africa eastern europe north china northern russia and most parts of australia present larger values where the average duration of soil moisture drought events are more than three months longer than that of meteorological drought events the time series of spei3 and smi1 for selected regions in figs 6 and 7 also revealed this difference in terms of drought duration for instance from figs 6 and 7 it can also be seen that in regions with low conditional probabilities like europe and western u s climatically europe is drier than amazon and western u s is drier than eastern u s although the meteorological droughts do not immediately initiate soil moisture droughts once the soil moisture droughts do get initiated they last longer than meteorological droughts this is consistent with findings in sheffield et al 2004 which also showed higher persistence of soil moisture droughts in western u s compared to eastern u s several grids in the west and north africa are the exception where negative values were observed this suggests the soil moisture drought events on average persist shorter than meteorological drought events meanwhile it should be noted that the uncertainties of gldas in west and north africa may also be responsible for these negative values see details in section 5 1 4 5 global agricultural drought impact analysis soil moisture has a close relationship with crop productivity and one of the major impacts of soil moisture drought is agricultural losses croplands which threaten the food security when a meteorological drought occurs the likelihood of a soil moisture drought in different regions could be estimated through their conditional joint distributions the occurrence of a soil moisture drought means reduced supply of moisture to the cropland thus estimated conditional probability of the dry condition in soil layer may have some implications for recognizing the potential agricultural drought impacts besides the duration of soil moisture drought reflecting the persistence of moisture deficits of the soil layer and its spatial coverage reflecting how much area suffers from droughts are also informative for estimating the strength of agricultural impacts in this section comprehensive considerations of drought propagation features including the conditional probability extended duration and affected area of soil moisture droughts in response to meteorological droughts for croplands were provided to assess globally potential agricultural drought impacts fig 11 presents the spatial distribution of croplands and the proportion of affected crop area by mild moderate severe and extreme drought given meteorological drought indicated by spei1 for globe and each continent as shown in fig 11a according to the esa cci land cover dataset v2 0 7 asia mainly distributed in china india and southeast asia ranked first among the five continents which accounted for 34 of the global cropland area followed by europe 22 africa 17 north america 13 south america 11 and oceania 3 from a global perspective fig 11b it can be seen that a moderate meteorological drought may lead to approximately 44 of the crop area falling under soil moisture drought and the potential agricultural drought impacts may be further enlarged 78 of the crop area for mild drought and 10 for moderate drought given a severe meteorological drought i e spei 2 when the climatic condition becomes extreme the affected crop area may increase to 98 with 60 for mild drought 35 for moderate drought and 3 for severe drought as the largest crop production base asia generally presents a pattern similar to that of the globe conditioned on a moderate and severe meteorological drought however for the extreme scenario 7 of the crop area may suffer from severe drought which is two fold higher than the global value fig 11c with regard to drought duration fig 10 suggests the north china on average presents higher persistence of soil moisture droughts may last for three to six months in response to meteorological droughts and are more vulnerable to agricultural disaster than other regions of asia for europe the affected crop area rapidly reaches up to 97 under a moderate meteorological drought i e 1 spei1 1 5 although such increments are mostly under mild dry condition fig 11d the moisture deficits may cause substantial damages for crop production given the overall long extended duration persist three to six months on average and negative anomalies of soil moisture over a long time especially in growing seasons may be harmful for crop growths of soil moisture droughts in this continent fig 10 in terms of africa and north america the affected crop area conditioned on different values of spei1 is slightly lower than that of the globe fig 11e f and the middle u s is more likely to suffer agricultural losses in consideration of the longer duration of soil moisture droughts in this region fig 10 the case for south america is not optimistic either although fig 10 suggests the soil moisture drought for cropland in this continent would not persist for a long time it may also induce large agricultural impacts when referring to the affected area of each drought category as shown in fig 11g 77 of the crop area may fall under drought given a mild meteorological drought i e 0 5 spei1 1 while 69 may suffer from moderate drought when spei1 is no more than 2 these proportion values are approximately two fold higher than the global average suggesting that south america is more vulnerable to agricultural drought than other continents 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainties some uncertainties may exist for the derived results regarding the selection of drought indices time series of drought indices selected for constructing the conditional probability distribution and gldas datasets first spei was employed in which precipitation and pet are treated equally for calculating the atmospheric moisture condition several previous studies claimed that the role of pet would be overestimated for estimating the dry status particularly in arid zones e g cook et al 2014 ma et al 2014 to evaluate the impact of spei on the probability of drought propagation the derived results were compared with those derived from spi we found in most regions of the world the probability of soil moisture drought derived from spei is very close to that derived from spi which also suggest high probabilities in the amazon rainforest southern and eastern china southeast asia southeastern u s west and central africa see supplementary figures s1 and s2 major differences are mainly located in water limited regions e g the north africa and northwestern china where the probability of soil moisture drought derived from spei is about 0 2 lower than those from spi fig 12 for arid areas pet i e the evaporative demand by the atmosphere which represents the highest possible evapotranspiration commonly far exceeds the actual moisture supply which may lead to the overestimation of the actual amount of water transferred to the atmosphere raible et al 2017 this leads to the climatic condition indicated by spei may present a dry signal but the soil moisture would not make a response resulted in a lower probability value than derived from spi second the conditional probabilities were calculated by using complete time series of spei and smi and there are uncertainties for estimating agricultural impacts fig 11 since the periods of drought indices in growing seasons are more relevant for obtaining realistic implications of drought propagation to evaluate the influence of time series the conditional probabilities by using data of growing seasons were compared against those from complete time series according to the frequency distributions of the probability of soil moisture drought conditioned on moderate meteorological drought indicated by spei1 as an example in fig 13 it can be seen that the probability values derived from data of growing seasons red dashed line overall increase by 0 1 comparing to those derived from complete time series the blue dashed line fig 14 exhibits the spatial distribution of probability differences except for northern canada south africa western and southern russia where the absolute values of probability difference range between 0 1 and 0 2 for most regions of the world the differences of probability values would not exceed 0 05 plus or minus this suggests there would be tiny differences for estimated probability values between complete series and data of growing seasons but the associated global patterns of drought propagation e g fig 4 11 would not change in a significant way finally limitations of the land surface model e g the inadequate consideration of snow related processes in cold regions and irrigation schemes used in gldas also influence the quality of the simulated datasets and therefore for the conditional probability for instance comparing to in situ observations chen et al 2013 found the four gldas models do not perform well in simulating the surface soil moisture in central tibetan plateau agutu et al 2017 assessed the performance of gldas in characterizing agricultural drought in east african and found gldas perform well in tanzania but mischaracterized the 2005 2006 drought in kenyan and ugandan zaitchik et al 2010 evaluated the performance of gldas in terms of global river discharge and found poor performances in congo river and high latitude basins with snowmelt which may have associated effects on the accuracy of soil moisture estimates in addition the land surface models used in gldas do not include the modules of irrigation schemes a common drawback for most global model simulation products and there are uncertainties for irrigated cropland fig 11 for instance based on hydrological model simulations several previous studies found irrigation leads to increased evapotranspiration decreased runoff increased surface soil moisture and decreased streamflow haddeland et al 2006 ozdogan et al 2010 shah et al 2021 from a climatic perspective several studies found irrigation would impact the water and energy balance near the ground making the near surface atmosphere cooler and moister than non irrigated areas kueppers et al 2007 mishra et al 2020 this cooling effect may create a favorable condition for drought propagation therefore we may speculate that the probability of soil moisture drought under meteorological drought may be underestimated to some extent for irrigated croplands e g northern india and the north china in growing seasons in spite of such limitations kim et al 2020 found the soil moisture datasets from gldas generally perform better than certain satellite based soil moisture products over moderately irrigated areas and is recommended for use when ground based soil moisture data are not available in future researches it is necessary to conduct regional studies by using more sophisticated hydrological models in high resolution to reflect more realistic information of drought propagation for irrigated croplands 5 2 implications previous studies for analyzing the process of drought propagation from meteorological to agricultural or hydrological mostly focused on the drought characteristics of different types with some features associated with lagging lengthening and attenuation recognized van loon 2015 apurv et al 2017 liu et al 2019 from a probabilistic perspective this study uses a copula based model to estimate the likelihood of soil moisture droughts conditioned on meteorological droughts of varying severity levels this probability value could be interpreted as the strength of drought signal during the propagation process where higher values imply that most of the drought information would be conveyed into the territorial hydrological system and soil moisture droughts are more likely to be initiated if a meteorological drought occurs it should be noted that this probability value has essential distinctions from aridity or the frequency of droughts as shown in fig 4 humid regions such as the amazon rainforest and southern china present higher probability values than arid regions such as the north africa this phenomenon is not in contradiction with previous findings associated with the global patterns of drying trends e g arid lands become more drier instead fig 4 suggests that under the same meteorological drought conditions regions in higher probability values like the amazon rainforest and southern china are more vulnerable to soil moisture drought than north africa in this study we found the likelihood of soil moisture drought conditioned on spei1 was generally higher in amazon rainforest southern and eastern china southeast asia southeastern united states and west africa than in other regions comparison of spei and smi in different climate regions suggests for high probability regions the time series of smi generally presents a good consistency with spei and is sensitive to the changes of climate condition figs 6 7 from a climatic perspective these regions are mostly in subtropical and tropical climate with sufficient precipitation i e water supply and high temperature i e evaporative demand a climatic dry spell suggests less water input i e precipitation deficiency is transported to the terrestrial system at the same time pet may also increase resulted from increased temperature radiation wind speed etc which can lead to boosted actual evapotranspiration with an extra loss of water from soil vegetation or open water bodies seneviratne et al 2010 all these contribute to the depletion of soil moisture which may further develop into a soil moisture drought the moisture and heat condition produces a close hydraulic relation among precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture chagas and chaffe 2018 yang et al 2018 leading to a strong nexus between meteorological and soil moisture droughts similar to previous studies e g vicente serrano et al 2005 peña gallardo et al 2019 which related accumulated spei of varying time scales to hydrological variables the time scale effect of droughts was also observed in this study as shown in fig 5 the north america and europe present significant increments in the probability values of soil moisture drought conditioned on spei3 than those conditioned on spei1 fig 4 this reflects the cumulative effects of meteorological water deficits on drought propagation meanwhile the enhanced probabilistic link under spei3 in these regions also indicate a lagged or slower response of soil moisture to the climatic condition than regions of high probability values e g the amazon rainforest this phenomenon agrees with findings in bachmair et al 2018 which also suggest the 3 month meteorological drought indices are best linked to agricultural and forest droughts apart from the current meteorological condition we found that the antecedent soil moisture status also influences the probability of drought propagation comparing to the patterns in fig 4 fig 8 shows that under the joint condition of meteorological droughts indicated by spei1 and normal antecedent soil moisture status 0 5 smilag 1 0 5 the likelihood of soil moisture drought significantly decreases in the northern china the u s midwest australia russia and canada according to the geographical definition these regions are mostly transitional regions where soil moisture has been shown to have a strong influence on the land atmospheric interactions via the soil moisture temperature coupling effect seneviratne et al 2010 this includes the feedback loops that a positive anomaly of temperature in response to a negative soil moisture anomaly and increased temperature contributes to a higher vapor pressure deficit and evaporative demand which possibly leading to a further decrease in soil moisture van loon 2015 this shows the key role of soil moisture in affecting the land energy and water balances in transitional regions which is also the core content of drought propagation process from meteorological to soil moisture findings in this study highlight the varied responses of soil moisture to meteorological drought under different moisture conditions both the atmospheric and the antecedent soil moisture status despite the uncertainties discussed above the probability of drought propagation provides some implications for recognizing the potential impacts of soil droughts fig 11 which also has scientific guidance for water security assessment and drought management ongoing analysis on the propagation behavior in different stages e g onset recover of drought and the seasonality in different regions are needed for improving the understanding of drought propagation mechanism 6 conclusions in this study a copula based probabilistic model i e the meta gaussian and vine copulas for bivariate and trivariate cases respectively was employed to illustrate the propagation of meteorological to soil moisture drought three different cases including the probability of soil moisture drought smi conditioned on 1 month meteorological drought spei1 seasonal meteorological drought spei3 and the joint effects of spei1 and antecedent soil moisture conditions smilag 1 were investigated based on the established conditional joint distributions the characteristics of drought propagation including the probable magnitude of soil moisture drought i e the extent to which the soil moisture condition may be drying the extended duration of soil moisture droughts in response to meteorological droughts and potential agricultural drought risks were analyzed results showed that the likelihood of soil moisture drought given spei1 tended to be higher when the meteorological condition was drier spatially the amazon rainforest southern and eastern china southeast asia southeastern united states and west africa were more sensitive to meteorological drought with high probabilities under the impact of seasonal meteorological drought the probability of soil moisture drought occurrence overall increased with significant increments in europe and north america in contrast the qinghai tibet plateau in china northern russia and north africa were less affected and maintained rather low probability values when conditioned on spei1 the antecedent soil moisture condition also influenced the probability of drought propagation and this effect was particularly significant for northern china russia the american midwest canada and australia in terms of the probable magnitude of soil moisture drought a moderate meteorological drought may cause little effect on the soil moisture condition while severe and extreme meteorological drought may lead to mild soil moisture drought for most parts of the world investigation on drought duration suggests the persistence of drought would be lengthened during the drought propagation process from meteorological to soil moisture with spatially longer duration of soil moisture drought in the western u s northern canada south africa eastern europe north china northern russia and most parts of australia a further investigation into the affected cropland area revealed that a moderate meteorological drought may lead to approximately 44 of the cropland falling under drought and the potential agricultural drought impacts may be further enlarged 78 of the crop area for mild drought and 10 for moderate drought given severe meteorological drought when the climatic condition becomes extreme the affected cropland area may increase to 98 with 60 for mild drought 35 for moderate drought and 3 for severe drought with overall higher proportions of the affected cropland area than the global averages south america is most likely to suffer from agricultural drought under meteorological drought followed by asia africa and north america europe is more sensitive to meteorological drought with 97 of the crop area may be affected under a moderate meteorological drought although these are mostly under mild dry condition they could be damaging to agricultural production given the overall long duration of soil moisture droughts from a global perspective the above results provide a spatial image of the likelihood of soil moisture drought conditioned on moderate severe and meteorological droughts which also have implications for drought prevention and mitigation strategies in the context of global warming declaration of competing
