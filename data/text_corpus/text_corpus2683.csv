13415,the growth of industries and population is accompanied by the introduction of emerging chemical pollutants such as pharmaceutical compounds into natural water sources the purification of these pollutants is essential to protect the environment and promote community health the present study aims to investigate the removal of acetaminophen act one of the most widely used pharmaceutical compounds and chemical oxygen demand cod through a completely environmentally friendly biological method namely cyclic biological reactor cbr this process is performed using high load synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater on a laboratory scale during the study the effect of cycle time hydraulic retention time hrt act and cod concentration and temperature on reactor performance are inspected finally the performances of two cbr and sequencing batch reactor sbr are compared financial analysis analysis of variance anova and nonlinear regression are applied to study the influence of cycle time and concentration of act and cod on cbr performance two cubic models have been developed for the effect of cycle and concentration on act and cod removal efficiencies using design expert software the models are utilized to calculate the optimum operating conditions at 18 h cycle and 500 mg l act and 7600 mg l cod concentrations the models show 98 and 95 removal efficiencies for act and cod

efficiency it can also be used to upgrade old treatment plants in the future keywords cyclic biological reactor cbr biological treatment cycle control ratio ccr liquid pulse injection lpi optimization 1 introduction pharmaceutical compounds pcs are a large group of human and animal therapeutic substances with wide global usage that are listed as environmental pollutants by the environmental protection agency epa 1 2 these compounds that are classified as emerging contaminants are consumed and leading to their greater discharge into the ecosystem and cause human health and ecological effects emerging contaminants consist of surfactants pharmaceuticals industrial chemicals pesticides and personal care products that are consistently being detected in surface water groundwater municipal wastewater drinking water and food sources these are synthetic or simply occurring chemicals or any microorganisms that are not commonly controlled in the environment but have the potential to enter the environment and cause difficulties 3 5 despite the low concentration of these substances in different types of environmental reservoirs their permanent and long term entry can cause harmful effects on all living things 6 due to discharging of organic pollutants and drugs components including antibiotics vitamins antiepileptics and cosmetic ingredients through pharmaceutical effluent to the environment and their adverse effects on it pcs are becoming one of the major problems for the environment 7 for instance the discharge of these compounds into the water ecosystem is in the range of several ng l μg l making the acute toxicity risk low but they are accumulated and circulated through the marine animals consumed by humans and are thus expected to have adverse effects on human health 8 9 therefore in the next few years these compounds will be one of the unexpected environmental problems discharges of these compounds include direct and indirect ones 10 in an indirect way much of them are excreted through metabolism with urination after being taken in a direct way they come mainly from conventional wastewater treatment plants that are unable to remove these pharmaceutical compounds completely 4 economic co operation and development organization oecd recommends countries limit their pharmaceutical production but countries such as united kingdom uk and germany where pharmaceutical production is an economic income source are reportedly still producing numerous medicines 6 the monitored and or unmonitored discharge of these dangerous pollutants will eventually lead to pollution of drinking water resources and in the long run it will pose health risks to humans and other living organisms 4 5 improper disposal of wastewater and partial discharge of it into surface water in most places leads to environmental pollution therefore people in these areas are exposed to the worst infectious diseases parasites and troubles caused by toxic elements these infections raise the death rate of children as well as reducing the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water lowering the population of aquatic animals increasing total dissolved solids tds cod biochemical oxygen demand bod suspended solids ss total nitrogen and phosphorus contents and producing sludge 7 11 consequently the decontamination of the pharmaceutical wastewater before discharging is necessary regarding environmental protection and health acetaminophen act with the scientific name of paracetamol or para acetyl aminophenol and the chemical formula of c8h9no2 is an analgesic and anti inflammatory drug that is widely used because of its various forms and usages and accessibility with without a prescription it was detected in the influent at a 14 0 67 5 μg l concentration in gyeongsang public wastewater treatment plants in south korea 6 the concentration of act in the influent and effluent of a conventional wastewater treatment plant in jordan usa were 36 7 μg l and 0 041 μg l respectively 12 the investigation on the sewage influents of a mediterranean country spain showed a dangerous abundant of act with maximum concentration of 82 84 mg l 13 this is one of pharmaceutical compounds with the most difficulties to be treated 14 reports related to the removal of act from wastewater treatment systems vary from complete removal of this compound to its partial reduction 15 this pharmaceutical compound has been found in drinking water in the cities of atlanta new york and oklahoma in the united states 10 65 μg l 16 17 several reports has detected act with concentration up to 1 38 15 7 μg l in surface waters and 0 38 μg l in groundwater 18 maximum standard of act in the surface water and effluent of wastewater treatment plant is 555 ng l and less than 20 ng l respectively 19 when administered in clinical doses a considerable amount of this compound about 58 68 is excreted through human feces and urine about 4 percent of this material enters wastewater treatment plants unchanged and can remain in the environment for up to 15 days without decomposing resulting in many environmental hazards 20 propagation of this compound into the soil also occurs when the effluent of the wastewater treatment plants is used as a source for irrigation or fertilizer for agricultural land recent studies have shown that act is in the wastewater of hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry and in natural waters due to its disposal and misuse as well 10 21 removal of act from polluted aqueous media by conventional purification methods is incomplete 20 the scarcity of drinking water resources and the harmful effects causes by this compound on human health and environment confirm the highly importance of this issue the sustainable administration of the environment is only probable when the discharge of pollutants is reduced based on discharge standards and the elimination of existing pollution is carried out efficiently 22 the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater is a very challenging task due to its intractable behaviors 7 additionally it usually contains ingredients that are very difficult to be removed due to their non biodegradability poor adsorption ability and complex nature 9 for the purpose of treating different pharmaceutical pollutants many efforts have been done 23 27 for this purpose different processes include adsorption 28 29 filtration 30 electrocoagulation 31 32 membrane 33 reverse osmosis advanced oxidation and etc have been studied various type of materials such as covalent organic frameworks cofs 34 activated carbon ac 4 9 zeolite 35 nanomaterials 36 magnetic nanomaterials 37 graphene oxide chitosan 38 metal organic frameworks mofs 39 molecularly imprinted polymers mips 40 with respect to these methods principles have been used as sorbents and catalysts 34 in spite of applicability these materials are associated with limitations like as low number of reactive sites low physical and chemical stability and low adsorption capacity 41 other weaknesses include high costs high generation of sludge less efficiency low biodegradability less reduction in cod and bod of wastewater and creation of by products which require additional cost for treatment 42 44 even each technique is limited with its application and results 7 however to overcome the shortcomings of these process a combination of them have been studied as well some of these processes include nanofiltration membranes 45 nanocomposite ultrafiltration membrane psf pvp sio2 46 adsorptive ultrafiltration uf solar photo fenton 47 solar photocatalysis 48 photodegration 49 photo electro fenton electro fenton and membrane photobioreactor 5 11 50 in recent years biological treatment bt as the major industrial part of the pharmaceutical wastewaters has been an emerging field in environmental engineering on account of the developments of finding extremophiles i e halophilic microorganisms as the engineered strains pre treatment methods hybrid physio chemical treatments novel bioreactors and sludge acclimation methods 51 in which the microorganisms are used for the elimination of organic compounds nutrient ingredients and solid particles and degrade them into carbon dioxide and harmless water for different purposes 7 bt methods have received great attention for removal of pollutants from different environments thanks to their environmental sustainability high efficiency high adjustability and work based on green chemistry and principles at the molecular level to achieve sustainability they have received broad attention in the past decade due to their ability to limit the usage of chemical substances reducing maintenance costs and easy utilization to meet economic and environmental goals concurrently 52 gurung et al studied the removal of 23 emerging organic micropollutants eoms including a wide range of pharmaceuticals including act and steroid hormones detected in municipal wastewater by a pilot scale membrane bioreactor mbr plant at two different solid retention times srts of 60 and 21days they removed 99 9 act at concentration of 0 01 μg l at srt of 21 days and hrt of 42 h 53 baratpour et al using a hydrogen peroxide induced upflow fixed bed bioreactor ufbr a bio enzymatic method and removed over 99 of act and 72 of toc at initial act concentrations up to 300 mg l 54 park et al in south korea investigated the concentrations of 57 different pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps including act in the different treatment units of various biological treatment processes including modified biological nutrient removal bnr anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o and membrane bioreactor mbr they concluded that biological treatment processes appeared to be most effective in eliminating most ppcps and first mbr and then a2o played a key role in ppcps removal 15 komesli et al studied the removal of endocrine disrupting compounds such as act carbamazepine estrogen and progesterone by the mbr bioreactor on a real and laboratory scale the results showed that the input act at concentration of 480 ng l was completely eliminated in the real scale bioreactor 55 abdullah et al studied the removal of act with the associated metabolism process beer brewing wastewater by a fixed bed anaerobic bioreactor the results showed that in the best fixed bed anaerobic bioreactor operation removal of 98 and 93 of cod and toc respectively were obtained in three days hrt and after adding 15 mg l act 56 vona et al found act as one of the pharmaceutical compound with most difficulties to remove among different compound include ibuprofen diclofenac dulfamethoxazole clonazepam and diazepam act showed the highest removal efficiency using sbr about 90 95 among different processes include uf nf ac oxidation with clo2 and combined processes uf nf uf ac sbr clo2 14 mowla et al evaluated the treatment of synthetic wastewater containing pharmaceutical compounds including act salicylic acid diclofenac and chloramphenicol by conventional activated sludge process the results showed that at a 48 h hrt 67 of act 2 5 mg l was removed 57 fan et al studied the efficacy of submerged membrane bioreactor smbr in removing 5 pharmaceutical compounds of acetaminophen naproxen diclofenac carbamazepine and estradiol from municipal synthetic wastewater the studied submerged membrane bioreactor at a 6 h hrt had eliminated 92 2 of the act input to the system 58 leili et al studied removal of high concentration of furfural using chemical and biological methods by a cbr and showed that this reactor was able to remove more than 98 furfural and 71 equivalent cod at concentrations up to 1200 mg l of furfural at a hydraulic retention time of 12 1 with a 6 h aeration cycle 59 avila et al studied the influence of primary treatment hydrolytic upflow sludge blanket husb reactor vs conventional settling and operational strategy alternation of saturated unsaturated phases vs permanently saturated on the removal of act in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands they removed 95 act at concentration of 75 μg l 60 maeng et al investigated the effect of cellular retention time nitrification and microbial activity on the removal of various pharmaceutical compounds such as phenacetin acetaminophen caffeine bezafibrate ibuprofen and fenoprofen in the membrane bioreactor mbr according to the results the membrane bioreactor was able to remove 90 of act 1 μg l at an 8 day cellular retention time and 6 h hydraulic retention time 61 for the present study an advanced biological method has been used to remove act and cod from a high load of synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater unprecedentedly it is a cost effective environmentally friendly and high biodegradable process to remove high concentrations of pollutants from municipal or industrial wastewaters for this purpose cbr was used which is a modified version of conventional sbr process although there is a biological treatment and high load wastewater no pre treatment is required in this process instead of a batch flow there is a continuous flow in this way the pollutant is continuously injected into the reactor using a drip injection pump some of the main advantages of cbr include the possibility of treating wastewater containing toxic and inhibitory compounds by removing the hydraulic loads in just one container taking up less space and simpler management and operation this process is less affected by wastewater shock loading thanks to continuous flow therefore it could be used for the treatment of various types of municipal and industrial wastewaters with relatively high concentrations of pollutants other advantages of cbr are no need for a sedimentation tank and return activated sludge system lower reactor volume energy saving and increased mlss capability 62 65 during the study the effect of parameters such as cycle time 6 24 h hrt 10 06 27 3 h inlet pollutant concentration up to 500 mg l inlet cod concentration up to 7700 mg l and temperature 14 30 on reactor performance have been investigated and the performance of the two cbr and sbr compared then anova analysis and nonlinear regression for optimization was done in the end the results obtained on the removal of act and cod from aquatic solutions by cbr has been reported 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor setup a plexiglas and cylindrical reactor with an inner diameter of 20 cm and a height of 30 cm with a total volume of about 9 5 l was designed and manufactured on the laboratory scale an air pump model hailea aco 308 with diffusers was used to supply the required do with a minimum of 3 mg l three brass hose heads were installed on the reactor wall the first one for feeding synthetic wastewater the second one for the upper flow discharge and the third one as a safety valve which were at 2 5 cm 15 cm and 25 cm in height from the bottom of the reactor fig 1 shows other accessories include peristaltic pump electric valve timers synthetic wastewater container and treated wastewater container 2 2 preparation of act synthetic wastewater the synthetic wastewater provided daily by dissolving the desired amount of high purity of acetaminophen powder prepared by sigma aldrich and nutrients in distilled water and considering the c n p ratio of 100 5 1 the nutrients as listed in table 1 included ammonium sulfate as nitrogen source dipotassium hydrogen phosphate and potassium dihydrogen phosphate as phosphorus source and supplier of system buffering capacity calcium chloride and magnesium sulfate as needed for the cytoskeleton 2 3 method for measuring parameters molecular spectroscopy was used for the quantitation and separation of acetaminophen this method was employed because of the variability in the partitioning and solubility of acetaminophen among various mobile phase solutions and fixed phase column substances and the ease with which chromophores were generated with numerous groups of pharmaceuticals 2 the use of lc tof ms 66 lc esi ms ms 67 68 hplc uv dad 69 70 uplc ms ms 71 and other methods were reported it is essential to remark that because most pharmaceuticals are not volatile the gc ms method is not very common 72 uv vis array spectrophotometer model photonix ar2017 was used to measure act concentration for this purpose the maximum absorption wavelength should be determined thus samples with different concentrations were injected into the spectrophotometer at 220 400 nm then the absorption peaks were detected by the device the results are presented in fig 2 a according to the figure the mean absorbance peak was determined to be 247 nm this method was also used to measure other contaminants concentration 64 73 this wavelength range was also used for spectrophotometric measurement of act in other studies 74 75 after determining the maximum absorption the calibration curve was plotted to find out the relationship between the absorbance values and the specified concentrations then the equation of the line was obtained the solutions were made from act with specific concentrations then the absorbance equilibrium was read by the spectrophotometer the calibration chart is shown in fig 2 b to measure the concentration of cod the closed reflux method no 5220d mentioned in the 23rd edition of the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater was used 76 for this purpose first to obtain the calibration curve specific concentrations of potassium hydrogen phthalate khp solutions were obtained and finally according to the obtained absorption values and also the known cods of khp solutions the calibration curve was drawn other measured parameters which are shown in table 2 were based on the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater as well 76 all measurements during this study were repeated twice for all parameters to more accurately measure and reduce the probable errors moreover in cases that more repetition was required it was done 2 4 calculation the performance of cbr in the decomposition of act and cod have been evaluated based on the removal

anova analysis and nonlinear regression are a statistical method that uses quantitative data from appropriate experiments to determine regression model equations and optimization condition the optimization process involves two major steps which are estimating the coefficients in a mathematical model and predicting the response and checking the adequacy of the model 77 just factors with the most important effects like cycle time and cod and act concentration have been studied it is required to find a suitable approximation between factors and response surface the responses were used to develop an empirical model that correlated the responses to the cycle time and act and cod concentrations using two cubic polynomial equations the statistical software package design expert version 11 0 3 0 stat ease inc minneapolis usa has been used for regression analysis of experimental data to fit the equations developed and also to plot response surfaces anova was used to estimate the statistical parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 microbial population adaptation phase the adaptation phase was performed in two stages for 48 days first the microorganisms were accommodated to the type of contaminant act which was lasted for 30 days in batch mode second for 18 days the microorganisms were adjusted to the type of flow which was in continuous droplet way since it was a novel way for the purpose of avoiding any load shock and being sure of achieving high efficiencies this way was chosen fig 3 a shows first stage s results in this condition the required reaction time for reaching maximum efficiencies was 24 h whereas the initial concentration of act was 0 50 mg l and increased to 120 mg l within 30 days the initial mlss concentration was 730 mg l and increased to 4500 mg l at the end of the adaptation phase and adjusted to 4500 mg l during the whole experiments with discharging the excess mlss also during the adaptation and operation of the cbr the ph value was always kept neutral according to this figure gradually system efficiency was improved and cod removal efficiency increased cod removal efficiency at the end of tenth day was 64 between 14th and 20th days a stepwise increase was applied in act concentration from 1 mg l to 120 mg l however cod removal efficiency by about 22 increase reached from 64 to 86 the standard deviation of cod removal efficiency in the first 15 days was 10 which reduce to 2 in the last 15 days efficiency was monitored daily to achieve the value of 90 then the second phase of adaptation began at this stage a peristaltic pump was used for the droplet injection of the pollutant the cycle duration of 24 h the aeration time of 22 h and the injection flow rate of 0 13 l h were considered the hrt was 59 5 h during this 18 day adaptation period the concentrations of act and cod were 200 mg l and 500 mg l respectively the concentration of mlss at the end of this stage was 4500 mg l fig 3 b shows the changes in cod and act removal efficiencies during these 18 days as shown the act removal efficiency was initially 87 and increased to 99 during this period but for cod the difference between the minimum and maximum removal efficiency was less than 3 at this phase the mean removal efficiencies of act and cod are 98 and 95 respectively after the ninth day when stable conditions were established the next phase of the study performed by completing the adaptation phase 3 2 the effect of cycle time one of the important parameters in operating a cbr is its cycle time the cycle time has been changed from 6 to 24 h this part of the study lasted for about 40 days during this period the concentrations of act was about 200 mg l table 3 shows the other operating conditions of this period the reactor s performance during four cycles are shown in fig 4 a according to the chart with changing in the cycle time an initial decrease in the removal efficiency of cod and act could be observed which was very significant in the change from 12 h to 6 h cycle then gradually increased until reached to a constant rate and the next cycle was applied afterward in the shift from 24 h to 18 h cycle the removal efficiencies decreased but efficiencies increased within 10 days by keeping the cycle constant however in 12 h cycle the changes in act and cod removal efficiencies did not fluctuate much and act and cod were removed with a mean of 96 and 95 respectively finally in 6 h cycle with the highest decrease the lowest removal efficiencies were obtained a reduction in the aeration time or an increase in flow rate which can subsequently cause a reduction in hrt and the reactor fill time could be one of the main reasons for the reduction in efficiencies fig 4 b shows the mean removal efficiencies of act and cod when steady state equilibrium prevails during the cycle control period as shown in 18 h cycle with the mean removal efficiencies of 99 and 98 the highest removal efficiencies were obtained for act and cod respectively according to this graph the removal efficiencies of both parameters in 24 h cycle is about 2 lower than 18 h cycle this decrease could be due to an increase in the amount of mlss and consequently end up with a decrease in dissolved oxygen since the highest removal efficiencies of act and cod were obtained in 18 h cycle it has been considered as the optimal cycle 3 3 ccr calculation the results of calculating the ccr value for all experiments performed during the control period are shown in fig 5 according to the explanations in section 2 4 the values obtained by dividing the removal efficiency of each experiment by the average efficiencies obtained in 6 h cycle which are 90 02 and 89 18 for act and cod respectively according to these results the ccr changes for cod removal in 24 h cycle is almost constant with the mean value of 1 07 however the ccr reached from 1 04 to 1 10 for act which means that the efficiency increased by about 6 in 18 h cycle the ccr values for cod and act are approximately equal the changes varied between 1 04 and 1 10 where the reactor was in a steady state phase in 12 h cycle the ccr values for cod and act are approximately equal with no fluctuations the values of both parameters change in the range of 1 06 to 1 08 it means that the values of efficiencies in the steady state of 12 h cycle are about 7 higher than 6 h cycle fig 6 illustrates the average ccr values for cod and act removal within different cycles as shown in fig 6 the reactor s performance to remove both cod and act are the same except 24 h the highest removal efficiencies were achieved at 18 h cycle that they are 10 more than the 6 h cycle leili et al studied the effect of cycle time 6 12 and 24 h on the furfural degradation by a mixture of catalytic ozonation process cop and cbr process this study demonstrated that decreasing the cycle time results in a reduction in cod removal efficiency also it was found that removal efficiency in 12 h and 24 h cycles were close and had a remarkable reduction with decreasing the cycle time to 6 h 61 3 4 hrt effect the hrt effect on cbr performance was investigated in the range of 10 6 27 3 h over 10 days on cycle 6 h the input act and cod concentrations were 200 and 500 mg l respectively fig 7 shows the relation between hrt removal efficiencies and loading rate which was calculated by eq 3 based on these results with increasing hrt the removal efficiencies of both parameters have negligible increased just about 2 that it could be due to decreasing in act loading rate the highest hrt had the lowest loading rate which led to the largest increase in act and cod removal efficiency the optimal time is about 27 h if the goal is to achieve the highest act and cod removal efficiency and about 10 h if the goal is the highest pollutant loading rate leili et al investigated the various hrts 10 5 25 4 h on the furfural removal through the combined ozonation and cbr the results approved that decreasing in hrt reduce the process performance in both terms of cod and furfural moreover the reduction of hrt resulted in a substantial increase in the loading rate 59 in the removal of pharmaceuticals such as diclofenac or caffeine through adsorption with activated carbon they have found out that feed flow rate has negative effect in the breakthrough time the higher flow rate values caused less amounts of hrt and as has been showed in eq 3 it will increase the loading rate which will reduce the efficiency 78 79 but there are some exceptions as garcía mateos et al showed the variation of the ﬂow rate has a negligible impact on the shape of the breakthrough curves in the adsorption of act in activated carbon prepared from biomass from 4 to 8 ml min 80 as shown in table 4 considering that this is a completely biological and environmentally friendly method considerable efficiencies have been achieved in the hrt of 46 5 h however other methods are either a combination of chemical and biological methods or require a very high hrt which in addition to making it difficult to operate does not provide the desired efficiencies 3 5 the effect of input act and cod concentration the removal efficiency of act up to a concentration of 500 mg l in an 18 h cycle was evaluated with an injection flow rate of 0 18 l h over a 10 day period as shown in fig 8 a at a concentration of 100 mg l and even 200 mg l approximately complete removal of act was performed with increasing the concentration of act up to 500 mg l its removal efficiency decreased by about 2 97 89 baratpour et al using a hydrogen peroxide induced ufbr reactor a bio enzymatic method removed about 99 of act in a concentration up to 300 mg l but by increasing its concentration to 500 mg l the act removal efficiency decreased to 95 54 however in this investigation almost 98 of act at concentration of 500 mg l and 97 of cod at concentration of 2700 mg l were removed within a hrt of 46 5 h compared to other studies in the field of biodegradation of act this amount of input concentration and removal efficiency is high however according to the results it is clear that the cbr can effectively withstand the shock of high concentrations of act and achieve stable conditions of act removal efficiency the small difference in the efficiency of act removal in different concentrations and reaching stable situation indicates that the reactor s performance is resilient the very low decrease in act removal efficiency with increasing concentration could be due to the fact that high concentrations of the substrate act can act as a limiting agent therefore microorganisms at high concentrations reached their maximum biodegradation capacity finally for the purpose of evaluating the performance and response of the reactor in emergency situations with higher concentrations of pollutants and cod the experiment was continued up to a concentration of 1000 mg l as shown in fig 8 b the mean removal efficiency of act during this period was about 95 the reactor removed about 92 of act at a concentration of 1000 mg l the results show that cbr is a favorable process for the treatment of highly polluted wastewater and depending on the type of process stable conditions prevail very quickly baratpour et al and komesli et al studied the removal of act by ufbr and mbr reactors respectively they both succeeded to remove about 95 of act in concentrations up to 500 mg l and 480 ng l respectively based on their reactors feature which needed packing media and membrane in real scale the usage and maintenance of them could impose expenses to the project but cbr is just a fine tuned sbr and it could even be used to advance the old plants 54 55 the cod value also varied from 360 mg l to 8000 mg l fig 9 shows the changes in cod removal efficiency along with the input cod concentration according to the figure the removal efficiency with an average of 96 was in the range of 92 99 the result shows that cbr is one of the few biological processes that can easily remove cod up to a concentration of about 8000 mg l thanks to the injection type which is in droplet form this feature causes no shock to enter the system and does not cause any disturbance in operation in general it can be said that according to the obtained results cbr is one of the biological processes that is highly resistant to the concentration of cod entering the system and quickly establishes stable conditions without causing any shock thanks to the prominent feature of this reactor which is injection in the form of drops desirable results will definitely be obtained at higher concentrations which indicates the ability of this system to treat industrial wastewater with high pollution 3 6 the temperature effect on reactor performance during the cbr operation the average reactor temperature has always been around 20 c in this part of the study which lasted 20 days the temperature of the reactor was firstly increased to about 30 c using a water bath and insulation after considering the effect of high temperature the temperature inside the reactor and the synthetic wastewater container was returned to its original state average temperature of 21 c then the reactor worked at this state for 3 days in the next step the temperature was reduced to about 14 c by a water bath table 5 presents the wide range temperature 14 30 c influence on both act and cod removal efficiency the input act concentration of 100 mg l and the injection flow rate of 0 18 l h were considered according to table 5 by increasing temperature from the initial standard state 20 c to 30 c cod removal efficiency with a mean value of about 8 reduced significantly however in terms of act removal efficiency the small range of changes was observed nearly 1 reduction by decreasing temperature to 14 c the decline in the cod removal efficiency was about 4 and reached to the average value of 91 87 the amount of applied shock was very low in the act removal efficiency and the mean removal efficiency was about 97 during the low temperature effect control period one of reasons for the efficiency reduction in elevated temperatures could be the decrease in dissolved oxygen level as temperature goes up during the process from 7 5 mg l to 2 9 mg l in fact the reduction in microorganisms access to oxygen causes a decline in the removal efficiency contrary to what happened to the cod removal efficiency which was further reduced at high temperatures the situation was quite different for act removal efficiencies as it has been shown in comparison with the act removal efficiency in both low and high temperature the efficiency at high temperature has been more favorable act removal through other kinds of treatments such as adsorption by activated carbon have been similar and experiments have shown that increasing the temperature raises the molecular activity as well as the specific surface area of the activated carbon particles thereby increasing the adsorption rate and efficiency of the system 78 80 3 7 the comparison of the performance of two cbr and sbr the performance of two cbr and sbr in the removal of the act and cod was compared during the 20 day test the act concentration was about 200 mg l and the cycle duration was 24 h including 22 h of aeration 1 75 h of sedimentation and 0 25 h of discharge the temperature was around 20 c and the amount of dissolved oxygen was daily monitored first the reactor was set up based on the sbr method for 10 days in this process the tank was filled with the stock wastewater solution and then aeration was started during this time the output act and cod concentrations were measured daily at the end of this period the cbr reactor began operating with a flow rate of 0 13 l h during this 10 day period the concentrations of the output act and cod were measured again daily fig 10 shows the changes in the removal efficiency of cod and act during this 20 day period from the 11th day that the reactor was set up as cbr the rate of increase in the removal efficiencies of cod and act was significant table 6 shows the changes in act and cod removal efficiencies during the batch and continuous reactors startup according to this table in continuous flow mode cbr the rate of removal efficiency is significantly different from batch mode sbr vona et al obtained the highest removal efficiency for act through a sbr process about 90 95 among different types of processes including ultrafiltration nanofiltration activated carbon sbr and oxidation with clo2 14 but by changing system s flow mode from batch to continuous reactors performance increased more than 10 and 15 for act and cod removal respectively 3 8 technical and financial analysis in this part the costs of a wastewater treatment plant including initial costs equipment set up run operation and maintenance for three types of plants involve cbr sbr and continuous flow process cfp have been compared financial analysis for sbr and cfp has been derived from a study conducted by clark et al 82 cfp thanks to its simplicity and versatility is still widespread however this type of process needs extra containers and equipment for treatment 83 sbr method is popular as well thanks to its single container especially for areas with small lands or less population 84 as mentioned in the cbr s definition it is a fine tuned sbr the only difference is the type of pump therefore the cost of construction and maintenances of cbr and sbr could be considered equal approximately fig 11 shows the total cost and efficiency for these plants as shown up to a cod of 2000 mg l that a conventional biological process could be workable the cbr with the less amount of expenses has the highest efficiency in the higher amount of cod concentration it would be necessary to add another processes to reduce the cod concentration for a biological process except cbr which would apply extra expenses to the projects for the construction and required facilities but in the present study as shown in fig 9 cbr has removed 91 of cod at a concentration of 8000 mg l without any supplementary cost 3 9 development of regression model equation and statistical analysis the model was run in two steps first the effects of cycle and act concentration and then cycle and cod concentration on cbr performance were investigated since there is a direct connection between cycle and hrt just cycle s effects were considered for this purpose the experimental results imported to the software according to the sequential sums of squares the models were selected based on higher order polynomials where the additional terms were significant and models were not aliased for both responses act and cod removal efficiencies cubic models were selected as suggested by software regression analysis was performed to fit the responses functions of act and cod removal efficiencies the final cubic models in terms of coded factors after excluding the insignificant terms for act and cod removal efficiencies expressed by eqs 7 and 8 respectively variables take their coded values represents act removal efficiency y1 and cod removal efficiency y2 as a function of cycle x1 act concentration x2 and cod concentration x3 the range of variables and details are given in table 7 7 y 1 77 3202 2 91372 x 1 0 00463063 x 2 0 133003 x 1 2 8 07181 10 6 x 2 2 0 00196187 x 1 3 8 y 2 76 67380 1 96004 x 1 0 004096 x 3 0 054159 x 1 2 1 25278 10 6 x 3 2 9 49739 10 11 x 3 3 in these equations positive sign implies synergistic effect whereas negative sign implies antagonistic effect the models fit quality was judged from their coefficients of correlation and determination the r values for eqs 7 and 8 were 0 940 and 0 955 respectively both the obtained r2 values were relatively high indicating that there was a good agreement between the experimental data and predicted values from the models adjusted r2 values for eqs 7 and 8 were 0 937 and 0 953 respectively this indicates that 93 7 and 95 3 of the total variation in act and cod removal efficiencies respectively were attributed to the experimental variables studied the standard deviation for two models were 0 87 and 0 72 respectively for eqs 7 and 8 the small amount of standard deviations with the closer adjusted r2 values to the unity demonstrate how well the models are to predict values for the responses which are closer to the actual values this indicates that the predicted values for cod rem eff would be more precise and closer to its actual value compared to act removal efficiency adequate precision value which measures signal to noise ratios with desirable amount bigger than 4 recorded a preferable value of 58 81 and 71 11 for act and cod removal efficiencies respectively these imply that the models gave sufficient signals required to navigate the design space the adequacy of models was further justified through analysis of variance anova the anova for the cubic models for act and cod removal efficiencies are listed in tables 8 and 9 respectively from the anova for response surface cubic models for act and cod removal efficiencies the models f value of 180 46 and 236 63 respectively implied that the models were significant p values less than 0 05 indicate model terms are significant values greater than 0 10 indicate the model terms are insignificant in this case except all terms which are highlighted in these tables that are insignificant the others are significant to the responses statistical results show that these models were adequate to predict the act and cod removal efficiencies within the range of studied variables 3 9 1 cycle and concentrations on act and cod removal efficiency to investigate the effect of the factors cycle and act concentration and cycle and cod concentration on the act and cod removal efficiencies respectively the response surface methodology was used and figs 11 and 12 were drawn base on the anova results obtained cycle time and concentrations were found to have significant effects on cbr performance fig 11 shows the two and three dimensional response surfaces the combined effect of cycle time and act concentration on act removal efficiency in the contour diagram the horizontal axis represents the cycle and the vertical axis represents the act concentration and the curves and contours show the act removal efficiency which ranges from 86 5 99 9 the points marked in red have the highest removal efficiency and whatever tends to blue indicates unsuitable conditions and reduced efficiency to better understand the effect of the two significant variables cycle and concentration on the removal efficiency the three dimensional response surface has been structured it shows that the reactor has more favorable efficiencies in 15 24 h which the highest efficiency was obtained at about 18 h cycle as the cycle time decreases or the act concentration increases the system s efficiency also decreases the situation for cod removal efficiency is as same as act removal efficiency which is shown on fig 12 reactor has higher efficiencies in 12 to 24 h cycle that the highest efficiency was obtained at about 18 h cycle as well reactor was able to remove 93 5 of cod up to about 8000 mg l concentration 3 9 2 process optimization one of the aims of this study was to find the optimum process parameters relatively high efficiencies are expected to catch the highest compatibility cycle time was changed in range of 6 to 24 h act was in range of 100 500 mg l and for cod since the target of process is to remove the highest amount of cods using a biological and environmental friendly process it was varied 4000 7700 mg l therefore the act and cod both should have a highest efficiencies for economical viability for the purpose of compromising between responses the function of desirability was applied using design expert software version 11 0 3 0 stat ease inc minneapolis usa for verifying the experimental conditions the highest desirability were selected tables 10 show the act and cod removal efficiencies models validation as shown in fig 13 a and b it was observed that the experimental values obtained were in good agreement with the values predicted from the models with relatively small errors between the predicted and the actual values which were less than 1 for act and cod removal efficiencies fig 14 4 conclusion four cycles of 6 12 18 and 24 h were studied in about 40 days by changing the cycles there was a suddenly decrease in the removal efficiency of cod and act which was achieved a steady state with a gradual upward trend a significant decrease was observed in changing from the 12 h to the 6 h cycle the mean removal efficiency of cod and act in the 18 h cycle was higher than other cycles for both act and cod about 98 and 97 respectively as a result the 18 h cycle was considered the optimal cycle in the study for surveying the effect of hrt the reactor was set up with a 6 h cycle in which the removal efficiency of act and cod was more than 90 in all hrts it was observed that with decreasing hrt the act loading rate increased that the lowest hrt had the highest loading rate which led to the greatest decline in act and cod removal efficiencies the optimal time is about 27 h if the goal is to achieve the highest act and cod removal efficiency and about 10 h if the goal is the highest pollutant loading rate cbr thanks to the droplet injection feature could enhance the removal efficiency of organic matter compared to other continuous flow systems that leads to the system work without any shock the effect of temperature on reactor performance has been studied the results showed temperature changes have not much effect on act removal efficiency in contrast increasing in temperature significantly reduced cod removal efficiency which can be attributed to the decrease in soluble oxygen level the highest efficiency was obtained at a temperature of about 20 c which microorganisms adapted to this temperature from the beginning the performances of cbr and sbr were experimentally compared then a technical and financial analysis has been conducted for three types of biological processes including cbr sbr and a cfp the results showed cbr with less cost than a cfp and approximately equal to sbr has the highest efficiency considering on the contrary other two types of processes cbr has the stable efficiency up to cod of nearly 8000 mg l process optimization was carried out and the experimental values agreed satisfactorily with the values predicted by models the optimal cycle for act and cod removal was 18 h and removed 95 and 98 of cod and act at concentration of 7600 mg l and 500 mg l respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

13415,the growth of industries and population is accompanied by the introduction of emerging chemical pollutants such as pharmaceutical compounds into natural water sources the purification of these pollutants is essential to protect the environment and promote community health the present study aims to investigate the removal of acetaminophen act one of the most widely used pharmaceutical compounds and chemical oxygen demand cod through a completely environmentally friendly biological method namely cyclic biological reactor cbr this process is performed using high load synthetic

1 introduction pharmaceutical compounds pcs are a large group of human and animal therapeutic substances with wide global usage that are listed as environmental pollutants by the environmental protection agency epa 1 2 these compounds that are classified as emerging contaminants are consumed and leading to their greater discharge into the ecosystem and cause human health and ecological effects emerging contaminants consist of surfactants pharmaceuticals industrial chemicals pesticides and personal care products that are consistently being detected in surface water groundwater municipal wastewater drinking water and food sources these are synthetic or simply occurring chemicals or any microorganisms that are not commonly controlled in the environment but have the potential to enter the environment and cause difficulties 3 5 despite the low concentration of these substances in different types of environmental reservoirs their permanent and long term entry can cause harmful effects on all living things 6 due to discharging of organic pollutants and drugs components including antibiotics vitamins antiepileptics and cosmetic ingredients through pharmaceutical effluent to the environment and their adverse effects on it pcs are becoming one of the major problems for the environment 7 for instance the discharge of these compounds into the water ecosystem is in the range of several ng l μg l making the acute toxicity risk low but they are accumulated and circulated through the marine animals consumed by humans and are thus expected to have adverse effects on human health 8 9 therefore in the next few years these compounds will be one of the unexpected environmental problems discharges of these compounds include direct and indirect ones 10 in an indirect way much of them are excreted through metabolism with urination after being taken in a direct way they come mainly from conventional wastewater treatment plants that are unable to remove these pharmaceutical compounds completely 4 economic co operation and development organization oecd recommends countries limit their pharmaceutical production but countries such as united kingdom uk and germany where pharmaceutical production is an economic income source are reportedly still producing numerous medicines 6 the monitored and or unmonitored discharge of these dangerous pollutants will eventually lead to pollution of drinking water resources and in the long run it will pose health risks to humans and other living organisms 4 5 improper disposal of wastewater and partial discharge of it into surface water in most places leads to environmental pollution therefore people in these areas are exposed to the worst infectious diseases parasites and troubles caused by toxic elements these infections raise the death rate of children as well as reducing the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water lowering the population of aquatic animals increasing total dissolved solids tds cod biochemical oxygen demand bod suspended solids ss total nitrogen and phosphorus contents and producing sludge 7 11 consequently the decontamination of the pharmaceutical wastewater before discharging is necessary regarding environmental protection and health acetaminophen act with the scientific name of paracetamol or para acetyl aminophenol and the chemical formula of c8h9no2 is an analgesic and anti inflammatory drug that is widely used because of its various forms and usages and accessibility with without a prescription it was detected in the influent at a 14 0 67 5 μg l concentration in gyeongsang public wastewater treatment plants in south korea 6 the concentration of act in the influent and effluent of a conventional wastewater treatment plant in jordan usa were 36 7 μg l and 0 041 μg l respectively 12 the investigation on the sewage influents of a mediterranean country spain showed a dangerous abundant of act with maximum concentration of 82 84 mg l 13 this is one of pharmaceutical compounds with the most difficulties to be treated 14 reports related to the removal of act from wastewater treatment systems vary from complete removal of this compound to its partial reduction 15 this pharmaceutical compound has been found in drinking water in the cities of atlanta new york and oklahoma in the united states 10 65 μg l 16 17 several reports has detected act with concentration up to 1 38 15 7 μg l in surface waters and 0 38 μg l in groundwater 18 maximum standard of act in the surface water and effluent of wastewater treatment plant is 555 ng l and less than 20 ng l respectively 19 when administered in clinical doses a considerable amount of this compound about 58 68 is excreted through human feces and urine about 4 percent of this material enters wastewater treatment plants unchanged and can remain in the environment for up to 15 days without decomposing resulting in many environmental hazards 20 propagation of this compound into the soil also occurs when the effluent of the wastewater treatment plants is used as a source for irrigation or fertilizer for agricultural land recent studies have shown that act is in the wastewater of hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry and in natural waters due to its disposal and misuse as well 10 21 removal of act from polluted aqueous media by conventional purification methods is incomplete 20 the scarcity of drinking water resources and the harmful effects causes by this compound on human health and environment confirm the highly importance of this issue the sustainable administration of the environment is only probable when the discharge of pollutants is reduced based on discharge standards and the elimination of existing pollution is carried out efficiently 22 the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater is a very challenging task due to its intractable behaviors 7 additionally it usually contains ingredients that are very difficult to be removed due to their non biodegradability poor adsorption ability and complex nature 9 for the purpose of treating different pharmaceutical pollutants many efforts have been done 23 27 for this purpose different processes include adsorption 28 29 filtration 30 electrocoagulation 31 32 membrane 33 reverse osmosis advanced oxidation and etc have been studied various type of materials such as covalent organic frameworks cofs 34 activated carbon ac 4 9 zeolite 35 nanomaterials 36 magnetic nanomaterials 37 graphene oxide chitosan 38 metal organic frameworks mofs 39 molecularly imprinted polymers mips 40 with respect to these methods principles have been used as sorbents and catalysts 34 in spite of applicability these materials are associated with limitations like as low number of reactive sites low physical and chemical stability and low adsorption capacity 41 other weaknesses include high costs high generation of sludge less efficiency low biodegradability less reduction in cod and bod of wastewater and creation of by products which require additional cost for treatment 42 44 even each technique is limited with its application and results 7 however to overcome the shortcomings of these process a combination of them have been studied as well some of these processes include nanofiltration membranes 45 nanocomposite ultrafiltration membrane psf pvp sio2 46 adsorptive ultrafiltration uf solar photo fenton 47 solar photocatalysis 48 photodegration 49 photo electro fenton electro fenton and membrane photobioreactor 5 11 50 in recent years biological treatment bt as the major industrial part of the pharmaceutical wastewaters has been an emerging field in environmental engineering on account of the developments of finding extremophiles i e halophilic microorganisms as the engineered strains pre treatment methods hybrid physio chemical treatments novel bioreactors and sludge acclimation methods 51 in which the microorganisms are used for the elimination of organic compounds nutrient ingredients and solid particles and degrade them into carbon dioxide and harmless water for different purposes 7 bt methods have received great attention for removal of pollutants from different environments thanks to their environmental sustainability high efficiency high adjustability and work based on green chemistry and principles at the molecular level to achieve sustainability they have received broad attention in the past decade due to their ability to limit the usage of chemical substances reducing maintenance costs and easy utilization to meet economic and environmental goals concurrently 52 gurung et al studied the removal of 23 emerging organic micropollutants eoms including a wide range of pharmaceuticals including act and steroid hormones detected in municipal wastewater by a pilot scale membrane bioreactor mbr plant at two different solid retention times srts of 60 and 21days they removed 99 9 act at concentration of 0 01 μg l at srt of 21 days and hrt of 42 h 53 baratpour et al using a hydrogen peroxide induced upflow fixed bed bioreactor ufbr a bio enzymatic method and removed over 99 of act and 72 of toc at initial act concentrations up to 300 mg l 54 park et al in south korea investigated the concentrations of 57 different pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps including act in the different treatment units of various biological treatment processes including modified biological nutrient removal bnr anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o and membrane bioreactor mbr they concluded that biological treatment processes appeared to be most effective in eliminating most ppcps and first mbr and then a2o played a key role in ppcps removal 15 komesli et al studied the removal of endocrine disrupting compounds such as act carbamazepine estrogen and progesterone by the mbr bioreactor on a real and laboratory scale the results showed that the input act at concentration of 480 ng l was completely eliminated in the real scale bioreactor 55 abdullah et al studied the removal of act with the associated metabolism process beer brewing wastewater by a fixed bed anaerobic bioreactor the results showed that in the best fixed bed anaerobic bioreactor operation removal of 98 and 93 of cod and toc respectively were obtained in three days hrt and after adding 15 mg l act 56 vona et al found act as one of the pharmaceutical compound with most difficulties to remove among different compound include ibuprofen diclofenac dulfamethoxazole clonazepam and diazepam act showed the highest removal efficiency using sbr about 90 95 among different processes include uf nf ac oxidation with clo2 and combined processes uf nf uf ac sbr clo2 14 mowla et al evaluated the treatment of synthetic wastewater containing pharmaceutical compounds including act salicylic acid diclofenac and chloramphenicol by conventional activated sludge process the results showed that at a 48 h hrt 67 of act 2 5 mg l was removed 57 fan et al studied the efficacy of submerged membrane bioreactor smbr in removing 5 pharmaceutical compounds of acetaminophen naproxen diclofenac carbamazepine and estradiol from municipal synthetic wastewater the studied submerged membrane bioreactor at a 6 h hrt had eliminated 92 2 of the act input to the system 58 leili et al studied removal of high concentration of furfural using chemical and biological methods by a cbr and showed that this reactor was able to remove more than 98 furfural and 71 equivalent cod at concentrations up to 1200 mg l of furfural at a hydraulic retention time of 12 1 with a 6 h aeration cycle 59 avila et al studied the influence of primary treatment hydrolytic upflow sludge blanket husb reactor vs conventional settling and operational strategy alternation of saturated unsaturated phases vs permanently saturated on the removal of act in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands they removed 95 act at concentration of 75 μg l 60 maeng et al investigated the effect of cellular retention time nitrification and microbial activity on the removal of various pharmaceutical compounds such as phenacetin acetaminophen caffeine bezafibrate ibuprofen and fenoprofen in the membrane bioreactor mbr according to the results the membrane bioreactor was able to remove 90 of act 1 μg l at an 8 day cellular retention time and 6 h hydraulic retention time 61 for the present study an advanced biological method has been used to remove act and cod from a high load of synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater unprecedentedly it is a cost effective environmentally friendly and high biodegradable process to remove high concentrations of pollutants from municipal or industrial wastewaters for this purpose cbr was used which is a modified version of conventional sbr process although there is a biological treatment and high load wastewater no pre treatment is required in this process instead of a batch flow there is a continuous flow in this way the pollutant is continuously injected into the reactor using a drip injection pump some of the main advantages of cbr include the possibility of treating wastewater containing toxic and inhibitory compounds by removing the hydraulic loads in just one container taking up less space and simpler management and operation this process is less affected by wastewater shock loading thanks to continuous flow therefore it could be used for the treatment of various types of municipal and industrial wastewaters with relatively high concentrations of pollutants other advantages of cbr are no need for a sedimentation tank and return activated sludge system lower reactor volume energy saving and increased mlss capability 62 65 during the study the effect of parameters such as cycle time 6 24 h hrt 10 06 27 3 h inlet pollutant concentration up to 500 mg l inlet cod concentration up to 7700 mg l and temperature 14 30 on reactor performance have been investigated and the performance of the two cbr and sbr compared then anova analysis and nonlinear regression for optimization was done in the end the results obtained on the removal of act and cod from aquatic solutions by cbr has been reported 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor setup a plexiglas and cylindrical reactor with an inner diameter of 20 cm and a height of 30 cm with a total volume of about 9 5 l was designed and manufactured on the laboratory scale an air pump model hailea aco 308 with diffusers was used to supply the required do with a minimum of 3 mg l three brass hose heads were installed on the reactor wall the first one for feeding synthetic wastewater the second one for the upper flow discharge and the third one as a safety valve which were at 2 5 cm 15 cm and 25 cm in height from the bottom of the reactor fig 1 shows other accessories include peristaltic pump electric valve timers synthetic wastewater container and treated wastewater container 2 2 preparation of act synthetic wastewater the synthetic wastewater provided daily by dissolving the desired amount of high purity of acetaminophen powder prepared by sigma aldrich and nutrients in distilled water and considering the c n p ratio of 100 5 1 the nutrients as listed in table 1 included ammonium sulfate as nitrogen source dipotassium hydrogen phosphate and potassium dihydrogen phosphate as phosphorus source and supplier of system buffering capacity calcium chloride and magnesium sulfate as needed for the cytoskeleton 2 3 method for measuring parameters molecular spectroscopy was used for the quantitation and separation of acetaminophen this method was employed because of the variability in the partitioning and solubility of acetaminophen among various mobile phase solutions and fixed phase column substances and the ease with which chromophores were generated with numerous groups of pharmaceuticals 2 the use of lc tof ms 66 lc esi ms ms 67 68 hplc uv dad 69 70 uplc ms ms 71 and other methods were reported it is essential to remark that because most pharmaceuticals are not volatile the gc ms method is not very common 72 uv vis array spectrophotometer model photonix ar2017 was used to measure act concentration for this purpose the maximum absorption wavelength should be determined thus samples with different concentrations were injected into the spectrophotometer at 220 400 nm then the absorption peaks were detected by the device the results are presented in fig 2 a according to the figure the mean absorbance peak was determined to be 247 nm this method was also used to measure other contaminants concentration 64 73 this wavelength range was also used for spectrophotometric measurement of act in other studies 74 75 after determining the maximum absorption the calibration curve was plotted to find out the relationship between the absorbance values and the specified concentrations then the equation of the line was obtained the solutions were made from act with specific concentrations then the absorbance equilibrium was read by the spectrophotometer the calibration chart is shown in fig 2 b to measure the concentration of cod the closed reflux method no 5220d mentioned in the 23rd edition of the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater was used 76 for this purpose first to obtain the calibration curve specific concentrations of potassium hydrogen phthalate khp solutions were obtained and finally according to the obtained absorption values and also the known cods of khp solutions the calibration curve was drawn other measured parameters which are shown in table 2 were based on the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater as well 76 all measurements during this study were repeated twice for all parameters to more accurately measure and reduce the probable errors moreover in cases that more repetition was required it was done 2 4 calculation the performance of cbr in the decomposition of act and cod have been evaluated based on the removal

anova analysis and nonlinear regression are a statistical method that uses quantitative data from appropriate experiments to determine regression model equations and optimization condition the optimization process involves two major steps which are estimating the coefficients in a mathematical model and predicting the response and checking the adequacy of the model 77 just factors with the most important effects like cycle time and cod and act concentration have been studied it is required to find a suitable approximation between factors and response surface the responses were used to develop an empirical model that correlated the responses to the cycle time and act and cod concentrations using two cubic polynomial equations the statistical software package design expert version 11 0 3 0 stat ease inc minneapolis usa has been used for regression analysis of experimental data to fit the equations developed and also to plot response surfaces anova was used to estimate the statistical parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 microbial population adaptation phase the adaptation phase was performed in two stages for 48 days first the microorganisms were accommodated to the type of contaminant act which was lasted for 30 days in batch mode second for 18 days the microorganisms were adjusted to the type of flow which was in continuous droplet way since it was a novel way for the purpose of avoiding any load shock and being sure of achieving high efficiencies this way was chosen fig 3 a shows first stage s results in this condition the required reaction time for reaching maximum efficiencies was 24 h whereas the initial concentration of act was 0 50 mg l and increased to 120 mg l within 30 days the initial mlss concentration was 730 mg l and increased to 4500 mg l at the end of the adaptation phase and adjusted to 4500 mg l during the whole experiments with discharging the excess mlss also during the adaptation and operation of the cbr the ph value was always kept neutral according to this figure gradually system efficiency was improved and cod removal efficiency increased cod removal efficiency at the end of tenth day was 64 between 14th and 20th days a stepwise increase was applied in act concentration from 1 mg l to 120 mg l however cod removal efficiency by about 22 increase reached from 64 to 86 the standard deviation of cod removal efficiency in the first 15 days was 10 which reduce to 2 in the last 15 days efficiency was monitored daily to achieve the value of 90 then the second phase of adaptation began at this stage a peristaltic pump was used for the droplet injection of the pollutant the cycle duration of 24 h the aeration time of 22 h and the injection flow rate of 0 13 l h were considered the hrt was 59 5 h during this 18 day adaptation period the concentrations of act and cod were 200 mg l and 500 mg l respectively the concentration of mlss at the end of this stage was 4500 mg l fig 3 b shows the changes in cod and act removal efficiencies during these 18 days as shown the act removal efficiency was initially 87 and increased to 99 during this period but for cod the difference between the minimum and maximum removal efficiency was less than 3 at this phase the mean removal efficiencies of act and cod are 98 and 95 respectively after the ninth day when stable conditions were established the next phase of the study performed by completing the adaptation phase 3 2 the effect of cycle time one of the important parameters in operating a cbr is its cycle time the cycle time has been changed from 6 to 24 h this part of the study lasted for about 40 days during this period the concentrations of act was about 200 mg l table 3 shows the other operating conditions of this period the reactor s performance during four cycles are shown in fig 4 a according to the chart with changing in the cycle time an initial decrease in the removal efficiency of cod and act could be observed which was very significant in the change from 12 h to 6 h cycle then gradually increased until reached to a constant rate and the next cycle was applied afterward in the shift from 24 h to 18 h cycle the removal efficiencies decreased but efficiencies increased within 10 days by keeping the cycle constant however in 12 h cycle the changes in act and cod removal efficiencies did not fluctuate much and act and cod were removed with a mean of 96 and 95 respectively finally in 6 h cycle with the highest decrease the lowest removal efficiencies were obtained a reduction in the aeration time or an increase in flow rate which can subsequently cause a reduction in hrt and the reactor fill time could be one of the main reasons for the reduction in efficiencies fig 4 b shows the mean removal efficiencies of act and cod when steady state equilibrium prevails during the cycle control period as shown in 18 h cycle with the mean removal efficiencies of 99 and 98 the highest removal efficiencies were obtained for act and cod respectively according to this graph the removal efficiencies of both parameters in 24 h cycle is about 2 lower than 18 h cycle this decrease could be due to an increase in the amount of mlss and consequently end up with a decrease in dissolved oxygen since the highest removal efficiencies of act and cod were obtained in 18 h cycle it has been considered as the optimal cycle 3 3 ccr calculation the results of calculating the ccr value for all experiments performed during the control period are shown in fig 5 according to the explanations in section 2 4 the values obtained by dividing the removal efficiency of each experiment by the average efficiencies obtained in 6 h cycle which are 90 02 and 89 18 for act and cod respectively according to these results the ccr changes for cod removal in 24 h cycle is almost constant with the mean value of 1 07 however the ccr reached from 1 04 to 1 10 for act which means that the efficiency increased by about 6 in 18 h cycle the ccr values for cod and act are approximately equal the changes varied between 1 04 and 1 10 where the reactor was in a steady state phase in 12 h cycle the ccr values for cod and act are approximately equal with no fluctuations the values of both parameters change in the range of 1 06 to 1 08 it means that the values of efficiencies in the steady state of 12 h cycle are about 7 higher than 6 h cycle fig 6 illustrates the average ccr values for cod and act removal within different cycles as shown in fig 6 the reactor s performance to remove both cod and act are the same except 24 h the highest removal efficiencies were achieved at 18 h cycle that they are 10 more than the 6 h cycle leili et al studied the effect of cycle time 6 12 and 24 h on the furfural degradation by a mixture of catalytic ozonation process cop and cbr process this study demonstrated that decreasing the cycle time results in a reduction in cod removal efficiency also it was found that removal efficiency in 12 h and 24 h cycles were close and had a remarkable reduction with decreasing the cycle time to 6 h 61 3 4 hrt effect the hrt effect on cbr performance was investigated in the range of 10 6 27 3 h over 10 days on cycle 6 h the input act and cod concentrations were 200 and 500 mg l respectively fig 7 shows the relation between hrt removal efficiencies and loading rate which was calculated by eq 3 based on these results with increasing hrt the removal efficiencies of both parameters have negligible increased just about 2 that it could be due to decreasing in act loading rate the highest hrt had the lowest loading rate which led to the largest increase in act and cod removal efficiency the optimal time is about 27 h if the goal is to achieve the highest act and cod removal efficiency and about 10 h if the goal is the highest pollutant loading rate leili et al investigated the various hrts 10 5 25 4 h on the furfural removal through the combined ozonation and cbr the results approved that decreasing in hrt reduce the process performance in both terms of cod and furfural moreover the reduction of hrt resulted in a substantial increase in the loading rate 59 in the removal of pharmaceuticals such as diclofenac or caffeine through adsorption with activated carbon they have found out that feed flow rate has negative effect in the breakthrough time the higher flow rate values caused less amounts of hrt and as has been showed in eq 3 it will increase the loading rate which will reduce the efficiency 78 79 but there are some exceptions as garcía mateos et al showed the variation of the ﬂow rate has a negligible impact on the shape of the breakthrough curves in the adsorption of act in activated carbon prepared from biomass from 4 to 8 ml min 80 as shown in table 4 considering that this is a completely biological and environmentally friendly method considerable efficiencies have been achieved in the hrt of 46 5 h however other methods are either a combination of chemical and biological methods or require a very high hrt which in addition to making it difficult to operate does not provide the desired efficiencies 3 5 the effect of input act and cod concentration the removal efficiency of act up to a concentration of 500 mg l in an 18 h cycle was evaluated with an injection flow rate of 0 18 l h over a 10 day period as shown in fig 8 a at a concentration of 100 mg l and even 200 mg l approximately complete removal of act was performed with increasing the concentration of act up to 500 mg l its removal efficiency decreased by about 2 97 89 baratpour et al using a hydrogen peroxide induced ufbr reactor a bio enzymatic method removed about 99 of act in a concentration up to 300 mg l but by increasing its concentration to 500 mg l the act removal efficiency decreased to 95 54 however in this investigation almost 98 of act at concentration of 500 mg l and 97 of cod at concentration of 2700 mg l were removed within a hrt of 46 5 h compared to other studies in the field of biodegradation of act this amount of input concentration and removal efficiency is high however according to the results it is clear that the cbr can effectively withstand the shock of high concentrations of act and achieve stable conditions of act removal efficiency the small difference in the efficiency of act removal in different concentrations and reaching stable situation indicates that the reactor s performance is resilient the very low decrease in act removal efficiency with increasing concentration could be due to the fact that high concentrations of the substrate act can act as a limiting agent therefore microorganisms at high concentrations reached their maximum biodegradation capacity finally for the purpose of evaluating the performance and response of the reactor in emergency situations with higher concentrations of pollutants and cod the experiment was continued up to a concentration of 1000 mg l as shown in fig 8 b the mean removal efficiency of act during this period was about 95 the reactor removed about 92 of act at a concentration of 1000 mg l the results show that cbr is a favorable process for the treatment of highly polluted wastewater and depending on the type of process stable conditions prevail very quickly baratpour et al and komesli et al studied the removal of act by ufbr and mbr reactors respectively they both succeeded to remove about 95 of act in concentrations up to 500 mg l and 480 ng l respectively based on their reactors feature which needed packing media and membrane in real scale the usage and maintenance of them could impose expenses to the project but cbr is just a fine tuned sbr and it could even be used to advance the old plants 54 55 the cod value also varied from 360 mg l to 8000 mg l fig 9 shows the changes in cod removal efficiency along with the input cod concentration according to the figure the removal efficiency with an average of 96 was in the range of 92 99 the result shows that cbr is one of the few biological processes that can easily remove cod up to a concentration of about 8000 mg l thanks to the injection type which is in droplet form this feature causes no shock to enter the system and does not cause any disturbance in operation in general it can be said that according to the obtained results cbr is one of the biological processes that is highly resistant to the concentration of cod entering the system and quickly establishes stable conditions without causing any shock thanks to the prominent feature of this reactor which is injection in the form of drops desirable results will definitely be obtained at higher concentrations which indicates the ability of this system to treat industrial wastewater with high pollution 3 6 the temperature effect on reactor performance during the cbr operation the average reactor temperature has always been around 20 c in this part of the study which lasted 20 days the temperature of the reactor was firstly increased to about 30 c using a water bath and insulation after considering the effect of high temperature the temperature inside the reactor and the synthetic wastewater container was returned to its original state average temperature of 21 c then the reactor worked at this state for 3 days in the next step the temperature was reduced to about 14 c by a water bath table 5 presents the wide range temperature 14 30 c influence on both act and cod removal efficiency the input act concentration of 100 mg l and the injection flow rate of 0 18 l h were considered according to table 5 by increasing temperature from the initial standard state 20 c to 30 c cod removal efficiency with a mean value of about 8 reduced significantly however in terms of act removal efficiency the small range of changes was observed nearly 1 reduction by decreasing temperature to 14 c the decline in the cod removal efficiency was about 4 and reached to the average value of 91 87 the amount of applied shock was very low in the act removal efficiency and the mean removal efficiency was about 97 during the low temperature effect control period one of reasons for the efficiency reduction in elevated temperatures could be the decrease in dissolved oxygen level as temperature goes up during the process from 7 5 mg l to 2 9 mg l in fact the reduction in microorganisms access to oxygen causes a decline in the removal efficiency contrary to what happened to the cod removal efficiency which was further reduced at high temperatures the situation was quite different for act removal efficiencies as it has been shown in comparison with the act removal efficiency in both low and high temperature the efficiency at high temperature has been more favorable act removal through other kinds of treatments such as adsorption by activated carbon have been similar and experiments have shown that increasing the temperature raises the molecular activity as well as the specific surface area of the activated carbon particles thereby increasing the adsorption rate and efficiency of the system 78 80 3 7 the comparison of the performance of two cbr and sbr the performance of two cbr and sbr in the removal of the act and cod was compared during the 20 day test the act concentration was about 200 mg l and the cycle duration was 24 h including 22 h of aeration 1 75 h of sedimentation and 0 25 h of discharge the temperature was around 20 c and the amount of dissolved oxygen was daily monitored first the reactor was set up based on the sbr method for 10 days in this process the tank was filled with the stock wastewater solution and then aeration was started during this time the output act and cod concentrations were measured daily at the end of this period the cbr reactor began operating with a flow rate of 0 13 l h during this 10 day period the concentrations of the output act and cod were measured again daily fig 10 shows the changes in the removal efficiency of cod and act during this 20 day period from the 11th day that the reactor was set up as cbr the rate of increase in the removal efficiencies of cod and act was significant table 6 shows the changes in act and cod removal efficiencies during the batch and continuous reactors startup according to this table in continuous flow mode cbr the rate of removal efficiency is significantly different from batch mode sbr vona et al obtained the highest removal efficiency for act through a sbr process about 90 95 among different types of processes including ultrafiltration nanofiltration activated carbon sbr and oxidation with clo2 14 but by changing system s flow mode from batch to continuous reactors performance increased more than 10 and 15 for act and cod removal respectively 3 8 technical and financial analysis in this part the costs of a wastewater treatment plant including initial costs equipment set up run operation and maintenance for three types of plants involve cbr sbr and continuous flow process cfp have been compared financial analysis for sbr and cfp has been derived from a study conducted by clark et al 82 cfp thanks to its simplicity and versatility is still widespread however this type of process needs extra containers and equipment for treatment 83 sbr method is popular as well thanks to its single container especially for areas with small lands or less population 84 as mentioned in the cbr s definition it is a fine tuned sbr the only difference is the type of pump therefore the cost of construction and maintenances of cbr and sbr could be considered equal approximately fig 11 shows the total cost and efficiency for these plants as shown up to a cod of 2000 mg l that a conventional biological process could be workable the cbr with the less amount of expenses has the highest efficiency in the higher amount of cod concentration it would be necessary to add another processes to reduce the cod concentration for a biological process except cbr which would apply extra expenses to the projects for the construction and required facilities but in the present study as shown in fig 9 cbr has removed 91 of cod at a concentration of 8000 mg l without any supplementary cost 3 9 development of regression model equation and statistical analysis the model was run in two steps first the effects of cycle and act concentration and then cycle and cod concentration on cbr performance were investigated since there is a direct connection between cycle and hrt just cycle s effects were considered for this purpose the experimental results imported to the software according to the sequential sums of squares the models were selected based on higher order polynomials where the additional terms were significant and models were not aliased for both responses act and cod removal efficiencies cubic models were selected as suggested by software regression analysis was performed to fit the responses functions of act and cod removal efficiencies the final cubic models in terms of coded factors after excluding the insignificant terms for act and cod removal efficiencies expressed by eqs 7 and 8 respectively variables take their coded values represents act removal efficiency y1 and cod removal efficiency y2 as a function of cycle x1 act concentration x2 and cod concentration x3 the range of variables and details are given in table 7 7 y 1 77 3202 2 91372 x 1 0 00463063 x 2 0 133003 x 1 2 8 07181 10 6 x 2 2 0 00196187 x 1 3 8 y 2 76 67380 1 96004 x 1 0 004096 x 3 0 054159 x 1 2 1 25278 10 6 x 3 2 9 49739 10 11 x 3 3 in these equations positive sign implies synergistic effect whereas negative sign implies antagonistic effect the models fit quality was judged from their coefficients of correlation and determination the r values for eqs 7 and 8 were 0 940 and 0 955 respectively both the obtained r2 values were relatively high indicating that there was a good agreement between the experimental data and predicted values from the models adjusted r2 values for eqs 7 and 8 were 0 937 and 0 953 respectively this indicates that 93 7 and 95 3 of the total variation in act and cod removal efficiencies respectively were attributed to the experimental variables studied the standard deviation for two models were 0 87 and 0 72 respectively for eqs 7 and 8 the small amount of standard deviations with the closer adjusted r2 values to the unity demonstrate how well the models are to predict values for the responses which are closer to the actual values this indicates that the predicted values for cod rem eff would be more precise and closer to its actual value compared to act removal efficiency adequate precision value which measures signal to noise ratios with desirable amount bigger than 4 recorded a preferable value of 58 81 and 71 11 for act and cod removal efficiencies respectively these imply that the models gave sufficient signals required to navigate the design space the adequacy of models was further justified through analysis of variance anova the anova for the cubic models for act and cod removal efficiencies are listed in tables 8 and 9 respectively from the anova for response surface cubic models for act and cod removal efficiencies the models f value of 180 46 and 236 63 respectively implied that the models were significant p values less than 0 05 indicate model terms are significant values greater than 0 10 indicate the model terms are insignificant in this case except all terms which are highlighted in these tables that are insignificant the others are significant to the responses statistical results show that these models were adequate to predict the act and cod removal efficiencies within the range of studied variables 3 9 1 cycle and concentrations on act and cod removal efficiency to investigate the effect of the factors cycle and act concentration and cycle and cod concentration on the act and cod removal efficiencies respectively the response surface methodology was used and figs 11 and 12 were drawn base on the anova results obtained cycle time and concentrations were found to have significant effects on cbr performance fig 11 shows the two and three dimensional response surfaces the combined effect of cycle time and act concentration on act removal efficiency in the contour diagram the horizontal axis represents the cycle and the vertical axis represents the act concentration and the curves and contours show the act removal efficiency which ranges from 86 5 99 9 the points marked in red have the highest removal efficiency and whatever tends to blue indicates unsuitable conditions and reduced efficiency to better understand the effect of the two significant variables cycle and concentration on the removal efficiency the three dimensional response surface has been structured it shows that the reactor has more favorable efficiencies in 15 24 h which the highest efficiency was obtained at about 18 h cycle as the cycle time decreases or the act concentration increases the system s efficiency also decreases the situation for cod removal efficiency is as same as act removal efficiency which is shown on fig 12 reactor has higher efficiencies in 12 to 24 h cycle that the highest efficiency was obtained at about 18 h cycle as well reactor was able to remove 93 5 of cod up to about 8000 mg l concentration 3 9 2 process optimization one of the aims of this study was to find the optimum process parameters relatively high efficiencies are expected to catch the highest compatibility cycle time was changed in range of 6 to 24 h act was in range of 100 500 mg l and for cod since the target of process is to remove the highest amount of cods using a biological and environmental friendly process it was varied 4000 7700 mg l therefore the act and cod both should have a highest efficiencies for economical viability for the purpose of compromising between responses the function of desirability was applied using design expert software version 11 0 3 0 stat ease inc minneapolis usa for verifying the experimental conditions the highest desirability were selected tables 10 show the act and cod removal efficiencies models validation as shown in fig 13 a and b it was observed that the experimental values obtained were in good agreement with the values predicted from the models with relatively small errors between the predicted and the actual values which were less than 1 for act and cod removal efficiencies fig 14 4 conclusion four cycles of 6 12 18 and 24 h were studied in about 40 days by changing the cycles there was a suddenly decrease in the removal efficiency of cod and act which was achieved a steady state with a gradual upward trend a significant decrease was observed in changing from the 12 h to the 6 h cycle the mean removal efficiency of cod and act in the 18 h cycle was higher than other cycles for both act and cod about 98 and 97 respectively as a result the 18 h cycle was considered the optimal cycle in the study for surveying the effect of hrt the reactor was set up with a 6 h cycle in which the removal efficiency of act and cod was more than 90 in all hrts it was observed that with decreasing hrt the act loading rate increased that the lowest hrt had the highest loading rate which led to the greatest decline in act and cod removal efficiencies the optimal time is about 27 h if the goal is to achieve the highest act and cod removal efficiency and about 10 h if the goal is the highest pollutant loading rate cbr thanks to the droplet injection feature could enhance the removal efficiency of organic matter compared to other continuous flow systems that leads to the system work without any shock the effect of temperature on reactor performance has been studied the results showed temperature changes have not much effect on act removal efficiency in contrast increasing in temperature significantly reduced cod removal efficiency which can be attributed to the decrease in soluble oxygen level the highest efficiency was obtained at a temperature of about 20 c which microorganisms adapted to this temperature from the beginning the performances of cbr and sbr were experimentally compared then a technical and financial analysis has been conducted for three types of biological processes including cbr sbr and a cfp the results showed cbr with less cost than a cfp and approximately equal to sbr has the highest efficiency considering on the contrary other two types of processes cbr has the stable efficiency up to cod of nearly 8000 mg l process optimization was carried out and the experimental values agreed satisfactorily with the values predicted by models the optimal cycle for act and cod removal was 18 h and removed 95 and 98 of cod and act at concentration of 7600 mg l and 500 mg l respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

13416,in the present paper the response surface methodology rsm was evaluated for optimizing the hexavalent chromium cr vi removal efficiency using our synthesized adsorbent i e fe3o4 nps loaded on activated carbon ac fe3o4 nps for studying the characteristics of synthesized catalyst the different analyses e g phpzc xrd fe sem and vsm was utilized as detected in results a suitable correlation could be perceived between the values obtained by experiments and the values predicted by the quadratic model p 0 05 results revealed that the efficiency of cr vi adsorption decreases by an increase in ph values and an increase in the reaction time and adsorbent dosage was led to development of the process efficiency through employment of analysis of variance anova for comparing acquired data the optimum conditions was proposed these conditions were ph of 3 pollutant concentration of 40 mg l the adsorbent concentration of 1 g l and time of 90 at these determined conditions cr vi adsorption efficiency was higher than 21 90 the cr vi adsorption experimental data were superlatively fitted to the freundlich isotherm model and the removal followed the pseudo second order kinetic model r2 0 99 the experimentally obtained maximum adsorption capacity of ac fe3o4 nps for cr vi adsorption was estimated to be 15 24 mg g keywords adsorption activated carbon hexavalent chromium surface response methodology 1 introduction in recent years the development of industries and civilization has led to increase the contamination of municipal and industrial wastewater which contain various contaminants especially heavy metals 1 2 heavy metal ions e g arsenic mercury lead and chromium due to their high toxicity and non biodegradability are very harmful or carcinogenic to human moreover it has also been identified that these elements are capable of possessing the hazardous threats to the environment even at low concentrations 3 5 among heavy metal ions chromium cr has identified as one of the most dangerous toxic metals that has many applications in various industries cr vi can be released into the environment from various industrial processes metallurgical and steel industries pigments manufacturing electroplating tanning metal finishing processes water cooling and chromate preparation are some of these industries 6 7 oxidation states of this element are in the range of 6 to 2 8 however its commonly observed oxidation states in soils and aqueous systems are cr iii and cr vi 9 the cr vi has generally propounded more toxic approximately 500 1000 times than the trivalent chromium discharging cr vi at various concentrations in the range of 5 220 mg l causes pollution in water and soil 10 since the solubility of cr vi in water is high it can easily absorb and accumulate in the kidneys stomach and liver and causes skin irritation 11 the methods which have been broadly utilized for eliminating cr vi from aqueous environments are photo catalytic 12 precipitation 13 membrane ﬁltration 14 biological method 15 ion exchange 16 and adsorption 17 mentioned treatment processes have been found to be associated with different removal efficiencies capital costs investments operating rates and their own advantages and disadvantages 18 among the different processes mentioned above the use of adsorption is more preferable compared to other conventional techniques for eliminating the recalcitrant pollutants from wastewater the favorability of adsorption is due to the advantages and characteristics which are listed as following low capital cost simplicity of design high effectiveness minimization of biological and chemical sludge generation insensitivity to toxic substances plain operation easy regeneration of the sorbents and the possibility of metal recovery 19 22 the adsorbents employed for removing heavy metals from wastewater include biomass microorganisms chitin chitosan agricultural waste clay zeolite and activated carbon 7 among mentioned adsorbents activated carbon has found as a powerful and versatile adsorbent applied for the adsorption of various type of pollutants both organic and inorganic compounds e g heavy metal ions from the aqueous phase the characteristics such as large surface area pore structure high catalytic activity surface chemical properties and thermal stability give this ability for this process 23 25 in spite of mentioned features high production and regeneration costs of the commercially available activated carbons result in appearing the challenges for employment of these adsorbents for the adsorbing heavy metals from polluted aqueous environments in large scale operations 26 this specifies the urgency of preparing the new adsorbents with low preparation costs and suitable effectiveness through utilizing inexpensive organic precursors or renewable sources 26 recently the potential of various agricultural and industrial wastes e g rice straw 27 sawdust 28 apricot stone 29 peanut shells 30 coconut shell 31 nutshells almond walnut and pecan 32 and algae 33 has been evaluated for preparing a low cost activated carbon additionally the producing the activated carbon from agricultural wastes facilitates the conversion of waste into useful adsorbents as provided by previous literature the characteristics of activated carbon suggestively influence the adsorption of pollutants onto activated carbon thus various physical and chemical activation methods including acid modification have been applied by researchers to improve the surface characteristics of the activated carbon 34 green algae an agricultural waste plant was employed for preparing activated carbon these algae as weeds grow up in rivers which can reach several meters in length in fact these plants block the path of the streams and prevent the passage of water easily after the removal of cr separating the adsorbent from the aqueous phase is done by ﬁltration and centrifugation approaches the use of these approaches for separating the adsorbent is led to the blockage of filters and the loss of adsorbent 35 to get rid of such disadvantages the employment of a magnetic separation method is one of the ways for solving this problem in this regard many researchers have focused on the combination of activated carbon and magnetic particles mentioned approach can offer both adsorption and magnetic properties in creation of a new absorbent 36 due to the unique properties of magnetic particles such as material stability uniform morphology of magnetic nano particles and eco friendly characteristics the use of fe3o4 nps is a promising particle to make the magnetic composite in the use of magnetic composite after the process of pollutant removal the magnetic composite can be collected from the aqueous media by using an external magnetic source the magnetic separation method is a faster method for collecting the adsorbent from the solution compared to the centrifugation and ﬁltration process 37 38 response surface methodology rsm is an approach includes independent factors and their corresponding relationship between the some obtained dependent responses 39 central composite design ccd and box behnken design bbd have been found to be the commonly used designs in rsm 40 41 bbd is considered as an efficient option in rsm bbd has been used as a tool to determine optimal conditions for desired responses in diverse studies 42 43 in order to reduce the number of the required experiments bbd was utilized for exploring the simultaneous effects of the independent variables on removal of cr vi as dependent variable to ascertain the optimum conditions for cr vi removal preparing activated carbon from waste algae with chemical activation method was the novelty of work so that activated carbon prepared from filamentous algae in combination with nanoparticle ac fe3o4 nanocomposite as new adsorbent was employed for removing cr vi from aqueous solution the present research consisted of three main steps as follow 1 the production of activated carbon from green algae as an abundant and low cost precursor using chemical activation with h3po4 followed by pyrolysis in a conventional furnace to obtain carbon adsorbent with high specific surface area and good chemical composition 2 magnetization of the prepared activated

examination nacl 0 01 m was poured into the solution and its ph was changed by adding naoh or h2so4 in the desired ranges 100 ml nacl 0 01 m was poured into different conical flasks and 0 2 g l of the ac fe3o4 nps was then added to the solutions after 48 h the measurement of the final ph of the solutions containing the adsorbent was done and the measured values were recorded in the end phfinal was plotted against phinitial 2 4 optimization of adsorption process by rsm method box behnken design bbd as the most widely used type of surface response method rsm was applied for modeling optimizing

interactive effects 48 the significance of each sentence in the regression equation was investigated and identification of the significant expressions in the model was done by the analysis of anova for each response the adsorption experiments were carried out by the ac fe3o4 nps under different conditions of process like ph adsorbent dose process time and initial concentrations of cr vi after adsorption experiments the adsorbent was immediately separated through a magnetic field then the concentration of the remaining cr vi ions was analyzed with a uv vis spectrophotometer lambda model

fig 1 a peaks at 2 theta 31 2 36 4 43 8 57 8 57 and 63 3 based this loading of the cubic structure of the fe3o4 nps on activated carbon is approved 52 53 in addition the peaks at 2 theta 24 5 26 8 and 28 3 belong to carbon in both two analyses 30 the magnetic hysteresis loop of the ac fe3o4 nps that was measured by vsm is shown in fig 1 b from the plotting of magnetization versus magnetic field weak hysteresis revealed that the resultant magnetic nanoparticles were super paramagnetic with a saturation magnetization ms of 12 04 emu g at room temperature the morphological features of the ac fe3o4 nps and ac fe3o4 nps examined by fe sem are presented in fig 2 it demonstrates the porous structure with high surface area of pure ac which leads to enhancing its usefulness for the cr vi removal the morphology of the fe3o4 nps in fig 2 illustrates a regular ordered structure and a spherical 3 2 analysis of the box behnken design bbd for appraising the information about interactive effects of the operational parameters on the process the analysis of variance anova was utilized using anova examination of the effective parameters for modeling the response was done based on f test and p values 54 55 in table 2 bbd for the results achieved by experiments and results predicted by model related to the cr vi removal by adsorption process onto the ac fe3o4 nps has been provided moreover table 3 represents the anova results of quadratic model for removal of cr vi as clarified by the anova the f value of 58 62 for the model implies the significant effect of the model on the response considering value of f values the order of effect associated with the studied parameters on the adsorption process was as follows ph adsorbent dosage initial concentration contact time the lack of fit f value of 0 1412 indicates that the lack of fit is not significant compared to the pure error and the related p value implying the significance of this model for predicting the experimental data the values of the r2 and r2 adj were observed to be 0 9856 and 0 9688 for cr vi respectively these values confirm the statistical model fitted the experimental data well and its applicability for predicting the removal percentage of cr vi analysis of variance anova illuminates that the actual relationship between the response the removal percentage of cr vi and the desired variables is sufficiently denoted by the model for obtaining regression equations different models e g linear quadratic and cube models were employed for data fitting the quadratic model is the best

decreases by increasing ph and vice versa as shown in fig 5 this decreasing trend might be attributable to the changes in surface charges of the adsorbent and chromium speciation as a function of ph in aqueous solutions cr vi shows different oxidation states and it commonly occurs in one of three ionic forms i e chromate cro4 2 bichromate hcro4 and dichromate cr2o7 therefore the relative abundance of the above mentioned ions is dependent on the solution ph which subsequently governs the nature of ionic species present in the solution in aqueous solutions at very strong acidic ph ph values lower than 2 cr vi starts convert into chromic acid and for ph values between 2 and 4 the chromium ions are predominantly present in the form of hcro4 as the ph of the solution increases

bichromate chromate and dichromate anions with negative charge under acidic conditions however for the conditions when ph is greater than phpzc the adsorbent surface is negatively charged in addition the concentration of oh increases which compete with cro4 2 and cr2o7 ions to be adsorbed on the surface of ac fe3o4 nps thus the removal efficiency decreases 57 59 enniya et al also could observed

initial concentration of studied pollutant i e cr vi its removal percentage reduced significantly this trend can be ascribed to the existence of a limited number of active sites on the adsorbent surface which are saturated beyond a certain optimum concentration 57 in contrast an increase in the initial cr vi concentration from 5 to 120 mg l leads to enhancement of the adsorption capacity from 2 79 to 18 16 mg g this phenomenon was expected because a greater driving force is created this event occurs due to the greater concentration gradient between cr vi in the solution and cr vi on the

increase in adsorbent dosage increasing the adsorbent dosage results in enhancing the adsorbent surface area and consequently the available adsorption sites for adsorption on the other hand for the lower dosages of the adsorbent lower adsorption sites are available for adsorbing chromium molecules causing a diminution in the removal efficiency 63 as the contact time increases the chance of

methodology 1 introduction in recent years the development of industries and civilization has led to increase the contamination of municipal and industrial wastewater which contain various contaminants especially heavy metals 1 2 heavy metal ions e g arsenic mercury lead and chromium due to their high toxicity and non biodegradability are very harmful or carcinogenic to human moreover it has also been identified that these elements are capable of possessing the hazardous threats to the environment even at low concentrations 3 5 among heavy metal ions chromium cr has identified as one of the most dangerous toxic metals that has many applications in various industries cr vi can be released into the environment from various industrial processes metallurgical and steel industries pigments manufacturing electroplating tanning metal finishing processes water cooling and chromate preparation are some of these industries 6 7 oxidation states of this element are in the range of 6 to 2 8 however its commonly observed oxidation states in soils and aqueous systems are cr iii and cr vi 9 the cr vi has generally propounded more toxic approximately 500 1000 times than the trivalent chromium discharging cr vi at various concentrations in the range of 5 220 mg l causes pollution in water and soil 10 since the solubility of cr vi in water is high it can easily absorb and accumulate in the kidneys stomach and liver and causes skin irritation 11 the methods which have been broadly utilized for eliminating cr vi from aqueous environments are photo catalytic 12 precipitation 13 membrane ﬁltration 14 biological method 15 ion exchange 16 and adsorption 17 mentioned treatment processes have been found to be associated with different removal efficiencies capital costs investments operating rates and their own advantages and disadvantages 18 among the different processes mentioned above the use of adsorption is more preferable compared to other conventional techniques for eliminating the recalcitrant pollutants from wastewater the favorability of adsorption is due to the advantages and characteristics which are listed as following low capital cost simplicity of design high effectiveness minimization of biological and chemical sludge generation insensitivity to toxic substances plain operation easy regeneration of the sorbents and the possibility of metal recovery 19 22 the adsorbents employed for removing heavy metals from wastewater include biomass microorganisms chitin chitosan agricultural waste clay zeolite and activated carbon 7 among mentioned adsorbents activated carbon has found as a powerful and versatile adsorbent applied for the adsorption of various type of pollutants both organic and inorganic compounds e g heavy metal ions from the aqueous phase the characteristics such as large surface area pore structure high catalytic activity surface chemical properties and thermal stability give this ability for this process 23 25 in spite of mentioned features high production and regeneration costs of the commercially available activated carbons result in appearing the challenges for employment of these adsorbents for the adsorbing heavy metals from polluted aqueous environments in large scale operations 26 this specifies the urgency of preparing the new adsorbents with low preparation costs and suitable effectiveness through utilizing inexpensive organic precursors or renewable sources 26 recently the potential of various agricultural and industrial wastes e g rice straw 27 sawdust 28 apricot stone 29 peanut shells 30 coconut shell 31 nutshells almond walnut and pecan 32 and algae 33 has been evaluated for preparing a low cost activated carbon additionally the producing the activated carbon from agricultural wastes facilitates the conversion of waste into useful adsorbents as provided by previous literature the characteristics of activated carbon suggestively influence the adsorption of pollutants onto activated carbon thus various physical and chemical activation methods including acid modification have been applied by researchers to improve the surface characteristics of the activated carbon 34 green algae an agricultural waste plant was employed for preparing activated carbon these algae as weeds grow up in rivers which can reach several meters in length in fact these plants block the path of the streams and prevent the passage of water easily after the removal of cr separating the adsorbent from the aqueous phase is done by ﬁltration and centrifugation approaches the use of these approaches for separating the adsorbent is led to the blockage of filters and the loss of adsorbent 35 to get rid of such disadvantages the employment of a magnetic separation method is one of the ways for solving this problem in this regard many researchers have focused on the combination of activated carbon and magnetic particles mentioned approach can offer both adsorption and magnetic properties in creation of a new absorbent 36 due to the unique properties of magnetic particles such as material stability uniform morphology of magnetic nano particles and eco friendly characteristics the use of fe3o4 nps is a promising particle to make the magnetic composite in the use of magnetic composite after the process of pollutant removal the magnetic composite can be collected from the aqueous media by using an external magnetic source the magnetic separation method is a faster method for collecting the adsorbent from the solution compared to the centrifugation and ﬁltration process 37 38 response surface methodology rsm is an approach includes independent factors and their corresponding relationship between the some obtained dependent responses 39 central composite design ccd and box behnken design bbd have been found to be the commonly used designs in rsm 40 41 bbd is considered as an efficient option in rsm bbd has been used as a tool to determine optimal conditions for desired responses in diverse studies 42 43 in order to reduce the number of the required experiments bbd was utilized for exploring the simultaneous

mediated zero valent iron zvi system was applied to the leachate after coagulation a response surface methodology rsm based on a box behnken design bbd was adopted to optimise the fenton like process a quadratic polynomial model was used on the data with r2 of 0 996 and 0 998 for total organic carbon toc and nh4 removal respectively influence of three main factors was investigated namely ph molar ratio of h2o2 zvi and concentration of h2o2 for toc and nh4 removal in optimum conditions of 30 min reaction time ph 3 h2o2 43 82 mm molar ratio h2o2 zvi of 3 89 effectiveness of elimination of toc and nh4 was 59 98 and 98 3 respectively combined technology of bio coagulant and fenton like reaction was confirmed to be a competent process for treating leachate with 72 6 toc and 98 98 nh4 removal supposed operation costs for the coupling of treatments can be estimated at 5 67 m3 thus reductions in nh4 and mineralization were achieved cost effectively by combining bio coagulation with protein extracted from mo seeds and a fenton like process activated by zvi keywords mature landfill leachate bio coagulant moringa oleifera seed fenton like process zero valent iron box behnken design 1 introduction landfill is the most widely used method of municipal solid waste msw disposal in developing countries 1 the primary disadvantage of landfill is the generation of a huge volume of leachate which can contain extremely toxic contaminants the characteristics of leachate are influenced by landfill age weather conditions and the contents of the landfill waste leachate can include organic substances which are highly polluting nitrogen compounds suspended solids and heavy metals 2 the leachate can be divided into three types based on the age of the landfill young intermediate and mature leachate from young landfill 5 years is usually polluted by high concentrations of organic contaminants with a bod5 cod ratio higher than 0 5 and a ph of around 4 3 mature leachate 10 years is characterised by recalcitrant contaminants high concentrations of ammoniacal nitrogen 3000 5000 mg l 1 medium concentrations of toc 4000 mg l 1 and a bod5 cod ratio of less than 0 1 4 it is difficult to treat mature leachate completely using biological methods 5 according to previous studies mature leachate must be treated using physico chemical techniques such as coagulation flocculation cf 6 advanced oxidation processes aops 7 8 or other combination technologies 9 10 cf is a relatively simple technology that can be used to reduce contaminants from young to mature landfill leachates 11 traditional coagulants such as aluminium sulfate alum ferrous sulfate and poly aluminium chloride are used 5 kumar et al applied rsm bbd for optimization coagulation process for treating landfill leachate by fecl3 the results were shown that maximal decreasion of 71 93 86 and 99 6 cod phosphate colour and sulfate at optimal fecl3 dosage 3 g l ph 8 during 95 min 12 yadav et al used fecl3 and pacl as coagulants for pretreatment mature landfill leachate in india the removal efficiency for cod and toc by fecl3 was 53 and 52 respectively and for pacl the highest reduction of cod and toc were 59 and 57 respectively 13 however cf is expensive has inimical effects on human health and produces a large quantity of sludge 14 plant derived coagulants have been used to treat pollutants with methods including removal of cod and colour from landfill leachate by coupling natural coagulants extracted from ocimum basilicum and ozone technology 15 reducing compost leachate using quince seed mucilage 16 and removing organic contaminants via cod from compost leachate using salvia hispanica 17 in this research a bio coagulant was efficiently extracted from moringa oleifera mo seeds for pretreatment of stabilised landfill leachate mo seeds have been shown to remove turbidity and organic pollutants from surface water 18 and adsorb organic contaminant from slaughterhouse wastewater 19 the mechanism is that proteins of mo seeds are obtained as a natural cationic polyelectrolyte and present primary characteristics for coagulation they linked with suspended particles in the water by charge neutralization to produce the floc thus it was removed quickly from water in the sedimentation process 20 drawback of using mo seeds in treatment water is that increasing organic material into water hence ghebremichael et al reported that extracting active coagulate component including lipid carbonhydrate from the mo seed could decrease the total of organic matters added during the treatment process furthermore aops such as a fenton like process with zero valent iron zvi have been found to eliminate organic contaminants completely in this process zvi is dissolved and releases ferrous iron from the surface of zvi powder under acidic conditions as shown in eq 1 then the fe2 ion immediately reacts with h2o2 in the fenton process as described in eq 2 1 fe0 h fe2 h2 2 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh organic matter reacts with oh as shown in eq 3 3 rh oh r oh the reaction between the hydroxyl radical oh and nh4 to remove ammonium ion compounds is presented in eq 4 21 4 nh4 oh nh2oh noh no hno2 hno3 bogacki et al reported that 50 1 toc in landfill leachate were removed by fe h2o2 process with ph 3 and molar ratio of h2o2 fe 3 8 22 similar mahtab et al applied rsm ccd to find the optimal value of fenton process for treatment leachate the highest cod removal of 61 was occured at ph 3 1 fe2 dosage of 40 mm and h2o2 dosage of 75 mm 23 however the fenton like process activated by zvi is quite expensive to boost treatment efficiency and decrease chemical consumption a fenton like process combined with coagulation may be promising in terms of increasing biodegradability and reducing cost in the work of isak et al 2018 90 9 or 91 5 of cod in mature landfill leachate was successfully treated using the chemical coagulant fecl3 combined with persulfate or peroxymonosulfate oxidation under uv light respectively 24 however to date there has been no report on the application of protein from mo seeds as a natural coagulant for treatment of stabilised leachate or as a combination bio coagulation with a fenton like process activated by zvi according to research on the fenton like system optimisation can be achieved by changing ph while other factors remain unchanged this method wastes time and energy and it is usually hard to achieve optimum performance since the method neglects interactions between influences nonetheless the primary benefit of applying response surface methodology rsm as an optimisation tool is to reduce the number of experimental runs and supply adequate information to obtain statistically acceptable results thus less effort is needed than with full factorial experimentation 25 rsm include full factorial design doehlert design dd central composite design ccd and box behnken design 26 bbd was invented by box and behnken in 1960 it is potential response surface design which presents information particularly on effect of experiment factors and total experimental error in a minimum number of required runs the designs show extremely symmetry and rotatability as well as generate minimum experimental reaction as compared to common ccd and distribute maximum information 27 this study aimed to determine the effectiveness of bio coagulation coupled with a fenton like reaction for degradation of mature landfill leachate in this method bio coagulant was extracted from mo seeds and used in the cf pretreatment phase a fenton like process was then used in the post treatment phase and the optimum settings for the process were determined rsm was applied to optimise the fenton like process with a box behnken design bbd to reduce the toc and remove nh4 which two primary properties of mature leachate with three operational conditions initial ph concentration of h2o2 and the ratio of zvi h2o2 dosage the cost of coupled bio coagulation and a fenton like process for treatment of mature leachate was analysed and compared with a conventional fecl3 coagulant zvi h2o2 process 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample of landfill leachate leachate samples were collected during three months in the summer of 2019 from leachate ponds from a closed municipal landfill pit which was part 1 of the nam son municipal landfill located in soc son province hanoi vietnamn the nam son municipal landfill is a giant landfill of over 157 ha in the north of vietnam the complex was built in 1999 and receives approximately 5000 tonnes of municipal solid waste per day 20 l leachate samples were collected each month and stored at 4 c in pharmaceutical refrigerators panasonic japan before being analysed using standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 28 the characteristics of the leachate are presented in table 1 the dark coloured liquid with high cod and ammonium concentrations and low bod5 cod 0 84 and a high toc cod 0 53 ratio is typical of stabilised leachate 2 2 reagents zvi purity 98 200 mesh was purchased from acros belgium hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 was obtained for use in fenton like oxidation from duc giang ltd vietnam n hexane protease enzyme was applied to extract protein from mo seeds and was purchased at analytical grade from sigma uk sodium hydroxide naoh 0 1 m and hydrochloric acid hcl 0 1 m adjusted ph were purchased from xichlong china 2 3 materials the mo seeds were purchased in binh thuan province vietnam the seeds were cleaned dried under sunlight and then store in a desiccator duran germany 2 4 extraction of protein from mo seeds the flour of mo seeds was obtained by grinding the whole seeds in a mill with a 1 mm mesh and screened by 10 xx mesh n hexane was used to de fat the flour ground seeds were blended with n hexane at a 1 3 w v ratio for 15 min at 45 c under ultrasound this procedure was repeated three times the defatted sample was then air dried and stored at 4 c before use extraction of protein using protease from bacillus licheniformis 2 4 u g was the chosen method the extraction process was carried out for 1 h at a temperature of 40 c in a ratio of material to distilled water of 1 3 w v with an enzyme concentration to liquid phase of 1 ml 100 ml after extraction the solution was centrifuged at 4000 g for 20 min at 10 c the supernatant was gathered and freeze dried the protein extract was designated bcmo as in the process shown in fig 1 2 4 1 determination of the chemical composition of mo seed and protein extracts the moisture ash crude protein total lipid and mineral contents of the mo seeds and protein extracts were determined using the association of official analytical chemists method and a conversion factor of 6 25 was applied 29 all experiments were carried out in triplicate and mean values with standard deviations sd were reported using microsoft excel 2016 microsoft usa 2 5 coagulation flocculation experiments a six place jar test apparatus was used for the cf experiments velp jlt6 italia following hoa and hue 2018 18 bcmo and fecl3 were added from 0 mg l to 180 mg l at six different ph values 4 9 to 500 ml of the mature leachate sample the solution was mixed for 5 min at 200 rpm then slowly stirred at 40 rpm for 20 min before the solution was settled for 30 min after settling the supernatant was analysed for toc and nh4 reduction the percentage of removed toc and nh4 were determined by equation eq 5 5 h c 0 c i c o x 100 where co and ci are the initial and post treatment concentrations for toc or nh4 the sludge volume after the cf process was calculated by equation eq 6 30 6 v s l u d g e v s e t t l e d v s a m p l e where vsludge vsettled vsample are the volume of sludge after cf ml sludge after settling ml and mature landfill leachate sample l 2 6 design of experiments statistical analysis and optimisation a three variable bbd was employed in this research to reduce the number of experiments bbd is an useful experimental design for rsm it is a rapid and saving statistical technique that is generally employed to determine experimental data and study the separate and interactive effects of factors and develop an empirical model 31 the variables and levels were determined for 50 ml of pretreated leachate using the cf process with the bio coagulant extracted from mo seeds put into a 250 ml beaker with adjusted ph 3 5 concentration of h2o2 40 80 mm and ratio of h2o2 zvi 2 4 nh4 and toc removal was measured as the response the experimental design is reported in table 2 and used design expert version 11 0 software stat ease usa a partial cubic polynomial model was considered to be appropriate for studying the influence of the variables on responses after testing more complex models from linear to partial cubic an analysis of variance anova was applied to show that the evolved models were statistically meaningful optimisation was implemented with the software using maximum and economic analysis 2 7 analytical method the ph was measured using a ph meter milwaukee mw 101 poland tss method 2540d and bod5 method 5210b determination were made following standard methods while cod was estimated by the closed reflux method 5220 c nh4 no3 po4 3 and so4 2 were measured using a spectrometer dr 3900 hach usa with the hach method toc concentration was determined using a torch analyser jenway spectrophotometer uk a shimadzu aa 670 flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer was used to determine cu zn al and cd levels the ph of the zero point charge phzpc for bcmo was measured following nguyen et al 2020 32 in this experiment 20 ml of 0 01 m nacl solution was put in a 100 ml erlenmeyer flask the ph was then adjusted to values of between 3 and 12 using either naoh or hcl 0 2 g l of bcmo was added after 24 h the final ph was measured and a ph curve plotted the ph where the curve crossed the ph final to ph initial line was used as the phzpc of the bcmo and was determined to be 6 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 bcmo characteristics 3 1 1 composition of mo seeds and protein extracts table 4 shows the approximate composition of mo seeds and protein extract bcmo the raw material had a high protein content 33 4 0 2 with carbohydrate of 18 5 0 3 and low ash and moisture the amount of protein in mo seeds is higher than that in other grains such as amaranth 16 5 17 55 33 bitter melon 34 and rice 35 the high protein content suggests that mo seeds can be used for protein products in the food industry including bio coagulants for water treatment however the seeds contain a variety of fats and it is crucial that the seeds are defatted before protein extraction as shown in table 4 all the bcmo samples contained a large amount of protein 83 78 0 52 extracted using protease enzyme from bacillus licheniformis the ash and moisture contents of the protein extracts were low compared with the carbohydrate in the raw material the amount of carbohydrate in bcmo was significantly lower the low fat content in the two samples indicates that removing lipids using n hexane is effective eliminating the fat from seed flour is a key step in protein extraction since it would increase organic pollutants by adding fatty acids into water industries such as the food and pharmaceutical industries could potentially use the oils from mo seeds 3 1 2 ft ir of bcmo the functional groups in the bcmo were identified by ft ir analysis all the common bonds of protein structures were shown in the ft ir spectrum of bcmo fig 2 such as the amide i at 1639 cm 1 and the amide ii band at 1546 cm 1 the samples also contained water o h at 3435 cm 1 and carbohydrates c h at 2929 cm 1 36 the presence of plentiful functional groups indicates that there are many adsorption points for the coagulant interparticle connecting effect 16 3 2 pretreatment of mature leachate by bio coagulation bcmo cf is a relatively straightforward technology and is widely used in pretreatment of mature landfill leachate chemical coagulation for landfill leachate reduction is based on adding ferric alum salts although it has been shown that iron salts are more efficient than aluminium salts 37 thus fecl3 was chosen to compare with the bcmo bio coagulant in removing tss toc and ammonium ions from mature landfill leachate samples it is important to reduce tss and organic pollutants and change colour to improve the efficiency of subsequent treatment processes the cf process includes an imbalanced colloidal suspension thereby increasing particle collection 38 3 2 1 effect of coagulant concentration the effectiveness of coagulants in removing toc tss and nh4 was determined with a coagulant concentration bcmo or fecl3 from 0 mg l to 180 mg l with an initial ph of the leachate sample of 7 6 as shown in fig 3 cf was effective in removing the tss from the mature landfill leachate while levels of toc and ammonium ion were only slightly reduced when using either fecl3 or bcmo the results were 69 44 for tss 16 24 for toc and 33 11 for ammonium ions at the optimum dosage of coagulant bcmo of 90 mg l when the bcmo concentration was increased from 30 mg l to 90 mg l the efficiency of toc removal rose from 4 5 to 16 24 the organic matter in landfill leachate includes humic acids fulvic acid proteins microbial products and hydrophilic organic matter most of these are aquatic humic substances in the form of colloids 39 the mechanisms for toc treatment with a coagulation process include charge neutralisation entrapment and adsorption based on coagulants forming insoluble particulate aggregates a greater coagulant concentration means that polymeric substances with higher positive charge densities were generated benefiting toc reduction by adsorption and charge neutralisation under these conditions the coagulant bcmo exhibited good charge neutralisation bridging and sweep floc abilities removing toc for adsorption polar functional groups such as o h c o and c n have been found to be involved in the removal processes 40 fecl3 required more mass as a coagulant with 150 mg l to remove 69 7 of the tss 10 43 of the toc and 22 08 of the nh4 tss removal efficiency was shown to decline from 44 3 to 35 01 when the fecl3 concentration was increased from 90 to 180 mg l likewise the percentage of toc and nh4 removed was found to decrease to 6 53 and 26 7 respectively an explanation could be that that colloidal particles restabilise when using coagulant in excess of the optimal concentration 41 3 2 2 effect of ph fig 4 illustrates different parameters tss toc and nh4 for mature landfill leachate treated with bcmo and fecl3 concentrations of 90 mg l and 150 mg l with ph ranging from 4 to 9 for cf with the bio coagulant bcmo the highest rates of tss toc and nh4 removal of 78 77 40 17 and 21 56 respectively were achieved at ph 7 the primary mechanisms for pollutant treatment using bcmo are destabilised colloids particles charge neutralisation and adsorption 42 for tss removal the mechanisms of bio coagulation by bcmo are a cross linked form combined with network structures in addition increasing alkaline values enhances the cf process when the ph of the solution increases because of the generation of hydroxyl groups 20 sivakumar 2013 also found that the optimum ph for removing 84 5 cod and 82 6 tds in leachate landfill by mo seeds is 7 43 in the case of removing nh4 when ph below 7 the efficiency of removal decreased rapidly to 28 96 nonetheless the highest nh4 reduction with bcmo was achieved at ph 7 this result can be explained by the distinction between chemical properties and functional groups on the surface of bcmo at ph phpzc 6 9 the surface may become positively charged therefore making h ions fully effective in reacting with ammonium cations causing a decrease in the reduction of nh4 at ph 7 colloidal particles are negatively charged enhancing ammonium treatment through electrostatic attraction forces when ph rises from ph 9 ammonium reduction declines due to the reaction of nh4 ions with oh according to the ammonia stripping equation eq 7 8 extreme basic ph promotes the production of ammonia gas however this incurs additional cost as more lime is needed to adjust the ph 7 nh4 oh nh3 h2o 8 nh3 h3o nh4 oh with fecl3 as the coagulant the maximum tss removal of 76 82 was achieved at ph 9 on the other hand the optimum ph for toc and nh4 reduction was 5 with 19 08 and 31 56 removal respectively according to previous studies lower ph values are most suitable for treating mature landfill leachate with high levels of removal of cod at ph 5 and 6 in ph 7 ferric iron fe3 can react with hydroxyl and produce fe oh 3 promoting flocculation it should also be noted that both reagents can act concurrently as a coagulant enabling the best destabilisation and aggregation of flocs 10 the percent of sludge volume ml of sludge per 100 ml of leachate produced in the optimum conditions of bcmo and fecl3 was 38 7 and 46 8 respectively with their physical properties and bridging power natural coagulants can create less quantity of sludge 44 on the other hand iron produces a bulky coagulated precipitate with an absorption effect generating a greater volume of sludge based on economic and environmental effect the bcmo option is preferable it has a lower chemical cost for adjusting ph and the operational cost of treating the sludge produced is also lower the characteristics of mature leachate after the cf process using bcmo bio coagulants are shown in table 1 although bio coagulants have advantages for water and wastewater treatment they have some drawbacks including substantial cod and organic load after treatment 45 however in this study a significant decrease in the cod of the treated leachate at 89 1 was obtained using protein extracted from mo seeds it should be noted that the protein extracted from mo seeds was also evaluated for the treatment of leachate 3 3 post treatment of mature leachate by a fenton like process activated by zvi 3 3 1 model fitting and anova 3 3 1 1 toc reduction the design matrix of the variables shown in table 3 was applied to obtain the level of toc reduction fitting the figures to different linear two factorial quadratic and cubic models was considered with a subsequent anova table 5 the results indicate that a quadratic polynomial model fits toc removal the equation eq 9 for the model in respect of coded factors is illustrated below 9 toc 20 23 17 18a 1 48b 4 63c 4 63ab 4 22ac 1 3bc 7 9a2 6 18b2 0 091c2 where a is the ph value of mature landfill leachate b is the concentration of h2o2 mm and c is molar ratio h2o2 zvi anova examination of the toc removal model is shown in table 5 the f value was 494 24 with a p value less than 0 05 0 0001 which shows that model fit is significant at a 95 confidence level moreover the study achieves a high coefficient of analysis r2 0 9984 when testing the null hypothesis to determine the consequence of each term in the model the concentration of h2o2 was the only parameter in the developed model found not to be crucial on the other hand the effect of the interaction between three factors ph h2o2 and h2o2 zvi was of high significance in this model a c ab ac a2 and b2 are significant model terms table 5 a bbd was used to consider the effect of different factors on the removal of nh4 the percentages of ammonium ion removal employing design matrix of different factors are shown in table 3 a quadratic polynomial model is the best fit for nh4 removal with p value 0 0001 f value 98 43 and a high coefficient of analysis r2 0 9922 adequate precision was shown by a signal to noise ratio of the developed model 29 7469 4 which indicates that the model for nh4 removal is correct likewise the model shows no lack of fit at the 95 significance level anova analysis for this model is illustrated in table 5 the equation for the nh4 reduction model depends on coded parameters and is shown by equation eq 10 10 nh4 36 23 24 12a 7 61b 8 69c 3 86ab 12 93 ac 7 35 bc 14 64 a2 14 76 b2 13 45 c2 in this model in this case a b c ac bc a² b² c² are significant model terms 3 3 2 effect of parameters since ph directly influences zvi corrosion and the quantity of dissolved o2 in solution it is evident that ph is one of the most critical factors moreover the production of free radicals in the fenton like process is also controlled by ph 46 ertugay et al were able to remove leachate efficiently at ph 2 4 using a fenton like process activated by zvi production of hydroxyl radicals increased in acidic conditions strengthening degradation of fulvic acid humic acids and aromatic structures in stabilised leachate therefore both zvi corrosion and ho production rise with a decline of ph 47 fig 5 presents contours and response surface plots for a function of ph versus the zvi h2o2 ratio when the dosage of h2o2 is stable at 60 mm the maximum removal of toc and nh4 was achieved at a ph of 3 the results show that increasing h2o2 concentration affects toc and nh4 reduction with an h2o2 dose of 43 82 mm the maximum removal of toc and nh4 was 62 84 and 93 69 respectively the optimum zvi h2o2 ratio is favourable to preventing a possible reaction between zvi and h2o2 and decreases the generation of iron complexes fig 6 shows the interaction between ph and h2o2 concentration on the fenton like oxidation of mature landfill leachate through toc and nh4 at the optimal ph toc and nh4 reduction is strengthened at a ratio of zvi h2o2 of 3 8 due to the reinforced formation of hydroxyl radicals the initial ph value significantly influences the removal of nh4 the removal rate of ammonium ions decreases with the increase in the initial ph value the degradation of nh4 by oh under acidic conditions through a fenton like system is described by eq 3 acidic conditions contribute to the oxidation of ammoniacal nitrogen by reactive hydroxyl radicals in addition iron complexes could not form reducing the production of oh in the fenton like process 3 3 3 optimisation of the fenton like process by using the optimisation function bbd can predict the optimal combination of parameters to obtain the highest percentage toc and nh4 treatment at ph 3 an h2o2 concentration of 43 82 mm and zvi h2o2 ratio of 3 89 the toc and nh4 the maximum reduction in the fenton like process was achieved the overall toc and nh4 removal in the optimum conditions for the fenton like process was 62 84 and 93 69 respectively the actual experimental values measured were 65 0 for toc treatment and 98 2 for ammonium ion removal table 1 summarises the characteristics of the treated mature landfill leachate before and after treatment by cf by bcmo and zvi h2o2 processes the results were illustrated degradation of cod bod5 tss no3 po4 3 so4 2 e coli and total coliform at 98 37 86 21 89 46 93 74 61 85 67 5 99 83 and 99 97 respectively after combination cf by bcmo and zvi h2o2 system the efficiency of cod reduction by integration cf and fenton like process was higher than previously investigated for leachate treatment with a coupling of cf and fenton oxidation kanaani et al 2021 investigated the coupling of bio coagulation from quince seed mucilage and a fenton process removing 84 of cod 48 amor et al 2015 treated leachate using chemical coagulant at 2 g l fecl3 at ph 5 with a fenton system with a reduction of 63 in cod 80 in turbidity and 74 in total polyphenols 10 also metals such as zn cu al and cd were completely removed by cf by bcmo coupled with zvi h2o2 3 4 cost estimation in the main economic analysis operating cost of treated leachate oc m3 can be measured by estimating two main cost items the quantity of chemicals consumed and the landfill cost of sludge from the cf and fenton like processes in the vietnamese market in september 2020 the prices of chemicals usage in fenton like process were 1 43 kg for h2o2 and 1 40 kg for h2so4 the prices of coagulants were 6 45 kg for fecl3 and bcmo the landfill cost of produced sludge was 0 10 kg in this case the operating costs for cf and fenton like processes were calculated using the following equations eq 11 49 11 o c m 3 c c h e m i c a l c s l u d g e cost analysis is a crucial factor in applying of bio coagulants in mature landfill leachate treatment the cost of the cf process is primarily influence in price of the coagulant therefore it is essential to ensure that the coagulant is cost effective a detailed cost breakdown in laboratory production of 1 kg of bcmo is given in table 6 it is true that the preparation of bcmo costs 3 06 usd per kg while cost of fecl3 in vietnam is approximately 6 45 usd kg this result shows that bcmo hydrogel could be considered a cost efficient coagulant the likely costs for treatment using bcmo bio coagulation and a fenton like process appear to be competitive and are better than the results previous report for the removal of mature leachate by advanced oxidation process aops for instance anfruns et al 2013 used a coupling of a biological method anammox with two aops ferric chloride ozonisation and homogenous photo fenton and estimated the cost of treating leachate with bod5 cod 0 13 were 7 18 m3 compared to 5 67 m3 in our study 50 4 conclusion cf and a zvi mediated fenton like system were used successfully to treat landfill leachate the first time protein extracted from mo seeds based on enzyme technique was found to be an extremely useful bio coagulant that can be used for the pretreatment of leachate the combination of coagulation with a fenton like reaction reduced the quantity of bcmo required to remove toc and ammonium ion 72 6 toc removal and 98 98 nh4 reduction was obtained at ph 3 an h2o2 concentration of 43 82 mm and a zvi h2o2 ratio of 3 89 the results show that the coupled technology of bio coagulation by protein from mo seeds and the fenton like process activated by zvi can save money and be an efficient option for mature leachate treatment funding the author s received no specific funding for this work declaration of competing interest the authors

13417,in this research protein was extracted from moringa oleifera mo seeds using protease from bacillus licheniformis and evaluated for effectiveness as a bio coagulant to be applied in leachate pretreatment leachate samples were collected from part of a closed municipal landfill with total organic carbon toc of 1465 mg l and ammonium ion nh4 of 1245 mg l a fenton like reaction with a mediated zero valent iron zvi system was applied to the leachate after coagulation a response surface methodology rsm based on a box behnken design bbd was adopted to optimise the fenton like process a quadratic polynomial model was used on the data with r2 of 0 996 and 0 998 for total organic carbon toc and nh4 removal respectively influence of three main factors was investigated namely ph molar ratio of h2o2 zvi and concentration of h2o2 for toc and nh4 removal in optimum conditions of 30 min reaction time ph 3 h2o2 43 82 mm molar ratio h2o2 zvi of 3 89 effectiveness of elimination of toc and nh4 was 59 98 and 98 3 respectively combined technology of bio coagulant and fenton like reaction was confirmed to be a competent process for treating leachate with 72 6 toc and 98 98 nh4 removal supposed operation costs for the coupling of treatments can be estimated at 5 67 m3 thus reductions in nh4 and mineralization were achieved cost effectively by combining bio coagulation with protein extracted from mo seeds and a fenton like process activated by zvi keywords mature landfill leachate bio coagulant moringa oleifera seed fenton like process zero valent iron box behnken design 1 introduction landfill is the most widely used method of municipal solid waste msw disposal in developing countries 1 the primary disadvantage of landfill is the generation of a huge volume of leachate which can contain extremely toxic contaminants the characteristics of leachate are influenced by landfill age weather conditions and the contents of the landfill waste leachate can include organic substances which are highly polluting nitrogen compounds suspended solids and heavy metals 2 the leachate can be divided into three types based on the age of the landfill young intermediate and mature leachate from young landfill 5 years is usually polluted by high concentrations of organic contaminants with a bod5 cod ratio higher than 0 5 and a ph of around 4 3 mature leachate 10 years is characterised by recalcitrant contaminants high concentrations of ammoniacal nitrogen 3000 5000 mg l 1 medium concentrations of toc 4000 mg l 1 and a bod5 cod ratio of less than 0 1 4 it is difficult to treat mature leachate completely using biological methods 5 according to previous studies mature leachate must be treated using physico chemical techniques such as coagulation flocculation cf 6 advanced oxidation processes aops 7 8 or other combination technologies 9 10 cf is a relatively simple technology that can be used to reduce contaminants from young to mature landfill leachates 11 traditional coagulants such as aluminium sulfate alum ferrous sulfate and poly aluminium chloride are used 5 kumar et al applied rsm bbd for optimization coagulation process for treating landfill leachate by fecl3 the results were shown that maximal decreasion of 71 93 86 and 99 6 cod phosphate colour and sulfate at optimal fecl3 dosage 3 g l ph 8 during 95 min 12 yadav et al used fecl3 and pacl as coagulants for pretreatment mature landfill leachate in india the removal efficiency for cod and toc by fecl3 was 53 and 52 respectively and for pacl the highest reduction of cod and toc were 59 and 57 respectively 13 however cf is expensive has inimical effects on human health and produces a large quantity of sludge 14 plant derived coagulants have been used to treat pollutants with methods including removal of cod and colour from landfill leachate by coupling natural coagulants extracted from ocimum basilicum and ozone technology 15 reducing compost leachate using quince seed mucilage 16 and removing organic contaminants via cod from compost leachate using salvia hispanica 17 in this research a bio coagulant was efficiently extracted from moringa oleifera mo seeds for pretreatment of stabilised landfill leachate mo seeds have been shown to remove turbidity and organic pollutants from surface water 18 and adsorb organic contaminant from slaughterhouse wastewater 19 the mechanism is that proteins of mo seeds are obtained as a natural cationic polyelectrolyte and present primary characteristics for coagulation they linked with suspended particles in the water by charge neutralization to produce the floc thus it was removed quickly from water in the sedimentation process 20 drawback of using mo seeds in treatment water is that increasing organic material into water hence ghebremichael et al reported that extracting active coagulate component including lipid carbonhydrate from the mo seed could decrease the total of organic matters added during the treatment process furthermore aops such as a fenton like process with zero valent iron zvi have been found to eliminate organic contaminants completely in this process zvi is dissolved and releases ferrous iron from the surface of zvi powder under acidic conditions as shown in eq 1 then the fe2 ion immediately reacts with h2o2 in the fenton process as described in eq 2 1 fe0 h fe2 h2 2 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh organic matter reacts with oh as shown in eq 3 3 rh oh r oh the reaction between the hydroxyl radical oh and nh4 to remove ammonium ion compounds is presented in eq 4 21 4 nh4 oh nh2oh noh no hno2 hno3 bogacki et al reported that 50 1 toc in landfill leachate were removed by fe h2o2 process with ph 3 and molar ratio of h2o2 fe 3 8 22 similar mahtab et al applied rsm ccd to find the optimal value of fenton process for treatment leachate the highest cod removal of 61 was occured at ph 3 1 fe2 dosage of 40 mm and h2o2 dosage of 75 mm 23 however the fenton like process activated by zvi is quite expensive to boost treatment efficiency and decrease chemical consumption a fenton like process combined with coagulation may be promising in terms of increasing biodegradability and reducing cost in the work of isak et al 2018 90 9 or 91 5 of cod in mature landfill leachate was successfully treated using the chemical coagulant fecl3 combined with persulfate or peroxymonosulfate oxidation under uv light respectively 24 however to date there has been no report on the application of protein from mo seeds as a natural coagulant for treatment of stabilised leachate or as a combination bio coagulation with a fenton like process activated by zvi according to research on the fenton like system optimisation can be achieved by changing ph while other factors remain unchanged this method wastes time and energy and it is usually hard to achieve optimum performance since the method neglects interactions between influences nonetheless the primary benefit of applying response surface methodology rsm as an optimisation tool is to reduce the number of experimental runs and supply adequate information to obtain statistically acceptable results thus less effort is needed than with full factorial experimentation 25 rsm include full factorial design doehlert design dd central composite design ccd and box behnken design 26 bbd was invented by box and behnken in 1960 it is potential response surface design which presents information particularly on effect of experiment factors and total experimental error in a minimum number of required runs the designs show extremely symmetry and rotatability as well as generate minimum experimental reaction as compared to common ccd and distribute maximum information 27 this study aimed to determine the effectiveness of bio coagulation coupled with a fenton like reaction for degradation of mature landfill leachate in this method bio coagulant was extracted from mo seeds and used in the cf pretreatment phase a fenton like process was then used in the post treatment phase and the optimum settings for the process were determined rsm was applied to optimise the fenton like process with a box behnken design bbd to reduce the toc and remove nh4 which two primary properties of mature leachate with three operational conditions initial ph concentration of h2o2 and the ratio of zvi h2o2 dosage the cost of coupled bio coagulation and a fenton like process for treatment of mature leachate was analysed and compared with a conventional fecl3 coagulant zvi h2o2 process 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample of landfill leachate leachate samples were collected during three months in the summer of 2019 from leachate ponds from a closed municipal landfill pit which was part 1 of the nam son municipal landfill located in soc son province hanoi vietnamn the nam son municipal landfill is a giant landfill of over 157 ha in the north of vietnam the complex was built in 1999 and receives approximately 5000 tonnes of municipal solid waste per day 20 l leachate samples were collected each month and stored at 4 c in pharmaceutical refrigerators panasonic japan before being analysed using standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 28 the characteristics of the leachate are presented in table 1 the dark coloured liquid with high cod and ammonium concentrations and low bod5 cod 0 84 and a high toc cod 0 53 ratio is typical of stabilised leachate 2 2 reagents zvi purity 98 200 mesh was purchased from acros belgium hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 was obtained for use in fenton like oxidation from duc giang ltd vietnam n hexane protease enzyme was applied to extract protein from mo seeds and was purchased at analytical grade from sigma uk sodium hydroxide naoh 0 1 m and hydrochloric acid hcl 0 1 m adjusted ph were purchased from xichlong china 2 3 materials the mo seeds were purchased in binh thuan province vietnam the seeds were cleaned dried under sunlight and then store in a desiccator duran germany 2 4 extraction of protein from mo seeds the flour of mo seeds was obtained by grinding the whole seeds in a mill with a 1 mm mesh and screened by 10 xx mesh n hexane was used to de fat the flour ground seeds were blended with n hexane at a 1 3 w v ratio for 15 min at 45 c under ultrasound this procedure was repeated three times the defatted sample was then air dried and stored at 4 c before use extraction of protein using protease from bacillus licheniformis 2 4 u g was the chosen method the extraction process was carried out for 1 h at a temperature of 40 c in a ratio of material to distilled water of 1 3 w v with an enzyme concentration to liquid phase of 1 ml 100 ml after extraction the solution was centrifuged at 4000 g for 20 min at 10 c the supernatant was gathered and freeze dried the protein extract was designated bcmo as in the process shown in fig 1 2 4 1 determination of the chemical composition of mo seed and protein extracts the moisture ash crude protein total lipid and mineral contents of the mo seeds and protein extracts were determined using the association of official analytical chemists method and a conversion factor of 6 25 was applied 29 all experiments were carried out in triplicate and mean values with standard deviations sd were reported using microsoft excel 2016 microsoft usa 2 5 coagulation flocculation experiments a six place jar test apparatus was used for the cf experiments velp jlt6 italia following hoa and hue 2018 18 bcmo and fecl3 were added from 0 mg l to 180 mg l at six different ph values 4 9 to 500 ml of the mature leachate sample the solution was mixed for 5 min at 200 rpm then slowly stirred at 40 rpm for 20 min before the solution was settled for 30 min after settling the supernatant was analysed for toc and nh4 reduction the percentage of removed toc and nh4 were determined by equation eq 5 5 h c 0 c i c o x 100 where co and ci are the initial and post treatment concentrations for toc or nh4 the sludge volume after the cf process was calculated by equation eq 6 30 6 v s l u d g e v s e t t l e d v s a m p l e where vsludge vsettled vsample are the volume of sludge after cf ml sludge after settling ml and mature landfill leachate sample l 2 6 design of experiments statistical analysis and optimisation a three variable bbd was employed in this research to reduce the number of experiments bbd is an useful experimental design for rsm it is a rapid and saving statistical technique that is generally employed to determine experimental data and study the separate and interactive effects of factors and develop an empirical model 31 the variables and levels were determined for 50 ml of pretreated leachate using the cf process with the bio coagulant extracted from mo seeds put into a 250 ml beaker with adjusted ph 3 5 concentration of h2o2 40 80 mm and ratio of h2o2 zvi 2 4 nh4 and toc removal was measured as the response the experimental design is reported in table 2 and used design expert version 11 0 software stat ease usa a partial cubic polynomial model was considered to be appropriate for studying the influence of the variables on responses after testing more complex models from linear to partial cubic an analysis of variance anova was applied to show that the evolved models were statistically meaningful optimisation was implemented with the software using maximum and economic analysis 2 7 analytical method the ph was measured using a ph meter milwaukee mw 101 poland tss method 2540d and bod5 method 5210b determination were made following standard methods while cod was estimated by the closed reflux method 5220 c nh4 no3 po4 3 and so4 2 were measured using a spectrometer dr 3900 hach usa with the hach method toc concentration was determined using a torch analyser jenway spectrophotometer uk a shimadzu aa 670 flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer was used to determine cu zn al and cd levels the ph of the zero point charge phzpc for bcmo was measured following nguyen et al 2020 32 in this experiment 20 ml of 0 01 m nacl solution was put in a 100 ml erlenmeyer flask the ph was then adjusted to values of between 3 and 12 using either naoh or hcl 0 2 g l of bcmo was added after 24 h the final ph was measured and a ph curve plotted the ph where the curve crossed the ph final to ph initial line was used as the phzpc of the bcmo and was determined to be 6 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 bcmo characteristics 3 1 1 composition of mo seeds and protein extracts table 4 shows the approximate composition of mo seeds and protein extract bcmo the raw material had a high protein content 33 4 0 2 with carbohydrate of 18 5 0 3 and low ash and moisture the amount of protein in mo seeds is higher than that in other grains such as amaranth 16 5 17 55 33 bitter melon 34 and rice 35 the high protein content suggests that mo seeds can be used for protein products in the food industry including bio coagulants for water treatment however the seeds contain a variety of fats and it is crucial that the seeds are defatted before protein extraction as shown in table 4 all the bcmo samples contained a large amount of protein 83 78 0 52 extracted using protease enzyme from bacillus licheniformis the ash and moisture contents of the protein extracts were low compared with the carbohydrate in the raw material the amount of carbohydrate in bcmo was significantly lower the low fat content in the two samples indicates that removing lipids using n hexane is effective eliminating the fat from seed flour is a key step in protein extraction since it would increase organic pollutants by adding fatty acids into water industries such as the food and pharmaceutical industries could potentially use the oils from mo seeds 3 1 2 ft ir of bcmo the functional groups in the bcmo were identified by ft ir analysis all the common bonds of protein structures were shown in the ft ir spectrum of bcmo fig 2 such as the amide i at 1639 cm 1 and the amide ii band at 1546 cm 1 the samples also contained water o h at 3435 cm 1 and carbohydrates c h at 2929 cm 1 36 the presence of plentiful functional groups indicates that there are many adsorption points for the coagulant interparticle connecting effect 16 3 2 pretreatment of mature leachate by bio coagulation bcmo cf is a relatively straightforward technology and is widely used in pretreatment of mature landfill leachate chemical coagulation for landfill leachate reduction is based on adding ferric alum salts although it has been shown that iron salts are more efficient than aluminium salts 37 thus fecl3 was chosen to compare with the bcmo bio coagulant in removing tss toc and ammonium ions from mature landfill leachate samples it is important to reduce tss and organic pollutants and change colour to improve the efficiency of subsequent treatment processes the cf process includes an imbalanced colloidal suspension thereby increasing particle collection 38 3 2 1 effect of coagulant concentration the effectiveness of coagulants in removing toc tss and nh4 was determined with a coagulant concentration bcmo or fecl3 from 0 mg l to 180 mg l with an initial ph of the leachate sample of 7 6 as shown in fig 3 cf was effective in removing the tss from the mature landfill leachate while levels of toc and ammonium ion were only slightly reduced when using either fecl3 or bcmo the results were 69 44 for tss 16 24 for toc and 33 11 for ammonium ions at the optimum dosage of coagulant bcmo of 90 mg l when the bcmo concentration was increased from 30 mg l to 90 mg l the efficiency of toc removal rose from 4 5 to 16 24 the organic matter in landfill leachate includes humic acids fulvic acid proteins microbial products and hydrophilic organic matter most of these are aquatic humic substances in the form of colloids 39 the mechanisms for toc treatment with a coagulation process include charge neutralisation entrapment and adsorption based on coagulants forming insoluble particulate aggregates a greater coagulant concentration means that polymeric substances with higher positive charge densities were generated benefiting toc reduction by adsorption and charge neutralisation under these conditions the coagulant bcmo exhibited good charge neutralisation bridging and sweep floc abilities removing toc for adsorption polar functional groups such as o h c o and c n have been found to be involved in the removal processes 40 fecl3 required more mass as a coagulant with 150 mg l to remove 69 7 of the tss 10 43 of the toc and 22 08 of the nh4 tss removal efficiency was shown to decline from 44 3 to 35 01 when the fecl3 concentration was increased from 90 to 180 mg l likewise the percentage of toc and nh4 removed was found to decrease to 6 53 and 26 7 respectively an explanation could be that that colloidal particles restabilise when using coagulant in excess of the optimal concentration 41 3 2 2 effect of ph fig 4 illustrates different parameters tss toc and nh4 for mature landfill leachate treated with bcmo and fecl3 concentrations of 90 mg l and 150 mg l with ph ranging from 4 to 9 for cf with the bio coagulant bcmo the highest rates of tss toc and nh4 removal of 78 77 40 17 and 21 56 respectively were achieved at ph 7 the primary mechanisms for pollutant treatment using bcmo are destabilised colloids particles charge neutralisation and adsorption 42 for tss removal the mechanisms of bio coagulation by bcmo are a cross linked form combined with network structures in addition increasing alkaline values enhances the cf process when the ph of the solution increases because of the generation of hydroxyl groups 20 sivakumar 2013 also found that the optimum ph for removing 84 5 cod and 82 6 tds in leachate landfill by mo seeds is 7 43 in the case of removing nh4 when ph below 7 the efficiency of removal decreased rapidly to 28 96 nonetheless the highest nh4 reduction with bcmo was achieved at ph 7 this result can be explained by the distinction between chemical properties and functional groups on the surface of bcmo at ph phpzc 6 9 the surface may become positively charged therefore making h ions fully effective in reacting with ammonium cations causing a decrease in the reduction of nh4 at ph 7 colloidal particles are negatively charged enhancing ammonium treatment through electrostatic attraction forces when ph rises from ph 9 ammonium reduction declines due to the reaction of nh4 ions with oh according to the ammonia stripping equation eq 7 8 extreme basic ph promotes the production of ammonia gas however this incurs additional cost as more lime is needed to adjust the ph 7 nh4 oh nh3 h2o 8 nh3 h3o nh4 oh with fecl3 as the coagulant the maximum tss removal of 76 82 was achieved at ph 9 on the other hand the optimum ph for toc and nh4 reduction was 5 with 19 08 and 31 56 removal respectively according to previous studies lower ph values are most suitable for treating mature landfill leachate with high levels of removal of cod at ph 5 and 6 in ph 7 ferric iron fe3 can react with hydroxyl and produce fe oh 3 promoting flocculation it should also be noted that both reagents can act concurrently as a coagulant enabling the best destabilisation and aggregation of flocs 10 the percent of sludge volume ml of sludge per 100 ml of leachate produced in the optimum conditions of bcmo and fecl3 was 38 7 and 46 8 respectively with their physical properties and bridging power natural coagulants can create less quantity of sludge 44 on the other hand iron produces a bulky coagulated precipitate with an absorption effect generating a greater volume of sludge based on economic and environmental effect the bcmo option is preferable it has a lower chemical cost for adjusting ph and the operational cost of treating the sludge produced is also lower the characteristics of mature leachate after the cf process using bcmo bio coagulants are shown in table 1 although bio coagulants have advantages for water and wastewater treatment they have some drawbacks including substantial cod and organic load after treatment 45 however in this study a significant decrease in the cod of the treated leachate at 89 1 was obtained using protein extracted from mo seeds it should be noted that the protein extracted from mo seeds was also evaluated for the treatment of leachate 3 3 post treatment of mature leachate by a fenton like process activated by zvi 3 3 1 model fitting and anova 3 3 1 1 toc reduction the design matrix of the variables shown in table 3 was applied to obtain the level of toc reduction fitting the figures to different linear two factorial quadratic and cubic models was considered with a subsequent anova table 5 the results indicate that a quadratic polynomial model fits toc removal the equation eq 9 for the model in respect of coded factors is illustrated below 9 toc 20 23 17 18a 1 48b 4 63c 4 63ab 4 22ac 1 3bc 7 9a2 6 18b2 0 091c2 where a is the ph value of mature landfill leachate b is the concentration of h2o2 mm and c is molar ratio h2o2 zvi anova examination of the toc removal model is shown in table 5 the f value was 494 24 with a p value less than 0 05 0 0001 which shows that model fit is significant at a 95 confidence level moreover the study achieves a high coefficient of analysis r2 0 9984 when testing the null hypothesis to determine the consequence of each term in the model the concentration of h2o2 was the only parameter in the developed model found not to be crucial on the other hand the effect of the interaction between three factors ph h2o2 and h2o2 zvi was of high significance in this model a c ab ac a2 and b2 are significant model terms table 5 a bbd was used to consider the effect of different factors on the removal of nh4 the percentages of ammonium ion removal employing design matrix of different factors are shown in table 3 a quadratic polynomial model is the best fit for nh4 removal with p value 0 0001 f value 98 43 and a high coefficient of analysis r2 0 9922 adequate precision was shown by a signal to noise ratio of the developed model 29 7469 4 which indicates that the model for nh4 removal is correct likewise the model shows no lack of fit at the 95 significance level anova analysis for this model is illustrated in table 5 the equation for the nh4 reduction model depends on coded parameters and is shown by equation eq 10 10 nh4 36 23 24 12a 7 61b 8 69c 3 86ab 12 93 ac 7 35 bc 14 64 a2 14 76 b2 13 45 c2 in this model in this case a b c ac bc a² b² c² are significant model terms 3 3 2 effect of parameters since ph directly influences zvi corrosion and the quantity of dissolved o2 in solution it is evident that ph is one of the most critical factors moreover the production of free radicals in the fenton like process is also controlled by ph 46 ertugay et al were able to remove leachate efficiently at ph 2 4 using a fenton like process activated by zvi production of hydroxyl radicals increased in acidic conditions strengthening degradation of fulvic acid humic acids and aromatic structures in stabilised leachate therefore both zvi corrosion and ho production rise with a decline of ph 47 fig 5 presents contours and response surface plots for a function of ph versus the zvi h2o2 ratio when the dosage of h2o2 is stable at 60 mm the maximum removal of toc and nh4 was achieved at a ph of 3 the results show that increasing h2o2 concentration affects toc and nh4 reduction with an h2o2 dose of 43 82 mm the maximum removal of toc and nh4 was 62 84 and 93 69 respectively the optimum zvi h2o2 ratio is favourable to preventing a possible reaction between zvi and h2o2 and decreases the generation of iron complexes fig 6 shows the interaction between ph and h2o2 concentration on the fenton like oxidation of mature landfill leachate through toc and nh4 at the optimal ph toc and nh4 reduction is strengthened at a ratio of zvi h2o2 of 3 8 due to the reinforced formation of hydroxyl radicals the initial ph value significantly influences the removal of nh4 the removal rate of ammonium ions decreases with the increase in the initial ph value the degradation of nh4 by oh under acidic conditions through a fenton like system is described by eq 3 acidic conditions contribute to the oxidation of ammoniacal nitrogen by reactive hydroxyl radicals in addition iron complexes could not form reducing the production of oh in the fenton like process 3 3 3 optimisation of the fenton like process by using the optimisation function bbd can predict the optimal combination of parameters to obtain the highest percentage toc and nh4 treatment at ph 3 an h2o2 concentration of 43 82 mm and zvi h2o2 ratio of 3 89 the toc and nh4 the maximum reduction in the fenton like process was achieved the overall toc and nh4 removal in the optimum conditions for the fenton like process was 62 84 and 93 69 respectively the actual experimental values measured were 65 0 for toc treatment and 98 2 for ammonium ion removal table 1 summarises the characteristics of the treated mature landfill leachate before and after treatment by cf by bcmo and zvi h2o2 processes the results were illustrated degradation of cod bod5 tss no3 po4 3 so4 2 e coli and total coliform at 98 37 86 21 89 46 93 74 61 85 67 5 99 83 and 99 97 respectively after combination cf by bcmo and zvi h2o2 system the efficiency of cod reduction by integration cf and fenton like process was higher than previously investigated for leachate treatment with a coupling of cf and fenton oxidation kanaani et al 2021 investigated the coupling of bio coagulation from quince seed mucilage and a fenton process removing 84 of cod 48 amor et al 2015 treated leachate using chemical coagulant at 2 g l fecl3 at ph 5 with a fenton system with a reduction of 63 in cod 80 in turbidity and 74 in total polyphenols 10 also metals such as zn cu al and cd were completely removed by cf by bcmo coupled with zvi h2o2 3 4 cost estimation in the main economic analysis operating cost of treated leachate oc m3 can be measured by estimating two main cost items the quantity of chemicals consumed and the landfill cost of sludge from the cf and fenton like processes in the vietnamese market in september 2020 the prices of chemicals usage in fenton like process were 1 43 kg for h2o2 and 1 40 kg for h2so4 the prices of coagulants were 6 45 kg for fecl3 and bcmo the landfill cost of produced sludge was 0 10 kg in this case the operating costs for cf and fenton like processes were calculated using the following equations eq 11 49 11 o c m 3 c c h e m i c a l c s l u d g e cost analysis is a crucial factor in applying of bio coagulants in mature landfill leachate treatment the cost of the cf process is primarily influence in price of the coagulant therefore it is essential to ensure that the coagulant is cost effective a detailed cost breakdown in laboratory production of 1 kg of bcmo is given in table 6 it is true that the preparation of bcmo costs 3 06 usd per kg while cost of fecl3 in vietnam is approximately 6 45 usd kg this result shows that bcmo hydrogel could be considered a cost efficient coagulant the likely costs for treatment using bcmo bio coagulation and a fenton like process appear to be competitive and are better than the results previous report for the removal of mature leachate by advanced oxidation process aops for instance anfruns et al 2013 used a coupling of a biological method anammox with two aops ferric chloride ozonisation and homogenous photo fenton and estimated the cost of treating leachate with bod5 cod 0 13 were 7 18 m3 compared to 5 67 m3 in our study 50 4 conclusion cf and a zvi mediated fenton like system were used successfully to treat landfill leachate the first time protein extracted from mo seeds based on enzyme technique was found to be an extremely useful bio coagulant that can be used for the pretreatment of leachate the combination of coagulation with a fenton like reaction reduced the quantity of bcmo required to remove toc and ammonium ion 72 6 toc removal and 98 98 nh4 reduction was obtained at ph 3 an h2o2 concentration of 43 82 mm and a zvi h2o2 ratio of 3 89 the results show that the coupled technology of bio coagulation by protein from mo seeds and the fenton like process activated by zvi can save money and be an efficient option for mature leachate treatment funding the author s received no specific funding for this work declaration of competing interest the authors

13418,photocatalytic technology offers powerful virus disinfection in wastewater via oxidative capability with minimum harmful by products generation this review paper aims to provide state of the art photocatalytic technology in battling transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 in wastewater prior to that the advantages and limitations of the existing conventional and advanced oxidation processes for virus disinfection in water systems were thoroughly examined a wide spectrum of virus degradation by various photocatalysts was then considered to understand the potential mechanism for deactivating this deadly virus the challenges and future perspectives were comprehensively discussed at the end of this review describing the limitations of current photocatalytic technology and suggesting a realistic outlook on advanced photocatalytic technology as a potential solution in dealing with similar upcoming pandemics the major finding of this review including discovery of a vision on the possible photocatalytic approaches that have been proven to be outstanding against other viruses and subsequently combatting sars cov 2 in wastewater this review intends to deliver insightful information and discussion on the potential of photocatalysis in battling covid 19 transmission through wastewater keywords photocatalysis wastewater virus sars cov 2 covid 19 1 introduction novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 has been declared a pandemic in most countries since the end of march 2020 and has affected 216 countries causing over 2 billion deaths as of 24 january 2021 this covid 19 is an illness caused by the new coronavirus emerging in wuhan hubei province china in early december 2019 on 11 march 2020 the world health organization declared covid 19 a pandemic 1 since the effects of this novel coronavirus are close to those of extreme acute respiratory syndrome sars it has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 2 it is believed that this virus was developed from bats and then moved into other mammalian hosts before jumping to humans covid 19 is the third zoonotic epidemic of the twenty first century after sars 2002 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers 2012 3 covid 19 virus is a positive stranded ribonucleic acid rna virus with a crown like appearance under an electron microscope due to the presence of spike glycoproteins on the envelope fig 1 4 in addition the covid 19 virus is similar to the sars virus in 2003 but spread faster illness caused by covid 19 is mostly respiratory disease while symptoms can be cough fever nausea and diarrhoea 5 the main route of transmission of the covid 19 virus is inhalation by person to person transmission based on its symptoms the transmission can also occur through respiratory droplets and aerosol transmission for this reason researchers have focused on various types of transmission including wastewater due to the probability that the virus may affect the wastewater from the hospital waste such as human faecal from infected persons 6 many contaminants can be found in wastewater especially those discharged from the hospital such as pharmaceutical residues chemical substances radioisotopes and microbial pathogens 7 notably various viruses have been found in the hospital wastewater such as adenoviruses hepatitis a hav and polioviruses this is according to the media that can be the reason for the viruses to be transmitted which is water media since 2003 drainage plumbing systems have been deemed a possible mechanism for spreading the sars cov 1 coronavirus into the sewage system for coronavirus infected populations living in apartment buildings 8 9 the sars cov 2 virus like sars cov 1 can be transmitted by aerosols or microscopic water droplets 10 in fact according to van rowan et al 2020 11 the sars cov 2 and sars cov 1 viruses have comparable stability in aerosols on the surface viruses may remain viable and contagious on surfaces for a few days and in aerosols depending on the inoculum shed for hours 11 to curb and alleviate infectious drinking water water purification technologies have advanced significantly in the last century 12 16 the number of waterborne diseases outbreaks including cholera and typhoid has declined because of drinking water disinfection water disinfection is the elimination deactivation or destruction of pathogenic microorganisms from water microorganisms are killed or made inactive putting an end to their development and reproduction sterilisation is a disinfection related process during the sterilisation process all present microorganisms both dangerous and harmless are destroyed 17 researchers in the netherlands were the first to detect covid 19 viruses in the hospital wastewater 18 later wu et al 19 also found covid 19 viruses in the hospital wastewater that is believed transmitted from the human faecal matter of infected person as in many countries in this world several studies detected the existence of the covid 19 virus in the human faecal of covid 19 patients with or without gastrointestinal symptoms 20 it should be noted that in some countries they are not discharged properly these hazardous contaminants especially viruses can represent chemical biological and physical risks for public and environmental health conventionally virus disinfection in water and wastewater divided into two main categories which are physical and chemical methods physical disinfection including through heating adsorption and filtration virus will be physically removed from water based on size exclusion however due to their small sizes and unique properties of the viruses they are difficult to remove and deactivate while chemical disinfection involved the usage of chemicals to disinfect the virus chlorination technique is one the most common technique for virus disinfection that using chlorine gas chloramines or hypochlorite solution 21 24 previous study reported chlorination could remove sars cov 1 efficiently 25 unfortunately chlorination was opposed due to generation of mutagenic and carcinogenic disinfection by products likewise chlorination also imparts unpleasant tastes and odours to the water in battling the pandemic the performance and environmental safety should be taken into serious consideration as the current published research of pandemic covid 19 is focusing on the occurrence detection and transmission of viruses in the environment 26 29 this paper aims to provide state of the art technology in battling transmission of sars cov 2 in wastewater via photocatalytic degradation the concept and limitation of the existing conventional and current advanced oxidation processes for virus disinfection in water systems were reviewed extensively a broad range of virus degradation by various photocatalysts was also deliberated to understand the possible mechanism to deactivate this deadly virus at the end of this review the challenge and future perspectives are included to provide the limitation of current photocatalytic and suggest a reasonable outlook on developing advanced photocatalytic technology as a promising alternative in handling similar forthcoming pandemics to the best of our knowledge this is the first systematic review that delivers insightful information and discussion on the potential of photocatalysis in battling covid 19 transmission through wastewater 2 virus disinfection via conventional methods physical or chemical disinfectants may be used for disinfection chemical pollutants of water which act as carbohydrates or habitat for microorganisms are often extracted by the disinfectant disinfectants should do more than just destroy bacteria disinfectants must also have a residual effect which ensures that they must stay present in the water after disinfection after disinfection a disinfectant can deter pathogenic microorganisms from emerging in the pipes and recontaminating the water fig 2 shows the classification of water disinfection methods 17 many wastewater treatment methods aim to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms that are toxic to marine organisms recent tests however have shown that even after water treatment a measurable number of pathogens existed in effluents in hospitals and treatment centres chlorine is one of the most used disinfectants 30 in addition to destroying most microbial communities this detergent has a detrimental influence on the ecosystem and may be hazardous to marine organisms if it reaches waterways 31 chlorination can also result in nitrosodimethylamine ndma development which has been linked to human cancer the chlorination process will react with organic matter producing trihalometanes thms a carcinogenic compound 30 conventional filtration methods for wastewater treatment are unsuccessful at eliminating micropollutants like viruses furthermore certain bacteria have been discovered to be immune to such chemical materials 32 these results are in line with the findings of al gheethi et al who discovered the existence of viable microbial cells even after the treatment phase 33 the use of solar based disinfection sodis technology especially in water and wastewater disinfection is a promising approach this system is ideal because of the abundance of high solar radiation low capital expense and long term feasibility meanwhile nanotechnology s use in wastewater treatment has also been recorded in the literature noman et al for example looked at how bimetallic bionanoparticles inactivated antibiotic resistant e coli gram negative and staphylococcus aureus gram positive bacteria seeded in greywater 34 according to the inactivation mechanism the bacterial cells were inactivated due to disruption to the bacterial cell wall s carbohydrates and protein structures 35 the cc bonds of the functional groups found in the bacterial cell wall were broken the combination of sodis and nanotechnology could result in a novel disinfection method for inactivating human viruses the most popular nanoparticles used for wastewater disinfection are zno which are more efficient when exposed to sunlight theoretically increasing antiviral activity 36 as specified by iso 13408 1 sterility assurance level sal is used to characterise the killing efficiency of a treatment process with the treatment process being very efficient if the sal is very poor log reduction accepted by the united states environmental protection agency usepa is a term widely used to measure the efficiency of disinfection processes 37 sal is generally written as 10n based on the pathogen s initial concentration a 103 or 106 value is most often used for sterilisation the log reduction is 101 which represents a 90 reduction in the microbial community the microbial population falls from one million 106 to almost zero or a reduction of 99 9999 when disinfection with a 6 log reduction 106 is used 38 a kill rate of 99 99 is measured by a four log reduction the growth of inactive bacteria should be calculated as an indication for inactive viruses to ensure that the removal of treated effluent is healthy if no growth can be seen in the culture medium after incubation these cells are designated as destroyed 39 however the capacity of microbial cells to resuscitate can be affected by the storage conditions of disinfected samples salmonella s aureus and enterococcus faecalis were resuscitated in sewage samples treated with solar disinfection sodis for 6 h and deposited at 37 c for 4 days the capacity of the disinfection process to damage the bacteria s cell walls can enable cells to survive in this situation a pathogen growth potential pgp bioassay must be performed 40 table 1 summarises the water disinfection process with reviews of the advantages and disadvantages 3 virus disinfection via an advanced oxidation process advanced oxidation processes are a recently discovered technology for the disinfection of viruses in polluted wastewater by generating reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals as an oxidising agent to treat harmful pathogens the generation of radicals may be initiated by primary oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide ozone sources of energy uv light ultrasonic and heat or catalysts such as titania iron oxide or other semiconductors hydroxyl radicals are known to rapidly and unselectively bombard organic molecules the generated radicals degrade the organic molecules found on the virus cell wall and directly deteriorate the virus pathogens the advanced oxidation processes include ozonation ultrasound fenton process and photocatalysis have been effectively and efficiently utilised in treating virus contaminated water the methods offer other diverse approaches to the production of hydroxyl radicals that make it more flexible and therefore provide a better approach to complying with strict guidelines during wastewater treatment ozonation is a common technique in virus disinfection from wastewater that utilises three oxygen atoms o3 called ozone into the water ozone presents in the form of gas which is one of the most potent oxidising agents when ozone is dissolved in water it produces a broad spectrum of reactive oxygen radicals ros that could oxidise organic materials in virus membranes which destroys the cell wall and leads to cell bursting causing immediate degradation of the viruses 44 previous studies reported that the virus could be removed from wastewater by ozonation 45 46 furthermore ozone is highly reactive and must be directly used after onsite generation and difficult to store 47 ozonation in wastewater could also result in the formation of harmful by products such as aldehydes carboxylic acids and bromate when reacting with dissolved organic matter and bromide 45 ultrasound is a longitudinal wave with frequencies in the range of 20 106 khz 48 this frequency is above the human hearing range 20 hz to 20 khz but below the mega sonic range 600 khz 49 this technique has attracted wide attention in water and sewage system due to simplicity high decomposition speed and zero secondary pollution ultrasound is evaluated as one of the aop for the degradation of pollutants in the water system due to the formation of free hydroxyl radicals with oxidising capabilities 50 51 ultrasound technique was reported to disinfect microorganisms and viruses by several mechanisms based on acoustic cavitation 49 52 53 cavitation is the phenomenon of microbubbles or cavities forming growing and collapsing in a liquid in extremely short time intervals milliseconds 49 the mechanism involved are 1 the viruses could be chemically disinfected by bombarded with hydroxyl radicals generated via ultrasound 2 the virus could be physically attacked by the high temperature and pressure that results from the momentum of bubble collapse that can kill the viruses and 3 shear forces that persuaded by microstreaming that could damage the virus ultrasound technique can be applied as a stand alone process or integrated with other disinfection techniques such as chlorination heating ozonation and uv irradiation 53 54 however the utilisation of ultrasound technique in water treatment requires high operating and maintaining costs due to the high energy consumption and replacement of instruments like the ultrasound probe which continue to be managed by the ultrasonic activity itself 55 the fenton process is the reaction between aqueous ferrous ions and hydrogen peroxide to generate hydroxyl radicals in acidic conditions fenton s reagent was first discovered in 1894 by henry john horstman fenton through the oxidation of tartaric acid by activating hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radicals and hydroxide ions by fe2 56 later only in the late 1960s the fenton process successfully destroyed hazardous organic pollutants in wastewater by radical oxidation and flocculation 56 this process is considered one of the most effective aop in removing organic pollutants and microbial disinfection in wastewater application the main benefits of this process in disinfection treatment are 1 both reagents iron and hydrogen peroxide are non toxic and cheap 2 harmless by products generation as in chlorination and ozonation and 3 no mass transfer limitation however there are several limitations suffered by the fenton process such as 1 high consumption of hydrogen peroxide 2 strict ph range 3 sludge generation and 4 the accumulation of ferric sludge that could affect the oxidation performance therefore several modifications to fenton reagent were made to overcome the limitation of the traditional fenton reagent such as integration with external energy and development of heterogeneous fenton process to ensure efficient and sustainable water purification 57 nieto juarez et al investigated the inactivation of ms2 virus by iron hydroxide mediated fenton like process under the sunlight and in the dark 58 they found viruses can be physically removed from water as well as inactivated by adsorption and a particle mediated photo fenton like process using heterogeneous fenton like processes according to the above description photocatalytic disinfection is the most effective procedure for water treatment mass transfer limitations must be minimised for efficient tio2 water treatment because photocatalytic degradation occurs primarily on the surface of tio2 organic pollutants adsorb poorly on tio2 surface due to their low affinity for organic pollutants particularly hydrophobic organic pollutants resulting in slow photocatalytic degradation rates as a result pollutant targeting around tio2 nanoparticles to improve photocatalytic performance must be considered 59 furthermore due to the instability of the nanosized particle tio2 nanoparticles can aggregate obstructing light incidence on the active centres and reducing catalytic activity however it should be noted that those small particles can experience greater scattering which may reduce their photocatalytic activity compared to larger particles furthermore one major practical obstacle for the slurry method is to extract the nanosized tio2 particles from the treated water which is both an economic and a safety issue 60 previous studies have used the following countermeasures to resolve the weaknesses of tio2 dependent photocatalysis 1 changes to the tio2 catalyst to allow visible light to be used 61 2 catalyst synthesis should be designed to produce catalysts with well defined crystal structures high affinity for different organic pollutants and smaller particle sizes 62 3 design and develop a second generation tio2 catalyst with high separation efficiency and the ability to be recovered and regenerated 63 these modifications and advancements aim to improve photocatalytic performance complete organic pollutant degradation visible light absorption stability reproducibility and tio2 recycle and reuse capabilities the following section will focus on photocatalytic action as a disinfection process for water treatment 4 virus disinfection via photocatalysis photocatalysts are semiconductor oxides that serve as heterogeneous catalysts in the presence of electromagnetic radiation they act as a medium to decompose living or non living microstructures accumulated on any surface or suspended in liquid or gases and come into contact with a solid surface photocatalysts may also use photocatalytic reactions to break the water and create hydrogen the phenomenon mentioned above occurs due to a process known as photocatalytic oxidation and reduction 60 the photocatalytic process involves three main stages 1 formation of photoinduced charge carrier 2 separation of charge carrier and distribution to the surface of the photocatalyst and 3 oxidation and reduction reaction on the surface of the photocatalyst 13 as illustrated in fig 3 zhang et al 64 suggested the progress on photocatalysis in battling virus from the water system virus disinfection in water by photocatalysis was pioneered by sierka and sjogren in 1994 44 they found ms2 viruses successfully disinfected by tio2 photocatalyst under uv irradiation in 2008 most research works focused on developing tio2 based photocatalyst that can deactivate viruses under visible light irradiation later the potential of various metals other than tio2 such as iron oxide 65 silver 66 alumina 66 and copper oxide 67 was investigated for virus disinfection under visible light since then metal free photocatalyst like carbon based photocatalyst with antiviral properties was further explored to obtain cheap safe and sustainable materials for viruses disinfection in the water 4 1 performance evaluation on virus disinfection via photocatalysis earlier tio2 photocatalyst has shown great potential as a solution for sewage and wastewater treatment because it is non toxic cheap and abundantly available tio2 photocatalysts successfully deactivated viruses like phage ms2 bacteriophage qβ phage f2 murine norovirus and human adenovirus 68 72 viruses disinfection by photocatalyst could overcome the drawbacks of the conventional disinfection methods such as the generation of harmful by products and utilisation of large volumes of chemicals however there are main limitations suffered by tio2 photocatalyst which are lower bandgap poor capability for carrier charge separation that results in incompetent exploitation of visible light and low photodegradation performances later coupling tio2 photocatalyst with other metals such as manganese mn 73 palladium 74 silver oxide ago copper 75 76 and copper oxide 67 to form heterojunction photocatalyst could further enhance the photocatalytic activities on virus degradation through visible light irradiation the technology of photocatalysis that employs carbon based photocatalyst has attracted much attention due to the zero risk of metal leaching into the water system and optimum natural light harvesting capability 77 79 the non metal photocatalysts that have been developed for virus disinfection include carbon based materials such fullerene 80 81 carbon nanotube 82 carbon dot 83 84 and graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 78 85 86 fullerene c60 is a spherical carbon based molecule made up of carbon atoms kept together by sp2 hybridisation fullerenes have a peculiar three dimensional structure and have high chemical stability they also have a large specific surface area and strong electrical conductivity fullerene offers the generation of ros under visible light due to its small gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest occupied molecular orbital which is approximately 1 6 1 9 ev 87 a previous study reported that the suspensions of polyhydroxylated fullerene successfully inactivated the non enveloped viruses like ms2 bacteriophage enterobacteria phage prd1 and bacteriophage t7 under uva irradiation 88 hotze et al determined that the virus inactivation by fullerene material is mainly based on the production of singlet oxygen 1o2 one of the ros by fullerene aggregates and resistance of the viruses determined by the structural and composition of non enveloped virus capsids however the potential of fullerene as a photocatalyst in wastewater treatment was limited to the aggregation of the nanoscale particles that reduces the photochemical properties therefore immobilisation of fullerene appeared as the most practical approach to retain the photoactivity in the aqueous system moor et al managed to immobilise fullerene on silica gel and polystyrene resin by the simple nucleophilic addition of a primary amine across a 6 6 fullerene double bond and followed by proton transfer under mild condition as shown in fig 4 a 80 based on the sem images in fig 4 b e moor et al suggested the surface of ps resin and silica gel were covered by monolayer coverage of fullerene and did not exhibit significant aggregation the immobilisation of fullerene on solid materials also promoted the production of 1o2 in the water under visible light irradiation and deactivated ms2 bacteriophages without exhibiting significant loss of photocatalytic activity after repeated cycles besides that c60 fullerene the immobilised c70 fullerene on mcm 41 also displays antiviral properties towards ms2 in the water system under visible light irradiation 81 in contrast g c3n4 can be synthesised directly from earth rich low cost precursors rich in nitrogen e g heating the melamine 79 the g c3n4 consists of organic elements such as carbon nitrogen and hydrogen and has the ability to break water and produce hydrogen under visible light irradiation making it a non metal catalyst and widely utilised for water treatment 89 91 to date g c3n4 was documented for having antimicrobial and antivirus properties through photocatalytic degradation 92 the bandgap of g c3n4 is 2 7 ev that is appropriate for visible light driven photocatalyst with a conductive band of 1 1 ev and valence band of 1 6 ev and normal hydrogen electrode as reference 93 to evaluate the photocatalytic inefficient of g c3n4 for virus disinfection under visible light irradiation li et al used bacteriophage ms2 as a model virus 78 as depicted in fig 5 a bacteriophage ms2 was completely inactivated within 360 min under visible light irradiation the regrowth test was also conducted in the dark for 72 h no visible plaques formed indicating that g c3n4 had inactivated the virus through the photocatalysis process as shown in fig 5 b li et al also compared the performance of g c3n4 with other metal based visible driven photocatalysts such as nitrogen doped tio2 n tio2 bi2wo6 and ag agcl for viral deactivation they revealed that more than 7 log of ms2 were deactivated by g c3n4 whereas about 1 log and 4 log of ms2 were deactivated by n tio2 and bi2wo6 photocatalyst respectively the ag agcl recorded the highest inactivation of ms2 which resulted from the presence of biocidal silver ions and silver nanoparticles that performed as an electron sink to expedite charge separation and enhance the photon harvesting 94 however the application of silver based photocatalyst is costly and may pose health risks in the treated water due to the dissolution of ag and ag nanoparticles as depicted in fig 5 c the degradation mechanism of ms2 by g c3n4 under visible light irradiation mainly involved the oxidation damage on the surface protein of the virus by ros that resulted in the leakage and shape distortion which finally led to the rapid destruction of genetic materials namely rna and caused the viral death with no regrowth 4 2 mechanism of photocatalysis on virus disinfection it was first to observe the photocatalysis mechanism by tio2 to inactivate the virus by destroying the shell and or capsid of viruses as a result genetic materials minerals and proteins were released inside the viruses and caused the virus to inactivate herein it should be noted that the photocatalysis mechanism of the virus occurred on the surface of the film and can be explained by photodegradation of the protein capsid of the virus and subsequently efflux of the viral rna enveloped by the protein layer when virus reacts with the surface of the catalyst active radicals such as o2 hoo and ho formed and oxidised the ch bonds and degraded viruses 95 it is well known that most photocatalysts are semiconductor materials the photocatalytic process based on semiconductor materials can be briefly described as shown in fig 6 when the semiconductor is irradiated by light photogenerated electron e and hole h are generated and react with other substances to form ros including oh h2o2 h and o2 and these ros participate in the photocatalytic degradation bacteria process afterwards reactive oxygen species attack the cell membrane the coenzyme a on the cell membrane is damaged resulting in inhibition of respiration dependent on the intact cell membrane reduction or loss of cellular respiration activity and eventually cause cell death to view the potential of photocatalysis as an alternative solution for battling covid 19 understanding the real mechanism of deactivation and destroying the microorganisms especially coronaviruses during photocatalytic disinfection is vitally important it might be helpful to develop a more efficient and powerful photocatalyst by 1 designing the morphology according to virology 2 hybridising or functionalising with transition metals ions and 3 fabricating composites or heterogeneous photocatalyst for efficient energy utilisation and recovery typically microorganisms contain outer membrane peptidoglycan and cytoplasmic membranes responsible for structural integrity and retention the membranes surround an internal liquid based cytoplasmic matrix that is comprised of genetic material and biochemical systems based on the complexity of the microorganisms the complete mechanism of their degradation by photocatalytic remains partially known as illustrated in fig 7 regmi et al reviewed the possible mechanism of photocatalytic degradation by semiconductor and nanoparticles photocatalyst on microbial cells in wastewater environment involving 1 oxidative stress induction where the excess generation of ros leads to peroxidation of the lipid membrane and protein attack that depresses the activity of some periplasmic enzyme and directly interact and damage the genetic materials 2 metal ion release the metal ions could exempt from semiconductor photocatalyst then passed through the cell membrane and directly reacted with the functional groups of nucleic acid and protein such as cooh nh and sh before finally destroying them 3 non oxidative mechanism reducing the critical cellular metabolism such as amino acid protein nucleotide and carbohydrate metabolism without oxidative stress induction 96 nevertheless only the first mechanism has gained the interest of the researchers which involved the generation of ros that plays a major role in virus disinfection researchers strongly agreed that the main degradation of microorganism is initiated by the prolonged ros attack results on the damage of the cell wall followed by the cytoplasmic membrane and direct attack of intracellular components comprising genetic materials within the microorganism as depicted in fig 8 97 viruses and their host bacteria typically co exist in actual water conditions therefore the efficiency of photocatalytic inactivation in the mixed system of virus bacteria is of practical importance for instance zheng et al fabricated cu tio2 nanofibres for the removal of virus bacteriophage f2 and bacteria e coli 285 75 fig 9 a they compared the inactivation of both virus and bacteria in a single and mixed systems with the presence and absence of source light under visible light both e coli and bacteriophage f2 were inactivated completely within 240 min as shown in fig 9 b this indicates bacteriophage f2 is more resistant to photocatalytic oxidation in the virus bacteria mixed system than e coli 286 however in the virus bacteria mixed system with the absence of source light the removal efficiency of bacteriophage f2 decreased significantly compared to that in the single virus system as depicted in fig 9 c it can be assumed that free ross play an important role in phage f2 inactivation and in the bulk phase virus disinfection in the water system by photocatalysis is also affected by the presence of natural organic molecules besides bacteria the actual water system also contains natural organic matters noms such as nucleic acids carbohydrates and proteins their presence could quench the generated ros and serve as disinfectants 98 therefore the disinfection of viruses must also consider the presence of noms to further explore this situation cheng et al utilised humic acid as nom representative and cu tio2 nanofibers as a photocatalyst 76 they found that when the concentration of humic acid was increased from 0 to 15 mg l the removal efficiency of bacteriophage f2 declined from 5 00 to 1 89 log this is due to the presence of humic acid that prevented the viral photocatalytic efficiency of the photocatalyst it could be inferred that the presence of humic acid also dramatically reduces its stability particularly for the practical application of virus photocatalytic disinfection technology the existence of noms is a non negligible problem and more relevant research should be conducted to gain a better understanding of this subject 5 challenges and future perspectives the impressive performance of the virus inactivation through the photocatalysis process in water as summarised in table 2 has proven the capability of photocatalysis to disinfect various harmful viruses however there are several challenges and barriers in the disinfection of viruses by photocatalysis especially in battling them in wastewater first the difficulty in recovery of the suspended photocatalyst from the solution because of the possible toxicity of nanosized photocatalysts and the photocatalysts functionalised with other carcinogen substances the powdery shaped and suspended nanosized photocatalysts must be removed before the treated water is reused or released into the environment the photocatalytic disinfection of the virus could also be more harmful if the released photocatalyst has not gone through a complete reaction where disinfection has still not occurred and the photocatalyst is still holding the adsorbed harmful viruses second in real water applications the nanosized photocatalysts are brittle and prone to aggregation aggregation of photocatalyst could hinder the active surface area and reduce the photocatalytic performance therefore those barriers must be overcome if photocatalytic degradation is to be used independently in wastewater treatment to address the above challenges immobilising the photocatalyst into porous or floating substrate could solve the recovery and agglomeration issues of the suspended photocatalysts in the aqueous system 13 67 92 the porous substrate could be an organic or inorganic membrane leading to the development of a bifunctional photocatalytic membrane that acts as a filter and photocatalyst in the same chamber however incorporating the photocatalyst in the substrate might result in the sedimentation of the photocatalyst at the bottom of the substrate this condition could hinder the maximum light utilisation from activating the photocatalyst hence modification or functionalisation of the photocatalyst and the substrate can be adapted to guarantee the photocatalyst remains at the top surface of the substrate other than that utilisation of translucent or transparent substrate might solve the source light utilisation besides that the application of electrospun nanofibrous photocatalyst also attracted much attention in virus disinfection in water systems due to their super porosity and high surface area to volume ratio 74 76 99 nevertheless electrospun nanofibrous photocatalysts are broadly acknowledged as brittle and fragile and they can collapse easily due to their large pore size this condition makes them not suitable to be used in water treatment for long term application post treatment after fabrication of nanofibrous photocatalytic could enhance the flexibility and mechanical strength of the nanofibrous photocatalyst apart from that viruses were reported to have stronger resistance towards photocatalytic disinfection than other microbes such as bacteria due to their differences in structural and geometric properties 75 unlike bacteria viruses are the smallest and tiniest germ that can spread easily through the air that can cause various diseases with specifically targeted cells for example when a certain virus gets inside a host it can hijack the specific cellular machinery like blood respiratory system liver or other organs to generate clones of itself overtaking more cells continuing to reproduce and finally destroying the targeted cells and harming the body in the case of covid 19 when sars cov 2 gets inside the human body it specifically attacks the upper and the lower respiratory system like sinuses nose throat windpipe and lungs before damaging the organs and terminating the whole body the recent finding through protein simulation revealed that the active sars cov 2 spike protein is more stable than the active sars cov 1 spike protein 106 in comparison sars cov 1 moves faster active and nonactive requiring a longer time to attach to human cell because of their instability meanwhile sars cov 2 are more stable and ready to attack which makes the covid 19 much easily transmitted among human compared to mers and sars cov 1 the detection of the variant of sars cov 2 through mutation also increases global awareness for improving current wastewater treatment therefore it is urgently crucial to develop an advanced remedy to deactivate the targeted viruses especially sars cov 2 in the water system development of smart or intelligent photocatalytic membrane could specifically exclude adsorb and photocatalytically degrade the virus according to their structural and geometric properties by integrating stimuli responsive materials that act as automatic doors by flexible adjustment of pore sizes and surface properties in response to the size or biological properties of the targeted viruses the intelligent or smart membrane could overcome the bottlenecks of current photocatalytic technology 6 conclusion in conclusion there has been a significant rise in evidence suggesting the presence of pathogenic novel sars cov 2 in wastewater throughout this review the articles on various viruses disinfection by photocatalyst were evaluated extensively it is discovered that in the presence of electromagnetic radiation photocatalysts degrade any microorganism that has spread through surfaces or polluted the air including the current deadly covid 19 virus there are only a few photocatalysts that operate successfully in the presence of uv radiation at the moment the scientific work on improving the performance of photocatalysts in the presence of visible spectrum radiation such as solar radiation is still ongoing however the photocatalysts stability and protection must be assured before being used in the public domain if these limitations are overcome photocatalysis can become a more effective weapon in the fight against the virus s spread it is hoped that photocatalysts will be commercialised and adopted on a wide scale in the near future to clean up contamination and kill deadly species like coronavirus declaration

13418,photocatalytic technology offers powerful virus disinfection in wastewater via oxidative capability with minimum harmful by products generation this review paper aims to provide state of the art photocatalytic technology in battling transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 in wastewater prior to that the advantages and limitations of the existing conventional and advanced oxidation processes for virus disinfection in water systems were thoroughly examined a wide spectrum of virus degradation by various photocatalysts was then considered to understand the potential mechanism for deactivating this deadly virus the challenges and future perspectives were comprehensively discussed at the end of this review describing the limitations of current photocatalytic technology and suggesting a realistic outlook on advanced photocatalytic technology as a potential solution in dealing with similar upcoming pandemics the major finding of this review including discovery of a vision on the possible photocatalytic approaches that have been proven to be outstanding against other viruses and subsequently combatting sars cov 2 in wastewater this review intends to deliver insightful information and discussion on the potential of photocatalysis in battling covid 19 transmission through wastewater keywords photocatalysis wastewater virus sars cov 2 covid 19 1 introduction novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 has been declared a pandemic in most countries since the end of march 2020 and has affected 216 countries causing over 2 billion deaths as of 24 january 2021 this covid 19 is an illness caused by the new coronavirus emerging in wuhan hubei province china in early december 2019 on 11 march 2020 the world health organization declared covid 19 a pandemic 1 since the effects of this novel coronavirus are close to those of extreme acute respiratory syndrome sars it has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 2 it is believed that this virus was developed from bats and then moved into other mammalian hosts before jumping to humans covid 19 is the third zoonotic epidemic of the twenty first century after sars 2002 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers 2012 3 covid 19 virus is a positive stranded ribonucleic acid rna virus with a crown like appearance under an electron microscope due to the presence of spike glycoproteins on the envelope fig 1 4 in addition the covid 19 virus is similar to the sars virus in 2003 but spread faster illness caused by covid 19 is mostly respiratory disease while symptoms can be cough fever nausea and diarrhoea 5 the main route of transmission of the covid 19 virus is inhalation by person to person transmission based on its symptoms the transmission can also occur through respiratory droplets and aerosol transmission for this reason researchers have focused on various types of transmission including wastewater due to the probability that the virus may affect the wastewater from the hospital waste such as human faecal from infected persons 6 many contaminants can be found in wastewater especially those discharged from the hospital such as pharmaceutical residues chemical substances radioisotopes and microbial pathogens 7 notably various viruses have been found in the hospital wastewater such as adenoviruses hepatitis a hav and polioviruses this is according to the media that can be the reason for the viruses to be transmitted which is water media since 2003 drainage plumbing systems have been deemed a possible mechanism for spreading the sars cov 1 coronavirus into the sewage system for coronavirus infected populations living in apartment buildings 8 9 the sars cov 2 virus like sars cov 1 can be transmitted by aerosols or microscopic water droplets 10 in fact according to van rowan et al 2020 11 the sars cov 2 and sars cov 1 viruses have comparable stability in aerosols on the surface viruses may remain viable and contagious on surfaces for a few days and in aerosols depending on the inoculum shed for hours 11 to curb and alleviate infectious drinking water water purification technologies have advanced significantly in the last century 12 16 the number of waterborne diseases outbreaks including cholera and typhoid has declined because of drinking water disinfection water disinfection is the elimination deactivation or destruction of pathogenic microorganisms from water microorganisms are killed or made inactive putting an end to their development and reproduction sterilisation is a disinfection related process during the sterilisation process all present microorganisms both dangerous and harmless are destroyed 17 researchers in the netherlands were the first to detect covid 19 viruses in the hospital wastewater 18 later wu et al 19 also found covid 19 viruses in the hospital wastewater that is believed transmitted from the human faecal matter of infected person as in many countries in this world several studies detected the existence of the covid 19 virus in the human faecal of covid 19 patients with or without gastrointestinal symptoms 20 it should be noted that in some countries they are not discharged properly these hazardous contaminants especially viruses can represent chemical biological and physical risks for public and environmental health conventionally virus disinfection in water and wastewater divided into two main categories which are physical and chemical methods physical disinfection including through heating adsorption and filtration virus will be physically removed from water based on size exclusion however due to their small sizes and unique properties of the viruses they are difficult to remove and deactivate while chemical disinfection involved the usage of chemicals to disinfect the virus chlorination technique is one the most common technique for virus disinfection that using chlorine gas chloramines or hypochlorite solution 21 24 previous study reported chlorination could remove sars cov 1 efficiently 25 unfortunately chlorination was opposed due to generation of mutagenic and carcinogenic disinfection by products likewise chlorination also imparts unpleasant tastes and odours to the water in battling the pandemic the performance and environmental safety should be taken into serious consideration as the current published research of pandemic covid 19 is focusing on the occurrence detection and transmission of viruses in the environment 26 29 this paper aims to provide state of the art technology in battling transmission of sars cov 2 in wastewater via photocatalytic degradation the concept and limitation of the existing conventional and current advanced oxidation processes for virus disinfection in water systems were reviewed extensively a broad range of virus degradation by various photocatalysts was also deliberated to understand the possible mechanism to deactivate this deadly virus at the end of this review the challenge and future perspectives are included to provide the limitation of current photocatalytic and suggest a reasonable outlook on developing advanced photocatalytic technology as a promising alternative in handling similar forthcoming pandemics to the best of our knowledge this is the first systematic review that delivers insightful information and discussion on the potential of photocatalysis in battling covid 19 transmission through wastewater 2 virus disinfection via conventional methods physical or chemical disinfectants may be used for disinfection chemical pollutants of water which act as carbohydrates or habitat for microorganisms are often extracted by the disinfectant disinfectants should do more than just destroy bacteria disinfectants must also have a residual effect which ensures that they must stay present in the water after disinfection after disinfection a disinfectant can deter pathogenic microorganisms from emerging in the pipes and recontaminating the water fig 2 shows the classification of water disinfection methods 17 many wastewater treatment methods aim to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms that are toxic to marine organisms recent tests however have shown that even after water treatment a measurable number of pathogens existed in effluents in hospitals and treatment centres chlorine is one of the most used disinfectants 30 in addition to destroying most microbial communities this detergent has a detrimental influence on the ecosystem and may be hazardous to marine organisms if it reaches waterways 31 chlorination can also result in nitrosodimethylamine ndma development which has been linked to human cancer the chlorination process will react with organic matter producing trihalometanes thms a carcinogenic compound 30 conventional filtration methods for wastewater treatment are unsuccessful at eliminating micropollutants like viruses furthermore certain bacteria have been discovered to be immune to such chemical materials 32 these results are in line with the findings of al gheethi et al who discovered the existence of viable microbial cells even after the treatment phase 33 the use of solar based disinfection sodis technology especially in water and wastewater disinfection is a promising approach this system is ideal because of the abundance of high solar radiation low capital expense and long term feasibility meanwhile nanotechnology s use in wastewater treatment has also been recorded in the literature noman et al for example looked at how bimetallic bionanoparticles inactivated antibiotic resistant e coli gram negative and staphylococcus aureus gram positive bacteria seeded in greywater 34 according to the inactivation mechanism the bacterial cells were inactivated due to disruption to the bacterial cell wall s carbohydrates and protein structures 35 the cc bonds of the functional groups found in the bacterial cell wall were broken the combination of sodis and nanotechnology could result in a novel disinfection method for inactivating human viruses the most popular nanoparticles used for wastewater disinfection are zno which are more efficient when exposed to sunlight theoretically increasing antiviral activity 36 as specified by iso 13408 1 sterility assurance level sal is used to characterise the killing efficiency of a treatment process with the treatment process being very efficient if the sal is very poor log reduction accepted by the united states environmental protection agency usepa is a term widely used to measure the efficiency of disinfection processes 37 sal is generally written as 10n based on the pathogen s initial concentration a 103 or 106 value is most often used for sterilisation the log reduction is 101 which represents a 90 reduction in the microbial community the microbial population falls from one million 106 to almost zero or a reduction of 99 9999 when disinfection with a 6 log reduction 106 is used 38 a kill rate of 99 99 is measured by a four log reduction the growth of inactive bacteria should be calculated as an indication for inactive viruses to ensure that the removal of treated effluent is healthy if no growth can be seen in the culture medium after incubation these cells are designated as destroyed 39 however the capacity of microbial cells to resuscitate can be affected by the storage conditions of disinfected samples salmonella s aureus and enterococcus faecalis were resuscitated in sewage samples treated with solar disinfection sodis for 6 h and deposited at 37 c for 4 days the capacity of the disinfection process to damage the bacteria s cell walls can enable cells to survive in this situation a pathogen growth potential pgp bioassay must be performed 40 table 1 summarises the water disinfection process with reviews of the advantages and disadvantages 3 virus disinfection via an advanced oxidation process advanced oxidation processes are a recently discovered technology for the disinfection of viruses in polluted wastewater by generating reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals as an oxidising agent to treat harmful pathogens the generation of radicals may be initiated by primary oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide ozone sources of energy uv light ultrasonic and heat or catalysts such as titania iron oxide or other semiconductors hydroxyl radicals are known to rapidly and unselectively bombard organic molecules the generated radicals degrade the organic molecules found on the virus cell wall and directly deteriorate the virus pathogens the advanced oxidation processes include ozonation ultrasound fenton process and photocatalysis have been effectively and efficiently utilised in treating virus contaminated water the methods offer other diverse approaches to the production of hydroxyl radicals that make it more flexible and therefore provide a better approach to complying with strict guidelines during wastewater treatment ozonation is a common technique in virus disinfection from wastewater that utilises three oxygen atoms o3 called ozone into the water ozone presents in the form of gas which is one of the most potent oxidising agents when ozone is dissolved in water it produces a broad spectrum of reactive oxygen radicals ros that could oxidise organic materials in virus membranes which destroys the cell wall and leads to cell bursting causing immediate degradation of the viruses 44 previous studies reported that the virus could be removed from wastewater by ozonation 45 46 furthermore ozone is highly reactive and must be directly used after onsite generation and difficult to store 47 ozonation in wastewater could also result in the formation of harmful by products such as aldehydes carboxylic acids and bromate when reacting with dissolved organic matter and bromide 45 ultrasound is a longitudinal wave with frequencies in the range of 20 106 khz 48 this frequency is above the human hearing range 20 hz to 20 khz but below the mega sonic range 600 khz 49 this technique has attracted wide attention in water and sewage system due to simplicity high decomposition speed and zero secondary pollution ultrasound is evaluated as one of the aop for the degradation of pollutants in the water system due to the formation of free hydroxyl radicals with oxidising capabilities 50 51 ultrasound technique was reported to disinfect microorganisms and viruses by several mechanisms based on acoustic cavitation 49 52 53 cavitation is the phenomenon of microbubbles or cavities forming growing and collapsing in a liquid in extremely short time intervals milliseconds 49 the mechanism involved are 1 the viruses could be chemically disinfected by bombarded with hydroxyl radicals generated via ultrasound 2 the virus could be physically attacked by the high temperature and pressure that results from the momentum of bubble collapse that can kill the viruses and 3 shear forces that persuaded by microstreaming that could damage the virus ultrasound technique can be applied as a stand alone process or integrated with other disinfection techniques such as chlorination heating ozonation and uv irradiation 53 54 however the utilisation of ultrasound technique in water treatment requires high operating and maintaining costs due to the high energy consumption and replacement of instruments like the ultrasound probe which continue to be managed by the ultrasonic activity itself 55 the fenton process is the reaction between aqueous ferrous ions and hydrogen peroxide to generate hydroxyl radicals in acidic conditions fenton s reagent was first discovered in 1894 by henry john horstman fenton through the oxidation of tartaric acid by activating hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radicals and hydroxide ions by fe2 56 later only in the late 1960s the fenton process successfully destroyed hazardous organic pollutants in wastewater by radical oxidation and flocculation 56 this process is considered one of the most effective aop in removing organic pollutants and microbial disinfection in wastewater application the main benefits of this process in disinfection treatment are 1 both reagents iron and hydrogen peroxide are non toxic and cheap 2 harmless by products generation as in chlorination and ozonation and 3 no mass transfer limitation however there are several limitations suffered by the fenton process such as 1 high consumption of hydrogen peroxide 2 strict ph range 3 sludge generation and 4 the accumulation of ferric sludge that could affect the oxidation performance therefore several modifications to fenton reagent were made to overcome the limitation of the traditional fenton reagent such as integration with external energy and development of heterogeneous fenton process to ensure efficient and sustainable water purification 57 nieto juarez et al investigated the inactivation of ms2 virus by iron hydroxide mediated fenton like process under the sunlight and in the dark 58 they found viruses can be physically removed from water as well as inactivated by adsorption and a particle mediated photo fenton like process using heterogeneous fenton like processes according to the above description photocatalytic disinfection is the most effective procedure for water treatment mass transfer limitations must be minimised for efficient tio2 water treatment because photocatalytic degradation occurs primarily on the surface of tio2 organic pollutants adsorb poorly on tio2 surface due to their low affinity for organic pollutants particularly hydrophobic organic pollutants resulting in slow photocatalytic degradation rates as a result pollutant targeting around tio2 nanoparticles to improve photocatalytic performance must be considered 59 furthermore due to the instability of the nanosized particle tio2 nanoparticles can aggregate obstructing light incidence on the active centres and reducing catalytic activity however it should be noted that those small particles can experience greater scattering which may reduce their photocatalytic activity compared to larger particles furthermore one major practical obstacle for the slurry method is to extract the nanosized tio2 particles from the treated water which is both an economic and a safety issue 60 previous studies have used the following countermeasures to resolve the weaknesses of tio2 dependent photocatalysis 1 changes to the tio2 catalyst to allow visible light to be used 61 2 catalyst synthesis should be designed to produce catalysts with well defined crystal structures high affinity for different organic pollutants and smaller particle sizes 62 3 design and develop a second generation tio2 catalyst with high separation efficiency and the ability to be recovered and regenerated 63 these modifications and advancements aim to improve photocatalytic performance complete organic pollutant degradation visible light absorption stability reproducibility and tio2 recycle and reuse capabilities the following section will focus on photocatalytic action as a disinfection process for water treatment 4 virus disinfection via photocatalysis photocatalysts are semiconductor oxides that serve as heterogeneous catalysts in the presence of electromagnetic radiation they act as a medium to decompose living or non living microstructures accumulated on any surface or suspended in liquid or gases and come into contact with a solid surface photocatalysts may also use photocatalytic reactions to break the water and create hydrogen the phenomenon mentioned above occurs due to a process known as photocatalytic oxidation and reduction 60 the photocatalytic process involves three main stages 1 formation of photoinduced charge carrier 2 separation of charge carrier and distribution to the surface of the photocatalyst and 3 oxidation and reduction reaction on the surface of the photocatalyst 13 as illustrated in fig 3 zhang et al 64 suggested the progress on photocatalysis in battling virus from the water system virus disinfection in water by photocatalysis was pioneered by sierka and sjogren in 1994 44 they found ms2 viruses successfully disinfected by tio2 photocatalyst under uv irradiation in 2008 most research works focused on developing tio2 based photocatalyst that can deactivate viruses under visible light irradiation later the potential of various metals other than tio2 such as iron oxide 65 silver 66 alumina 66 and copper oxide 67 was investigated for virus disinfection under visible light since then metal free photocatalyst like carbon based photocatalyst with antiviral properties was further explored to obtain cheap safe and sustainable materials for viruses disinfection in the water 4 1 performance evaluation on virus disinfection via photocatalysis earlier tio2 photocatalyst has shown great potential as a solution for sewage and wastewater treatment because it is non toxic cheap and abundantly available tio2 photocatalysts successfully deactivated viruses like phage ms2 bacteriophage qβ phage f2 murine norovirus and human adenovirus 68 72 viruses disinfection by photocatalyst could overcome the drawbacks of the conventional disinfection methods such as the generation of harmful by products and utilisation of large volumes of chemicals however there are main limitations suffered by tio2 photocatalyst which are lower bandgap poor capability for carrier charge separation that results in incompetent exploitation of visible light and low photodegradation performances later coupling tio2 photocatalyst with other metals such as manganese mn 73 palladium 74 silver oxide ago copper 75 76 and copper oxide 67 to form heterojunction photocatalyst could further enhance the photocatalytic activities on virus degradation through visible light irradiation the technology of photocatalysis that employs carbon based photocatalyst has attracted much attention due to the zero risk of metal leaching into the water system and optimum natural light harvesting capability 77 79 the non metal photocatalysts that have been developed for virus disinfection include carbon based materials such fullerene 80 81 carbon nanotube 82 carbon dot 83 84 and graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 78 85 86 fullerene c60 is a spherical carbon based molecule made up of carbon atoms kept together by sp2 hybridisation fullerenes have a peculiar three dimensional structure and have high chemical stability they also have a large specific surface area and strong electrical conductivity fullerene offers the generation of ros under visible light due to its small gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest occupied molecular orbital which is approximately 1 6 1 9 ev 87 a previous study reported that the suspensions of polyhydroxylated fullerene successfully inactivated the non enveloped viruses like ms2 bacteriophage enterobacteria phage prd1 and bacteriophage t7 under uva irradiation 88 hotze et al determined that the virus inactivation by fullerene material is mainly based on the production of singlet oxygen 1o2 one of the ros by fullerene aggregates and resistance of the viruses determined by the structural and composition of non enveloped virus capsids however the potential of fullerene as a photocatalyst in wastewater treatment was limited to the aggregation of the nanoscale particles that reduces the photochemical properties therefore immobilisation of fullerene appeared as the most practical approach to retain the photoactivity in the aqueous system moor et al managed to immobilise fullerene on silica gel and polystyrene resin by the simple nucleophilic addition of a primary amine across a 6 6 fullerene double bond and followed by proton transfer under mild condition as shown in fig 4 a 80 based on the sem images in fig 4 b e moor et al suggested the surface of ps resin and silica gel were covered by monolayer coverage of fullerene and did not exhibit significant aggregation the immobilisation of fullerene on solid materials also promoted the production of 1o2 in the water under visible light irradiation and deactivated ms2 bacteriophages without exhibiting significant loss of photocatalytic activity after repeated cycles besides that c60 fullerene the immobilised c70 fullerene on mcm 41 also displays antiviral properties towards ms2 in the water system under visible light irradiation 81 in contrast g c3n4 can be synthesised directly from earth rich low cost precursors rich in nitrogen e g heating the melamine 79 the g c3n4 consists of organic elements such as carbon nitrogen and hydrogen and has the ability to break water and produce hydrogen under visible light irradiation making it a non metal catalyst and widely utilised for water treatment 89 91 to date g c3n4 was documented for having antimicrobial and antivirus properties through photocatalytic degradation 92 the bandgap of g c3n4 is 2 7 ev that is appropriate for visible light driven photocatalyst with a conductive band of 1 1 ev and valence band of 1 6 ev and normal hydrogen electrode as reference 93 to evaluate the photocatalytic inefficient of g c3n4 for virus disinfection under visible light irradiation li et al used bacteriophage ms2 as a model virus 78 as depicted in fig 5 a bacteriophage ms2 was completely inactivated within 360 min under visible light irradiation the regrowth test was also conducted in the dark for 72 h no visible plaques formed indicating that g c3n4 had inactivated the virus through the photocatalysis process as shown in fig 5 b li et al also compared the performance of g c3n4 with other metal based visible driven photocatalysts such as nitrogen doped tio2 n tio2 bi2wo6 and ag agcl for viral deactivation they revealed that more than 7 log of ms2 were deactivated by g c3n4 whereas about 1 log and 4 log of ms2 were deactivated by n tio2 and bi2wo6 photocatalyst respectively the ag agcl recorded the highest inactivation of ms2 which resulted from the presence of biocidal silver ions and silver nanoparticles that performed as an electron sink to expedite charge separation and enhance the photon harvesting 94 however the application of silver based photocatalyst is costly and may pose health risks in the treated water due to the dissolution of ag and ag nanoparticles as depicted in fig 5 c the degradation mechanism of ms2 by g c3n4 under visible light irradiation mainly involved the oxidation damage on the surface protein of the virus by ros that resulted in the leakage and shape distortion which finally led to the rapid destruction of genetic materials namely rna and caused the viral death with no regrowth 4 2 mechanism of photocatalysis on virus disinfection it was first to observe the photocatalysis mechanism by tio2 to inactivate the virus by destroying the shell and or capsid of viruses as a result genetic materials minerals and proteins were released inside the viruses and caused the virus to inactivate herein it should be noted that the photocatalysis mechanism of the virus occurred on the surface of the film and can be explained by photodegradation of the protein capsid of the virus and subsequently efflux of the viral rna enveloped by the protein layer when virus reacts with the surface of the catalyst active radicals such as o2 hoo and ho formed and oxidised the ch bonds and degraded viruses 95 it is well known that most photocatalysts are semiconductor materials the photocatalytic process based on semiconductor materials can be briefly described as shown in fig 6 when the semiconductor is irradiated by light photogenerated electron e and hole h are generated and react with other substances to form ros including oh h2o2 h and o2 and these ros participate in the photocatalytic degradation bacteria process afterwards reactive oxygen species attack the cell membrane the coenzyme a on the cell membrane is damaged resulting in inhibition of respiration dependent on the intact cell membrane reduction or loss of cellular respiration activity and eventually cause cell death to view the potential of photocatalysis as an alternative solution for battling covid 19 understanding the real mechanism of deactivation and destroying the microorganisms especially coronaviruses during photocatalytic disinfection is vitally important it might be helpful to develop a more efficient and powerful photocatalyst by 1 designing the morphology according to virology 2 hybridising or functionalising with transition metals ions and 3 fabricating composites or heterogeneous photocatalyst for efficient energy utilisation and recovery typically microorganisms contain outer membrane peptidoglycan and cytoplasmic membranes responsible for structural integrity and retention the membranes surround an internal liquid based cytoplasmic matrix that is comprised of genetic material and biochemical systems based on the complexity of the microorganisms the complete mechanism of their degradation by photocatalytic remains partially known as illustrated in fig 7 regmi et al reviewed the possible mechanism of photocatalytic degradation by semiconductor and nanoparticles photocatalyst on microbial cells in wastewater environment involving 1 oxidative stress induction where the excess generation of ros leads to peroxidation of the lipid membrane and protein attack that depresses the activity of some periplasmic enzyme and directly interact and damage the genetic materials 2 metal ion release the metal ions could exempt from semiconductor photocatalyst then passed through the cell membrane and directly reacted with the functional groups of nucleic acid and protein such as cooh nh and sh before finally destroying them 3 non oxidative mechanism reducing the critical cellular metabolism such as amino acid protein nucleotide and carbohydrate metabolism without oxidative stress induction 96 nevertheless only the first mechanism has gained the interest of the researchers which involved the generation of ros that plays a major role in virus disinfection researchers strongly agreed that the main degradation of microorganism is initiated by the prolonged ros attack results on the damage of the cell wall followed by the cytoplasmic membrane and direct attack of intracellular components comprising genetic materials within the microorganism as depicted in fig 8 97 viruses and their host bacteria typically co exist in actual water conditions therefore the efficiency of photocatalytic inactivation in the mixed system of virus bacteria is of practical importance for instance zheng et al fabricated cu tio2 nanofibres for the removal of virus bacteriophage f2 and bacteria e coli 285 75 fig 9 a they compared the inactivation of both virus and bacteria in a single and mixed systems with the presence and absence of source light under visible light both e coli and bacteriophage f2 were inactivated completely within 240 min as shown in fig 9 b this indicates bacteriophage f2 is more resistant to photocatalytic oxidation in the virus bacteria mixed system than e coli 286 however in the virus bacteria mixed system with the absence of source light the removal efficiency of bacteriophage f2 decreased significantly compared to that in the single virus system as depicted in fig 9 c it can be assumed that free ross play an important role in phage f2 inactivation and in the bulk phase virus disinfection in the water system by photocatalysis is also affected by the presence of natural organic molecules besides bacteria the actual water system also contains natural organic matters noms such as nucleic acids carbohydrates and proteins their presence could quench the generated ros and serve as disinfectants 98 therefore the disinfection of viruses must also consider the presence of noms to further explore this situation cheng et al utilised humic acid as nom representative and cu tio2 nanofibers as a photocatalyst 76 they found that when the concentration of humic acid was increased from 0 to 15 mg l the removal efficiency of bacteriophage f2 declined from 5 00 to 1 89 log this is due to the presence of humic acid that prevented the viral photocatalytic efficiency of the photocatalyst it could be inferred that the presence of humic acid also dramatically reduces its stability particularly for the practical application of virus photocatalytic disinfection technology the existence of noms is a non negligible problem and more relevant research should be conducted to gain a better understanding of this subject 5 challenges and future perspectives the impressive performance of the virus inactivation through the photocatalysis process in water as summarised in table 2 has proven the capability of photocatalysis to disinfect various harmful viruses however there are several challenges and barriers in the disinfection of viruses by photocatalysis especially in battling them in wastewater first the difficulty in recovery of the suspended photocatalyst from the solution because of the possible toxicity of nanosized photocatalysts and the photocatalysts functionalised with other carcinogen substances the powdery shaped and suspended nanosized photocatalysts must be removed before the treated water is reused or released into the environment the photocatalytic disinfection of the virus could also be more harmful if the released photocatalyst has not gone through a complete reaction where disinfection has still not occurred and the photocatalyst is still holding the adsorbed harmful viruses second in real water applications the nanosized photocatalysts are brittle and prone to aggregation aggregation of photocatalyst could hinder the active surface area and reduce the photocatalytic performance therefore those barriers must be overcome if photocatalytic degradation is to be used independently in wastewater treatment to address the above challenges immobilising the photocatalyst into porous or floating substrate could solve the recovery and agglomeration issues of the suspended photocatalysts in the aqueous system 13 67 92 the porous substrate could be an organic or inorganic membrane leading to the development of a bifunctional photocatalytic membrane that acts as a filter and photocatalyst in the same chamber however incorporating the photocatalyst in the substrate might result in the sedimentation of the photocatalyst at the bottom of the substrate this condition could hinder the maximum light utilisation from activating the photocatalyst hence modification or functionalisation of the photocatalyst and the substrate can be adapted to guarantee the photocatalyst remains at the top surface of the substrate other than that utilisation of translucent or transparent substrate might solve the source light utilisation besides that the application of electrospun nanofibrous photocatalyst also attracted much attention in virus disinfection in water systems due to their super porosity and high surface area to volume ratio 74 76 99 nevertheless electrospun nanofibrous photocatalysts are broadly acknowledged as brittle and fragile and they can collapse easily due to their large pore size this condition makes them not suitable to be used in water treatment for long term application post treatment after fabrication of nanofibrous photocatalytic could enhance the flexibility and mechanical strength of the nanofibrous photocatalyst apart from that viruses were reported to have stronger resistance towards photocatalytic disinfection than other microbes such as bacteria due to their differences in structural and geometric properties 75 unlike bacteria viruses are the smallest and tiniest germ that can spread easily through the air that can cause various diseases with specifically targeted cells for example when a certain virus gets inside a host it can hijack the specific cellular machinery like blood respiratory system liver or other organs to generate clones of itself overtaking more cells continuing to reproduce and finally destroying the targeted cells and harming the body in the case of covid 19 when sars cov 2 gets inside the human body it specifically attacks the upper and the lower respiratory system like sinuses nose throat windpipe and lungs before damaging the organs and terminating the whole body the recent finding through protein simulation revealed that the active sars cov 2 spike protein is more stable than the active sars cov 1 spike protein 106 in comparison sars cov 1 moves faster active and nonactive requiring a longer time to attach to human cell because of their instability meanwhile sars cov 2 are more stable and ready to attack which makes the covid 19 much easily transmitted among human compared to mers and sars cov 1 the detection of the variant of sars cov 2 through mutation also increases global awareness for improving current wastewater treatment therefore it is urgently crucial to develop an advanced remedy to deactivate the targeted viruses especially sars cov 2 in the water system development of smart or intelligent photocatalytic membrane could specifically exclude adsorb and photocatalytically degrade the virus according to their structural and geometric properties by integrating stimuli responsive materials that act as automatic doors by flexible adjustment of pore sizes and surface properties in response to the size or biological properties of the targeted viruses the intelligent or smart membrane could overcome the bottlenecks of current photocatalytic technology 6 conclusion in conclusion there has been a significant rise in evidence suggesting the presence of pathogenic novel sars cov 2 in wastewater throughout this review the articles on various viruses disinfection by photocatalyst were evaluated extensively it is discovered that in the presence of electromagnetic radiation photocatalysts degrade any microorganism that has spread through surfaces or polluted the air including the current deadly covid 19 virus there are only a few photocatalysts that operate successfully in the presence of uv radiation at the moment the scientific work on improving the performance of photocatalysts in the presence of visible spectrum radiation such as solar radiation is still ongoing however the photocatalysts stability and protection must be assured before being used in the public domain if these limitations are overcome photocatalysis can become a more effective weapon in the fight against the virus s spread it is hoped that photocatalysts will be commercialised and adopted on a wide scale in the near future to clean up contamination and kill deadly species like coronavirus declaration

13419,a lab scale system pbes combined electrolysis hydrogenotrophic denitrification and pyrite oxidizing denitrification was established to evaluate the effect of current density on nitrate removal performance and community dynamics results indicated that the optimal no3 n removal efficiency with lowest no2 n accumulation was obtained when current density was 0 10 ma cm2 a higher current density did not promote no3 n removal the activities of nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase in both the cathode biofilm and pyrite biofilm showed similar variation trend with that of no3 n removal the estimated contribution of hydrogenotrophic denitrification 23 77 43 53 was lower than that of pyrite oxidizing denitrification 58 19 76 23 in the pbes illumina miseq sequencing indicated that microbial diversity of cathode biofilm increased with current density increased from 0 05 to 0 10 ma cm2 then ceased to increase at a higher current density whereas the microbial diversity of pyrite biofilm continuously increased along with increased current density azoarcus may be the key player for nitrate removal in both cathode and pyrite biofilms our results can provide useful information to improve pbes designs for the future applications keywords hydrogenotrophic denitrification pyrite oxidizing denitrification nitrate removal current density azoarcus 1 introduction many industries such as explosive and fertilizer manufacturing discharge highly concentrated nitrate contaminated wastewaters to the environment 1 the excessive presence of nitrate in natural waters may pose serious environmental problems and health risks 2 in many countries industries are enforced to treat their wastewater to comply with the corresponding environmental standards thus the selection of cost effective treatment method for the nitrate contaminated wastewater is an important topic and has been widely studied in recent years biological denitrification is considered to be an efficient and low cost way for converting the nitrate and nitrite to harmless n2 in the anoxic environment 3 4 in our previous study a pyrite oxidizing bioelectrochemical system pbes was established to treat the wastewater containing nitrate nitrogen no3 n from 100 to 400 mg l the final product was n2 5 instead of poised potential to the cathode the pbes was powered by a dc power supply which is considered more suitable for practical applications 6 7 the main idea of building such system is that the pyrite oxidizing process generates less sulfate in comparison with sulfur oxidizing process when reducing the same amount of no3 n 8 moreover electrochemically induced hydrogenotrophic denitrification process can cover the consumed alkalinity by pyrite oxidizing process the external power supply is the key to regulate the system ph and accelerate the reaction rate those are hard to be controlled in conventional pyrite based denitrification system 9 10 however the effect of current density on the nitrate removal performance of pbes is still unknown which is essential for future scale up several previous studies have demonstrated that the microbial denitrifying performance could be stimulated by the increased current density 11 12 the possible mechanism is that the electrical current stimulates the growth and enzyme activity of the bacteria at a specific range 13 14 however there are also conflicting studies that have shown increased current density did not benefit denitrification for instance wei et al found that when the biomass from a membrane bioreactor mbr was subjected to constant direct current the percentage of live cell decreased by 10 15 and 29 at current density of 6 2 12 3 and 24 7 a m2 respectively 15 current density may also affect the structure of microbial community zhang et al found that acidovorax and bradyrhizobium possessed higher abundances in the denitrifying microbial community when the current density was increased 16 xia et al investigated the dynamic response of denitrifying community to current density in a biofilm electrode reactor and found that the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria decreased from 45 6 to 23 5 with the increased current density from 0 to 166 7 a m3 net cathodic compartment 17 nevertheless there are also some reports revealed that the dominant bacteria may not be affected by the electrode potential for example pous et al found that geobacter was predominant in the biofilm of a bioelectrochemical system operated at both bioanodic acetate as an electron donor 397 mv vs she and biocathodic conditions nitrate as an electron acceptor 303 mv vs she 18 however there is very little dynamic information about the response of core denitrifying microbial community in pyrite oxidizing bioelectrochmical system to current density variation in this study we aimed to investigate the effect of electrical current density on nitrate removal in pbes the dynamics of biomass amount nitrate nitrite metabolism enzyme activity and microbial community in response to current density were also examined the results of this study have important implication for future combination of the denitrification process with renewable energy technologies since the current densities of electricity generated from renewable energy sun light wind etc vary widely 19 2 materials and methods 2 1 pbes

synthetic wastewater was changed when more than 80 of no3 n was removed from the reactor after three feeding cycles the reactor was operated as continuous up flow mode as described below 2 2 effect of current density on denitrification performance of pbes after start up the reactor was operated as continuous up flow mode the influent synthetic wastewater without ch3coo c was pumped into the reactor by a peristaltic pump bt100 2 j longer china at a flow rate of 2 56 ml min hrt 7 5 h from the bottom which went through the pbes and then discharged from the upper outlet the current density was also

biofilm sampling and microbial community analysis biofilm samples were taken at the last day of different operation phases six biofilm samples were collected from the cathode surface and pyrite

1 33 mg l of no2 n were present in the effluent and the no3 n removal efficiency was approximately 58 32 2 51 when the current density was increased to 0 10 ma cm2 5 22 0 36 mg l of no3 n and 1 50 0 26 mg l of no2 n was left in the effluent and the no3 n removal efficiency was approached to 94 48 1 91 however further increase of current density to 0 20 and 0 30 ma cm2 did not significantly influence the no3 n removal efficiency 95 27 3 76 and 91 15 1 03 at 0 20 and 0 30 ma cm2 4 52 0 89 and 8 33 0 52 mg l of no3 n 3 05 0 24 and 4 91 0 73 mg l of no2 n remained in the effluent of pbes n2o n production accounted for less than 0 3 of the mass of no3 n denitrified under all conditions fig s2 while the estimated hydrogen amounts containing hydrogen gas and dissolved hydrogen per hrt were 9 48 23 58 65 86 and 69 76 mg at current density of 0 05 0 10 0 20 and 0 30 ma cm2 respectively these observations are consisted with a previous research that has shown the highest nitrate removal efficiency was achieved at an optimal current density of 0 03 ma cm2 further increased the current density did not increase nitrate removal efficiency probably because of the hydrogen inhibition 23 as shown in fig 1b the so4 2 concentration in effluent was 195 67 15 67 mg l when the current density was 0 05 ma cm2 which increased to 231 28 23 93 mg l along with the increase of current density to 0 10 ma cm2 this indicates that the pyrite oxidizing denitrification capacity may be enhanced by increasing the current density 0 10 ma cm2 proper dc current may be important to the bacterial activity jackman et al also reported that proper dc current increased the acidification rate due to the stimulation of metabolic processes and biofilms formation 24 however similar with the variation trend of nitrate removal efficiency there was no further increase of the so4 2 concentration when the current density was further increased to 0 20 and 0 30 ma cm2 the possible explanation might be that the relatively high current density 0 10 ma cm2 disrupted the cell walls and membranes therefore deteriorated the bacterial activity 15 25 26 the ph is an important factor which affects the performance of biocathodic denitrification 27 fig 1c shows the variations of ph in the pbes at a constant influent ph condition 7 0 the effluent ph was 7 39 0 15 at current density of 0 05 ma cm2 which was increased when the current density increased to 0 10 ma cm2 the raised ph may due to the improved activity of hydrogenotrophic denitrification when current density was increased however the effluent ph remained comparatively stable when the current density was further increased to 0 20 and 0 30 ma cm2 suggesting that excessive evolution of hydrogen caused by larger current density may not significantly enhance the hydrogenotrophic denitrification performance probably because of the hydrogen inhibition 23 28 these results were corroborated by the nitrate removal efficiency results that the current density of 0 20 and 0 30 ma cm2 did not enhance the nitrate removal performance compared with that of 0 10 ma cm2 in addition the ph values ranging from 7 0 to 8 2 under all conditions were close to the reported optimal ph 7 50 for cathodic denitrification 29 this might be one of the reason for the insignificant n2o accumulation in pbes overall the current density may affect the microbial activity of both pyrite oxidizing denitrifier and hydrogenotrophic denitrifier in the pbes indicating that a proper current density is of great importance for regulating the microbial denitrification activity in the pbes 3 2 effect of current density on biomass amount and nitrate nitrite metabolism enzyme activity of pbes the biomass amount and nitrate nitrite metabolism enzyme activity of the cathode biofilm and pyrite biofilm under different current densities were measured figs 2 and 3 as shown in fig 2 the biomass amount of the cathode biofilm significantly increased from 34 55 4 21 to 85 37 2 66 mg g when current density increased from 0 05 to 0 10 ma cm2 and then decreased when current density was further increased this suggests that the current density 0 10 ma cm2 stimulated cathodic bacteria to grow when the current density was more than 0 10 ma cm2 some bacteria may die and resulted in decreased biomass of the cathode biofilm 30 in contrast the biomass amount of the pyrite biofilm showed insignificant variation with changing the current density the activities of nitrate reductase nr and nitrite reductase nir can indicate the microbial denitrification activity 31 fig 3 displays the nr and nir activities of cathode biofilm and pyrite biofilm under different current densities nr of the cathode biofilm increased from 0 03 0 01 to 0 09 0 02 μmol nitrite production min mg protein with current density increased from 0 05 to 0 10 ma cm2 and then decreased to 0 06 0 01 and 0 05 0 01 μmol nitrite production min mg protein at current density of 0 20 and 0 30 ma cm2 nr of the pyrite biofilm showed similar trends with that of the cathode biofilm these results are in accordance with the no3 n removal efficiency in the pbes under different current densities fig 1a when the current density increased from 0 05 to 0 10 ma cm2 nir of the cathode biofilm and pyrite biofilm showed similar variations with nr nir reached the maximum of 0 24 0 02 and 0 28 0 01 μmol nitrite reduction min mg protein of the cathode biofilm and pyrite biofilm at 0 10 ma cm2 this is also consistent with the no2 n accumulation degrees in the pbes fig 1a 3 3 the contribution of pyrite oxidizing and hydrogenotrophic denitrification to nitrate removal under different current densities fig 4 shows the relative contributions of pyrite oxidizing denitrification and hydrogenotrophic denitrification to no3 n removal under different current densities the estimated contribution of pyrite oxidizing autotrophic denitrification to nitrate removal was 76 23 56 60 56 47 and 58 19 at current density of 0 05 0 10 0 20 and 0 30 ma cm2 based on eq 5 the contribution of hydrogenotrophic denitrification was 23 77 43 40 43 53 and 41 81 at current density of 0 05 0 10 0 20 and 0 30 ma cm2 respectively the theoretical no3 n removal amounts per hrt were 21 06 52 38 146 31 and 154 97 mg no3 n based on the measured amount of produced hydrogen according to eq 2 the theoretical values of no3 n removal at 0 05 and 0 10 ma cm2 were lower than those of the estimated hydrogenotrophic denitrification values obtained from eq 5 27 17 and 80 37 mg no3 n the rest part could be attributed to the nitrate assimilation for biomass growth at 0 05 and 0 10 ma cm2 this is consistent with the increased cathode biofilm biomass at 0 10 ma cm2 fig 2 the ratios of hydrogenotrophic denitrification and pyrite oxidizing denitrification were not much difference with current density increased from 0 10 to 0 30 ma cm2 this may be ascribed to the electrical inhibition of both hydrogenotrophic and pyrite oxidizing denitrification as the biomass amount and nitrate nitrite metabolism enzyme activity of cathode biofilm and the nitrite metabolism enzyme activity of pyrite biofilm were all decreased along with the increased current density figs 2 and 3 thus although the h2 amount was increased with the increased current density it would not be utilized due to the electrical inhibition of bacteria activity furthermore the contribution of hydrogenotrophic denitrification was lower than that of the pyrite oxidizing denitrification for all conditions this is not consistent with wang et al who found that the percentage of sulfur autotrophic denitrification part was lower than that of hydrogenotrophic denitrification part in their combined autotrophic denitrification system 32 probably because the functional microbes in the pbes were different from that study and the ratio of pyrite mass current density in the pbes was larger than that study of sulfur mass current density ratio 3 4 response of microbial community the high throughput sequencing was used to analyze the dynamics of microbial community structure a total of 264 253 effective sequence reads were obtained from all biofilm samples after filtering out the low quality reads and trimming the adapters and barcodes the sequences were further clustered into 2032 otus of bacteria the rarefaction curves of bacteria for each biofilm sample tended to approach the saturation plateau fig s1 indicating that a reasonable number of individual sample was taken and the data could sufficiently show the diﬀ erences in the species diversity among diﬀ erent samples the estimators representing the community richness and alpha diversity were listed in table 1 sobs ace and chao representing the richness of the community their values increased with current density increased from 0 05 to 0 10 ma cm2 but decreased when current density further increased to 0 30 ma cm2 irrespective of the cathode biofilm or pyrite biofilm the shannon value and simpson value have opposite relationships with respect to alpha diversity of the community shannon value was continuously increased when current density increased from 0 05 to 0 30 ma cm2 for the pyrite biofilm whereas for the cathode biofilm the shannon value was increased when current density increased from 0 05 to 0 10 ma cm2 but decreased at current density of 0 30 ma cm2 similar observation by feng et al who reported that electric acclimation caused an obvious decrease of the species richness and diversity in microbial community on the particle electrodes zeolite and granular activated carbon 33 in another report the richness of microbial community increased when the current intensity increased from 0 25 to 0 35 a and then decreased at 0 40 a 34 a taxonomic classification of community in the pbes at genus level in biofilm samples under different current densities is shown in fig s4 and the key microbes are listed in fig 5 azoarcus thauera and unclassified f rhodobacteraceae were the most dominant genera in both cathode biofilm and pyrite biofilm azoarcus have been observed in both hydrogenotrophic and sulfide oxidizing denitrifying communities 35 36 with the highest relative abundances in the cathode biofilm 27 06 and pyrite biofilm 24 80 at current density of 0 10 ma cm2 which may be the key contributor for the larger no3 n removal efficiency at this current density than 0 05 or 0 30 ma cm2 fig 1a thauera also have been identified as autotrophic denitrifier which could reduce nitrate to nitrogen gas using hydrogen and hs as electron donors 37 38 with higher relative abundance at current density of 0 30 ma cm2 than 0 05 and 0 10 ma cm2 in both cathode biofilm 19 54 in c1 3 48 in c2 and 25 27 in c3 and pyrite biofilm 8 29 in p1 7 39 in p2 and 20 14 in p3 which may exhibit tolerance to higher dc current stress in the pbes in addition the family rhodobacteraceae contained the groups with the ability to carry out key steps in the denitrification pathway 39 however no classified genus was identified in the communities of the biofilm samples hyphomonas a dimophic prosthecate which might play an important role for the cathode biofilm formation 8 38 in c1 1 17 in c2 and 10 70 in c3 40 paracoccus was reported to be capable of hydrogenotrophic denitrification 41 was also present in the cathode biofilm 2 91 in c1 1 98 in c2 and 1 51 in c3 thiobacillus 2 92 in p1 5 34 in p2 and 12 40 in p3 and pseudomonas 2 92 in p1 1 82 in p2 and 5 19 in p3 were reported to use pyrite as electron donor for denitrification were detected in the pyrite biofilm with low relative abundances 42 43 which also contributed to no3 n removal through pyrite oxidizing process in the pbes the function genes analyses were carried out through picrust2 predication following the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database the total abundances of denitrification associated genes in cathode biofilm and pyrite biofilm increased from 0 61 to 0 76 with current density increased from 0 05 to 0 10 ma cm2 while no further increase 0 72 was observed at current density of 0 30 ma cm2 table s1 which is in accordance with the no3 n removal efficiency fig 1 and the enzyme activity results fig 3 moreover the abundance of denitrification associated genes in pyrite biofilm was higher than that in cathode biofilm 0 39 0 42 vs 0 22 0 34 which was consistent with the results that the higher contribution of pyrite oxidizing denitrification than hydrogenotrophic denitrification in pbes fig 4 the total abundances of cytochrome c associated genes and quinone associated genes in pyrite biofilm and cathode biofilm ranged from 1 96 to 2 25 and 1 43 to 1 69 respectively with changing the current density the highest abundances were all observed at current density of 0 10 ma cm2 which is in accordance with the result that the optimal denitrification efficiency of pbes was obtained at 0 10 ma cm2 the membrane bound electron carriers cytochrome c and quinone were recognized as crucial components for extracellular electron transfer eet between bacteria and solid phase metal oxides electrode 10 44 this indicates that eet may be an important pathway for microbial pyrite oxidization and the cathodic biofilm may also have ability to perform direct eet from electrode without using h2 as mediator at 0 10 ma cm2 current density 3 5 future outlook understanding the regulation mechanism of current density is required to bring electrochemically assisted denitrifying bioreactor on a large scale as it is a promising low carbon consumed technology for the nitrate removal in the present study we found that the increased current density may not always enhance the nitrate removal performance and the activity of pyrite oxidizing denitrification was outcompeted to the hydrogenotrophic denitrification at all current density conditions although the ph values in the system were relatively stable over all operation phases the results of this study provided useful information for applying the pbes for real nitrate contaminated wastewater treatment for successful scale up of pbes in the future four primary issues should be considered 1 the pyrite mass current density ratio of the pbes should be optimized 2 the mass transfer rate should be increased and the detailed information about the electron transfer mechanism in pbes needs to be elucidated 3 the influence of coexisted pollutants should be investigated 4 the energy efficiency should be evaluated and the feasibility of the combination of pbes with the renewable energy technologies such as sun light wind should be further explored 4 conclusions in summary the most satisfied nitrate removal efficiency 94 48 1 91 with lowest nitrite accumulation 1 50 0 26 mg l was obtained when current density was 0 10 ma cm2 nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase activities both reached the maximum values at 0 10 ma cm2 pyrite oxidizing denitrification exhibited a larger contribution for nitrate removal than hydrogenotrophic denitrification in the pbes current density significantly affected the bacterial diversity and community structure azoarcus may greatly contribute to nitrate removal via hydrogenotrophic denitrification and pyrite oxidizing

13419,a lab scale system pbes combined electrolysis hydrogenotrophic denitrification and pyrite oxidizing denitrification was established to evaluate the effect of current density on nitrate removal performance and community dynamics results indicated that the optimal no3 n removal efficiency with lowest no2 n accumulation was obtained when current density was 0 10 ma cm2 a higher current density did not promote no3 n removal the activities of nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase in both the cathode biofilm and pyrite biofilm showed similar variation trend with that of no3 n removal the estimated contribution of hydrogenotrophic denitrification 23 77 43 53 was lower than that of pyrite oxidizing denitrification 58 19 76 23 in the pbes illumina miseq sequencing indicated that microbial diversity of cathode biofilm increased with current density increased from 0 05 to 0 10 ma cm2 then ceased to increase at a higher current density whereas the microbial diversity of pyrite biofilm continuously increased along with increased current density azoarcus may be the key player for nitrate removal in both cathode and pyrite biofilms our results can provide useful information to improve pbes designs for the future applications keywords hydrogenotrophic denitrification pyrite oxidizing denitrification nitrate removal current density azoarcus 1 introduction many industries such as explosive and fertilizer manufacturing discharge highly concentrated nitrate contaminated wastewaters to the environment 1 the excessive presence of nitrate in natural waters may pose serious environmental problems and health risks 2 in many countries industries are enforced to treat their wastewater to comply with the corresponding environmental standards thus the selection of cost effective treatment method for the nitrate contaminated wastewater is an important topic and has been widely studied in recent years biological denitrification is considered to be an efficient and low cost way for converting the nitrate and nitrite to harmless n2 in the anoxic environment 3 4 in our previous study a pyrite oxidizing bioelectrochemical system pbes was established to treat the wastewater containing nitrate nitrogen no3 n from 100 to 400 mg l the final product was n2 5 instead of poised potential to the cathode the pbes was powered by a dc power supply which is considered more suitable for practical applications 6 7 the main idea of building such system is that the pyrite oxidizing process generates less sulfate in comparison with sulfur oxidizing process when reducing the same amount of no3 n 8 moreover electrochemically induced hydrogenotrophic denitrification process can cover the consumed alkalinity by pyrite oxidizing process the external power supply is the key to regulate the system ph and accelerate the reaction rate those are hard to be controlled in conventional pyrite based denitrification system 9 10 however the effect of current density on the nitrate removal performance of pbes is still unknown which is essential for future scale up several previous studies have demonstrated that the microbial denitrifying performance could be stimulated by the increased current density 11 12 the possible mechanism is that the electrical current stimulates the growth and enzyme activity of the bacteria at a specific range 13 14 however there are also conflicting studies that have shown increased current density did not benefit denitrification for instance wei et al found that when the biomass from a membrane bioreactor mbr was subjected to constant direct current the percentage of live cell decreased by 10 15 and 29 at current density of 6 2 12 3 and 24 7 a m2 respectively 15 current density may also affect the structure of microbial community zhang et al found that acidovorax and bradyrhizobium possessed higher abundances in the denitrifying microbial community when the current density was increased 16 xia et al investigated the dynamic response of denitrifying community to current density in a biofilm electrode reactor and found that the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria decreased from 45 6 to 23 5 with the increased current density from 0 to 166 7 a m3 net cathodic compartment 17 nevertheless there are also some reports revealed that the dominant bacteria may not be affected by the electrode potential for example pous et al found that geobacter was predominant in the biofilm of a bioelectrochemical system operated at both bioanodic acetate as an electron donor 397 mv vs she and biocathodic conditions nitrate as an electron acceptor 303 mv vs she 18 however there is very little dynamic information about the response of core denitrifying microbial community in pyrite oxidizing bioelectrochmical system to current density variation in this study we aimed to investigate the effect of electrical current density on nitrate removal in pbes the dynamics of biomass amount nitrate nitrite metabolism enzyme activity and microbial community in response to current density were also examined the results of this study have important implication for future combination of the denitrification process with renewable energy technologies since the current densities of electricity generated from renewable energy sun light wind etc vary widely 19 2 materials and methods 2 1 pbes start up the pbes was constructed according to our previous study 5 the system was made by a cylindrical column with a volume of 2 3 l diameter 9 8 cm height 30 cm fig s1 a graphite rod anode diameter of 8 mm purchased from leqing graphite rod co ltd china was set in the center of the column and a piece of carbon fiber felt cathode purchased from haining anjie composite material co ltd china was

anaerobic tank of jiangxinzhou wastewater treatment plant nanjing china firstly the activated sludge was anaerobically incubated with 1 l of synthetic no3 n containing wastewater bubbled with n2 for 30 min for 30 days around 50 of wastewater was replaced every 5 days the synthetic wastewater composed of ch3coo c 200 mg l no3 n 100 mg hco3 80 mg mgcl2 0 50 mg zncl2 0 50 mg cocl2 0 50 mg mnso4 0 30

acclimation and the ph was around 7 4 no nh4 n was detected in the system thereafter the acclimated activated sludge slurry 100 ml mlss 3 36 g l together with synthetic wastewater without ch3coo c were seeded into the pbes the inoculant was incubated under fed batch mode for 21 days to enhance attachment and acclimation of the biofilm the current density was maintained at 0 05 ma cm2 80 v v of synthetic wastewater was changed when more than 80 of no3 n was removed from the reactor after three feeding cycles the reactor was operated as continuous up flow mode as described below 2 2 effect of current density on denitrification performance of pbes after start up the reactor was operated as continuous up flow mode the influent synthetic wastewater without ch3coo c was pumped into the reactor by a peristaltic pump bt100 2 j longer china at a flow rate of 2 56 ml min hrt 7 5 h from the bottom which went through the pbes and then discharged from the upper outlet the current density was also maintained at 0 05 ma cm2 the pbes reactor was operated in four stages with current density of 0 05 ma cm2 day 1 20 0 10 ma cm2 day 21 40 0 20 ma cm2 day 41 60 and 0 30 ma cm2 day 61 80 respectively the no3 n no2 n n2o so4 2 and ph were measured to evaluate the no3 n removal efficiency the experiments were conducted in triplicates and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation 2 3 biofilm sampling and microbial community analysis biofilm samples were taken at the last day of different operation phases six biofilm samples were collected from the cathode surface and pyrite surface at different current densities 0 05 ma cm2 0 10 ma cm2 and 0 30 ma cm2 for high throughput sequencing each sample was a mixture of randomly collected biofilm from different heights of the reactor from top to bottom sample c1 cathode biofilm 0 05 ma cm2 condition sample c2 cathode biofilm 0 10 ma cm2 condition sample c3 cathode biofilm 0 30 ma cm2 condition sample p1 pyrite biofilm 0 05

using an agilent gas chromatograph 7890b usa with n2 as the carrier gas as described by liu et al 21 hydrogen gas concentration was analyzed via gas chromatograph gc 2030 test instrument china equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a stainless steel column tdx 01 the dissolved n2o and hydrogen concentrations in the liquid were calculated using henry s law at 25 c the detailed measurements of n2o gas and hydrogen gas in the pbes were described in supplementary materials the attached biomass amount on the cathode and pyrite were measured by drying carriers cathode and pyrite and weighing constant weight 105 c for 12 h before and after biofilm removal by 2 m h2so4 the nitrate reductase nr and nitrite reductase nir activities were measured according to the methods described in our previous study 22 the contribution of pyrite oxidizing autotrophic denitrification to nitrate removal eq 1 was estimated based on the so4 2 production this estimation excluded the nitrate removal caused by reaction intermediates e g s0 s4 produced from the oxidation of pyrite s1 to so4 2 and the rest of nitrate removal was assumed as the hydrogenotrophic denitrification the equations

discussion 3 1 effect of current density on denitrification performance of pbes the effluent concentrations of no3 n no2 n so4 2 and ph in the pbes under different current densities are shown in fig 1 it was noted that no3 n removal efficiency differed significantly between 0 05 ma cm2 and 0 10 ma cm2 current density fig 1a when the current density was 0 05 ma cm2 40 11 1 75 mg l of no3 n and 9 65 1 33 mg l of no2 n were present in the effluent and the no3 n removal efficiency was approximately 58 32 2 51 when the current density was increased to 0 10 ma cm2 5 22 0 36 mg l of no3 n and 1 50 0 26 mg l of no2 n was left in the effluent and the no3 n removal efficiency was approached to 94 48 1 91 however further increase of current density to 0 20 and 0 30 ma cm2 did not significantly influence the no3 n removal efficiency 95 27 3 76 and 91 15 1 03 at 0 20 and 0 30 ma cm2 4 52 0 89 and 8 33 0 52 mg l of no3 n 3 05 0 24 and 4 91 0 73 mg l of no2 n remained in the effluent of pbes n2o n production accounted for less than 0 3 of the mass of no3 n denitrified under all conditions fig s2 while the estimated hydrogen amounts containing hydrogen gas and dissolved hydrogen per hrt were 9 48 23 58 65 86 and 69 76 mg at current density of 0 05 0 10 0 20 and 0 30 ma cm2 respectively these observations are consisted with a previous research that has shown the highest nitrate removal efficiency was achieved at an optimal current density of 0 03 ma cm2 further increased the current density did not increase nitrate removal efficiency probably because of the hydrogen inhibition 23 as shown in fig 1b the so4 2 concentration in effluent was 195 67 15 67 mg l when the current density was 0 05 ma cm2 which increased to 231 28 23 93 mg l along with the increase of current density to 0 10 ma cm2 this indicates that the pyrite oxidizing denitrification capacity may be enhanced by increasing the current density 0 10 ma cm2 proper dc current may be important to the bacterial activity jackman et al also reported that proper dc current increased the acidification rate due to the stimulation of metabolic processes and biofilms formation 24 however similar with the variation trend of nitrate removal efficiency there was no further increase of the so4 2 concentration when the current density was further increased to 0 20 and 0 30 ma cm2 the possible explanation might be that the relatively high current density 0 10 ma cm2 disrupted the cell walls and membranes therefore deteriorated the bacterial activity 15 25 26 the ph is an important factor which affects the performance of biocathodic denitrification 27 fig 1c shows the variations of ph in the pbes at a constant influent ph condition 7 0 the effluent ph was 7 39 0 15 at current density of 0 05 ma cm2 which was increased when the current density increased to 0 10 ma cm2 the raised ph may due to the improved activity of hydrogenotrophic denitrification when current density was increased however the effluent ph remained comparatively stable when the current density was further increased to 0 20 and 0 30 ma cm2 suggesting that excessive evolution of hydrogen caused by larger current density may not significantly enhance the hydrogenotrophic denitrification performance probably because of the hydrogen inhibition 23 28 these results were corroborated by the nitrate removal efficiency results that the current density of 0 20 and 0 30 ma cm2 did not enhance the nitrate removal performance compared with that of 0 10 ma cm2 in addition the ph values ranging from 7 0 to 8 2 under all conditions were close to the reported optimal ph 7 50 for cathodic denitrification 29 this might be one of the reason for the insignificant n2o accumulation in pbes overall the current density may affect the microbial activity of both pyrite oxidizing denitrifier and hydrogenotrophic denitrifier in the pbes indicating that a proper current density is of great importance for regulating the microbial denitrification activity in the pbes 3 2 effect of current density on biomass amount and nitrate nitrite metabolism enzyme activity of pbes the biomass amount and nitrate nitrite metabolism enzyme activity of the cathode biofilm and pyrite biofilm under different current densities were measured figs 2 and 3 as shown in fig 2 the biomass amount of the cathode biofilm significantly increased from 34 55 4 21 to 85 37 2 66 mg g when current density increased from 0 05 to 0 10 ma cm2 and then decreased when current density was further increased this suggests that the current density 0 10 ma cm2 stimulated cathodic bacteria to grow when the current density was more than 0 10 ma cm2 some bacteria may die and resulted in decreased biomass of the cathode biofilm 30 in contrast the biomass amount of the pyrite biofilm showed insignificant variation with changing the current density the activities of nitrate reductase nr and nitrite reductase nir can indicate the microbial denitrification activity 31 fig 3 displays the nr and nir activities of cathode biofilm and pyrite biofilm under different current densities nr of the cathode biofilm increased from 0 03 0 01 to 0 09 0 02 μmol nitrite production min mg protein with current density increased from 0 05 to 0 10 ma cm2 and then decreased to 0 06 0 01 and 0 05 0 01 μmol nitrite production min mg protein at current density of 0 20 and 0 30 ma cm2 nr of the pyrite biofilm showed similar trends with that of the cathode biofilm these results are in accordance with the no3 n removal efficiency in the pbes under different current densities fig 1a when the current density increased from 0 05 to 0 10 ma cm2 nir of the cathode biofilm and pyrite biofilm showed similar variations with nr nir reached the maximum of 0 24 0 02 and 0 28 0 01 μmol nitrite reduction min mg protein of the cathode biofilm and pyrite biofilm at 0 10 ma cm2 this is also consistent with the no2 n accumulation degrees in the pbes fig 1a 3 3 the contribution of pyrite oxidizing and hydrogenotrophic denitrification to nitrate removal under different current densities fig 4 shows the relative contributions of pyrite oxidizing denitrification and hydrogenotrophic denitrification to no3 n removal under different current densities the estimated contribution of pyrite oxidizing autotrophic denitrification to nitrate removal was 76 23 56 60 56 47 and 58 19 at current density of 0 05 0 10 0 20 and 0 30 ma cm2 based on eq 5 the contribution of hydrogenotrophic denitrification was 23 77 43 40 43 53 and 41 81 at current density of 0 05 0 10 0 20 and 0 30 ma cm2 respectively the theoretical no3 n removal amounts per hrt were 21 06 52 38 146 31 and 154 97 mg no3 n based on the measured amount of produced hydrogen according to eq 2 the theoretical values of no3 n removal at 0 05 and 0 10 ma cm2 were lower than those of the estimated hydrogenotrophic denitrification values obtained from eq 5 27 17 and 80 37 mg no3 n the rest part could be attributed to the nitrate assimilation for biomass growth at 0 05 and 0 10 ma cm2 this is consistent with the increased cathode biofilm biomass at 0 10 ma cm2 fig 2 the ratios of hydrogenotrophic denitrification and pyrite oxidizing denitrification were not much difference with current density increased from 0 10 to 0 30 ma cm2 this may be ascribed to the electrical inhibition of both hydrogenotrophic and pyrite oxidizing denitrification as the biomass amount and nitrate nitrite metabolism enzyme activity of cathode biofilm and the nitrite metabolism enzyme activity of pyrite biofilm were all decreased along with the increased current density figs 2 and 3 thus although the h2 amount was increased with the increased current density it would not be utilized due to the electrical inhibition of bacteria activity furthermore the contribution of hydrogenotrophic denitrification was lower than that of the pyrite oxidizing denitrification for all conditions this is not consistent with wang et al who found that the percentage of sulfur autotrophic denitrification part was lower than that of hydrogenotrophic denitrification part in their combined autotrophic denitrification system 32 probably because the functional microbes in the pbes were different from that study and the ratio of pyrite mass current density in the pbes was larger than that study of sulfur mass current density ratio 3 4 response of microbial community the high throughput sequencing was used to analyze the dynamics of microbial community structure a total of 264 253 effective sequence reads were obtained from all biofilm samples after filtering out the low quality reads and trimming the adapters and barcodes the sequences were further clustered into 2032 otus of bacteria the rarefaction curves of bacteria for each biofilm sample tended to approach the saturation plateau fig s1 indicating that a reasonable number of individual sample was taken and the data could sufficiently show the diﬀ erences in the species diversity among diﬀ erent samples the estimators representing the community richness and alpha diversity were listed in table 1 sobs ace and chao representing the richness of the community their values increased with current density increased from 0 05 to 0 10 ma cm2 but decreased when current density further increased to 0 30 ma cm2 irrespective of the cathode biofilm or pyrite biofilm the shannon value and simpson value have opposite relationships with respect to alpha diversity of the community shannon value was continuously increased when current density increased from 0 05 to 0 30 ma cm2 for the pyrite biofilm whereas for the cathode biofilm the shannon value was increased when current density increased from 0 05 to 0 10 ma cm2 but decreased at current density of 0 30 ma cm2 similar observation by feng et al who reported that electric acclimation caused an obvious decrease of the species richness and diversity in microbial community on the particle electrodes zeolite and granular activated carbon 33 in another report the richness of microbial community increased when the current intensity increased from 0 25 to 0 35 a and then decreased at 0 40 a 34 a taxonomic classification of community in the pbes at genus level in biofilm samples under different current densities is shown in fig s4 and the key microbes are listed in fig 5 azoarcus thauera and unclassified f rhodobacteraceae were the most dominant genera in both cathode biofilm and pyrite biofilm azoarcus have been observed in both hydrogenotrophic and sulfide oxidizing denitrifying communities 35 36 with the highest relative abundances in the cathode biofilm 27 06 and pyrite biofilm 24 80 at current density of 0 10 ma cm2 which may be the key contributor for the larger no3 n removal efficiency at this current density than 0 05 or 0 30 ma cm2 fig 1a thauera also have been identified as autotrophic denitrifier which could reduce nitrate to nitrogen gas using hydrogen and hs as electron donors 37 38 with higher relative abundance at current density of 0 30 ma cm2 than 0 05 and 0 10 ma cm2 in both cathode biofilm 19 54 in c1 3 48 in c2 and 25 27 in c3 and pyrite biofilm 8 29 in p1 7 39 in p2 and 20 14 in p3 which may exhibit tolerance to higher dc current stress in the pbes in addition the family rhodobacteraceae contained the groups with the ability to carry out key steps in the denitrification pathway 39 however no classified genus was identified in the communities of the biofilm samples hyphomonas a dimophic prosthecate which might play an important role for the cathode biofilm formation 8 38 in c1 1 17 in c2 and 10 70 in c3 40 paracoccus was reported to be capable of hydrogenotrophic denitrification 41 was also present in the cathode biofilm 2 91 in c1 1 98 in c2 and 1 51 in c3 thiobacillus 2 92 in p1 5 34 in p2 and 12 40 in p3 and pseudomonas 2 92 in p1 1 82 in p2 and 5 19 in p3 were reported to use pyrite as electron donor for denitrification were detected in the pyrite biofilm with low relative abundances 42 43 which also contributed to no3 n removal through pyrite oxidizing process in the pbes the function genes analyses were carried out through picrust2 predication following the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database the total abundances of denitrification associated genes in cathode biofilm and pyrite biofilm increased from 0 61 to 0 76 with current density increased from 0 05 to 0 10 ma cm2 while no further increase 0 72 was observed at current density of 0 30 ma cm2 table s1 which is in accordance with the no3 n removal efficiency fig 1 and the enzyme activity results fig 3 moreover the abundance of denitrification associated genes in pyrite biofilm was higher than that in cathode biofilm 0 39 0 42 vs 0 22 0 34 which was consistent with the results that the higher contribution of pyrite oxidizing denitrification than hydrogenotrophic denitrification in pbes fig 4 the total abundances of cytochrome c associated genes and quinone associated genes in pyrite biofilm and cathode biofilm ranged from 1 96 to 2 25 and 1 43 to 1 69 respectively with changing the current density the highest abundances were all observed at current density of 0 10 ma cm2 which is in accordance with the result that the optimal denitrification efficiency of pbes was obtained at 0 10 ma cm2 the membrane bound electron carriers cytochrome c and quinone were recognized as crucial components for extracellular electron transfer eet between bacteria and solid phase metal oxides electrode 10 44 this indicates that eet may be an important pathway for microbial pyrite oxidization and the cathodic biofilm may also have ability to perform direct eet from electrode without using h2 as mediator at 0 10 ma cm2 current density 3 5 future outlook understanding the regulation mechanism of current density is required to bring electrochemically assisted denitrifying bioreactor on a large scale as it is a promising low carbon consumed technology for the nitrate removal in the present study we found that the increased current density may not always enhance the nitrate removal performance and the activity of pyrite oxidizing denitrification was outcompeted to the hydrogenotrophic denitrification at all current density conditions although the ph values in the system were relatively stable over all operation phases the results of this study provided useful information for applying the pbes for real nitrate contaminated wastewater treatment for successful scale up of pbes in the future four primary issues should be considered 1 the pyrite mass current density ratio of the pbes should be optimized 2 the mass transfer rate should be increased and the detailed information about the electron transfer mechanism in pbes needs to be elucidated 3 the influence of coexisted pollutants should be investigated 4 the energy efficiency should be evaluated and the feasibility of the combination of pbes with the renewable energy technologies such as sun light wind should be further explored 4 conclusions in summary the most satisfied nitrate removal efficiency 94 48 1 91 with lowest nitrite accumulation 1 50 0 26 mg l was obtained when current density was 0 10 ma cm2 nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase activities both reached the maximum values at 0 10 ma cm2 pyrite oxidizing denitrification exhibited a larger contribution for nitrate removal than hydrogenotrophic denitrification in the pbes current density significantly affected the bacterial diversity and community structure azoarcus may greatly contribute to nitrate removal via hydrogenotrophic denitrification and pyrite oxidizing
