15475,anammox as a promising biological nitrogen removal technology has attracted much attention however cold temperature would limit its wide application and little is known about the microbial interactions between anammox bacteria anaob and heterotrophic bacteria at cold temperature here we observed reduced temperature 25 15 c promoted the secretion of eps and thus stimulated bigger size of granular sludge in a laboratory scale anammox reactor we further combined co occurrence network analysis and genome centered metagenomics to explore the potential interactions between anaob and heterotrophic bacteria network analysis suggested 22 out of 25 positively related species were reported as definite heterotrophic bacteria in subnetwork of anaob genome centered metagenomics analysis yielded 23 metagenomic assembly genomes mags and we found that acidobacteriota affiliated bacteria could biosynthesize most polysaccharides ps precursors and contain the most glycosyltransferases and transporters to facilitate exopolysaccharides biosynthesis together with partial ps precursors produced by anaob amx1 as the only anammox genome could synthesize most amino acids and cross feed with some heterotrophs to affect the extracellular protein function additionally bacteroidota planctomycetota chloroflexota and proteobacteria could contribute folate and molybdopterin cofactor for amx1 to benefit their activity and growth superphylum patescibacteria could survive by cross feeding with anaob and heterotrophic organisms about organic compounds glyceraldehyde 3p and lactate these cross feedings maintained the stability of anammox reactor performance and emphasize the importance of heterotrophs in anammox system at reduced temperature graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reduced temperature anammox bacteria heterotrophic bacteria co occurrence network metabolism interaction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anammox is a promising biological nitrogen removal process developed in recent years owing to its energy efficient advantages chen et al 2021a while the temperature of domestic and industrial wastewater could reduce to 5 15 c at higher latitudes or in hilly regions huang et al 2015 much lower than the optimum processing temperature of anammox bacteria anaob and other symbiotic bacteria 20 35 c zha et al 2020 previous studies have reported that temperatures below 15 c could severely inhibit nitrogen removal capacity in various anammox systems guo et al 2015 yang et al 2021a zhu et al 2017 to broaden the application of anammox it is important to understand how to achieve high nitrogen removal efficiency at low temperatures notably the abundant and active anaob have been detected in sediments of the southern north sea in winter 10 c indicating the possibility of stable nitrogen removal under cold temperatures for wastewater treatment lotti et al 2014 the nitrogen removal in anammox process relies on the activity of anammox consortia and their synergistic microbe1s besides anaob some heterotrophic bacteria affiliated with proteobacteria bacteroidota and chloroflexota were found to be abundant in various anammox based systems guo et al 2022 he et al 2018 ishimoto et al 2021 li et al 2018 chen et al 2020 found the potential synergistic mechanism between anaob and heterotrophic bacteria based on the consistent variation of candidatus brocadias and denitratisoma abundance the co occurrence network analysis further demonstrated the significant positive correlations between anaob and denitratisoma su et al 2022 the excellent nitrogen removal efficiency might be inseparable from the cooperation of anaob with heterotrophic bacteria through substrate or metabolic cross feeding a few researchers recently built a genome based ecological model of the microbial community using metagenomics analysis to reveal the potential cross feeding in anammox consortia speth et al 2016 speculated that species affiliated to phyla chlorobi and acidobacteriota as heterotrophic denitrifiers encoding the function of nitrate reductase could utilize nitrate generated from anaob growth and the nitrite reduced from nitrate could be reused by anaob so this process was considered as a nitrogen related cross feeding further study implicated the chlorobi species as protein degraders could liberate the amino acids in extracellular polymeric substance eps matrix for themselves or other heterotrophic bacteria and these costly but necessary amino acids were offered by anaob lawson et al 2017 in addition a recent genome centered metagenomic study revealed that proteobacteria and armatimonadota organisms could contribute folate and molybdopterin cofactor moco for anaob to conduct central carbon metabolism zhao et al 2018 despite some metabolic cross feeding has been discussed in anammox communities for example in the start up phase of anammox system whether the metabolic network at cold temperature is consistent and whether more cross feedings exist remain poorly understood in this study a uasb was operated for 250 days with the temperature decreasing from 30 c to 25 20 15 and 5 c dividing into five phases sludge biosamples were taken at the end of each phase and analyzed using 16s rrna gene sequencing and metagenomic sequencing combined with binning analysis the variations of system performance sludge characteristics as well as community structure and co occurrence network of anammox microbial community were investigated the abundance variations of genes related to nitrogen and carbohydrate metabolism as well as the heterotrophic bacteria possessing the functions of cross feeding with anaob about nitrogen and carbohydrate metabolism eps secretion and secondary metabolite during cooling process were investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor operation the anammox seed sludge taken from a long term running uasb anammox reactor was inoculated into a 0 5 l uasb reactor the influent was synthetic wastewater in mg l nh4cl 100 nano2 132 nahco3 1250 mgso4 7h2o 300 kh2po4 10 and cacl2 5 6 the trace elements were the same as reported in a previous study ya et al 2021 the nitrogen loading rate nlr was about 2 97 0 13 kg n m3 d according to the temperature i e 30 25 20 15 5 c the entire cooling process could be divided into five phases phase a 1 46 d phase b 47 92 d phase c 93 139 d phase d 140 187 d and phase e 188 250 d 2 2 physico chemical analysis methods water samples were taken once every two days to determine the concentrations of ammonia nitrite and nitrate according to gilcreas 2012 mlss and mlvss were measured every 15 days three fractions of eps including soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were analyzed using a modified heat method li and yang 2007 polysaccharides ps and protein pn are the main components of eps ps was measured using the anthrone h2so4 method with glucose as the standard miao et al 2018 and pn was analyzed using lowry method with bovine serum albumin as the standard zhang et al 2011 anammox granular sludge angs size analysis was conducted by a professional particle size analysis software nano measurer 1 2 through importing angs picture canon eos r6 and manual labeling and the detailed process was shown in text s1 the specific anammox activity saa is an important indicator to evaluate the anammox activity of anaob in a reactor and the determination method of saa was shown in text s2 according to chen et al 2016 the angs characteristics such as particle size eps content saa etc were determined at the end of each stage 2 3 microbial community metagenomics combined with binning analysis the granular sludge biomasses were sampled from the reactor for eight consecutive days at the end of each phase these biosamples were cryopreserved at 20 c until dna extraction dna extraction was then performed using the fastdna spin kit for soil omega bio tek norcross ga u s according to the manufacturer s instructions next polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification was accomplished with primers 338f and 806r finally high throughput sequencing was performed at illumina miseq pe300 platform in majorbio co ltd shanghai china the quality filtering of the original sequence was described earlier wang et al 2017 the amplicon sequence variants asvs were obtained by using qiime2 with dada2 plugin bolyen et al 2019 callahan et al 2016 without imposing the arbitrary dissimilarity thresholds that define operational taxonomic units otus the raw data of sequencing was available in the ncbi short read archive under prjna842194 for metagenomic sequencing ezna soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s were used for total genomic dna extraction according to manufacturer s instructions the shotgun sequencing was performed using illumina hiseq 4000 platform original sequencing data could be found under prjna845941 on the website of the ncbi the raw data were trimmed length 50 bp or with a quality value 20 or having n bases by fastp https github com opengene fastp v0 20 0 chen et al 2018 then metagenomics data were assembled using megahit v1 1 3 and the contigs with the length 300 bp were selected as the final assembling result the assembled contigs were binned using metabat v2 12 1 to obtain metagenomic assembly genomes mags and checkm was used to evaluate the completeness and contamination level of mags 23 mags have been submitted to ncbi and the biosample accession numbers was summarized in table s1 next the species annotations of mags were obtained through gtdb tk v1 7 0 based on genome taxonomy database gtdb r202 the open reading frames orfs of each contig as well as mag were predicted using metagene http metagene cb k u tokyo ac jp noguchi et al 2006 functional annotations were conducted using diamond http www diamondsearch org index php version 0 8 35 buchfink et al 2015 against non supervised orthologous groups eggnog and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg databases with an e value cutoff of 1e 5 and the outputs were further filtered using identity 70 and alignment length 25 aa as the blastp results according to previous studies guo et al 2017 yang et al 2014 yang et al 2019 ani was calculated using the software jspecies1 2 1 for ani analysis 2 4 statistical analysis and network construction the analytical method of icamp was used to quantitatively infer community assembly mechanisms by phylogenetic bin based null model ning et al 2020 and the procedure of icamp was described in text s3 and the whole process of molecular ecological network analysis mena was consistent with our previous study ya et al 2021 these networks were visualized using cytoscape 3 6 1 and were accordingly named net 30 c net 25 c net 20 c net 15 c and net 5 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 system performance after the start up stage the uasb reactor was operated for 250 days with an average nlr of 2 97 0 13 kg n m3 d the average effluent concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n were 5 71 2 73 mg l and 2 84 1 37 mg l with removal efficiencies of 94 38 2 63 and 97 69 1 14 respectively under 30 15 c supplementary fig s1 however the saa gradually decreased from 22 63 to 7 82 mg no2 n g vss d under gradient cooling process of 30 15 c table s2 when under 5 c nh4 n and no2 n removal efficiencies rapidly declined to 78 64 9 10 and 84 28 9 46 which led to poor nitrogen removal performance but did not cause system collapse since the average ratios of δno2 n nh4 n and δno3 n nh4 n were very close to the anammox reaction stoichiometry of 1 32 and 0 26 table s3 besides the saa slightly increased to 10 54 mg no2 n g vss d under 5 c indicating the adaptation of system when exposed to cold temperature 3 2 variation of angs size and eps angs size is indicative of the performance of anammox system and could greatly influence the settleability of anammox granules adams et al 2020 as shown in fig 1 a when system temperature gradually decreased from 30 to 5 c the average diameters of angs at 25 5 c were significantly larger than 30 c p 0 05 since the average diameter of angs increased to 1 7 mm under 25 c and then declined to 1 5 mm under 5 c but still larger than the initial angs size 1 26 mm 30 c indicating that cold temperature could promote anaob aggregation he et al 2018 besides fig 1a reflected anaob was inclined to form medium size angs since 45 75 50 09 angs had a diameter between 0 8 and 1 6 mm in each phase which was in line with a previous study chen et al 2021b also the proportion of bigger particle size 1 6 5 6 mm under 25 5 c was larger than the initial inoculation diameter which was advantageous to avoid the biomass washout and could maintain the stability of anammox system eps functioned as the binder between microorganisms and contributed to a better aggregation of angs and thus the dynamics variation of eps content could lead to the variation of angs particle size hou et al 2015 in this study the eps contents at 25 15 c were significantly larger than 30 c p 0 05 so 25 15 c promoted the eps secretion and thus stimulated the particle sizes fig 1 the peak value of eps concentration was observed under 25 c reaching 32 03 mg g 1 vss and then it gradually decreased and eventually dropped to the lowest 15 95 mg g 1 vss at 5 c which weakened the resistance of angs system against low temperature and inevitably led to poor performance in addition the variation trends of three eps fractions including s eps lb eps and tb eps were different tb eps as the major component of eps ranged from 14 55 to 30 92 mg g 1 vss accounting for over 87 57 of the total eps and tb eps with gel like property could tightly bound to the cell surface and played an important role for flocculation yuan et al 2014 moreover pn conducive to the formation of granules is in the inner layer of granules while polysaccharides ps essential for the stability of granules is in the outer layer of granules rusanowska et al 2019 zhu et al 2018 in our study the content of ps was 3 06 5 91 mg g 1 vss whereas pn varied widely from 10 04 to 27 05 mg g 1 vss under 30 5 c more pn content was detected below 30 c except 5 c indicating that pn excretion was the potential strategy to cope with low temperatures disturbance while the sudden drop of pn content at 5 c might have negative effect on angs stability resulting in a slight decrease of system performance these results elucidated that the reduced temperature could regulate the secretion of eps by anammox consortia and thus stimulate the aggregation of angs to resist cold temperature perturbation even under 5 c 3 3 microbial shift driven by declining temperature 3 3 1 community structure shift a total of 865 asvs were defined from 20 241 high quality 16s rrna gene sequences without imposing the arbitrary dissimilarity thresholds the abundance and structure of bacterial community during temperature declining process were identified the peak values of sobs and shannon indexes were observed under 25 c and 20 c respectively and it indicated that low temperature stimulated the bacterial richness and diversity table s4 the most abundant phyla were classified into planctomycetota 32 77 19 14 55 asvs chloroflexi 30 72 21 31 228 asvs proteobacteria 18 29 33 51 207asvs bacteroidota 6 91 5 25 73 asvs and actinobacteriota 2 85 4 22 65 asvs supplementary fig s2 at genus level the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia 31 59 17 56 and o sbr1031 26 05 16 70 decreased with temperature declining and candidatus kuenenia abundance slightly recovered to 25 48 at 5 c while the relative abundance of denitratisoma 8 88 23 49 and c chitinivibrionia 1 66 5 01 showed the opposite trend candidatus kuenenia is a canonical anaob and the metabolism of o sbr1031 is related to organic degradation wang et al 2018a denitratisoma is considered as a denitrifier and could collaborate with anaob for nitrogen removal in anammox reactor but the function of c chitinivibrionia is unclear chen et al 2020 3 3 2 community assembly shift icamp provided insights into the potential roles of various ecological processes forces in the phylogenetic community dynamics of bacterial communities fig 2 in fact the average relative importance of homogeneous selection hos and drift dr were 35 60 53 49 and 42 57 61 51 which were more important than other processes in anammox consortia assembly similar result was also found in studying the effects of warming on grassland bacterial community assembly ning et al 2020 the contribution of hos below 30 c sharply increased and peaked at 25 c with 53 49 driving the assembly of anammox consortia niederdorfer et al 2021 accordingly dr 42 57 reached the lowest value at 25 c other processes owned relatively low importance 3 10 besides hos and heterogeneous selection hes belong to determinism and homogenizing dispersal hd dispersal limitation dl and dr belong to stochasticity obviously 25 5 c temperature increased the deterministic processes and the determinism became dominant 53 69 especially at 25 c after exposing to 20 5 c stochastic processes regained the dominance 51 85 54 77 but still far below the value at 30 c 64 28 the variation trend of deterministic processes is consistent with the trend of α diversity average particle size as well as total eps secretion 3 3 3 co occurrence networks shift in view of the cold temperature effect network analysis was performed to elucidate the variation of potential biotic interactions in anammox consortia the resulting networks consisted of 186 to 212 nodes and 270 to 342 links with an average degree from 2 903 to 3 227 fig 3 table s5 the increase of the network links nodes and average degree at 25 15 c suggested that a certain range of cooling promoted the network size and complexity however net 5 c owned the fewest nodes and links and the smallest average degree average clustering coefficient as well as the largest average path distance and modularity indicating the simplest and most loose network at 5 c supplementary fig s3 unlike the microbial community the majority of nodes in all five networks were related to chloroflexi 26 09 28 64 and proteobacteria 25 47 28 64 and only 3 77 6 76 nodes belonged to planctomycetota supplementary fig s4 indicative of the important role of heterotrophic bacteria in anammox consortia network we further focused on the relationships between anaob including candidatus kuenenia candidatus brocadia and sm1a02 and their first neighbors fig 4 obviously the anaob subnetworks displayed more intensive interactions at cold temperature especially at 5 c since there were 8 12 13 13 and 17 closest neighbors corresponding to temperature of 30 25 20 15 and 5 c respectively simultaneously 25 15 c temperature stimulated the cooperation between anaob and heterotrophic species as there were 4 6 5 7 and 3 positive links under declining temperature and 22 out of 25 positively related species were reported as definite heterotrophic bacteria such as denitratisoma asv395 truepera asv1371 responsible for denitrification chen et al 2020 yin et al 2019 and sva0996 marine group asv997 haliangium asv551 comamonas asv210 norank o sbr1031 asvs 877 918 785 854 and 831 ignavibacterium asv533 anaerolineaceae asv927 etc involved in the biodegradation of organic compounds ivanova et al 2010 miao et al 2016 wang et al 2018a 2018b wu et al 2018 yang et al 2020 the symbiotic effect between above mentioned microorganisms reflected that the inter species cooperation might promote the resistance of anammox system when exposed to reduced temperature 25 15 c while anaob possessing the most competitive relationships 81 82 with heterotrophic bacteria at 5 c might lead to the slight reduction of nitrogen removal capacity the putative keystone taxa were recognized in the light of the zi within module connectivity and pi among module connectivity values supplementary fig s5a more keystone taxa were detected under cold temperatures since there were 3 3 6 6 and 4 asvs identified as keystone taxa across five networks these 21 keystone taxa were derived from 8 phyla and the relative abundance of these species were below 1 03 table s6 supplementary fig s5b c the abundance of taxa might not be directly related to taxon importance so the above rare species might play vital function in maintaining the structure stability of anammox microbial networks manoeli et al 2014 shi et al 2016 it was also worth noticing that 17 out of 21 keystone taxa were considered as heterotrophic bacteria and involved in denitrification and biodegradation of organic compounds which further emphasized the irreplaceable role of heterotrophic bacteria in anammox microbial community 3 4 microbial metabolic network analysis metagenomic sequencing from five angs biosamples yielded a total of 555 299 062 reads after quality control co assembly of these clean reads approximately generated 355 758 523 398 contigs with n50 of 1570 1926 bp contigs were subsequently binned into microbial genomes and 23 draft mags completeness 50 contamination 10 were recovered from all the five biosamples these genomes were affiliated with the phyla chloroflexota patescibacteria planctomycetota bacteroidota armatimonadota proteobacteria acidobacteriota and sumerlaeotas table s7 the sequences of whole community dna were compared to eggnog database to acquire functional annotations under gradual cooling conditions fig 5 a cogs cluster of orthologous groups related to replication recombination and repair were 9 02 8 66 8 30 7 79 and 8 33 respectively corresponding to 30 5 c and displayed a reduction below 30 c indicating the inhibition of bacteria proliferation and genetic stability under 25 5 c temperature which was consistent with the findings of soil microbiome at cold temperature bao et al 2021 on the contrary it could be seen that cold temperature stimulated most metabolic pathways especially energy production and conversion amino acid transport and metabolism and inorganic ion transport and metabolism which could be related to bacterial growth as well as the synthesis of proteins and polysaccharides in eps 3 4 1 nitrogen and carbohydrate metabolism nitrogen cycle related genes hao hzs nxr nir nar had relatively high abundance during whole gradient cooling process 30 5 c in anammox consortia fig 5b in this study only one anammox genome amx1 completeness 99 73 contamination 1 65 assigned to genus candidatus kuenenia was obtained from anammox system but amx1 was not the known candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis since the acquired amx1 shared an ani of 76 44 95 with candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis the metabolic pathway of candidatus kuenenia is no dependen hu et al 2019 and different from candidatus brocadia sinica using hydroxylamine as the intermediate oshiki et al 2016 amx1 genome harbored genes hdh hzs hao and nxr but lacked the distinct no generating nitrite reductases nir fig 7 intriguingly the abundance of hao in anaob was abundant shown in fig 5 b and apparently the high abundance of hao played a vital role in anammox metabolism previous research had found that hao related enzymes kustc0458 homologs could also carry out nitrite reduction to no which was supposed to fulfill the function of no generation in amx1 metabolism hu et al 2019 yang et al 2021b the abundance of anammox related genes was slightly down regulated when temperature declined from 30 c to 15 c while a clear rebound was observed at 5 c fig 5b conversely 25 5 c temperature stimulated the abundance of genes related denitrification which might lead to the slight reduction of nitrate at 5 c correspondingly some symbiotic bacteria acd1 atm1 pla1 and pla2 encoded the genes narghi but lacked nirk or nirs might function for the nitrite loop in anammox consortia fig 7 the nitrate generated from anaob could be reduced to nitrite by acd1 atm1 and pla1 2 and the nitrite could be reused by anaob which was in line with previous research speth et al 2016 besides acd1 atm1 and pla1 also encoded nirbd or nrfah and thus the nitrate generated from anaob could be reduced to ammonia by them and the ammonia could be reused by anaob which indicated a ammonia loop together the nitrite loop or ammonia loop might affect the nitrogen removal efficiency in anammox system supplementary fig s6 also showed the genes abundance varitation of major carbohydrate metabolic pathways in anammox community including the upregulation of pyruvate metabolism glycolysis gluconeogenesis tricarboxylic acid tca cycle and the downregulation of amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pentose phosphate pathway ppp among others when exposed to declining temperature furthernore binning analysis indicated that amx1 encoded complete wood ljungdahl pathway wlp for co2 fixation and was the only one genome conducting autotrophic carbon fixation in all 23 mags in line with previous researches schouten et al 2004 wang et al 2016 and tca cycle in anammox bacterium amx1 operated completely in addition amx1 possessed complete ppp and downstream enzymes pyruvate kinase and pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase previous researches also confirmed the ppp encoded in candidatus jettenia ecosi and candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis however ppp has not yet been found in other anaob lawson et al 2021 mardanov et al 2019 furthermore the intermediates from pyruvate metabolism ppp as well as tca cycle could function as precursors for most amino acid biosynthesis detailed discussion below furthermore four mags pat1 4 belonging to superphylum patescibacteria were detected in anammox consortia zhou et al 2020 patescibacteria pat1 4 genomes lacked many genes required for tca cycle gluconeogenesis and prerequisite electron carriers and nitrogen metabolism related genes were all missing in mags classified as patescibacteria indicating patescibacteria populations need acquire essential nutrients from other microorganisms for their growth in anammox community hosokawa et al 2021 reported some patescibacteria could utilize parts of poly n acetylglucosamine pga e g n acetylglucosamine glcnac produced by candidatus brocadia for their growth in this study instead of anaob only ucb1 possessed genes pgaabc which were indispensable for the biosynthesis of pga however glcnac metabolism related genes were missing in pat1 4 which illustrated the growth of patescibacteria did not depend on pga production under cold temperture we observed the absence of aldolases e2 2 1 2 and e4 1 2 13 in ppp and glycolysis gluconeogenesis pathways thus the deficiency of glyceraldehyde 3p inhibited the generation of atp in pat1 3 it was speculated that pat1 3 might survive depending on the glyceraldehyde 3p produced by amx1 or other heterotrophic mags besides fermentative pathway for lactate l lactate dehydrogenase was found in pat1 and pat2 this suggested that patescibacteria pat1 and pat2 could provide these fermentative by products to heterotrophs this is atm1 atm2 bat1 cfx1 cfx2 cfx5 which possessed lactate dehydrogenase the above observations implied patescibacteria spesies may play ecological roles in anammox consortia such as the cross feeding with anaob and heterotrophic organisms on organic compounds glyceraldehyde 3p and lactate 3 4 2 cross feeding on pn ps biosynthesis the eps content variation under 30 5 c illustrated that increasing eps synthesis was one of the main responses of anammox consortia to low temperature stress the ps of eps could form complex structure that attached to the cell surface and favored sludge aggregation or was a trigger for sludge granulation flemming and wingender 2010 he et al 2018 hou et al 2015 extracellular ps biosynthesis requires the precursors of nucleotide sugar and amino sugar that are incorporated into the elongating ps chain secreted as heteropolysaccharides with irregular repeating units that assembled using a variety of nucleotide sugar and amino sugar as well as their precursors boels et al 2001 flemming and wingender 2010 tang et al 2018 the top 30 most abundant genes related to amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism in anammox consortia were showed in fig 6 c the majority of genes abundance were downregulated by declining temperature while genes pmm pgm and ugp2 related to udp glc biosynthesis gene gale related to udp gal biosynthesis as well as genes glmm glmu and murb related to udp glcnac and udp murnac biosynthesis were stimulated under 25 5 c temperature through constructing genome based ecological model of anammox consortia community fig 7 we observed that acd1 encoded the biosynthesis pathways for most ps precursors including udp glc udp gal udp glca udp glcnac udp glcnaca gdp fuc and gdp man from fructose and mannose metabolism while genome amx1 showed functional complementarity with acd1 since amx1 could biosynthesize cdp glc and adp glc which were missing in acd1 indicating the potential cooperation between amx1 and acd1 furthermore acd1 contained the most glycosyltransferases to facilitate macro molecule ps biosynthesis including polyisoprenyl phosphate glycosyltransferase glycosyltransferase 2 family protein and l malate glycosyltransferase and acd1 also harbored more ps transporters for exopolysaccharide production the important contribution of acd1 could promote anaob aggregation at cold temperature previous study proposed exopolysaccharides biosynthesis dependent on the cooperation of anaob and chloroflexi in the anammox reactor during start up process zhao et al 2018 in this study chloroflexi populations lacked most nucleotide sugars metabolism functions this contradiction implied different cross feeding patterns under various operation conditions amino acid biosynthesis was closely related to the intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism fig 6b the abundance of genes related to glycolysis gluconeogenesis and pyruvate metabolism were elevated when exposed to 25 5 c temperature supplementary fig s6 and accordingly stimulated amino acid biosynthesis which was consistent with the increased pn concentration under cold temperature in section 3 2 we also proposed the cross feedings of amino acids in anammox consortia at reduced temperature fig 7 amx1 harbored complete pathways for the biosynthesis of most amino acids especially some with high biosynthetic cost table s8 for instance amx1 genome could confirm the production of isoleucine leucine valine and alanine from pyruvate and of the phenylalanine and tyrosine from erythrose 4p and phosphoenolpyruvate and of the histidine and tryptophan from prpp via ppp and glycolysis pathway fig 7 this was in contrast to other heterotrophic organisms especially atm2 bat2 cfx3 cfx6 and acd1 which lacking the synthetic pathways of the above mentioned high biosynthetic cost amino acids therefore it was supposed that anaob might support high cost amino acids requirements for these heterotrophic genomes to direct assimilation into protein production or utilization as carbon and energy sources lawson et al 2021 this could be a feedback mechanism for the contributions of ps folate and cofactor of acidobacteriota bacteroidota chloroflexota and proteobacteria bacteria to anaob folate and cofactor detailed discussion below furthermore hydrophobic amino acids are critical for granule aggregation ability and most of them were produced by amx1 table s8 demonstrating the irreplaceable role of anaob in protein synthesis in eps hou et al 2015 therefore we concluded that the growth of angs particle size and the variation of eps could be attributed to the metabolic interactions among amx1 and acd1 as well as other heterotrophic bacteria in anammox system for coping with cold temperature stress 3 4 3 folate and cofactor deficiency secondary metabolites such as folate and cofactor are important for many biological processes although thay are not directly required for microorganism growth we observed that the key genes fola and folb were missing in amx1 implying the deficiency of tetrahydrofolate thf fig 7 which could have severe repercussions on co2 fixation since the wlp for co2 fixation was a folate dependent pattern wang et al 2016 while bat1 and bat3 encoded all related genes for the thf synthesis which could cross feed with amx1 similarly amx1 also lacked a series of genes moax moga and moab for the moco biosynthesis fig 7 and moco is a cofactor for many oxidoreductases including the formate dehydrogenases fdhs involving in the wlp for co2 fixation lawson et al 2017 leimkuhler and iobbi nivol 2016 whereas pla2 harbored genes to facilitate moco production coenzyme a coa is a essential cofactor playing a central role in tca cycle fatty acid metabolism and other central biochemical transformations leonardi et al 2005 and coenzyme r cor also known as biotin is recognized as a coenzyme for pyruvate carboxylase acetyl coa carboxylase and other carboxylases which are involved in gluconeogenesis and fatty acid synthesis zempleni et al 2009 these cofactors play indispensable roles in various metabolism reactions although they are required in minute quantities however amx1 lacked the complete synthetic pathway for coa precursor pantoate as well the missing biof is a key gene in the pathway for cor biosynthesis at the same time cfx1 harbored abundant genes for coa biosynthesis as well as pro1 possessed the complete pathway for cor production the deficiency of folate and cofactor should have a serious impact on anammox system but the relatively stable anammox performance reflected the potential cross feedings of folate and cofactor in the anammox consortia 4 conclusion in the anammox bioreactor 25 15 c temperature promoted the secretion of eps and thus favored the aggregation of angs to resist cold temperature perturbation network analysis showed that 25 15 c temperature stimulated the cooperation between anaob and heterotrophic species such as denitratisoma truepera anaerolineaceae norank o sbr1031 etc 17 out of 21 keystone taxa were heterotrophic bacteria that played important roles in maintaining the structure stability of anammox microbial networks metagenomic assembly approach yielded 23 mags and allowed us to build a genome based ecological model of anammox community in this model the generation of eps depended on the cross feedings in anammox consortia for example in cooperation with anaob acidobacteriota affiliated bacteria harbored the function of exopolysaccharides biosynthesis and amx1 as the only anammox genome encoded the most pathways of amino acids especially costly and hydrophobic amino acids which could cross feed with some heterotrophs for their growth members of bacteroidota planctomycetota chloroflexota and proteobacteria harbored the secondary metabolites folate and cofactors moco coa and cor biosynthesis ability to cross feed with anaob for some vital biological processes and patescibacteria may play ecological roles in anammox consortia such as the cross feeding with heterotrophic organisms about organic compounds glyceraldehyde 3p and lactate all above mentioned metabolic interactions could affect anammox performance by regulating microbial activity and aggregation in this study microbial metabolic network advances our understanding of the ecological roles played by anaob and heterotrophic bacteria and highlights the bacteria interactions in anammox community system at reduced temperature further studies are necessary to verify these symbiotic

15475,anammox as a promising biological nitrogen removal technology has attracted much attention however cold temperature would limit its wide application and little is known about the microbial interactions between anammox bacteria anaob and heterotrophic bacteria at cold temperature here we observed reduced temperature 25 15 c promoted the secretion of eps and thus stimulated bigger size of granular sludge in a laboratory scale anammox reactor we further combined co occurrence network analysis and genome centered metagenomics to explore the potential interactions between anaob and heterotrophic bacteria network analysis suggested 22 out of 25 positively related species were reported as definite heterotrophic bacteria in subnetwork of anaob genome centered metagenomics analysis yielded 23 metagenomic assembly genomes mags and we found that acidobacteriota affiliated bacteria could biosynthesize most polysaccharides ps precursors and contain the most glycosyltransferases and transporters to facilitate exopolysaccharides biosynthesis together with partial ps precursors produced by anaob amx1 as the only anammox genome could synthesize most amino acids and cross feed with some heterotrophs to affect the extracellular protein function additionally bacteroidota planctomycetota chloroflexota and proteobacteria could contribute folate and molybdopterin cofactor for amx1 to benefit their activity and growth superphylum patescibacteria could survive by cross feeding with anaob and heterotrophic organisms about organic compounds glyceraldehyde 3p and lactate these cross feedings maintained the stability of anammox reactor performance and emphasize the importance of heterotrophs in anammox system at reduced temperature graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reduced temperature anammox bacteria heterotrophic bacteria co occurrence network metabolism interaction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anammox is a promising biological nitrogen removal process developed in recent years owing to its energy efficient advantages chen et al 2021a while the temperature of domestic and industrial wastewater could reduce to 5 15 c at higher latitudes or in hilly regions huang et al 2015 much lower than the optimum processing temperature of anammox bacteria anaob and other symbiotic bacteria 20 35 c zha et al 2020 previous studies have reported that temperatures below 15 c could severely inhibit nitrogen removal capacity in various anammox systems guo et al 2015 yang et al 2021a zhu et al 2017 to broaden the application of anammox it is important to understand how to achieve high nitrogen removal efficiency at low temperatures notably the abundant and active anaob have been detected in sediments of the southern north sea in winter 10 c indicating the possibility of stable nitrogen removal under cold temperatures for wastewater treatment lotti et al 2014 the nitrogen removal in anammox process relies on the activity of anammox consortia and their synergistic microbe1s besides anaob some heterotrophic bacteria affiliated with proteobacteria bacteroidota and chloroflexota were found to be abundant in various anammox based systems guo et al 2022 he et al 2018 ishimoto et al 2021 li et al 2018 chen et al 2020 found the potential synergistic mechanism between anaob and heterotrophic bacteria based on the consistent variation of candidatus brocadias and denitratisoma abundance the co occurrence network analysis further demonstrated the significant positive correlations between anaob and denitratisoma su et al 2022 the excellent nitrogen removal efficiency might be inseparable from the cooperation of anaob with heterotrophic bacteria through substrate or metabolic cross feeding a few researchers recently built a genome based ecological model of the microbial community using metagenomics analysis to reveal the potential cross feeding in anammox consortia speth et al 2016 speculated that species affiliated to phyla chlorobi and acidobacteriota as heterotrophic denitrifiers encoding the function of nitrate reductase could utilize nitrate generated from anaob growth and the nitrite reduced from nitrate could be reused by anaob so this process was considered as a nitrogen related cross feeding further study implicated the chlorobi species as protein degraders could liberate the amino acids in extracellular polymeric substance eps matrix for themselves or other heterotrophic bacteria and these costly but necessary amino acids were offered by anaob lawson et al 2017 in addition a recent genome centered metagenomic study revealed that proteobacteria and armatimonadota organisms could contribute folate and molybdopterin cofactor moco for anaob to conduct central carbon metabolism zhao et al 2018 despite some metabolic cross feeding has been discussed in anammox communities for example in the start up phase of anammox system whether the metabolic network at cold temperature is consistent and whether more cross feedings exist remain poorly understood in this study a uasb was operated for 250 days with the temperature decreasing from 30 c to 25 20 15 and 5 c dividing into five phases sludge biosamples were taken at the end of each phase and analyzed using 16s rrna gene sequencing and metagenomic sequencing combined with binning analysis the variations of system performance sludge characteristics as well as community structure and co occurrence network of anammox microbial community were investigated the abundance variations of genes related to nitrogen and carbohydrate metabolism as well as the heterotrophic bacteria possessing the functions of cross feeding with anaob about nitrogen and carbohydrate metabolism eps secretion and secondary metabolite during cooling process were investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor operation the anammox seed sludge taken from a long term running uasb anammox reactor was inoculated into a 0 5 l uasb reactor the influent was synthetic wastewater in mg l nh4cl 100 nano2 132 nahco3 1250 mgso4 7h2o 300 kh2po4 10 and cacl2 5 6 the trace elements were the same as reported in a previous study ya et al 2021 the nitrogen loading rate nlr was about 2 97 0 13 kg n m3 d according to the temperature i e 30 25 20 15 5 c the entire cooling process could be divided into five phases phase a 1 46 d phase b 47 92 d phase c 93 139 d phase d 140 187 d and phase e 188 250 d 2 2 physico chemical analysis methods water samples were taken once every two days to determine the concentrations of ammonia nitrite and nitrate according to gilcreas 2012 mlss and mlvss were measured every 15 days three fractions of eps including soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were analyzed using a modified heat method li and yang 2007 polysaccharides ps and protein pn are the main components of eps ps was measured using the anthrone h2so4 method with glucose as the standard miao et al 2018 and pn was analyzed using lowry method with bovine serum albumin as the standard zhang et al 2011 anammox granular sludge angs size analysis was conducted by a professional particle size analysis software nano measurer 1 2 through importing angs picture canon eos r6 and manual labeling and the detailed process was shown in text s1 the specific anammox activity saa is an important indicator to evaluate the anammox activity of anaob in a reactor and the determination method of saa was shown in text s2 according to chen et al 2016 the angs characteristics such as particle size eps content saa etc were determined at the end of each stage 2 3 microbial community metagenomics combined with binning analysis the granular sludge biomasses were sampled from the reactor for eight consecutive days at the end of each phase these biosamples were cryopreserved at 20 c until dna extraction dna extraction was then performed using the fastdna spin kit for soil omega bio tek norcross ga u s according to the manufacturer s instructions next polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification was accomplished with primers 338f and 806r finally high throughput sequencing was performed at illumina miseq pe300 platform in majorbio co ltd shanghai china the quality filtering of the original sequence was described earlier wang et al 2017 the amplicon sequence variants asvs were obtained by using qiime2 with dada2 plugin bolyen et al 2019 callahan et al 2016 without imposing the arbitrary dissimilarity thresholds that define operational taxonomic units otus the raw data of sequencing was available in the ncbi short read archive under prjna842194 for metagenomic sequencing ezna soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s were used for total genomic dna extraction according to manufacturer s instructions the shotgun sequencing was performed using illumina hiseq 4000 platform original sequencing data could be found under prjna845941 on the website of the ncbi the raw data were trimmed length 50 bp or with a quality value 20 or having n bases by fastp https github com opengene fastp v0 20 0 chen et al 2018 then metagenomics data were assembled using megahit v1 1 3 and the contigs with the length 300 bp were selected as the final assembling result the assembled contigs were binned using metabat v2 12 1 to obtain metagenomic assembly genomes mags and checkm was used to evaluate the completeness and contamination level of mags 23 mags have been submitted to ncbi and the biosample accession numbers was summarized in table s1 next the species annotations of mags were obtained through gtdb tk v1 7 0 based on genome taxonomy database gtdb r202 the open reading frames orfs of each contig as well as mag were predicted using metagene http metagene cb k u tokyo ac jp noguchi et al 2006 functional annotations were conducted using diamond http www diamondsearch org index php version 0 8 35 buchfink et al 2015 against non supervised orthologous groups eggnog and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg databases with an e value cutoff of 1e 5 and the outputs were further filtered using identity 70 and alignment length 25 aa as the blastp results according to previous studies guo et al 2017 yang et al 2014 yang et al 2019 ani was calculated using the software jspecies1 2 1 for ani analysis 2 4 statistical analysis and network construction the analytical method of icamp was used to quantitatively infer community assembly mechanisms by phylogenetic bin based null model ning et al 2020 and the procedure of icamp was described in text s3 and the whole process of molecular ecological network analysis mena was consistent with our previous study ya et al 2021 these networks were visualized using cytoscape 3 6 1 and were accordingly named net 30 c net 25 c net 20 c net 15 c and net 5 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 system performance after the start up stage the uasb reactor was operated for 250 days with an average nlr of 2 97 0 13 kg n m3 d the average effluent concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n were 5 71 2 73 mg l and 2 84 1 37 mg l with removal efficiencies of 94 38 2 63 and 97 69 1 14 respectively under 30 15 c supplementary fig s1 however the saa gradually decreased from 22 63 to 7 82 mg no2 n g vss d under gradient cooling process of 30 15 c table s2 when under 5 c nh4 n and no2 n removal efficiencies rapidly declined to 78 64 9 10 and 84 28 9 46 which led to poor nitrogen removal performance but did not cause system collapse since the average ratios of δno2 n nh4 n and δno3 n nh4 n were very close to the anammox reaction stoichiometry of 1 32 and 0 26 table s3 besides the saa slightly increased to 10 54 mg no2 n g vss d under 5 c indicating the adaptation of system when exposed to cold temperature 3 2 variation of angs size and eps angs size is indicative of the performance of anammox system and could greatly influence the settleability of anammox granules adams et al 2020 as shown in fig 1 a when system temperature gradually decreased from 30 to 5 c the average diameters of angs at 25 5 c were significantly larger than 30 c p 0 05 since the average diameter of angs increased to 1 7 mm under 25 c and then declined to 1 5 mm under 5 c but still larger than the initial angs size 1 26 mm 30 c indicating that cold temperature could promote anaob aggregation he et al 2018 besides fig 1a reflected anaob was inclined to form medium size angs since 45 75 50 09 angs had a diameter between 0 8 and 1 6 mm in each phase which was in line with a previous study chen et al 2021b also the proportion of bigger particle size 1 6 5 6 mm under 25 5 c was larger than the initial inoculation diameter which was advantageous to avoid the biomass washout and could maintain the stability of anammox system eps functioned as the binder between microorganisms and contributed to a better aggregation of angs and thus the dynamics variation of eps content could lead to the variation of angs particle size hou et al 2015 in this study the eps contents at 25 15 c were significantly larger than 30 c p 0 05 so 25 15 c promoted the eps secretion and thus stimulated the particle sizes fig 1 the peak value of eps concentration was observed under 25 c reaching 32 03 mg g 1 vss and then it gradually decreased and eventually dropped to the lowest 15 95 mg g 1 vss at 5 c which weakened the resistance of angs system against low temperature and inevitably led to poor performance in addition the variation trends of three eps fractions including s eps lb eps and tb eps were different tb eps as the major component of eps ranged from 14 55 to 30 92 mg g 1 vss accounting for over 87 57 of the total eps and tb eps with gel like property could tightly bound to the cell surface and played an important role for flocculation yuan et al 2014 moreover pn conducive to the formation of granules is in the inner layer of granules while polysaccharides ps essential for the stability of granules is in the outer layer of granules rusanowska et al 2019 zhu et al 2018 in our study the content of ps was 3 06 5 91 mg g 1 vss whereas pn varied widely from 10 04 to 27 05 mg g 1 vss under 30 5 c more pn content was detected below 30 c except 5 c indicating that pn excretion was the potential strategy to cope with low temperatures disturbance while the sudden drop of pn content at 5 c might have negative effect on angs stability resulting in a slight decrease of system performance these results elucidated that the reduced temperature could regulate the secretion of eps by anammox consortia and thus stimulate the aggregation of angs to resist cold temperature perturbation even under 5 c 3 3 microbial shift driven by declining temperature 3 3 1 community structure shift a total of 865 asvs were defined from 20 241 high quality 16s rrna gene sequences without imposing the arbitrary dissimilarity thresholds the abundance and structure of bacterial community during temperature declining process were identified the peak values of sobs and shannon indexes were observed under 25 c and 20 c respectively and it indicated that low temperature stimulated the bacterial richness and diversity table s4 the most abundant phyla were classified into planctomycetota 32 77 19 14 55 asvs chloroflexi 30 72 21 31 228 asvs proteobacteria 18 29 33 51 207asvs bacteroidota 6 91 5 25 73 asvs and actinobacteriota 2 85 4 22 65 asvs supplementary fig s2 at genus level the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia 31 59 17 56 and o sbr1031 26 05 16 70 decreased with temperature declining and candidatus kuenenia abundance slightly recovered to 25 48 at 5 c while the relative abundance of denitratisoma 8 88 23 49 and c chitinivibrionia 1 66 5 01 showed the opposite trend candidatus kuenenia is a canonical anaob and the metabolism of o sbr1031 is related to organic degradation wang et al 2018a denitratisoma is considered as a denitrifier and could collaborate with anaob for nitrogen removal in anammox reactor but the function of c chitinivibrionia is unclear chen et al 2020 3 3 2 community assembly shift icamp provided insights into the potential roles of various ecological processes forces in the phylogenetic community dynamics of bacterial communities fig 2 in fact the average relative importance of homogeneous selection hos and drift dr were 35 60 53 49 and 42 57 61 51 which were more important than other processes in anammox consortia assembly similar result was also found in studying the effects of warming on grassland bacterial community assembly ning et al 2020 the contribution of hos below 30 c sharply increased and peaked at 25 c with 53 49 driving the assembly of anammox consortia niederdorfer et al 2021 accordingly dr 42 57 reached the lowest value at 25 c other processes owned relatively low importance 3 10 besides hos and heterogeneous selection hes belong to determinism and homogenizing dispersal hd dispersal limitation dl and dr belong to stochasticity obviously 25 5 c temperature increased the deterministic processes and the determinism became dominant 53 69 especially at 25 c after exposing to 20 5 c stochastic processes regained the dominance 51 85 54 77 but still far below the value at 30 c 64 28 the variation trend of deterministic processes is consistent with the trend of α diversity average particle size as well as total eps secretion 3 3 3 co occurrence networks shift in view of the cold temperature effect network analysis was performed to elucidate the variation of potential biotic interactions in anammox consortia the resulting networks consisted of 186 to 212 nodes and 270 to 342 links with an average degree from 2 903 to 3 227 fig 3 table s5 the increase of the network links nodes and average degree at 25 15 c suggested that a certain range of cooling promoted the network size and complexity however net 5 c owned the fewest nodes and links and the smallest average degree average clustering coefficient as well as the largest average path distance and modularity indicating the simplest and most loose network at 5 c supplementary fig s3 unlike the microbial community the majority of nodes in all five networks were related to chloroflexi 26 09 28 64 and proteobacteria 25 47 28 64 and only 3 77 6 76 nodes belonged to planctomycetota supplementary fig s4 indicative of the important role of heterotrophic bacteria in anammox consortia network we further focused on the relationships between anaob including candidatus kuenenia candidatus brocadia and sm1a02 and their first neighbors fig 4 obviously the anaob subnetworks displayed more intensive interactions at cold temperature especially at 5 c since there were 8 12 13 13 and 17 closest neighbors corresponding to temperature of 30 25 20 15 and 5 c respectively simultaneously 25 15 c temperature stimulated the cooperation between anaob and heterotrophic species as there were 4 6 5 7 and 3 positive links under declining temperature and 22 out of 25 positively related species were reported as definite heterotrophic bacteria such as denitratisoma asv395 truepera asv1371 responsible for denitrification chen et al 2020 yin et al 2019 and sva0996 marine group asv997 haliangium asv551 comamonas asv210 norank o sbr1031 asvs 877 918 785 854 and 831 ignavibacterium asv533 anaerolineaceae asv927 etc involved in the biodegradation of organic compounds ivanova et al 2010 miao et al 2016 wang et al 2018a 2018b wu et al 2018 yang et al 2020 the symbiotic effect between above mentioned microorganisms reflected that the inter species cooperation might promote the resistance of anammox system when exposed to reduced temperature 25 15 c while anaob possessing the most competitive relationships 81 82 with heterotrophic bacteria at 5 c might lead to the slight reduction of nitrogen removal capacity the putative keystone taxa were recognized in the light of the zi within module connectivity and pi among module connectivity values supplementary fig s5a more keystone taxa were detected under cold temperatures since there were 3 3 6 6 and 4 asvs identified as keystone taxa across five networks these 21 keystone taxa were derived from 8 phyla and the relative abundance of these species were below 1 03 table s6 supplementary fig s5b c the abundance of taxa might not be directly related to taxon importance so the above rare species might play vital function in maintaining the structure stability of anammox microbial networks manoeli et al 2014 shi et al 2016 it was also worth noticing that 17 out of 21 keystone taxa were considered as heterotrophic bacteria and involved in denitrification and biodegradation of organic compounds which further emphasized the irreplaceable role of heterotrophic bacteria in anammox microbial community 3 4 microbial metabolic network analysis metagenomic sequencing from five angs biosamples yielded a total of 555 299 062 reads after quality control co assembly of these clean reads approximately generated 355 758 523 398 contigs with n50 of 1570 1926 bp contigs were subsequently binned into microbial genomes and 23 draft mags completeness 50 contamination 10 were recovered from all the five biosamples these genomes were affiliated with the phyla chloroflexota patescibacteria planctomycetota bacteroidota armatimonadota proteobacteria acidobacteriota and sumerlaeotas table s7 the sequences of whole community dna were compared to eggnog database to acquire functional annotations under gradual cooling conditions fig 5 a cogs cluster of orthologous groups related to replication recombination and repair were 9 02 8 66 8 30 7 79 and 8 33 respectively corresponding to 30 5 c and displayed a reduction below 30 c indicating the inhibition of bacteria proliferation and genetic stability under 25 5 c temperature which was consistent with the findings of soil microbiome at cold temperature bao et al 2021 on the contrary it could be seen that cold temperature stimulated most metabolic pathways especially energy production and conversion amino acid transport and metabolism and inorganic ion transport and metabolism which could be related to bacterial growth as well as the synthesis of proteins and polysaccharides in eps 3 4 1 nitrogen and carbohydrate metabolism nitrogen cycle related genes hao hzs nxr nir nar had relatively high abundance during whole gradient cooling process 30 5 c in anammox consortia fig 5b in this study only one anammox genome amx1 completeness 99 73 contamination 1 65 assigned to genus candidatus kuenenia was obtained from anammox system but amx1 was not the known candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis since the acquired amx1 shared an ani of 76 44 95 with candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis the metabolic pathway of candidatus kuenenia is no dependen hu et al 2019 and different from candidatus brocadia sinica using hydroxylamine as the intermediate oshiki et al 2016 amx1 genome harbored genes hdh hzs hao and nxr but lacked the distinct no generating nitrite reductases nir fig 7 intriguingly the abundance of hao in anaob was abundant shown in fig 5 b and apparently the high abundance of hao played a vital role in anammox metabolism previous research had found that hao related enzymes kustc0458 homologs could also carry out nitrite reduction to no which was supposed to fulfill the function of no generation in amx1 metabolism hu et al 2019 yang et al 2021b the abundance of anammox related genes was slightly down regulated when temperature declined from 30 c to 15 c while a clear rebound was observed at 5 c fig 5b conversely 25 5 c temperature stimulated the abundance of genes related denitrification which might lead to the slight reduction of nitrate at 5 c correspondingly some symbiotic bacteria acd1 atm1 pla1 and pla2 encoded the genes narghi but lacked nirk or nirs might function for the nitrite loop in anammox consortia fig 7 the nitrate generated from anaob could be reduced to nitrite by acd1 atm1 and pla1 2 and the nitrite could be reused by anaob which was in line with previous research speth et al 2016 besides acd1 atm1 and pla1 also encoded nirbd or nrfah and thus the nitrate generated from anaob could be reduced to ammonia by them and the ammonia could be reused by anaob which indicated a ammonia loop together the nitrite loop or ammonia loop might affect the nitrogen removal efficiency in anammox system supplementary fig s6 also showed the genes abundance varitation of major carbohydrate metabolic pathways in anammox community including the upregulation of pyruvate metabolism glycolysis gluconeogenesis tricarboxylic acid tca cycle and the downregulation of amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pentose phosphate pathway ppp among others when exposed to declining temperature furthernore binning analysis indicated that amx1 encoded complete wood ljungdahl pathway wlp for co2 fixation and was the only one genome conducting autotrophic carbon fixation in all 23 mags in line with previous researches schouten et al 2004 wang et al 2016 and tca cycle in anammox bacterium amx1 operated completely in addition amx1 possessed complete ppp and downstream enzymes pyruvate kinase and pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase previous researches also confirmed the ppp encoded in candidatus jettenia ecosi and candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis however ppp has not yet been found in other anaob lawson et al 2021 mardanov et al 2019 furthermore the intermediates from pyruvate metabolism ppp as well as tca cycle could function as precursors for most amino acid biosynthesis detailed discussion below furthermore four mags pat1 4 belonging to superphylum patescibacteria were detected in anammox consortia zhou et al 2020 patescibacteria pat1 4 genomes lacked many genes required for tca cycle gluconeogenesis and prerequisite electron carriers and nitrogen metabolism related genes were all missing in mags classified as patescibacteria indicating patescibacteria populations need acquire essential nutrients from other microorganisms for their growth in anammox community hosokawa et al 2021 reported some patescibacteria could utilize parts of poly n acetylglucosamine pga e g n acetylglucosamine glcnac produced by candidatus brocadia for their growth in this study instead of anaob only ucb1 possessed genes pgaabc which were indispensable for the biosynthesis of pga however glcnac metabolism related genes were missing in pat1 4 which illustrated the growth of patescibacteria did not depend on pga production under cold temperture we observed the absence of aldolases e2 2 1 2 and e4 1 2 13 in ppp and glycolysis gluconeogenesis pathways thus the deficiency of glyceraldehyde 3p inhibited the generation of atp in pat1 3 it was speculated that pat1 3 might survive depending on the glyceraldehyde 3p produced by amx1 or other heterotrophic mags besides fermentative pathway for lactate l lactate dehydrogenase was found in pat1 and pat2 this suggested that patescibacteria pat1 and pat2 could provide these fermentative by products to heterotrophs this is atm1 atm2 bat1 cfx1 cfx2 cfx5 which possessed lactate dehydrogenase the above observations implied patescibacteria spesies may play ecological roles in anammox consortia such as the cross feeding with anaob and heterotrophic organisms on organic compounds glyceraldehyde 3p and lactate 3 4 2 cross feeding on pn ps biosynthesis the eps content variation under 30 5 c illustrated that increasing eps synthesis was one of the main responses of anammox consortia to low temperature stress the ps of eps could form complex structure that attached to the cell surface and favored sludge aggregation or was a trigger for sludge granulation flemming and wingender 2010 he et al 2018 hou et al 2015 extracellular ps biosynthesis requires the precursors of nucleotide sugar and amino sugar that are incorporated into the elongating ps chain secreted as heteropolysaccharides with irregular repeating units that assembled using a variety of nucleotide sugar and amino sugar as well as their precursors boels et al 2001 flemming and wingender 2010 tang et al 2018 the top 30 most abundant genes related to amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism in anammox consortia were showed in fig 6 c the majority of genes abundance were downregulated by declining temperature while genes pmm pgm and ugp2 related to udp glc biosynthesis gene gale related to udp gal biosynthesis as well as genes glmm glmu and murb related to udp glcnac and udp murnac biosynthesis were stimulated under 25 5 c temperature through constructing genome based ecological model of anammox consortia community fig 7 we observed that acd1 encoded the biosynthesis pathways for most ps precursors including udp glc udp gal udp glca udp glcnac udp glcnaca gdp fuc and gdp man from fructose and mannose metabolism while genome amx1 showed functional complementarity with acd1 since amx1 could biosynthesize cdp glc and adp glc which were missing in acd1 indicating the potential cooperation between amx1 and acd1 furthermore acd1 contained the most glycosyltransferases to facilitate macro molecule ps biosynthesis including polyisoprenyl phosphate glycosyltransferase glycosyltransferase 2 family protein and l malate glycosyltransferase and acd1 also harbored more ps transporters for exopolysaccharide production the important contribution of acd1 could promote anaob aggregation at cold temperature previous study proposed exopolysaccharides biosynthesis dependent on the cooperation of anaob and chloroflexi in the anammox reactor during start up process zhao et al 2018 in this study chloroflexi populations lacked most nucleotide sugars metabolism functions this contradiction implied different cross feeding patterns under various operation conditions amino acid biosynthesis was closely related to the intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism fig 6b the abundance of genes related to glycolysis gluconeogenesis and pyruvate metabolism were elevated when exposed to 25 5 c temperature supplementary fig s6 and accordingly stimulated amino acid biosynthesis which was consistent with the increased pn concentration under cold temperature in section 3 2 we also proposed the cross feedings of amino acids in anammox consortia at reduced temperature fig 7 amx1 harbored complete pathways for the biosynthesis of most amino acids especially some with high biosynthetic cost table s8 for instance amx1 genome could confirm the production of isoleucine leucine valine and alanine from pyruvate and of the phenylalanine and tyrosine from erythrose 4p and phosphoenolpyruvate and of the histidine and tryptophan from prpp via ppp and glycolysis pathway fig 7 this was in contrast to other heterotrophic organisms especially atm2 bat2 cfx3 cfx6 and acd1 which lacking the synthetic pathways of the above mentioned high biosynthetic cost amino acids therefore it was supposed that anaob might support high cost amino acids requirements for these heterotrophic genomes to direct assimilation into protein production or utilization as carbon and energy sources lawson et al 2021 this could be a feedback mechanism for the contributions of ps folate and cofactor of acidobacteriota bacteroidota chloroflexota and proteobacteria bacteria to anaob folate and cofactor detailed discussion below furthermore hydrophobic amino acids are critical for granule aggregation ability and most of them were produced by amx1 table s8 demonstrating the irreplaceable role of anaob in protein synthesis in eps hou et al 2015 therefore we concluded that the growth of angs particle size and the variation of eps could be attributed to the metabolic interactions among amx1 and acd1 as well as other heterotrophic bacteria in anammox system for coping with cold temperature stress 3 4 3 folate and cofactor deficiency secondary metabolites such as folate and cofactor are important for many biological processes although thay are not directly required for microorganism growth we observed that the key genes fola and folb were missing in amx1 implying the deficiency of tetrahydrofolate thf fig 7 which could have severe repercussions on co2 fixation since the wlp for co2 fixation was a folate dependent pattern wang et al 2016 while bat1 and bat3 encoded all related genes for the thf synthesis which could cross feed with amx1 similarly amx1 also lacked a series of genes moax moga and moab for the moco biosynthesis fig 7 and moco is a cofactor for many oxidoreductases including the formate dehydrogenases fdhs involving in the wlp for co2 fixation lawson et al 2017 leimkuhler and iobbi nivol 2016 whereas pla2 harbored genes to facilitate moco production coenzyme a coa is a essential cofactor playing a central role in tca cycle fatty acid metabolism and other central biochemical transformations leonardi et al 2005 and coenzyme r cor also known as biotin is recognized as a coenzyme for pyruvate carboxylase acetyl coa carboxylase and other carboxylases which are involved in gluconeogenesis and fatty acid synthesis zempleni et al 2009 these cofactors play indispensable roles in various metabolism reactions although they are required in minute quantities however amx1 lacked the complete synthetic pathway for coa precursor pantoate as well the missing biof is a key gene in the pathway for cor biosynthesis at the same time cfx1 harbored abundant genes for coa biosynthesis as well as pro1 possessed the complete pathway for cor production the deficiency of folate and cofactor should have a serious impact on anammox system but the relatively stable anammox performance reflected the potential cross feedings of folate and cofactor in the anammox consortia 4 conclusion in the anammox bioreactor 25 15 c temperature promoted the secretion of eps and thus favored the aggregation of angs to resist cold temperature perturbation network analysis showed that 25 15 c temperature stimulated the cooperation between anaob and heterotrophic species such as denitratisoma truepera anaerolineaceae norank o sbr1031 etc 17 out of 21 keystone taxa were heterotrophic bacteria that played important roles in maintaining the structure stability of anammox microbial networks metagenomic assembly approach yielded 23 mags and allowed us to build a genome based ecological model of anammox community in this model the generation of eps depended on the cross feedings in anammox consortia for example in cooperation with anaob acidobacteriota affiliated bacteria harbored the function of exopolysaccharides biosynthesis and amx1 as the only anammox genome encoded the most pathways of amino acids especially costly and hydrophobic amino acids which could cross feed with some heterotrophs for their growth members of bacteroidota planctomycetota chloroflexota and proteobacteria harbored the secondary metabolites folate and cofactors moco coa and cor biosynthesis ability to cross feed with anaob for some vital biological processes and patescibacteria may play ecological roles in anammox consortia such as the cross feeding with heterotrophic organisms about organic compounds glyceraldehyde 3p and lactate all above mentioned metabolic interactions could affect anammox performance by regulating microbial activity and aggregation in this study microbial metabolic network advances our understanding of the ecological roles played by anaob and heterotrophic bacteria and highlights the bacteria interactions in anammox community system at reduced temperature further studies are necessary to verify these symbiotic

15476,per polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass contamination has caused worldwide health concerns and increased demand for effective elimination strategies herein we developed a new indole derivative decorated with a hexadecane chain and a tertiary amine center named di indole hexadecyl ammonium diha which can form stable nanospheres 100 200 nm in water via supramolecular assembly as the diha nanospheres can induce electrostatic hydrophobic and van der waals interactions all are long ranged that operative cooperatively in addition to the nano sized particles with large surface area the diha nanocomposite exhibited extremely fast adsorption rates in seconds high adsorption capacities 0 764 0 857 g g 1 and selective adsorption for perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos outperformed the previous reported high end pfass adsorbents simultaneously the diha nanospheres can produce hydrated electron e aq when subjected to uv irradiation with the virtue of constraining the photo generated e aq and the adsorbed pfoa pfos molecules entirely inside the nanocomposite as such the uv diha system exhibits extremely high degradation defluorination efficiency for pfoa pfos even under ambient conditions especially with the advantages of low chemical dosage requirement μm level and robust performance against environmental variables therefore it is a new attempt of using supramolecular approach to construct an indole based nanocomposite which can elegantly combine adsorption and degradation functions the novel diha nanoemulsion system would shed light on the treatment of pfas contaminated wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords supramolecular assembly perfluoroalkyl substances indole derivatives hydrated electron adsorption photodegradation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction per polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are a series of artificially synthesized per fluorinated alkyl chemicals with superior thermal and chemical stabilities pfass have been massively used as additives in widespread industrial and commercial products since the 1950s the extensive usage of pfass has caused severe environmental contamination of water air soil and food thereafter resulting in widespread public health threats d ambro et al 2021 lim 2019 penland et al 2020 rahman et al 2014 among all the pfass perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos draw the greatest concerns due to their known ubiquity persistence bioaccumulation and toxicity grandjean et al 2012 rich et al 2015 wang et al 2021a yeung et al 2017 although the stockholm convention has phased out pfoa and pfos their exemption for usage such as in aqueous fire fighting foams afff still causes continuous water and soil contamination nickerson et al 2021 wang et al 2014 have estimated that the post global emission of c4 c14 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas will go up to 6 420 tons from 2016 to 2030 and pfoa based products are still the dominant emissions in china and russia currently the reported pfoa pfos contamination in nature water and municipal wastewater could reach up to ppb level lenka et al 2021 schwichtenberg et al 2020 some manufacture discharge investigator derived wastewater and the fire extinguishing foam contaminated wastewater etc may contain much higher pfoa pfos concentrations at ppm level or higher moody et al 2003 tenorio et al 2020 therefore elimination of pfass from natural water and wastewater is vital lenka et al 2021 wang et al 2016 and this calls for high efficient cost effective and environmentally friendly pfas treatment involving adsorption and degradation technologies hydrated electron e aq based reduction techniques are promising for complete destruction of pfass in water because e aq is one of the rare candidates to directly cleave c f bond cui et al 2020 several compounds e g sulfite iodide nitrilotriacetic acid nta and indole derivatives have been investigated as e aq precursors by the excitation of uv irradiation chen et al 2021 qu et al 2010 sun et al 2018 tenorio et al 2020 however due to the strong quenching effect on e aq by proton and dissolved oxygen alkaline ph 9 and anaerobic conditions are generally required for the uv iodide uv sulfite and uv nta systems bentel et al 2020 song et al 2013 sun et al 2017 sun et al 2018 to overcome these deficiencies we previously applied cationic surfactant in association with indole acetic acid 3 iaa to construct a self assembled micelle confinement which could protect e aq from being undesirable consumption concentrate the pfass molecules and promote the e aq transfer efficiency chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b however without fully pre concentrating the e aq precursors and the target pollutants the e aq utilization efficiency is still unsatisfactory nevertheless this approach enlightens us to design more elegant indole structure based supramolecular assemblies with even higher affinity and selectivity for pfass supramolecular chemistry can provide versatile approaches to construct self assembled and multi functionalized organic materials for customized applications for example molecular recognition to target pollutants ateia et al 2020 guo et al 2010 terashima and sawamoto 2012 noncovalent interactions e g van der waals vdw electrostatic hydrogen bonding π π hydrophobic hydrophilic interaction metal ligand coordination etc are generally responsible for the supramolecular assembly processes qin et al 2020 rybtchinski 2011 several kinds of β cyclodextrin polymers one guanidinocalix 5 arene structure two metal organic framework mofs materials and several fluorous functionalized polymers have been reported to selectively recognize pfoa and pfos karoyo et al 2013 klemes et al 2019 koda et al 2014 kumarasamy et al 2020 li et al 2017 liu et al 2015 tan et al 2021 xiao et al 2017 zheng et al 2019 these supramolecular hosts have been applied as high end adsorbents to remove pfass from water with outstanding adsorption performance in that way it would be potentially feasible to incorporate the indole structure into a supramolecular polymeric system for the purpose of combining the adsorption and the e aq degradation functions synergistically for better treatment of pfass for this to be achieved decorating the indole structure with a hydrophobic alkyl chain might be a simple and worthwhile route to construct the copolymer assemblies the alkyl chain can provide hydrophobic and or weak vdw interactions within the polymer chains and can interact with the long chain pfas molecules tan et al 2021 urban et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 in addition in light of the previous findings that amine functionalized materials can selectively adsorb pfass ateia et al 2019a ji et al 2018 klemes et al 2019 amination of the indole compound could be another promising approach to provide electrostatic attraction to pfas molecules in this study we synthesized a new indole derivative named di indole hexadecyl ammonium diha that could form stable nanospheres to preferentially and selectively adsorb pfass in water its degradation defluorination performance to pfoa and pfos was also systemically explored due to the compact e aq attacking path in the nanospheres this novel material exhibited high e aq utilization efficiency leading to efficient degradation defluorination of pfass 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the chemicals of pfoa pfos sodium alga acid octanoic acid 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 pi

degradation and defluorination performances of the newly developed uv diha system for the treatment of pfoa were also tested for two natural surface water and one industral wastewater which were directly used without any pre treatment the sampling information and the water qualities of the three actual water samples were provided in table s1 it was noteworthy that no pfoa was detected in the the two natural water samples thereby 10 mg l 1 pfoa was artifically injected for investigation the industral wastewater contained 17 mg l 1 pfoa but was diluted to 10 mg l 1 for comparison the same photo reactor was used for the photodegradation experiments 2 6 md simulation and quantum chemical qc computation the self assembly process of diha diha was modeled by the md simulation in a 10 nm3 cubic water box using gromacs 2018 8 software abraham et al 2015 in conjunction with amber14sb for water molecule and gaff forcefield for diha diha and pfoa molecules the atomic charge type utilized in md simulation was resp2 0 5 the electrostatic and vdw interactions from one diha diha cluster to mono pfoa molecule were analyzed using the energy model of gmx2018 8 in order to evaluate the exact weak interactions between single diha or diha and pfoa the geometry optimization following with the weak interaction calculations were calculated by the methods of pbe0 def2 tzvp smd water and m06 2x def2 tzvp smz water respectively brémond et al 2016 walker et al 2013 a d3 dispersion correction was employed when calculating the intermolecular interactions grimme et al 2010 all qc calculations were carried out using gaussian 16 software frisch 2016 following wave function analysis by multiwfn lu and chen 2020 including esp vdw potential and independent gradient model igm analysis lefebvre et al 2017 3 results and discussions 3 1 synthesis and the properties of diha as shown in scheme 1 the novel indole compound was synthesized via the mannish reaction the obtained indole derivative is composed of one tertiary amine center bonded with two indole structures and one hexadecane chain fig s2 given the name as di indole hexadecyl ammonium diha chemical formula c34h49n3 the 1h nmr fig s3 and lc ms fig s4 characterizations confirmed the molecule structure of diha and the purity of the obtained chemical is 95 as indicated by the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy the diha material mainly contains c o n elements and no residual zn2 was detected figure s5 the newly developed diha shows stronger uv visible absorption 250 450 nm than the other representative indole derivatives 250 300 nm for 3 iaa indole donaxine fig s6 while its fluorescence emission is much weaker fig s7 suggesting that diha might possess stronger non radioactive dissipation due to the low water solubility diha was firstly dissolved in isopropanol then introduced into water with isopropanol water 0 2 v v upon introduction into water an emulsion suspension was formed immediately fig 1 a a probably because the strong hydrophobic interactions among diha molecules caused fast molecular association balakrishnan et al 2006 tan et al 2021 the diha emulsion could keep stable for weeks fig s8 a attributing to the positive surface zeta ζ potential of the diha nanocomposite fig 2 a which stems from the protonation of diha molecules the pk a value of diha is predicted to be 6 5 and is assigned at its tertiary amine n site https ilab acdlabs com ilab2 which is also the most electronegative site fig s9a as the increase of pfoa concentration the surface ζ potential of the system was gradually neutralized fig 2a indicating that pfoa was continuously adsorbed onto the diha nanocomposite which could be regard as a kind of supramolecular assemblies 3 2 the morphology of diha nanocomposite by observation of cryo tem fig 1b the pure diha existed as dispersed nanospheres of 100 200 nm fig 2b and tended to distribute on the carbon film rather than in the holes due to the strong hydrophobicity while for the diha pfoa 5 1 mol mol system the nanospheres became interlinked more spherical and less hydrophobic fig 1c suggesting that pfoa had been incorporated into the diha nanocomposites moreover for the diha pfoa 1 1 system the abundant pfoa molecules were mainly adsorbed on the shell of the nanospheres as indicated by the clear bilayer spheroidal structures of the nanospheres and the outer shell probably represented the adsorbed pfoa layer fig 1d when double molar concentration of pfoa was introduced diha pfoa 1 2 the surface ζ potential was neutralized fig 2a consequently the nanospheres tended to aggregate to larger particles and started to precipitate figs 2b and s8 e since diha molecules aggregated strongly in the water the bulk ph cannot drive spontaneous protonation or deprotonation of diha molecules inside the nanosphere therefore the diha pfoa 5 1 mole mole nanoemulsion system was quite stable under a wide ph range 4 10 as reflected by the surface ζ potential fig 2a and the particle size distribution fig 2c however the presence of ha and fa with the concentration range from 1 to 10 mg l 1 as well as the presence of inorganic salt of nacl from 1 to 100 mm could gradually reduce the surface ζ potential of the diha pfoa nanocomposite fig 2a and increase the particle size fig 2d e as increasing their concentrations it is probably because the diha pfoa nanocomposite could adsorb the negatively charged ha and fa while high ionic strength would compress the double electric layer of colloids leading to the aggregation 3 3 adsorption performance of diha to pfoa pfos both the cryo tem images fig 1c d and the surface ζ potential fig 2a have suggested the adsorption of pfoa by diha nanospheres furthermore on examination of the adsorption kinetics the diha nanospheres exhibited extremely fast adsorption rates based on a pseudo second order model ho and mckay 1999 with the k obs 1 327 g mg 1 h 1 for pfoa and 2964 g mg 1 h 1 for pfos which were at least 20 fold faster than other reported materials table s2 almost complete 99 7 99 9 adsorption of pfoa pfos with the initial concentration of 10 mg l 1 could be achieved in 10 s by applying a small amount of diha 121 μm and only 10 μg l 1 pfoa or 1 μg l 1 pfos was remained free in water after 2 min fig 3 a by comparison the reported pfas adsorbents e g activated carbon zhang et al 2019 resins yu et al 2009 all silica zeolite β van den bergh et al 2020 specific modified clays du et al 2017 wang et al 2021b mof material liu et al 2015 and polymers ateia et al 2019b ateia et al 2018 tan et al 2021 xiao et al 2017 etc usually required minutes to hours to attain adsorption equilibrium and the adsorption were usually incomplete for pfoa pfos at mg l 1 level table s2 moreover according to the langmuir adsorption isotherm model the adsorption capacities of diha for pfoa and pfos reached 0 857 g g 1 and 0 764 g g 1 respectively fig 3b which were higher than most of the reported materials table s2 although one fluorinated vermiculite and one certain ion exchange resin ia400 were reported to have comparable or even higher adsorption capacities their adsorption rate was much slower than diha du et al 2017 yu et al 2009 the applicability of adsorbents for pfass removal also requires good adsorption selectivity on examination of pfoa the diha nanospheres exhibited excellent adsorption selectivity against considerable amounts of in organic competitors as shown in fig 3c the carboxylic or phenolic substances e g benzoic acid oxalic acid and sodium alginate did not show any significant competition at 10 mm which was 413 fold higher than the pfoa concentration while the competition by octanoic acid was considerable the presence of 1 mm and 5 mm reaching its water solubility octanoic acid reduced the adsorption ratio of pfoa by 5 and 13 respectively besides representative humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa at 10 mg l 1 also did not inhibit the adsorption process the high salinity condition up to 100 mm nacl only slightly suppressed the pfoa adsorption by 8 the detailed comparison of the diha system with other reported high end adsorbents is listed in table s2 in general the exceptional adsorption performance of the diha material has outperformed all round in aspects of removal efficiency adsorption rate adsorption capacity and adsorption selectivity ateia et al 2019b 2018 du et al 2017 klemes et al 2019 van den bergh et al 2020 3 4 adsorption mechanism molecular dynamics md modeling was further conducted to simulate the formation of diha nanospheres and the interaction with pfoa as diha nanospheres were formed upon contacting with water fig 1a the formation of diha nanospheres should be accomplished before adsorbing pfoa according to its predicted pk a value 6 5 diha molecules with half number of the protonated species diha were introduced into the model to simulate neutral ph condition the self assembly of the diha diha molecule was simulated for 50 ns to obtain the stable separate clusters and the equilibrium configuration could be achieved within 20 ns fig s10a d however if only the uncharged diha molecules were introduced for modeling the diha molecules tended to assemble into a large single cluster due to the lack of electrostatic repulsion fig s11a c attributing to amine functionalization and protonation of the tertiary amine center the diha diha nanocomposite exhibits strong electron deficiency with the theoretical electrostatic potential esp extrema of 332 6 kj mol 1 fig 4 a suggesting the potentially high affinity with pfoa pfos liu et al 2021 which is electron rich fig s9b and its pk a value is 1 0 3 8 burns et al 2008 subsequently when pfoa anions were introduced into the md model at equivalent molar concentration as shown in figure s10e h pfoa anions were all adsorbed onto the shell of the diha diha nanospheres in 50 ns which fitted well with the cyto tem observation fig 1d notably as indicated by the vdw potential and esp dynamic during the md process both the vdw interaction and the electrostatic attraction contributed to adsorption process and the vdw interaction contributed more significantly fig 4b this was confirmed by further calculating the vdw potential iso surface where the pfoa molecules were indeed mainly adsorbed fig 4c furthermore two representative bi molecular assemblies i e diha pfoa and diha pfoa were selected from the clusters to calculate the potential weak intermolecular interactions as indicated in fig 4d e the significant vdw interaction was demonstrated as represented by the white strips between pfoa and diha while the carboxylate amino attraction δ c o δ h n only assisted the adsorption for diha pfoa while not for diha pfoa besides the weak electron donor acceptor interactions of c f π and c f h c were also highlighted the blue speckle the c f h c interaction could also be regarded as the weak hydrogen bond interaction zheng et al 2019 moreover as diha is extremely hydrophobic and pfoa is amphiphilic we suppose that the hydrophobic force also to some extent facilitates the adsorption process balakrishnan et al 2006 tan et al 2021 this could be indicated by the slight competitive adsorption by octanoic acid c8 fig 3c based on these observations the extremely fast adsorption rates and the high adsorption selectivity of the diha nanospheres would primarily be attributed to its super fine particle size at sub nanometer level which provides a large readily available surface area and greatly reduces the diffusion distance of pfoa pfos yu et al 2009 the diha diha clusters can induce electrostatic vdw and hydrophobic interactions simultaneously the hydrophobic interaction is a long range attraction force 0 10 nm israelachvili and pashley 1982 and the electrostatic interaction takes effect at distance 10 nm kanda et al 2002 meyer et al 2005 silbert et al 2012 although the vdw force is usually short ranged 1 nm they are additive when many diha molecules comprise together as one nanocomposite thus its operating radius is greatly increased all these long ranged interactions would induce rapid directional movement of free pfoa pfos molecules orienting to diha nanocomposite as long as pfoa pfos is adsorbed the fluorophilic effect would further increase the specific affinity with more pfoa pfos molecules du et al 2017 koda et al 2014 kumarasamy et al 2020 tan et al 2021 therefore all these multiple interactions cooperatively induce the fast adsorption rate and adsorption selectivity for pfoa pfos and the fast adsorption rate can facilitate the adsorption selectivity 3 5 photo degradation defluorination performance of diha to pfoa pfos since the diha material inherently contains the indole structure when subjected to uv 254 nm 36 w irradiation the diha nanocomposite can also serve as e aq nanoreactor to degrade defluorinate the adsorbed pfass the photo generated e aq was evidenced by the dmpo h signal of esr measurement fig 5 a the hydroxyl radical was also detected fig 5a it could be produced from the reaction of e aq with dissolved oxygen e a q h h o 2 h 2 o 2 o h e a q o 2 o 2 e a q o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 oh the carbon radical was probably from the diha radical or its debris fig 5a in addition using tempo a stable radical as the trapping agent it can capture e aq and transform into a singlet organic matter without paramagnetism chen et al 2022 as shown in fig 5b the triple peak signal of tempo reduced by 33 after irradiating by the uv light of 254 nm for 2 h in the diha tempo system compared to those in the pure tempo system it confirms the production of e aq in the uv diha system the production of e aq was also probed by the lfp measurement the broad peak at around 680 nm represented for the e aq signal fig s12 chen et al 2021 during the photolysis diha acts as the e aq precursor it could undergo self photodecomposition or be degraded by reactive oxygen species i e hydroxyl radicals produced in the system one intermediate with the m z 145 0455 was detected fig s13a b the decomposition pathway was proposed accompanied with the production of electrons and protons fig s13c although diha was generally consumed the uv diha system could keep high degradation efficiency in 12 h fig s14 suggesting that the degradation intermediate of diha is also capable of degrading pfoa since the diha pfas assemblies can provide a confined reaction zone for the photo generated e aq and the targeted pollutants the diha nanoemulsion can perform high degradation deflurination efficiency to the compactly adsorbed pfoa pfos even under the ambient condition room temperature neutral ph and open air as shown in fig 6 in the presence of 121 μm diha 10 mg l 1 24 2 μm pfoa could be degraded by 95 in 2 h with the defluorinated ratio of 51 after 12 h the residual pfoa was 15 μg l 1 and the defluorination ratio increased to 79 the presence of 0 2 isopropanol had little effect on the photolysis process we benchmarked the performance of diha nanocomposite against other e aq based systems only 21 28 degradation and 10 15 defluorination of pfoa were achieved in 12 h by applying equivalent concentrations of 3 iaa indole or donaxine fig s15 to obtain comparable degradation and defluorination efficiencies of pfoa the uv sulfite system required 10 mm sulfite furthermore alkaline ph and anaerobic conditions were also needed bentel et al 2019 for pfos which is usually much more persistent in other e aq systems bentel et al 2019 however almost the same degradation defluorination efficiency was obtained in our system and only 2 μg l 1 pfos was left after 12 h reaction fig 6 although in our previous uv organo clay 3 iaa and uv surfactant 3 iaa systems slightly higher defluorination ratio 90 of pfoa could be achieved the former system required a large amount of organo clay 2 2 g l 1 tian and gu 2018 and the latter used a high pressure hg lamp 500 w as the light source making them incomparable with current study chen et al 2020b as listed in table s3 compared with other systems we can conclude that in our developed uv diha system the e aq utilization efficiency is greatly improved since vast usage of indole compounds as e aq precursors might raise concerns on the potential toxicity and economic sustainability the low chemical usage μm level would to some extent relieve such concerns then the applicability of the uv diha system at different feeding ratios was also evaluated firstly by applying diha 0 from 24 2 to 242 μm the degradation efficiencies for the fixed pfoa 0 of 10 mg l 1 24 2 μm kept stable approaching 100 degradation in 2 h while the 12 h defluorination ratio increased from 41 to 82 fig 7 a the incomplete defluorination is probably due to the production of some fluorotelomer carboxylic acids and perfluorinated alcohols cnf2n 1 oh the formers are more recalcitrant for defluorination and the later ones are volatile park et al 2009 secondly at fixed diha 0 of 121 μm the 12 h defluorination efficiencies were only reduced within 10 as the increase of pfoa 0 from 1 to 50 mg l 1 2 42 121 μm fig 7b the stable performance of the diha system over a wide pfoa 0 range is probably because the reaction occurs on the highly concentrated diha nanosphere surface which would diminish the bulk concentration effect of pfoa furthermore the effects of various environmental factors on the degradation of pfoa were examined the diha pfoa of 5 1 mole mole system was applied for subsequent investigations for different initial phs 4 10 without buffer the solution ph was reduced by 0 5 3 0 ph units during the reaction fig s16 as the decomposition of both pfoa and diha could release protons nevertheless either acidic ph 4 0 or basic ph 10 0 condition did not affect the degradation efficiency while retarded the 12 h defluorination ratios within 10 20 fig 7c we propose that the densely positively charged diha nanospheres would exclude the protons and prevent them from interfering with the surface reaction nom is omnipresent in the environment although the co existing ha and fa would be simultaneously adsorbed by diha pfoa assemblies the presence of 10 mg l ha and fa only slightly inhibited the 12 h defluorination ratios by 7 and 16 respectively fig 7d the little competition of ha fa for adsorption fig 3c could explain the limited influence of ha fa on the degradation defluorination of pfass 3 6 treatment of actual water samples containing pfoa to verify the adaptability of our system the degradation defluorination performances of the uv diha system were further examined for three actual water samples all the water bodies were in neutral ph conditions and contained the total organic carbon contents from 8 16 to 28 1 mg l 1 notably the industrial wastewater had extremely high salinity e g 2278 mg l 1 cl and 929 mg l 1 na table s1 as shown in fig s1t by only applying 121 μm diha complete degradation of pfoa was accomplished within 12 h for all three samples and 58 9 66 5 defluorination rates were achieved suggesting the high efficiency and adaptability of the newly developed system therefore our results suggest that the uv diha system has the great potential for treatment of actual pfas containing wastewater 4 conclusion in this study we synthesized an amine functionalized and long chain alky modified indole derivative namely diha and applied it for adsorbing and photodegrading pfoa pfos the newly developed diha compound self assembled to form stable nanospheres in water which could be solely used as nano adsorbents with high adsorption efficiency and selectivity after treatment it can be readily removed by filtration which is promising for application this supramolecular approach provides a new prospect that soft materials owning long ranged vdw and hydrophobic interactions are promising for selectively adsorbing pfas molecules as diha can produce e aq under uv irradiation the diha nanocomposite can serve as a synchronal adsorption photodegradation material given that pfoa pfos were fully adsorbed on the surface of the diha nanospheres the photo generated e aq can efficiently react with pfoa pfos leading to high degradation defluorination rates the uv diha system shows its significant advantages of low chemical dosage requirement μm level and wide applicability with respect to different environmental variables it could be applied as a novel and practical treatment technology to remediate the pfas contaminated wastewater for better understanding its environmental implication the degradation mechanisms by considering the photolysis products and pathways need to be further revealed in the following study data

15476,per polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass contamination has caused worldwide health concerns and increased demand for effective elimination strategies herein we developed a new indole derivative decorated with a hexadecane chain and a tertiary amine center named di indole hexadecyl ammonium diha which can form stable nanospheres 100 200 nm in water via supramolecular assembly as the diha nanospheres can induce electrostatic hydrophobic and van der waals interactions all are long ranged that operative cooperatively in addition to the nano sized particles with large surface area the diha nanocomposite exhibited extremely fast adsorption rates in seconds high adsorption capacities 0 764 0 857 g g 1 and selective adsorption for perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos outperformed the previous reported high end pfass adsorbents simultaneously the diha nanospheres can produce hydrated electron e aq when subjected to uv irradiation with the virtue of constraining the photo generated e aq and the adsorbed pfoa pfos molecules entirely inside the nanocomposite as such the uv diha system exhibits extremely high degradation defluorination efficiency for pfoa pfos even under ambient conditions especially with the advantages of low chemical dosage requirement μm level and robust performance against environmental variables therefore it is a new attempt of using supramolecular approach to construct an indole based nanocomposite which can elegantly combine adsorption and degradation functions the novel diha nanoemulsion system would shed light on the treatment of pfas contaminated wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords supramolecular assembly perfluoroalkyl substances indole derivatives hydrated electron adsorption photodegradation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction per polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are a series of artificially synthesized per fluorinated alkyl chemicals with superior thermal and chemical stabilities pfass have been massively used as additives in widespread industrial and commercial products since the 1950s the extensive usage of pfass has caused severe environmental contamination of water air soil and food thereafter resulting in widespread public health threats d ambro et al 2021 lim 2019 penland et al 2020 rahman et al 2014 among all the pfass perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos draw the greatest concerns due to their known ubiquity persistence bioaccumulation and toxicity grandjean et al 2012 rich et al 2015 wang et al 2021a yeung et al 2017 although the stockholm convention has phased out pfoa and pfos their exemption for usage such as in aqueous fire fighting foams afff still causes continuous water and soil contamination nickerson et al 2021 wang et al 2014 have estimated that the post global emission of c4 c14 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas will go up to 6 420 tons from 2016 to 2030 and pfoa based products are still the dominant emissions in china and russia currently the reported pfoa pfos contamination in nature water and municipal wastewater could reach up to ppb level lenka et al 2021 schwichtenberg et al 2020 some manufacture discharge investigator derived wastewater and the fire extinguishing foam contaminated wastewater etc may contain much higher pfoa pfos concentrations at ppm level or higher moody et al 2003 tenorio et al 2020 therefore elimination of pfass from natural water and wastewater is vital lenka et al 2021 wang et al 2016 and this calls for high efficient cost effective and environmentally friendly pfas treatment involving adsorption and degradation technologies hydrated electron e aq based reduction techniques are promising for complete destruction of pfass in water because e aq is one of the rare candidates to directly cleave c f bond cui et al 2020 several compounds e g sulfite iodide nitrilotriacetic acid nta and indole derivatives have been investigated as e aq precursors by the excitation of uv irradiation chen et al 2021 qu et al 2010 sun et al 2018 tenorio et al 2020 however due to the strong quenching effect on e aq by proton and dissolved oxygen alkaline ph 9 and anaerobic conditions are generally required for the uv iodide uv sulfite and uv nta systems bentel et al 2020 song et al 2013 sun et al 2017 sun et al 2018 to overcome these deficiencies we previously applied cationic surfactant in association with indole acetic acid 3 iaa to construct a self assembled micelle confinement which could protect e aq from being undesirable consumption concentrate the pfass molecules and promote the e aq transfer efficiency chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b however without fully pre concentrating the e aq precursors and the target pollutants the e aq utilization efficiency is still unsatisfactory nevertheless this approach enlightens us to design more elegant indole structure based supramolecular assemblies with even higher affinity and selectivity for pfass supramolecular chemistry can provide versatile approaches to construct self assembled and multi functionalized organic materials for customized applications for example molecular recognition to target pollutants ateia et al 2020 guo et al 2010 terashima and sawamoto 2012 noncovalent interactions e g van der waals vdw electrostatic hydrogen bonding π π hydrophobic hydrophilic interaction metal ligand coordination etc are generally responsible for the supramolecular assembly processes qin et al 2020 rybtchinski 2011 several kinds of β cyclodextrin polymers one guanidinocalix 5 arene structure two metal organic framework mofs materials and several fluorous functionalized polymers have been reported to selectively recognize pfoa and pfos karoyo et al 2013 klemes et al 2019 koda et al 2014 kumarasamy et al 2020 li et al 2017 liu et al 2015 tan et al 2021 xiao et al 2017 zheng et al 2019 these supramolecular hosts have been applied as high end adsorbents to remove pfass from water with outstanding adsorption performance in that way it would be potentially feasible to incorporate the indole structure into a supramolecular polymeric system for the purpose of combining the adsorption and the e aq degradation functions synergistically for better treatment of pfass for this to be achieved decorating the indole structure with a hydrophobic alkyl chain might be a simple and worthwhile route to construct the copolymer assemblies the alkyl chain can provide hydrophobic and or weak vdw interactions within the polymer chains and can interact with the long chain pfas molecules tan et al 2021 urban et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 in addition in light of the previous findings that amine functionalized materials can selectively adsorb pfass ateia et al 2019a ji et al 2018 klemes et al 2019 amination of the indole compound could be another promising approach to provide electrostatic attraction to pfas molecules in this study we synthesized a new indole derivative named di indole hexadecyl ammonium diha that could form stable nanospheres to preferentially and selectively adsorb pfass in water its degradation defluorination performance to pfoa and pfos was also systemically explored due to the compact e aq attacking path in the nanospheres this novel material exhibited high e aq utilization efficiency

degradation and defluorination performances of the newly developed uv diha system for the treatment of pfoa were also tested for two natural surface water and one industral wastewater which were directly used without any pre treatment the sampling information and the water qualities of the three actual water samples were provided in table s1 it was noteworthy that no pfoa was detected in the the two natural water samples thereby 10 mg l 1 pfoa was artifically injected for investigation the industral wastewater contained 17 mg l 1 pfoa but was diluted to 10 mg l 1 for comparison the same photo reactor was used for the photodegradation experiments 2 6 md simulation and quantum chemical qc computation the self assembly process of diha diha was modeled by the md simulation in a 10 nm3 cubic water box using gromacs 2018 8 software abraham et al 2015 in conjunction with amber14sb for water molecule and gaff forcefield for diha diha and pfoa molecules the atomic charge type utilized in md simulation was resp2 0 5 the electrostatic and vdw interactions from one diha diha cluster to mono pfoa molecule were analyzed using the energy model of gmx2018 8 in order to evaluate the exact weak interactions between single diha or diha and pfoa the geometry optimization following with the weak interaction calculations were calculated by the methods of pbe0 def2 tzvp smd water and m06 2x def2 tzvp smz water respectively brémond et al 2016 walker et al 2013 a d3 dispersion correction was employed when calculating the intermolecular interactions grimme et al 2010 all qc calculations were carried out using gaussian 16 software frisch 2016 following wave function analysis by multiwfn lu and chen 2020 including esp vdw potential and independent gradient model igm analysis lefebvre et al 2017 3 results and discussions 3 1 synthesis and the properties of diha as shown in scheme 1 the novel indole compound was synthesized via the mannish reaction the obtained indole derivative is composed of one tertiary amine center bonded with two indole structures and one hexadecane chain fig s2 given the name as di indole hexadecyl ammonium diha chemical formula c34h49n3 the 1h nmr fig s3 and lc ms fig s4 characterizations confirmed the molecule structure of diha and the purity of the obtained chemical is 95 as indicated by the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy the diha material mainly contains c o n elements and no residual zn2 was detected figure s5 the newly developed diha shows stronger uv visible absorption 250 450 nm than the other representative indole derivatives 250 300 nm for 3 iaa indole donaxine fig s6 while its fluorescence emission is much weaker fig s7 suggesting that diha might possess stronger non radioactive dissipation due to the low water solubility diha was firstly dissolved in isopropanol then introduced into water with isopropanol water 0 2 v v upon introduction into water an emulsion suspension was formed immediately fig 1 a a probably because the strong hydrophobic interactions among diha molecules caused fast molecular association balakrishnan et al 2006 tan et al 2021 the diha emulsion could keep stable for weeks fig s8 a attributing to the positive surface zeta ζ potential of the diha nanocomposite fig 2 a which stems from the protonation of diha molecules the pk a value of diha is predicted to be 6 5 and is assigned at its tertiary amine n site https ilab acdlabs com ilab2 which is also the most electronegative site fig s9a as the increase of pfoa concentration the surface ζ potential of the system was gradually neutralized fig 2a indicating that pfoa was continuously adsorbed onto the diha nanocomposite which could be regard as a kind of supramolecular assemblies 3 2 the morphology of diha nanocomposite by observation of cryo tem fig 1b the pure diha existed as dispersed nanospheres of 100 200 nm fig 2b and tended to distribute on the carbon film rather than in the holes due to the strong hydrophobicity while for the diha pfoa 5 1 mol mol system the nanospheres became interlinked more spherical and less hydrophobic fig 1c suggesting that pfoa had been incorporated into the diha nanocomposites moreover for the diha pfoa 1 1 system the abundant pfoa molecules were mainly adsorbed on the shell of the nanospheres as indicated by the clear bilayer spheroidal structures of the nanospheres and the outer shell probably represented the adsorbed pfoa layer fig 1d when double molar concentration of pfoa was introduced diha pfoa 1 2 the surface ζ potential was neutralized fig 2a consequently the nanospheres tended to aggregate to larger particles and started to precipitate figs 2b and s8 e since diha molecules aggregated strongly in the water the bulk ph cannot drive spontaneous protonation or deprotonation of diha molecules inside the nanosphere therefore the diha pfoa 5 1 mole mole nanoemulsion system was quite stable under a wide ph range 4 10 as reflected by the surface ζ potential fig 2a and the particle size distribution fig 2c however the presence of ha and fa with the concentration range from 1 to 10 mg l 1 as well as the presence of inorganic salt of nacl from 1 to 100 mm could gradually reduce the surface ζ potential of the diha pfoa nanocomposite fig 2a and increase the particle size fig 2d e as increasing their concentrations it is probably because the diha pfoa nanocomposite could adsorb the negatively charged ha and fa while high ionic strength would compress the double electric layer of colloids leading to the aggregation 3 3 adsorption performance of diha to pfoa pfos both the cryo tem images fig 1c d and the surface ζ potential fig 2a have suggested the adsorption of pfoa by diha nanospheres furthermore on examination of the adsorption kinetics the diha nanospheres exhibited extremely fast adsorption rates based on a pseudo second order model ho and mckay 1999 with the k obs 1 327 g mg 1 h 1 for pfoa and 2964 g mg 1 h 1 for pfos which were at least 20 fold faster than other reported materials table s2 almost complete 99 7 99 9 adsorption of pfoa pfos with the initial concentration of 10 mg l 1 could be achieved in 10 s by applying a small amount of diha 121 μm and only 10 μg l 1 pfoa or 1 μg l 1 pfos was remained free in water after 2 min fig 3 a by comparison the reported pfas adsorbents e g activated carbon zhang et al 2019 resins yu et al 2009 all silica zeolite β van den bergh et al 2020 specific modified clays du et al 2017 wang et al 2021b mof material liu et al 2015 and polymers ateia et al 2019b ateia et al 2018 tan et al 2021 xiao et al 2017 etc usually required minutes to hours to attain adsorption equilibrium and the adsorption were usually incomplete for pfoa pfos at mg l 1 level table s2 moreover according to the langmuir adsorption isotherm model the adsorption capacities of diha for pfoa and pfos reached 0 857 g g 1 and 0 764 g g 1 respectively fig 3b which were higher than most of the reported materials table s2 although one fluorinated vermiculite and one certain ion exchange resin ia400 were reported to have comparable or even higher adsorption capacities their adsorption rate was much slower than diha du et al 2017 yu et al 2009 the applicability of adsorbents for pfass removal also requires good adsorption selectivity on examination of pfoa the diha nanospheres exhibited excellent adsorption selectivity against considerable amounts of in organic competitors as shown in fig 3c the carboxylic or phenolic substances e g benzoic acid oxalic acid and sodium alginate did not show any significant competition at 10 mm which was 413 fold higher than the pfoa concentration while the competition by octanoic acid was considerable the presence of 1 mm and 5 mm reaching its water solubility octanoic acid reduced the adsorption ratio of pfoa by 5 and 13 respectively besides representative humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa at 10 mg l 1 also did not inhibit the adsorption process the high salinity condition up to 100 mm nacl only slightly suppressed the pfoa adsorption by 8 the detailed comparison of the diha system with other reported high end adsorbents is listed in table s2 in general the exceptional adsorption performance of the diha material has outperformed all round in aspects of removal efficiency adsorption rate adsorption capacity and adsorption selectivity ateia et al 2019b 2018 du et al 2017 klemes et al 2019 van den bergh et al 2020 3 4 adsorption mechanism molecular dynamics md modeling was further conducted to simulate the formation of diha nanospheres and the interaction with pfoa as diha nanospheres were formed upon contacting with water fig 1a the formation of diha nanospheres should be accomplished before adsorbing pfoa according to its predicted pk a value 6 5 diha molecules with half number of the protonated species diha were introduced into the model to simulate neutral ph condition the self assembly of the diha diha molecule was simulated for 50 ns to obtain the stable separate clusters and the equilibrium configuration could be achieved within 20 ns fig s10a d however if only the uncharged diha molecules were introduced for modeling the diha molecules tended to assemble into a large single cluster due to the lack of electrostatic repulsion fig s11a c attributing to amine functionalization and protonation of the tertiary amine center the diha diha nanocomposite exhibits strong electron deficiency with the theoretical electrostatic potential esp extrema of 332 6 kj mol 1 fig 4 a suggesting the potentially high affinity with pfoa pfos liu et al 2021 which is electron rich fig s9b and its pk a value is 1 0 3 8 burns et al 2008 subsequently when pfoa anions were introduced into the md model at equivalent molar concentration as shown in figure s10e h pfoa anions were all adsorbed onto the shell of the diha diha nanospheres in 50 ns which fitted well with the cyto tem observation fig 1d notably as indicated by the vdw potential and esp dynamic during the md process both the vdw interaction and the electrostatic attraction contributed to adsorption process and the vdw interaction contributed more significantly fig 4b this was confirmed by further calculating the vdw potential iso surface where the pfoa molecules were indeed mainly adsorbed fig 4c furthermore two representative bi molecular assemblies i e diha pfoa and diha pfoa were selected from the clusters to calculate the potential weak intermolecular interactions as indicated in fig 4d e the significant vdw interaction was demonstrated as represented by the white strips between pfoa and diha while the carboxylate amino attraction δ c o δ h n only assisted the adsorption for diha pfoa while not for diha pfoa besides the weak electron donor acceptor interactions of c f π and c f h c were also highlighted the blue speckle the c f h c interaction could also be regarded as the weak hydrogen bond interaction zheng et al 2019 moreover as diha is extremely hydrophobic and pfoa is amphiphilic we suppose that the hydrophobic force also to some extent facilitates the adsorption process balakrishnan et al 2006 tan et al 2021 this could be indicated by the slight competitive adsorption by octanoic acid c8 fig 3c based on these observations the extremely fast adsorption rates and the high adsorption selectivity of the diha nanospheres would primarily be attributed to its super fine particle size at sub nanometer level which provides a large readily available surface area and greatly reduces the diffusion distance of pfoa pfos yu et al 2009 the diha diha clusters can induce electrostatic vdw and hydrophobic interactions simultaneously the hydrophobic interaction is a long range attraction force 0 10 nm israelachvili and pashley 1982 and the electrostatic interaction takes effect at distance 10 nm kanda et al 2002 meyer et al 2005 silbert et al 2012 although the vdw force is usually short ranged 1 nm they are additive when many diha molecules comprise together as one nanocomposite thus its operating radius is greatly increased all these long ranged interactions would induce rapid directional movement of free pfoa pfos molecules orienting to diha nanocomposite as long as pfoa pfos is adsorbed the fluorophilic effect would further increase the specific affinity with more pfoa pfos molecules du et al 2017 koda et al 2014 kumarasamy et al 2020 tan et al 2021 therefore all these multiple interactions cooperatively induce the fast adsorption rate and adsorption selectivity for pfoa pfos and the fast adsorption rate can facilitate the adsorption selectivity 3 5 photo degradation defluorination performance of diha to pfoa pfos since the diha material inherently contains the indole structure when subjected to uv 254 nm 36 w irradiation the diha nanocomposite can also serve as e aq nanoreactor to degrade defluorinate the adsorbed pfass the photo generated e aq was evidenced by the dmpo h signal of esr measurement fig 5 a the hydroxyl radical was also detected fig 5a it could be produced from the reaction of e aq with dissolved oxygen e a q h h o 2 h 2 o 2 o h e a q o 2 o 2 e a q o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 oh the carbon radical was probably from the diha radical or its debris fig 5a in addition using tempo a stable radical as the trapping agent it can capture e aq and transform into a singlet organic matter without paramagnetism chen et al 2022 as shown in fig 5b the triple peak signal of tempo reduced by 33 after irradiating by the uv light of 254 nm for 2 h in the diha tempo system compared to those in the pure tempo system it confirms the production of e aq in the uv diha system the production of e aq was also probed by the lfp measurement the broad peak at around 680 nm represented for the e aq signal fig s12 chen et al 2021 during the photolysis diha acts as the e aq precursor it could undergo self photodecomposition or be degraded by reactive oxygen species i e hydroxyl radicals produced in the system one intermediate with the m z 145 0455 was detected fig s13a b the decomposition pathway was proposed accompanied with the production of electrons and protons fig s13c although diha was generally consumed the uv diha system could keep high degradation efficiency in 12 h fig s14 suggesting that the degradation intermediate of diha is also capable of degrading pfoa since the diha pfas assemblies can provide a confined reaction zone for the photo generated e aq and the targeted pollutants the diha nanoemulsion can perform high degradation deflurination efficiency to the compactly adsorbed pfoa pfos even under the ambient condition room temperature neutral ph and open air as shown in fig 6 in the presence of 121 μm diha 10 mg l 1 24 2 μm pfoa could be degraded by 95 in 2 h with the defluorinated ratio of 51 after 12 h the residual pfoa was 15 μg l 1 and the defluorination ratio increased to 79 the presence of 0 2 isopropanol had little effect on the photolysis process we benchmarked the performance of diha nanocomposite against other e aq based systems only 21 28 degradation and 10 15 defluorination of pfoa were achieved in 12 h by applying equivalent concentrations of 3 iaa indole or donaxine fig s15 to obtain comparable degradation and defluorination efficiencies of pfoa the uv sulfite system required 10 mm sulfite furthermore alkaline ph and anaerobic conditions were also needed bentel et al 2019 for pfos which is usually much more persistent in other e aq systems bentel et al 2019 however almost the same degradation defluorination efficiency was obtained in our system and only 2 μg l 1 pfos was left after 12 h reaction fig 6 although in our previous uv organo clay 3 iaa and uv surfactant 3 iaa systems slightly higher defluorination ratio 90 of pfoa could be achieved the former system required a large amount of organo clay 2 2 g l 1 tian and gu 2018 and the latter used a high pressure hg lamp 500 w as the light source making them incomparable with current study chen et al 2020b as listed in table s3 compared with other systems we can conclude that in our developed uv diha system the e aq utilization efficiency is greatly improved since vast usage of indole compounds as e aq precursors might raise concerns on the potential toxicity and economic sustainability the low chemical usage μm level would to some extent relieve such concerns then the applicability of the uv diha system at different feeding ratios was also evaluated firstly by applying diha 0 from 24 2 to 242 μm the degradation efficiencies for the fixed pfoa 0 of 10 mg l 1 24 2 μm kept stable approaching 100 degradation in 2 h while the 12 h defluorination ratio increased from 41 to 82 fig 7 a the incomplete defluorination is probably due to the production of some fluorotelomer carboxylic acids and perfluorinated alcohols cnf2n 1 oh the formers are more recalcitrant for defluorination and the later ones are volatile park et al 2009 secondly at fixed diha 0 of 121 μm the 12 h defluorination efficiencies were only reduced within 10 as the increase of pfoa 0 from 1 to 50 mg l 1 2 42 121 μm fig 7b the stable performance of the diha system over a wide pfoa 0 range is probably because the reaction occurs on the highly concentrated diha nanosphere surface which would diminish the bulk concentration effect of pfoa furthermore the effects of various environmental factors on the degradation of pfoa were examined the diha pfoa of 5 1 mole mole system was applied for subsequent investigations for different initial phs 4 10 without buffer the solution ph was reduced by 0 5 3 0 ph units during the reaction fig s16 as the decomposition of both pfoa and diha could release protons nevertheless either acidic ph 4 0 or basic ph 10 0 condition did not affect the degradation efficiency while retarded the 12 h defluorination ratios within 10 20 fig 7c we propose that the densely positively charged diha nanospheres would exclude the protons and prevent them from interfering with the surface reaction nom is omnipresent in the environment although the co existing ha and fa would be simultaneously adsorbed by diha pfoa assemblies the presence of 10 mg l ha and fa only slightly inhibited the 12 h defluorination ratios by 7 and 16 respectively fig 7d the little competition of ha fa for adsorption fig 3c could explain the limited influence of ha fa on the degradation defluorination of pfass 3 6 treatment of actual water samples containing pfoa to verify the adaptability of our system the degradation defluorination performances of the uv diha system were further examined for three actual water samples all the water bodies were in neutral ph conditions and contained the total organic carbon contents from 8 16 to 28 1 mg l 1 notably the industrial wastewater had extremely high salinity e g 2278 mg l 1 cl and 929 mg l 1 na table s1 as shown in fig s1t by only applying 121 μm diha complete degradation of pfoa was accomplished within 12 h for all three samples and 58 9 66 5 defluorination rates were achieved suggesting the high efficiency and adaptability of the newly developed system therefore our results suggest that the uv diha system has the great potential for treatment of actual pfas containing wastewater 4 conclusion in this study we synthesized an amine functionalized and long chain alky modified indole derivative namely diha and applied it for adsorbing and photodegrading pfoa pfos the newly developed diha compound self assembled to form stable nanospheres in water which could be solely used as nano adsorbents with high adsorption efficiency and selectivity after treatment it can be readily removed by filtration which is promising for application this supramolecular approach provides a new prospect that soft materials owning long ranged vdw and hydrophobic interactions are promising for selectively adsorbing pfas molecules as diha can produce e aq under uv irradiation the diha nanocomposite can serve as a synchronal adsorption photodegradation material given that pfoa pfos were fully adsorbed on the surface of the diha nanospheres the photo generated e aq can efficiently react with pfoa pfos leading to high degradation defluorination rates the uv diha system shows its significant advantages of low chemical dosage requirement μm level and wide applicability with respect to different environmental variables it could be applied as a novel and practical treatment technology to remediate the pfas contaminated wastewater for better understanding its environmental implication the degradation mechanisms by considering the photolysis products and pathways need to be further revealed in the following study data

15477,microplastics mps are emerging pollutants detected everywhere in the environment with the potential to harm living organisms the present study investigated the concentration morphology and composition of mps between 20 μm and 5 mm in a drinking water treatment plant dwtp located close to barcelona catalonia ne spain the sampling included different units of the dwtp from influent to effluent as well as sludge line sampling strategy filtration allows sampling of large volumes of water avoiding sample contamination and during 8 h in order to increase the representativeness of mps collected the pre treatment of the samples consisted of advanced oxidation with fenton s reagent and hydrogen peroxide followed by density separation of the particles with zinc chloride solution visual identification was performed with an optical and stereoscopic microscope with final fourier transform infrared spectroscopic ftir confirmation mps were found in all dwtp samples with concentrations from 4 23 1 26 mps l to 0 075 0 019 mps l in the influent and effluent of the plant respectively the overall removal efficiency of the plant was 98 3 the most dominant morphology was fibers followed by fragments and films twenty two different polymer types were identified and synthetic cellulose polyester polyamide polypropylene polyethylene polyurethane and polyacrylonitrile were the most common although mps could be incorporated from the distribution network mps intake from drinking water from this dwtp was not an important route compared to fish and seafood ingestion keywords plastic pollution drinking water sludge removal ratios data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics mps are defined as an emergent pollutant that is ubiquitously detected in the natural environment marine and freshwater soil and air franco et al 2021 posing a threat to the health of living organisms alimi et al 2018 chen et al 2020 waring et al 2018 mps are synthetic non biodegradable polymers with a diameter size of less than 5 mm divided by origin they can be either primary directly manufactured microbeads and fibers or secondary breakdown of larger plastic primary mps come mainly from personal care products and textile fibers while secondary ones are from weathering photolysis and decomposition of discarded plastics in the environment expósito et al 2021 ziajahromi et al 2017 mps may act as vectors for environmental pollutants hazardous chemical additives and pathogen microorganisms which have the potential to be spread through the food chain prata 2018 rist et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2019 food and water intake have been identified as a route of exposure to mps they have been detected in numerous samples of commercially available seafood bottled water tap water honey and salt iñiguez et al 2017 liebezeit and liebezeit 2015 mason et al 2018 mintenig et al 2019 pivokonsky et al 2018 tanaka and takada 2016 yang et al 2015 to date toxicological studies on the possible effects of mps on human health have not been fully established revel et al 2018 who 2019 wright and kelly 2017 mainly due to challenges in the experimental design and determining the actual mps concentration to which organisms are exposed however a recent study found that mps could alter human microbiota tamargo et al 2022 it is worth noting that in addition to ingestion inhalation of mps present in the air as well as dermal contact are also routes of exposure that must be considered prata et al 2020 mps pollution receiving considerable attention is also evidenced by the number of publications that have drastically increased from 2011 until now sol et al 2020 additionally mps have been mentioned in the european drinking water directive 2020 to be included in the risk assessment of the dwtp and their supply system however there is a lack of published data addressing the problem of mps contamination in drinking water treatment plants dwtp wang et al 2020 drinking water treatment plants ensure the quality and safety of drinking water thus it is urgent to investigate the fate of mps in different treatment processes currently there are no legislative restrictions on the abundance of mps in drinking water novotna et al 2019 wang et al 2020 only a few studies investigated mps based on full scale dwtp pivokonský et al 2020 investigated the occurrence and fate of microplastic particles up to 1 μm at two different dwtps with advanced and conventional treatment systems within one river catchment in the czech republic and discovered a significant difference between them dwtp containing flocculation sedimentation sand filtration and granular activated carbon filtration units had mps removal efficiency higher than 80 unlike the other dwtp with flocculation and sand filtration units that had mps removal rate of only 40 other studies by wang et al 2020 and shen et al 2021 also reported a high removal rate of dwtps located in china both greater than 85 furthermore characterization of mps in eight dwtps located in the uk showed that is possible to eliminate over 99 99 of mps from their source water river groundwater or an upland reservoir leading to its accumulation in dry sludge johnson et al 2020 although mp s removal rates in dwtp are high several mps are still found in the effluents of dwtp investigating mps in a size range of 20 μm to 5000 μm mintenig et al 2019 reported that the concentration of mps in the german dwtp effluent was 0 007 mps l while dalmau soler et al 2021 reported the concentration of 0 06 0 04 mps l in the effluent of spanish dwtp for the same size range this study performed by dalmau soler et al 2021 investigated the presence of microplastics along the same river basin as in the present study however different drinking water treatment plant was observed the microplastic methodology is similar in both studies allowing better comparison of the results such as identification method ftir spectroscopy analyzed size 20μm to 5 mm and units used to report the mps levels mps l furthermore although the plant is different the treatments in both cases are similar where the plant from the previous study consists of clarifiers sand filtration ozonation gac filtration and ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis some studies have also found that during the water treatment in the plant the number of mps increases such as a recent study that reported the reduction of overall removal from 70 to 52 in a clearwell cherniak et al 2022 information about the presents of mps in the effluents of dwtp cannot be ignored since the treated water is intended for the local population the aim of the present study is to investigate the concentrations morphology and composition of mps in different treatment units of a river freshwater supplied dwtp including both water and sludge lines removal efficiency was calculated to determine which treatment unit had the greatest impact on mps removal and finally to estimate the intake of mps by drinking water from this source 2 materials and methods 2 1 drinking water treatment plant characteristics the studied dwtp of llobregat river is located near barcelona ne spain and has a treatment capacity of 3 2 m3 s the dwtp consists of the treatment units depicted in fig 1 briefly the first treatment is water roughing in which the surface river water ph 8 passes through bars that prevent large materials suspended in the water from entering the plant the water then flows through three grit channels potassium permanganate is added 0 5 1 5 mg l for the pre oxidation of organic and inorganic compounds in the next step the water enters the mixing chambers where ph is adjusted 7 4 7 7 with carbon dioxide and chemicals such as coagulants and flocculants aluminium polychloride 25 mg l and polydadmac 0 8 mg l were added for turbidity removal the water then goes to eight clarifiers pulsator where the flocs present in the water are sedimented and the excess sludge is discharged after clarification oxidation with chloride dioxide is performed the next process is filtration in two steps in twelve sand filters 70 cm thickness three of them are filled with two layers of sand 0 8 1 6 and 1 4 2 5 mm grain size and the other nine are filled with one layer 1 2 mm grain size together with sand filtralite material this step is used not only for physical filtration but also for biofiltration sand filtration processes were followed by a granular activated carbon gac filtration process 15 filters of 150 cm thickness norit gac1240 where part of the dissolved organic matter is adsorbed organochlorides part of the treated water with the conventional treatment undergoes microfiltration with 10 µm polypropylene cartridge filters and reversible electrodialysis edr which removes a high percentage of salt content in treated water then water is remineralized with calcium hydroxide in solution and carbon dioxide injection after that the remineralized water is mixed with the water non treated with microfiltration and edr units final disinfection is done with a sodium hypochlorite solution and water is stored in two tanks of 213 000 m3 before the distribution 2 2 sampling methodology microplastic samples from the 6 water line sampling points were obtained by filtration from dwtp in may 2021 for 8 h a total of 360l 3 replicates of 120l each of river water influent from the field inside the plant for 8 h were filtered through a set of stainless steel sieves cisa sieving technologies 200 mm diameter x 50 mm height with mesh size 20 50 100 500 and 1000 μm to avoid contamination the other water line samples were taken from the taps of the dwtp laboratory from the effluents of treatment units clarifier lines 1 n 7 and 2 n 7 sand filter n 3 and activated carbon filter unit n 3 and the effluent of the plant n 7 water was filtered through an in line stainless filter holder containing a ptfe filter sartorius 10 μm pore size connected to a tap for 8 h the total volumes of water sampling were 29l 28l 267l 600l and 965l for clarifier line 1 effluent clarifier line 2 effluent sand filter effluent carbon filter effluent and effluent of the plant respectively water volume filtered varied from one treatment unit s effluent to another according to the expected mps levels mintenig et al 2019 pivokonsky et al 2018 stainless steel sieves covered in aluminum foil and ptfe filters stored in glass petri dishes were immediately transferred to the laboratory for further analysis this sampling approach allows us to sample relatively large volumes of water near 1m3 in the effluent of the plant avoiding sample contamination and during large periods 8 h more information regarding sampled volume and the replicates are summarized in the supplementary data finally dry sludge 300n g n 1 and water from centrifugation process 5 l n 1 were taken from the operation unit of the sludge line in glass bottles pre cleaned with filtered water glass bottles were covered with aluminum foil to prevent contamination from the cap 2 3 analysis of samples in the laboratory in order to perform pre treatment of the samples the following chemicals and materials were used absolute ethanol scharlau 99 9 iron ii sulfate heptahydrate sigma aldrich 99 0 hydrogen peroxide pamreac applichem itw reagents 30 ptfe filter sartorius 5 and 10 μm pore size and zinc chloride acros organics 98 0 nowadays there are no standard procedures for measuring mps in drinking water treatment plants conesa and ortuño et al 2022 pre treatment of the samples was performed in order to extract mps and remove all organic and inorganic matter to avoid interference three versions of the same protocol are established in the laboratory based on the requirements and nature of the samples from highest organic matter content in dry sludge or centrifugated water to lowest organic matter content in water from clarifiers sand carbon filters or effluent in general the protocol consists of oxidation to remove organic matter oxidation with fenton s reagent was recommended by us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa for mps analysis in marine water masura et al 2015 and other authors have also used it as a purifying step in microplastic identification from different water samples sediments and organisms erni cassola et al 2017 karami et al 2016 hydrogen peroxide is another oxidizing agent that can digest organic matter with little or no polymer degradation nuelle et al 2014 qiu et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 in order to remove inorganic matter from the samples density separation was applied using a salt solution ziajahromi et al 2017 in the present work zinc chloride solution density 1 8 g ml was chosen because its density is suitable for successful extraction of high density microplastics such as polyvinyl chloride pvc density 1 16 1 58 g cm3 and polyethylene terephthalate pet density 1 37 1 45 g cm3 prata et al 2019a pre treatment methodology is summarized in fig 2 briefly the influent of dwtp was filtrated through stainless steel sieves cisa sieving technologies 200 mm diameter x 50 mm height with mesh sizes of 20 50 100 500 and 1000 μm each fraction was filtered through vacuum filter equipment on a 10 μm ptfe filter treated with fenton s reagent and sonicated for 10 min at 40 c the suspension was left for 24 h and was filtered again through a 10 μm ptfe filter density separation with zinc chloride solution 1 8 g ml was performed next the sample was sonicated at 40 c for 10 min and left for 4 12 h furthermore it was centrifugated at 3000 rpm for 1 min and the supernatant was filtered through a 10 μm ptfe filter the process was repeated three times on the same filter the quantity of organic and inorganic matter in the sieves with particle size 50 μm was not significantly high to interfere with mps identification and for this reason visual inspection was performed immediately and the oxidation process for organic matter removal was not carried out in contrast for particles between 20 and 50 μm the ptfe filters were treated with hydrogen peroxide 33 35 for 24 h samples of dry sludge and water from sludge centrifugation units were filtrated through stainless steel sieves with mesh sizes of 20 50 100 500 and 1000 μm in the laboratory and dried at 40 45 c for 3 4 days and the weight of dry material was recorded the methodology for processing was elaborated with a combination of steps and different sequences based in mintening et al 2017 prata et al 2019b ben david et al 2021 ziajahromi et al 2021 elkhatib and vinka craver 2020 methodologies in this study fenton s solution was applied for 24 h due to high organic matter content for clarifier lines 1 and 2 sand and carbon filters as well as treated water units of dwtp due to low organic and inorganic particle content on the ptfe filters were directly inspected taking into account mps size equal to or larger than 20 μm visual identification was performed for all filters of treatment units and after purification of the river and sludge samples with a stereoscopic microscope leica mz10 with 1 µm resolution and 80 x magnification coupled to flexacam c1 camera and docked screen of 32 cm light projected from above and below to get good image of surface structure and appearance in order to sort the particles according to their most common shapes fibers films and fragments bayo et al 2020 hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 lares et al 2018 as well as to quantify them particle shapes between 20 and 50 μm were then confirmed with an olympus cx41 optical microscope at 40 and 50x magnification and 400 and 500 x total magnification all particles identified were extracted from the filters and were taken to analysis for composition in order to determine the size of the mps imagej software was used previously calibrated with olympus objective micrometer reference 10 µm fiber length was registered and for fragments the mean between maximum and minimum diameter was registered 2 4 qualitative analysis after visual identification mps composition was analyzed by µftir and atr ftir spectroscopic techniques only for river water from sludge centrifugation and sludge samples of the total number of particles between 20 and 500 µm sub samples were extracted on calcium fluoride slides for maps elaboration due high quantity of possible plastic particles for subsample particles were chosen according to morphology color and appearance for every filter section until completing the entire filter area to ensure representativeness for other samples clarifiers sand carbon filter and effluent all particles detected were analyzed for their composition particles larger than 500 μm were analyzed by thermo scientific gladiatr highest performance nicolet diamond atr ftir spectrometer with omnic paradigm software the measurements were performed in reflection mode in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 with 16 scans at a spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 the background was done before analysis and every 6 samples infra red maps over calcium fluoride slides were performed for particles from 20 to 500 µm by µftir analysis or ultrafast mapping microscope thermo scientific nicolet in 10 with mct detector with pixel aperture 25x25 µm in transmission mode in the range of 715 4000 cm 1 with 4 scans at a spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 the spectra were analyzed with the omnic specta mcs software and the identification was obtained by comparing unknown spectra with databases such as hr nicolet sampler library hummel polymer sample library polymer laminate films wizard library as well as an own library that was generated with more than 80 spectra for all particles isolated from the treatment unit s samples such as clarifiers 1 and 2 sand filter activated carbon filter and treated water all particles 20 µm were placed over calcium fluoride slides for µftir analysis using leica stereoscopy microscope resolution of 1 µm to avoid the loss of mps for sludge water from sludge centrifugation and river samples in the ptfe filters containing particle sizes from 20 to 50 µm all particles were retired from the filter for composition analysis then for missing particles recruitment the filter was washed vigorously with hydrogen peroxide 33 35 for 24 h and filtered on siliceous filters 1 cm2 pore size 5 6 µm wide square shape 12 µm pore distance membrane thickness 500 µm the entire filter was checked first for some single particle presence with microscopy µftir and then µftir maps were elaborated for µ ftir maps an area of 3 mm2 was established randomly over siliceous filters considering interference absence and accurate ir spectra generation in that area a spectrum was made every 25 µm with a total of more than 15 000 spectra for analysis with omnic picta software and libraries selected as hr nicolet sampler library hummel polymer sample library polymer laminate films wizard library the µ ftir maps were obtained by reflection four scan accumulations the spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 and spectral range of 4000 715 cm 1 similarly all ptfe filters from all treatment units of dwtp were also treated with hydrogen peroxide 33 35 for 24 h and filtered over siliceous filters all siliceous filters were analyzed as above mentioned match spectra greater than or equal to 70 similarity to the reference spectra were accepted unidentified spectra were compared to two own libraries elaborated with more common plastics in the market and weathered fragments films and fibers from environmental samples applying the same criteria for reference spectra acceptance furthermore particles were analyzed according to their characteristic absorption band of each polymer chemical grouping bonds according to campbell et al 2000 and coates 2000 for frequencies ranging mostly from 3650 to 500 cm 1 1480 1430 cm 1 for cc aromatic ring stretching 1790 1700 cm 1 for double binding co stretching 2980 2780 cm 1 for ch stretching of aliphatic and 3150 3030 cm 1 of aromatics for aliphatic organohalogen natural and synthetic cellulose identification frequencies from 1150 to 550 cm 1 1200 1000 cm 1 1500 1200 cm 1 ch and coh bending modes 2900 2820 cm 1 ch stretching modes and from 3600 to 3000 cm 1 oh stretching modes were also evaluated the particles identified as plastic were added to the final quantification if the particle still could not be identified it was considered to be a definite unidentified category 2 5 quality control to avoid cross contamination ultrapure water was filtered through a 0 45 μm pore size filter gf f whatman 47 mm diameter nitrocellulose all equipment and materials were washed with filtered ultrapure water and 70 ethanol before sampling all reagents were prepared with filtered ultrapure water during the analysis of the samples in the laboratory only laboratory coats made of cotton were worn the extraction hoods were used during all sample pre treatment processes moreover procedural blank samples were collected in the field as well as in the laboratory and the corresponding corrections were applied to the results controls were applied during river sampling activities and consisted of two open petri dishes 90 cm in diameter to collect possible airborne fibers the results were 8 fibers 3 black 2 red and 3 blue and 6 fibers 3 black 2 blue and 1 red in control 1 and 2 respectively in consequence the maximum fibers value of 8 samples were removed of the final quantification result of the various ptfe filters analyzed from every sieve size used in river water filtration this selection was in a randomly way choosing several filters and removing the fibers according only by color and length inside the laboratory of dwtp for catchment samples were located two controls near of sampling pipelines that representing the outlet of each treatment unit two 60 mm petri dish was placed open near the sampling area while activity was developed the results were 0 particles in both controls for accurate results and due to the sample processing site in laboratory is not entirely free from fibers a deposition rate of airbone fibers was calculated prior to sample processing this rate was calculated for the laboratory workspace where the samples were processed the procedure was four open petri dishes 60 cm in diameter with ptfe filters were placed into similar distance in laboratory and covering the entire area for a month after that the fibers deposited were quantified and referred by filter area and time with a result of 0 04 fibers cm2 day considering a pfte filter area of 17 4 cm2 1 fiber was randomly subtracted from each analyzed filter needed organic matter or turbidity removals finally in the procedural blank mps fibers films or fragments were not found for the detection of particles lost through the different steps of the sample treatment a recovery test n 3 was conducted per sample batch spiking a mix of colored polyethylene spheres with diameters from 53 to 500 μm cospheric inc california usa in water and sludge samples the recovery rates in sludge were 75 and 91 for 53 63 μm 74 and 95 for 125 150 μm 70 and 95 for 250 300 μm and 100 and 100 for 425 500 μm for sludge and water samples no degradation signs i e mechanical damages fragmentations or chemical attacks were observed on spheres the methods applied in the present work fulfill almost all minimum requirements established by schymanski et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 abundance and removal of microplastic particles in the water line of dwtp microplastic particles were detected in all water samples from influent to effluent table 1 presents the mps concentrations removal efficiency and sizes for each treatment unit in the water line due to the morphological characteristics of the fibers and their large length width ratio they were not categorized in size fractions yet their size can be found in supplementary data the concentration of mps in the dwtp influent raw water was 4 23 1 26 mps l the most abundant mps concentration was between 500 and 100 µm 43 followed by a fraction of 100 50 µm 30 considering films and fragments these results are lower than the results published by pivokonský et al 2020 whose concentration for raw water was 1296 mps l and 23 mps l for advanced and conventional treatment in the dwtp located in the czech republic respectively the different results are mainly caused by different size ranges as the previous study investigate mps up to 1 µm another study by mintenig et al 2019 determined concentrations of mps larger than 20 µm in raw water that ranged from 0 to 0 007 mps l although raw water refers to groundwater extraction at least 30 m deep in germany other studies conducted in european rivers found mps mean levels of 12 42 and 5 53 mps m3 in rhone tet and elbe river respectively constant et al 2020 however influent water cannot be representative of river water and water from the mediterranean river here studied are not comparable to the rivers of northern or central europe only a recent study dalmau soler et al 2021 was found regarding the same river that feeds the dwtp here studied with similar mps levels along the river basin concentration was ranging from non detected to 3 6 mps l while the mean concentration in the influent of dwtp was 0 96 0 46 mps l still data on the presents of mps in water in mediterranean rivers is very scarce guerranti et al 2020 however the differences between methodologies lack of standardization and size ranges of analyzed mps make difficult these comparisons the overall mps removal rate was 98 3 from 4 23 1 26 mps l in raw water to 0 075 0 019 mps l in the effluent considering each treatment unit clarifier eliminated the most of mps between 63 and 67 depending on the water line studied the most abundant size fraction for both clarifiers was between 500 and 100 µm considering films and fragments subsequently the sand filter increases the removal efficiency up to 99 where the concentration of 0 038 0 025 mps l was found in the effluent of this treatment unit previous research by dalmau soler et al 2021 and li et al 2020 also reported that the first treatment stage coagulation sedimentation in clarifiers and sand filtration had the highest impact on mps removal investigating full scale dwtps as well as some lab scale studies by ma et al 2019 furthermore a recent study by cherniak et al 2022 found that coagulation flocculation and sedimentation accounted for the highest removal 70 however negligible additional removal was observed in the filtration unit 1 the next treatment unit the activated carbon filter does not increase significantly the removal efficiency with a level of 0 032 0 025 mps l in their effluent by contrast after the microfiltration electrodialysis and remineralization stage an increase of mps content from 0 032 to 0 075 0 019 mps l was observed wang et al 2020 observed similar behavior in the effluent of the ozonation unit leading to an increase in small and fibrous mps the reason may be that the mps in this operating unit broke down due to the shear force of the water flow horton et al 2017 johnson et al 2020 noted that there is a possibility of mps generated within dwtp itself while dalmau soler et al 2021 performed migration tests to check this theory and the results suggested that mps can be released from dwtp when the materials are old however this probably does not occur at normal dwtp working conditions our speculation was that remineralization of the treated water with calcium hydroxide and post chlorination with sodium hypochlorite probably added particles to the effluent water these mps pollution could come from solid reagents ca oh 2 packaged with plastic chlorination or pollution coming from the resuspension of storage tanks however more studies are needed to elucidate this nevertheless the removal efficiency of dwtp in this study 98 3 is higher than the ones observed in other european plants that ranged from 70 to 90 pivokonsky et al 2018 pivokonský et al 2020 other work performed in a pilot station established a removal rate of mps fibers and fragments in 81 and 89 respectively in absence of coagulant and 96 and 97 respectively in presence of coagulant negrete velasco et al 2022 when comparing different water treatment plants in the same river basin the removal rate reported was similar with an overall value of 93 dalmau soler et al 2021 certainly direct comparison between the studies should be taken with caution due to differences in dwtp technology mp sampling sample pre treatment analytical identification methods to differences related to spatial variations and sampling location novotna et al 2019 regarding the dwtp effluent the concentration was 0 075 0 019 mps l fraction between 100 and 50 μm most abundant considering films and fragments which is higher by one order of magnitude than the average value determined in a german dwtp that catch underground water mintenig et al 2019 of 0 007 mps l potable water from eight dwtps within the uk had similar results typically less than 0 002 mps l accounted for mps 25 μm johnson et al 2020 and also similar to effluent water of spanish dwtp located in the same river basin dalmau soler et al 2021 with mps levels ranging from 0 03 to 0 11 mp l on the contrary these values were much lower than the values reported by wang et al 2020 of 930 71 mps l in the effluent of one of the largest advanced drinking water plant located in china the typical capacity of this plant is 120 million m3 day compared to the treatment plant in our study with a treatment capacity of only 276 480 m3 day a recent study investigated tap water samples from different developed countries including france germany japan and the united states showing much higher results than the ones obtained in the present study with the mps concentration ranging from 1 9 to 225 mps l and the overall mean concentration of 39 44 mps l size range 19 2 μm to 4200 μm mukotaka et al 2021 kosuth et al 2018 also investigated mps in the tap water from 14 different countries in europe america asia and africa with the concentration ranging from 0 to 61 mps l and the overall mean of 5 45 mps l size range 100 to 5000 μm the highest concentration of 61 mps l was found in the usa while the four lowest means were from european union countries non detected 0 91 1 82 1 83 mps l for italy germany france and ireland respectively however it should take into account the low volumes 0 5 l of water analyzed by this study kosuth et al 2018 in some cases mps concentration could vary from the effluent of dwtp to tap water since the household pipes made from durable plastic pvc pe and pa could contribute to the increase of mps in the tap water over time mintenig et al 2019 tong et al 2020 however shen et al 2021 reported no difference between these two samples the morphology of mps has also been investigated and visually categorized into three main shape types fragments films and fibers bayo et al 2020 hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 lares et al 2018 fig 3 shows that fiber morphology was the most prevalent in dwtp influent similarly reported by other authors cherniak et al 2022 dalmau soler et al 2021 sarkar et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the proportion of fibers decreased while treatment advanced from 77 mps l in raw water to 27 mps l in the effluent several explanations are present regarding the better removal of fibers especially in the first treatment steps fibers are more likely to form flocs and settle katrivesis et al 2019 since they are usually heavier polymers such as polyamide pa or nylon density 1 15 g cm3 polyester pes density 1 38 g cm3 and cellulose acetate ca density 1 30 g cm3 and their chemical structure can facilitate attachment to coagulant flocs such as carbonyl co chemical groups of pes or pet xue et al 2022 also pa fibers can be ionized depending on ph media and interact with coagulants and flocculants furthermore the surface of mps has an impact on its removal so the rougher the surface the better the removal shahi et al 2020 it is most likely that these synthetic fibers in the water environments are released from washing machines napper and thompson 2016 fragments and films are microplastics that remain in the effluent water and are more difficult to remove during the treatment process with an abundance of 47 and 26 respectively fig 4 shows different morphology types detected in the influent and effluent of dwtp 3 2 abundance of microplastic particles in the sludge line of dwtp microplastic removed from the water during the treatment process tends to accumulate in the sludge conesa and ortuño 2022 dry sludge and water from sludge centrifugation unit mps concentration are depicted in table 2 water from the sludge centrifugation unit had a mps concentration of 194 mps l dominated by particles of sizes ranging from 2000 to 1000 μm fig 5 a fibers were more than 75 of mps detected in water from the sludge centrifugation unit the concentration in the dry sludge was 14 360 mps kgw w or 35 680 mps kgdw the highest concentration of particles was between 500 and 100 µm followed by a fraction of 100 50 µm fig 5b fibers were again the most abundant morphology in general however it can be observed that their concentration decreases from larger size ranges 2000 1000 µm to the smallest 50 20 µm where film and fragment type increases significantly high fiber content was in line with high removal efficiency from treated water another study also collected sludge produced during the water treatment process at four dwtps in the uk the results varied extremely from non detected to 86 000 mps g dw the authors commented that more samples are necessary to understand such variations johnson et al 2020 taking into account the results obtained in our study we suggest that both dry sludge and water from sludge centrifugation should be properly managed as waste avoiding agricultural uses or its return to the river in order not to transmit contamination to terrestrial ecosystems the implementation of new technologies that enable the removal of mps from sludge as well as from environmental samples is definitely needed in order to move forward towards a circular economy for plastic waste and to protect the environment sol et al 2020 3 3 composition of microplastic particles each sample after visual inspection and particle quantification was photographed with leica flexacam c1 ic90 e icc50 w e camera and subject to final confirmation with ftir spectroscopic technique for this purpose mps maps were elaborated in fig 6 can be seen µftir map for the influent of dwtp a total of 345 particles were confirmed and 22 different polymers were identified however the most common were synthetic cellulose pes polypropylene pp pa and polyethylene pe fig 7 in addition pet and polystyrene ps were also found pivokonský et al 2020 reported similar results for the most commonly observed mps in almost every sample ca pet pvc pe and pp synthetic cellulose rayon cellulose acetate was found in all samples with a high abundance from 24 to 53 although some authors in previous studies reported it as a non plastic particle wang et al 2020 yu et al 2016 in the present study it was considered a synthetic polymer and was included in the quantification of the microplastics one of the reasons was that after pre treatment of the samples cellulose did not degrade which should happen in the case of natural material indicating synthetic origin all of these polymers are commonly used materials cellulose pes and pa are synthetic fibers used in the textile industry pe is used for reusable bags trays containers toys and household utensils while pp is used for food packaging pipes car parts etc plasticeurope 2021 other polymers detected in this study were polyurethane pu pet polyacrylonitrile pan tygon b 44 4 polymer a new generation polymer with high content of pvc and silicon but without phthalates with abundance 5 which are included in fig 7 and polycarbonate pc ps pvc polybutadiene pbd polyisobutene pib polymethyl methacrylate pmma polyvinyl acetate pva polyvinyl stearate pp pe copolymer epoxy resin alkyl resin ethylene vinyl alcohol ethylene vinyl acetate evoh eva fluoroelastomer synthetic rubber with abundance 5 the proportions of materials with low abundance in dwtp units 5 are denoted as other considering mps composition and morphology fibers in the water line were made of synthetic cellulose pes pa pan and to a lesser extent of pmma while fragments and films are mainly made of pp pe pa and to a lesser extent of pu polyvinyl stearate pp pe and pet for dry sludge besides the main fiber composition synthetic cellulose pes and pa fibers made of pan pe pp copolymer and pp were also detected to a lesser extent fragments and films in sludge were made of pe pp pa and to a lesser extent pet pvc and pu some polymers that are detected in the effluent of dwtp were not found in the influent opening the possibility of mps generated within dwtp itself however to confirm this statement more proofs are needed due to the covid 19 pandemic and the global use of disposable masks that are consisting of polymers such as pes pp and ps in the following years is expected a significant increase in its concentration in freshwater sources xu and ren 2021 according to the present results assuming a water consumption per capita of around 1 0 l day martínez et al 2017 all tap water coming from this dwtp and no extra incorporation of mp in distribution pipelines the annual intake of mp through drinking tap water was set at 27 mp person year this mps intake through drinking water is negligible compared with another study that set the annual ingestion of mps via food and beverages between 39 000 and 52 000 items year cox et al 2019 most probably seafood is one of the top three contributors to mps human consumption especially in the countries like japan with a much greater dietary proportion of seafood with the highest estimation of 104 2 g day leading to daily consumption of 154 mps cox et al 2019 micha et al 2015 another study catarino et al 2018 indicated that mps ingestion by a human via wild mussels is minimal compared to exposure via household fibers fallout during a meal they predicted a concentration of 123 mps year capita in the uk for mps ingestion by humans via consumption of mussels and it can go to 4620 mps year capita in countries with higher shellfish consumption such as france belgium and spain by comparison fiber exposure during a meal via dust fallout in a household was estimated to be 13 731 68 415 mps year capita 4 conclusions microplastic particles are detected in all samples within dwtp but their concentration varies significantly in general the operation of a drinking water treatment plant with respect to the reduction of microplastic particles is effective and with elevated removal efficiency clarifiers together with the sand filtration unit had the greatest impact on mps reduction 99 however an increase in microplastic particles in the dwtp effluent was observed and the final removal efficiency was 98 3 which is still higher than the values reported for other european drinking water treatment plants it should be noted that direct comparison between the papers is challenging since to date there is no standardized analytical method for mps identification as observed in the case of wastewater treatment plants microplastic particles that are removed during treatment processes tend to accumulate in the sludge especially synthetic fibers that are coming from washing machines both sludge and the centrifuged water must be properly managed as waste avoiding agricultural uses or its return to the river not to transmit contamination to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems new technologies should be implemented that enable the mps removal from the sludge declaration of competing interest the

15477,microplastics mps are emerging pollutants detected everywhere in the environment with the potential to harm living organisms the present study investigated the concentration morphology and composition of mps between 20 μm and 5 mm in a drinking water treatment plant dwtp located close to barcelona catalonia ne spain the sampling included different units of the dwtp from influent to effluent as well as sludge line sampling strategy filtration allows sampling of large volumes of water avoiding sample contamination and during 8 h in order to increase the representativeness of mps collected the pre treatment of the samples consisted of advanced oxidation with fenton s reagent and hydrogen peroxide followed by density separation of the particles with zinc chloride solution visual identification was performed with an optical and stereoscopic microscope with final fourier transform infrared spectroscopic ftir confirmation mps were found in all dwtp samples with concentrations from 4 23 1 26 mps l to 0 075 0 019 mps l in the influent and effluent of the plant respectively the overall removal efficiency of the plant was 98 3 the most dominant morphology was fibers followed by fragments and films twenty two different polymer types were identified and synthetic cellulose polyester polyamide polypropylene polyethylene polyurethane and polyacrylonitrile were the most common although mps could be incorporated from the distribution network mps intake from drinking water from this dwtp was not an important route compared to fish and seafood ingestion keywords plastic pollution drinking water sludge removal ratios data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics mps are defined as an emergent pollutant that is ubiquitously detected in the natural environment marine and freshwater soil and air franco et al 2021 posing a threat to the health of living organisms alimi et al 2018 chen et al 2020 waring et al 2018 mps are synthetic non biodegradable polymers with a diameter size of less than 5 mm divided by origin they can be either primary directly manufactured microbeads and fibers or secondary breakdown of larger plastic primary mps come mainly from personal care products and textile fibers while secondary ones are from weathering photolysis and decomposition of discarded plastics in the environment expósito et al 2021 ziajahromi et al 2017 mps may act as vectors for environmental pollutants hazardous chemical additives and pathogen microorganisms which have the potential to be spread through the food chain prata 2018 rist et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2019 food and water intake have been identified as a route of exposure to mps they have been detected in numerous samples of commercially available seafood bottled water tap water honey and salt iñiguez et al 2017 liebezeit and liebezeit 2015 mason et al 2018 mintenig et al 2019 pivokonsky et al 2018 tanaka and takada 2016 yang et al 2015 to date toxicological studies on the possible effects of mps on human health have not been fully established revel et al 2018 who 2019 wright and kelly 2017 mainly due to challenges in the experimental design and determining the actual mps concentration to which organisms are exposed however a recent study found that mps could alter human microbiota tamargo et al 2022 it is worth noting that in addition to ingestion inhalation of mps present in the air as well as dermal contact are also routes of exposure that must be considered prata et al 2020 mps pollution receiving considerable attention is also evidenced by the number of publications that have drastically increased from 2011 until now sol et al 2020 additionally mps have been mentioned in the european drinking water directive 2020 to be included in the risk assessment of the dwtp and their supply system however there is a lack of published data addressing the problem of mps contamination in drinking water treatment plants dwtp wang et al 2020 drinking water treatment plants ensure the quality and safety of drinking water thus it is urgent to investigate the fate of mps in different treatment processes currently there are no legislative restrictions on the abundance of mps in drinking water novotna et al 2019 wang et al 2020 only a few studies investigated mps based on full scale dwtp pivokonský et al 2020 investigated the occurrence and fate of microplastic particles up to 1 μm at two different dwtps with advanced and conventional treatment systems within one river catchment in the czech republic and discovered a significant difference between them dwtp containing flocculation sedimentation sand filtration and granular activated carbon filtration units had mps removal efficiency higher than 80 unlike the other dwtp with flocculation and sand filtration units that had mps removal rate of only 40 other studies by wang et al 2020 and shen et al 2021 also reported a high removal rate of dwtps located in china both greater than 85 furthermore characterization of mps in eight dwtps located in the uk showed that is possible to eliminate over 99 99 of mps from their source water river groundwater or an upland reservoir leading to its accumulation in dry sludge johnson et al 2020 although mp s removal rates in dwtp are high several mps are still found in the effluents of dwtp investigating mps in a size range of 20 μm to 5000 μm mintenig et al 2019 reported that the concentration of mps in the german dwtp effluent was 0 007 mps l while dalmau soler et al 2021 reported the concentration of 0 06 0 04 mps l in the effluent of spanish dwtp for the same size range this study performed by dalmau soler et al 2021 investigated the presence of microplastics along the same river basin as in the present study however different drinking water treatment plant was observed the microplastic methodology is similar in both studies allowing better comparison of the results such as identification method ftir spectroscopy analyzed size 20μm to 5 mm and units used to report the mps levels mps l furthermore although the plant is different the treatments in both cases are similar where the plant from the previous study consists of clarifiers sand filtration ozonation gac filtration and ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis some studies have also found that during the water treatment in the plant the number of mps increases such as a recent study that reported the reduction of overall removal from 70 to 52 in a clearwell cherniak et al 2022 information about the presents of mps in the effluents of dwtp cannot be ignored since the treated water is intended for the local population the aim of the present study is to investigate the concentrations morphology and composition of mps in different treatment units of a river freshwater supplied dwtp including both water and sludge lines removal efficiency was calculated to determine which treatment unit had the greatest impact on mps removal and finally to estimate the intake of mps by drinking water from this source 2 materials and methods 2 1 drinking water treatment plant characteristics the studied dwtp of llobregat river is located near barcelona ne spain and has a treatment capacity of 3 2 m3 s the dwtp consists of the treatment units depicted in fig 1 briefly the first treatment is water roughing in which the surface river water ph 8 passes through bars that prevent large materials suspended in the water from entering the plant the water then flows through three grit channels potassium permanganate is added 0 5 1 5 mg l for the pre oxidation of organic and inorganic compounds in the next step the water enters the mixing chambers where ph is adjusted 7 4 7 7 with carbon dioxide and chemicals such as coagulants and flocculants aluminium polychloride 25 mg l and polydadmac 0 8 mg l were added for turbidity removal the water then goes to eight clarifiers pulsator where the flocs present in the water are sedimented and the excess sludge is discharged after clarification oxidation with chloride dioxide is performed the next process is filtration in two steps in twelve sand filters 70 cm thickness three of them are filled with two layers of sand 0 8 1 6 and 1 4 2 5 mm grain size and the other nine are filled with one layer 1 2 mm grain size together with sand filtralite material this step is used not only for physical filtration but also for biofiltration sand filtration processes were followed by a granular activated carbon gac filtration process 15 filters of 150 cm thickness norit gac1240 where part of the dissolved organic matter is adsorbed organochlorides part of the treated water with the conventional treatment undergoes microfiltration with 10 µm polypropylene cartridge filters and reversible electrodialysis edr which removes a high percentage of salt content in treated water then water is remineralized with calcium hydroxide in solution and carbon dioxide injection after that the remineralized water is mixed with the water non treated with microfiltration and edr units final disinfection is done with a sodium hypochlorite solution and water is stored in two tanks of 213 000 m3 before the distribution 2 2 sampling methodology microplastic samples from the 6 water line sampling points were obtained by filtration from dwtp in may 2021 for 8 h a total of 360l 3 replicates of 120l each of river water influent from the field inside the plant for 8 h were filtered through a set of stainless steel sieves cisa sieving technologies 200 mm diameter x 50 mm height with mesh size 20 50 100 500 and 1000 μm to avoid contamination the other water line samples were taken from the taps of the dwtp laboratory from the effluents of treatment units clarifier lines 1 n 7 and 2 n 7 sand filter n 3 and activated carbon filter unit n 3 and the effluent of the plant n 7 water was filtered through an in line stainless filter holder containing a ptfe filter sartorius 10 μm pore size connected to a tap for 8 h the total volumes of water sampling were 29l 28l 267l 600l and 965l for clarifier line 1 effluent clarifier line 2 effluent sand filter effluent carbon filter effluent and effluent of the plant respectively water volume filtered varied from one treatment unit s effluent to another according to the expected mps levels mintenig et al 2019 pivokonsky et al 2018 stainless steel sieves covered in aluminum foil and ptfe filters stored in glass petri dishes were immediately transferred to the laboratory for further analysis this sampling approach allows us to sample relatively large volumes of water near 1m3 in the effluent of the plant avoiding sample contamination and during large periods 8 h more information regarding sampled volume and the replicates are summarized in the supplementary data finally dry sludge 300n g n 1 and water from centrifugation process 5 l n 1 were taken from the operation unit of the sludge line in glass bottles pre cleaned with filtered water glass bottles were covered with aluminum foil to prevent contamination from the cap 2 3 analysis of samples in the laboratory in order to perform pre treatment of the samples the following chemicals and materials were used absolute ethanol scharlau 99 9 iron ii sulfate heptahydrate sigma aldrich 99 0 hydrogen peroxide pamreac applichem itw reagents 30 ptfe filter sartorius 5 and 10 μm pore size and zinc chloride acros organics 98 0 nowadays there are no standard procedures for measuring mps in drinking water treatment plants conesa and ortuño et al 2022 pre treatment of the samples was performed in order to extract mps and remove all organic and inorganic matter to avoid interference three versions of the same protocol are established in the laboratory based on the requirements and nature of the samples from highest organic matter content in dry sludge or centrifugated water to lowest organic matter content in water from clarifiers sand carbon filters or effluent in general the protocol consists of oxidation to remove organic matter oxidation with fenton s reagent was recommended by us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa for mps analysis in marine water masura et al 2015 and other authors have also used it as a purifying step in microplastic identification from different water samples sediments and organisms erni cassola et al 2017 karami et al 2016 hydrogen peroxide is another oxidizing agent that can digest organic matter with little or no polymer degradation nuelle et al 2014 qiu et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 in order to remove inorganic matter from the samples density separation was applied using a salt solution ziajahromi et al 2017 in the present work zinc chloride solution density 1 8 g ml was chosen because its density is suitable for successful extraction of high density microplastics such as polyvinyl chloride pvc density 1 16 1 58 g cm3 and polyethylene terephthalate pet density 1 37 1 45 g cm3 prata et al 2019a pre treatment methodology is summarized in fig 2 briefly the influent of dwtp was filtrated through stainless steel sieves cisa sieving technologies 200 mm diameter x 50 mm height with mesh sizes of 20 50 100 500 and 1000 μm each fraction was filtered through vacuum filter equipment on a 10 μm ptfe filter treated with fenton s reagent and sonicated for 10 min at 40 c the suspension was left for 24 h and was filtered again through a 10 μm ptfe filter density separation with zinc chloride solution 1 8 g ml was performed next the sample was sonicated at 40 c for 10 min and left for 4 12 h furthermore it was centrifugated at 3000 rpm for 1 min and the supernatant was filtered through a 10 μm ptfe filter the process was repeated three times on the same filter the quantity of organic and inorganic matter in the sieves with particle size 50 μm was not significantly high to interfere with mps identification and for this reason visual inspection was performed immediately and the oxidation process for organic matter removal was not carried out in contrast for particles between 20 and 50 μm the ptfe filters were treated with hydrogen peroxide 33 35 for 24 h samples of dry sludge and water from sludge centrifugation units were filtrated through stainless steel sieves with mesh sizes of 20 50 100 500 and 1000 μm in the laboratory and dried at 40 45 c for 3 4 days and the weight of dry material was recorded the methodology for processing was elaborated with a combination of steps and different sequences based in mintening et al 2017 prata et al 2019b ben david et al 2021 ziajahromi et al 2021 elkhatib and vinka craver 2020 methodologies in this study fenton s solution was applied for 24 h due to high organic matter content for clarifier lines 1 and 2 sand and carbon filters as well as treated water units of dwtp due to low organic and inorganic particle content on the ptfe filters were directly inspected taking into account mps size equal to or larger than 20 μm visual identification was performed for all filters of treatment units and after purification of the river and sludge samples with a stereoscopic microscope leica mz10 with 1 µm resolution and 80 x magnification coupled to flexacam c1 camera and docked screen of 32 cm light projected from above and below to get good image of surface structure and appearance in order to sort the particles according to their most common shapes fibers films and fragments bayo et al 2020 hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 lares et al 2018 as well as to quantify them particle shapes between 20 and 50 μm were then confirmed with an olympus cx41 optical microscope at 40 and 50x magnification and 400 and 500 x total magnification all particles identified were extracted from the filters and were taken to analysis for composition in order to determine the size of the mps imagej software was used previously calibrated with olympus objective micrometer reference 10 µm fiber length was registered and for fragments the mean between maximum and minimum diameter was registered 2 4 qualitative analysis after visual identification mps composition was analyzed by µftir and atr ftir spectroscopic techniques only for river water from sludge centrifugation and sludge samples of the total number of particles between 20 and 500 µm sub samples were extracted on calcium fluoride slides for maps elaboration due high quantity of possible plastic particles for subsample particles were chosen according to morphology color and appearance for every filter section until completing the entire filter area to ensure representativeness for other samples clarifiers sand carbon filter and effluent all particles detected were analyzed for their composition particles larger than 500 μm were analyzed by thermo scientific gladiatr highest performance nicolet diamond atr ftir spectrometer with omnic paradigm software the measurements were performed in reflection mode in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 with 16 scans at a spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 the background was done before analysis and every 6 samples infra red maps over calcium fluoride slides were performed for particles from 20 to 500 µm by µftir analysis or ultrafast mapping microscope thermo scientific nicolet in 10 with mct detector with pixel aperture 25x25 µm in transmission mode in the range of 715 4000 cm 1 with 4 scans at a spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 the spectra were analyzed with the omnic specta mcs software and the identification was obtained by comparing unknown spectra with databases such as hr nicolet sampler library hummel polymer sample library polymer laminate films wizard library as well as an own library that was generated with more than 80 spectra for all particles isolated from the treatment unit s samples such as clarifiers 1 and 2 sand filter activated carbon filter and treated water all particles 20 µm were placed over calcium fluoride slides for µftir analysis using leica stereoscopy microscope resolution of 1 µm to avoid the loss of mps for sludge water from sludge centrifugation and river samples in the ptfe filters containing particle sizes from 20 to 50 µm all particles were retired from the filter for composition analysis then for missing particles recruitment the filter was washed vigorously with hydrogen peroxide 33 35 for 24 h and filtered on siliceous filters 1 cm2 pore size 5 6 µm wide square shape 12 µm pore distance membrane thickness 500 µm the entire filter was checked first for some single particle presence with microscopy µftir and then µftir maps were elaborated for µ ftir maps an area of 3 mm2 was established randomly over siliceous filters considering interference absence and accurate ir spectra generation in that area a spectrum was made every 25 µm with a total of more than 15 000 spectra for analysis with omnic picta software and libraries selected as hr nicolet sampler library hummel polymer sample library polymer laminate films wizard library the µ ftir maps were obtained by reflection four scan accumulations the spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 and spectral range of 4000 715 cm 1 similarly all ptfe filters from all treatment units of dwtp were also treated with hydrogen peroxide 33 35 for 24 h and filtered over siliceous filters all siliceous filters were analyzed as above mentioned match spectra greater than or equal to 70 similarity to the reference spectra were accepted unidentified spectra were compared to two own libraries elaborated with more common plastics in the market and weathered fragments films and fibers from environmental samples applying the same criteria for reference spectra acceptance furthermore particles were analyzed according to their characteristic absorption band of each polymer chemical grouping bonds according to campbell et al 2000 and coates 2000 for frequencies ranging mostly from 3650 to 500 cm 1 1480 1430 cm 1 for cc aromatic ring stretching 1790 1700 cm 1 for double binding co stretching 2980 2780 cm 1 for ch stretching of aliphatic and 3150 3030 cm 1 of aromatics for aliphatic organohalogen natural and synthetic cellulose identification frequencies from 1150 to 550 cm 1 1200 1000 cm 1 1500 1200 cm 1 ch and coh bending modes 2900 2820 cm 1 ch stretching modes and from 3600 to 3000 cm 1 oh stretching modes were also evaluated the particles identified as plastic were added to the final quantification if the particle still could not be identified it was considered to be a definite unidentified category 2 5 quality control to avoid cross contamination ultrapure water was filtered through a 0 45 μm pore size filter gf f whatman 47 mm diameter nitrocellulose all equipment and materials were washed with filtered ultrapure water and 70 ethanol before sampling all reagents were prepared with filtered ultrapure water during the analysis of the samples in the laboratory only laboratory coats made of cotton were worn the extraction hoods were used during all sample pre treatment processes moreover procedural blank samples were collected in the field as well as in the laboratory and the corresponding corrections were applied to the results controls were applied during river sampling activities and consisted of two open petri dishes 90 cm in diameter to collect possible airborne fibers the results were 8 fibers 3 black 2 red and 3 blue and 6 fibers 3 black 2 blue and 1 red in control 1 and 2 respectively in consequence the maximum fibers value of 8 samples were removed of the final quantification result of the various ptfe filters analyzed from every sieve size used in river water filtration this selection was in a randomly way choosing several filters and removing the fibers according only by color and length inside the laboratory of dwtp for catchment samples were located two controls near of sampling pipelines that representing the outlet of each treatment unit two 60 mm petri dish was placed open near the sampling area while activity was developed the results were 0 particles in both controls for accurate results and due to the sample processing site in laboratory is not entirely free from fibers a deposition rate of airbone fibers was calculated prior to sample processing this rate was calculated for the laboratory workspace where the samples were processed the procedure was four open petri dishes 60 cm in diameter with ptfe filters were placed into similar distance in laboratory and covering the entire area for a month after that the fibers deposited were quantified and referred by filter area and time with a result of 0 04 fibers cm2 day considering a pfte filter area of 17 4 cm2 1 fiber was randomly subtracted from each analyzed filter needed organic matter or turbidity removals finally in the procedural blank mps fibers films or fragments were not found for the detection of particles lost through the different steps of the sample treatment a recovery test n 3 was conducted per sample batch spiking a mix of colored polyethylene spheres with diameters from 53 to 500 μm cospheric inc california usa in water and sludge samples the recovery rates in sludge were 75 and 91 for 53 63 μm 74 and 95 for 125 150 μm 70 and 95 for 250 300 μm and 100 and 100 for 425 500 μm for sludge and water samples no degradation signs i e mechanical damages fragmentations or chemical attacks were observed on spheres the methods applied in the present work fulfill almost all minimum requirements established by schymanski et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 abundance and removal of microplastic particles in the water line of dwtp microplastic particles were detected in all water samples from influent to effluent table 1 presents the mps concentrations removal efficiency and sizes for each treatment unit in the water line due to the morphological characteristics of the fibers and their large length width ratio they were not categorized in size fractions yet their size can be found in supplementary data the concentration of mps in the dwtp influent raw water was 4 23 1 26 mps l the most abundant mps concentration was between 500 and 100 µm 43 followed by a fraction of 100 50 µm 30 considering films and fragments these results are lower than the results published by pivokonský et al 2020 whose concentration for raw water was 1296 mps l and 23 mps l for advanced and conventional treatment in the dwtp located in the czech republic respectively the different results are mainly caused by different size ranges as the previous study investigate mps up to 1 µm another study by mintenig et al 2019 determined concentrations of mps larger than 20 µm in raw water that ranged from 0 to 0 007 mps l although raw water refers to groundwater extraction at least 30 m deep in germany other studies conducted in european rivers found mps mean levels of 12 42 and 5 53 mps m3 in rhone tet and elbe river respectively constant et al 2020 however influent water cannot be representative of river water and water from the mediterranean river here studied are not comparable to the rivers of northern or central europe only a recent study dalmau soler et al 2021 was found regarding the same river that feeds the dwtp here studied with similar mps levels along the river basin concentration was ranging from non detected to 3 6 mps l while the mean concentration in the influent of dwtp was 0 96 0 46 mps l still data on the presents of mps in water in mediterranean rivers is very scarce guerranti et al 2020 however the differences between methodologies lack of standardization and size ranges of analyzed mps make difficult these comparisons the overall mps removal rate was 98 3 from 4 23 1 26 mps l in raw water to 0 075 0 019 mps l in the effluent considering each treatment unit clarifier eliminated the most of mps between 63 and 67 depending on the water line studied the most abundant size fraction for both clarifiers was between 500 and 100 µm considering films and fragments subsequently the sand filter increases the removal efficiency up to 99 where the concentration of 0 038 0 025 mps l was found in the effluent of this treatment unit previous research by dalmau soler et al 2021 and li et al 2020 also reported that the first treatment stage coagulation sedimentation in clarifiers and sand filtration had the highest impact on mps removal investigating full scale dwtps as well as some lab scale studies by ma et al 2019 furthermore a recent study by cherniak et al 2022 found that coagulation flocculation and sedimentation accounted for the highest removal 70 however negligible additional removal was observed in the filtration unit 1 the next treatment unit the activated carbon filter does not increase significantly the removal efficiency with a level of 0 032 0 025 mps l in their effluent by contrast after the microfiltration electrodialysis and remineralization stage an increase of mps content from 0 032 to 0 075 0 019 mps l was observed wang et al 2020 observed similar behavior in the effluent of the ozonation unit leading to an increase in small and fibrous mps the reason may be that the mps in this operating unit broke down due to the shear force of the water flow horton et al 2017 johnson et al 2020 noted that there is a possibility of mps generated within dwtp itself while dalmau soler et al 2021 performed migration tests to check this theory and the results suggested that mps can be released from dwtp when the materials are old however this probably does not occur at normal dwtp working conditions our speculation was that remineralization of the treated water with calcium hydroxide and post chlorination with sodium hypochlorite probably added particles to the effluent water these mps pollution could come from solid reagents ca oh 2 packaged with plastic chlorination or pollution coming from the resuspension of storage tanks however more studies are needed to elucidate this nevertheless the removal efficiency of dwtp in this study 98 3 is higher than the ones observed in other european plants that ranged from 70 to 90 pivokonsky et al 2018 pivokonský et al 2020 other work performed in a pilot station established a removal rate of mps fibers and fragments in 81 and 89 respectively in absence of coagulant and 96 and 97 respectively in presence of coagulant negrete velasco et al 2022 when comparing different water treatment plants in the same river basin the removal rate reported was similar with an overall value of 93 dalmau soler et al 2021 certainly direct comparison between the studies should be taken with caution due to differences in dwtp technology mp sampling sample pre treatment analytical identification methods to differences related to spatial variations and sampling location novotna et al 2019 regarding the dwtp effluent the concentration was 0 075 0 019 mps l fraction between 100 and 50 μm most abundant considering films and fragments which is higher by one order of magnitude than the average value determined in a german dwtp that catch underground water mintenig et al 2019 of 0 007 mps l potable water from eight dwtps within the uk had similar results typically less than 0 002 mps l accounted for mps 25 μm johnson et al 2020 and also similar to effluent water of spanish dwtp located in the same river basin dalmau soler et al 2021 with mps levels ranging from 0 03 to 0 11 mp l on the contrary these values were much lower than the values reported by wang et al 2020 of 930 71 mps l in the effluent of one of the largest advanced drinking water plant located in china the typical capacity of this plant is 120 million m3 day compared to the treatment plant in our study with a treatment capacity of only 276 480 m3 day a recent study investigated tap water samples from different developed countries including france germany japan and the united states showing much higher results than the ones obtained in the present study with the mps concentration ranging from 1 9 to 225 mps l and the overall mean concentration of 39 44 mps l size range 19 2 μm to 4200 μm mukotaka et al 2021 kosuth et al 2018 also investigated mps in the tap water from 14 different countries in europe america asia and africa with the concentration ranging from 0 to 61 mps l and the overall mean of 5 45 mps l size range 100 to 5000 μm the highest concentration of 61 mps l was found in the usa while the four lowest means were from european union countries non detected 0 91 1 82 1 83 mps l for italy germany france and ireland respectively however it should take into account the low volumes 0 5 l of water analyzed by this study kosuth et al 2018 in some cases mps concentration could vary from the effluent of dwtp to tap water since the household pipes made from durable plastic pvc pe and pa could contribute to the increase of mps in the tap water over time mintenig et al 2019 tong et al 2020 however shen et al 2021 reported no difference between these two samples the morphology of mps has also been investigated and visually categorized into three main shape types fragments films and fibers bayo et al 2020 hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 lares et al 2018 fig 3 shows that fiber morphology was the most prevalent in dwtp influent similarly reported by other authors cherniak et al 2022 dalmau soler et al 2021 sarkar et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the proportion of fibers decreased while treatment advanced from 77 mps l in raw water to 27 mps l in the effluent several explanations are present regarding the better removal of fibers especially in the first treatment steps fibers are more likely to form flocs and settle katrivesis et al 2019 since they are usually heavier polymers such as polyamide pa or nylon density 1 15 g cm3 polyester pes density 1 38 g cm3 and cellulose acetate ca density 1 30 g cm3 and their chemical structure can facilitate attachment to coagulant flocs such as carbonyl co chemical groups of pes or pet xue et al 2022 also pa fibers can be ionized depending on ph media and interact with coagulants and flocculants furthermore the surface of mps has an impact on its removal so the rougher the surface the better the removal shahi et al 2020 it is most likely that these synthetic fibers in the water environments are released from washing machines napper and thompson 2016 fragments and films are microplastics that remain in the effluent water and are more difficult to remove during the treatment process with an abundance of 47 and 26 respectively fig 4 shows different morphology types detected in the influent and effluent of dwtp 3 2 abundance of microplastic particles in the sludge line of dwtp microplastic removed from the water during the treatment process tends to accumulate in the sludge conesa and ortuño 2022 dry sludge and water from sludge centrifugation unit mps concentration are depicted in table 2 water from the sludge centrifugation unit had a mps concentration of 194 mps l dominated by particles of sizes ranging from 2000 to 1000 μm fig 5 a fibers were more than 75 of mps detected in water from the sludge centrifugation unit the concentration in the dry sludge was 14 360 mps kgw w or 35 680 mps kgdw the highest concentration of particles was between 500 and 100 µm followed by a fraction of 100 50 µm fig 5b fibers were again the most abundant morphology in general however it can be observed that their concentration decreases from larger size ranges 2000 1000 µm to the smallest 50 20 µm where film and fragment type increases significantly high fiber content was in line with high removal efficiency from treated water another study also collected sludge produced during the water treatment process at four dwtps in the uk the results varied extremely from non detected to 86 000 mps g dw the authors commented that more samples are necessary to understand such variations johnson et al 2020 taking into account the results obtained in our study we suggest that both dry sludge and water from sludge centrifugation should be properly managed as waste avoiding agricultural uses or its return to the river in order not to transmit contamination to terrestrial ecosystems the implementation of new technologies that enable the removal of mps from sludge as well as from environmental samples is definitely needed in order to move forward towards a circular economy for plastic waste and to protect the environment sol et al 2020 3 3 composition of microplastic particles each sample after visual inspection and particle quantification was photographed with leica flexacam c1 ic90 e icc50 w e camera and subject to final confirmation with ftir spectroscopic technique for this purpose mps maps were elaborated in fig 6 can be seen µftir map for the influent of dwtp a total of 345 particles were confirmed and 22 different polymers were identified however the most common were synthetic cellulose pes polypropylene pp pa and polyethylene pe fig 7 in addition pet and polystyrene ps were also found pivokonský et al 2020 reported similar results for the most commonly observed mps in almost every sample ca pet pvc pe and pp synthetic cellulose rayon cellulose acetate was found in all samples with a high abundance from 24 to 53 although some authors in previous studies reported it as a non plastic particle wang et al 2020 yu et al 2016 in the present study it was considered a synthetic polymer and was included in the quantification of the microplastics one of the reasons was that after pre treatment of the samples cellulose did not degrade which should happen in the case of natural material indicating synthetic origin all of these polymers are commonly used materials cellulose pes and pa are synthetic fibers used in the textile industry pe is used for reusable bags trays containers toys and household utensils while pp is used for food packaging pipes car parts etc plasticeurope 2021 other polymers detected in this study were polyurethane pu pet polyacrylonitrile pan tygon b 44 4 polymer a new generation polymer with high content of pvc and silicon but without phthalates with abundance 5 which are included in fig 7 and polycarbonate pc ps pvc polybutadiene pbd polyisobutene pib polymethyl methacrylate pmma polyvinyl acetate pva polyvinyl stearate pp pe copolymer epoxy resin alkyl resin ethylene vinyl alcohol ethylene vinyl acetate evoh eva fluoroelastomer synthetic rubber with abundance 5 the proportions of materials with low abundance in dwtp units 5 are denoted as other considering mps composition and morphology fibers in the water line were made of synthetic cellulose pes pa pan and to a lesser extent of pmma while fragments and films are mainly made of pp pe pa and to a lesser extent of pu polyvinyl stearate pp pe and pet for dry sludge besides the main fiber composition synthetic cellulose pes and pa fibers made of pan pe pp copolymer and pp were also detected to a lesser extent fragments and films in sludge were made of pe pp pa and to a lesser extent pet pvc and pu some polymers that are detected in the effluent of dwtp were not found in the influent opening the possibility of mps generated within dwtp itself however to confirm this statement more proofs are needed due to the covid 19 pandemic and the global use of disposable masks that are consisting of polymers such as pes pp and ps in the following years is expected a significant increase in its concentration in freshwater sources xu and ren 2021 according to the present results assuming a water consumption per capita of around 1 0 l day martínez et al 2017 all tap water coming from this dwtp and no extra incorporation of mp in distribution pipelines the annual intake of mp through drinking tap water was set at 27 mp person year this mps intake through drinking water is negligible compared with another study that set the annual ingestion of mps via food and beverages between 39 000 and 52 000 items year cox et al 2019 most probably seafood is one of the top three contributors to mps human consumption especially in the countries like japan with a much greater dietary proportion of seafood with the highest estimation of 104 2 g day leading to daily consumption of 154 mps cox et al 2019 micha et al 2015 another study catarino et al 2018 indicated that mps ingestion by a human via wild mussels is minimal compared to exposure via household fibers fallout during a meal they predicted a concentration of 123 mps year capita in the uk for mps ingestion by humans via consumption of mussels and it can go to 4620 mps year capita in countries with higher shellfish consumption such as france belgium and spain by comparison fiber exposure during a meal via dust fallout in a household was estimated to be 13 731 68 415 mps year capita 4 conclusions microplastic particles are detected in all samples within dwtp but their concentration varies significantly in general the operation of a drinking water treatment plant with respect to the reduction of microplastic particles is effective and with elevated removal efficiency clarifiers together with the sand filtration unit had the greatest impact on mps reduction 99 however an increase in microplastic particles in the dwtp effluent was observed and the final removal efficiency was 98 3 which is still higher than the values reported for other european drinking water treatment plants it should be noted that direct comparison between the papers is challenging since to date there is no standardized analytical method for mps identification as observed in the case of wastewater treatment plants microplastic particles that are removed during treatment processes tend to accumulate in the sludge especially synthetic fibers that are coming from washing machines both sludge and the centrifuged water must be properly managed as waste avoiding agricultural uses or its return to the river not to transmit contamination to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems new technologies should be implemented that enable the mps removal from the sludge declaration of competing interest the

15478,pathogenic microorganisms pose a global threat to public health and environment common antibacterial chemicals produce toxic residues inevitably harming the environment electrolyzed oxidizing water eow a promising environment friendly alternative disinfectant still lacks effective production processes sufficient bactericidal efficacy and stability while the enabling physico chemical mechanisms remain unclear here we report for the first time an effective hybrid plasma electrochemical eow production process and reveal the mechanisms by combining nonthermal plasmas and a two chamber electrochemical cell separated by a cation exchange membrane cem for decoupling the chemical reactions during the plasma treatment of water experimental results demonstrate that combined chlorine chloramine was the main chlorine product in the plasma enhanced eow p eow without a membrane owing to the consumption of free chlorine cl2 hocl clo by plasma generated reactive nitrogen species with a cem in the plasma electrolysis system and through controlling the plasma discharge polarity the production of free chlorine and other reactive species can be selectively controlled with the highest concentration of free chlorine obtained in the negative plasma enhanced eow np eow according to the transportation of cations by the cem the high concentrations of free chlorine may be attributed to the higher consuptions of h in cathode cell of negative plasma the study of antibacterial ability of eow produced under different conditions revealed that staphylococcus aureus cells were best inactivated by the np eow with cem which is mainly attributed to the higher concentration of free chlorine this study demonstrates the feasibility of plasma enhanced microbial electrolytic disinfection and offers new insights into the fundamental aspects of p eow chemistries for the future development of sustainable efficient and cost effective multipurpose sustainable chemical technologies for water research and treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrolyzed oxidizing water plasma activated water atmospheric pressure plasma cation exchange membrane data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microbes exist everywhere in our surroundings and play vital roles in the fields of food medicine agriculture and ecosystems sagova mareckova et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 zitvogel et al 2018 some microorganisms with an outstanding ability to degrade various organic compounds can be used to clean stubborn contaminants and some moulds can contribute to the production of different types of foods food supplements or even pharmaceuticals huang et al 2020 thibeault et al 2021 however harmful microbes may cause pathogenic diseases to living organisms and bacteria induced contaminations or damages to food materials and instruments can lead to major economic losses numerous approaches for sterilization have been extensively investigated including heating ultraviolet irradiation and using chemical disinfectants klampfl et al 2012 however these approaches suffer from limited ranges of processing subjects low sterilization efficiency production of toxic by products of health and environmental concerns and some other issues therefore environmentally benign and effective alternatives for sterilization are urgently needed to ensure sufficient antibacterial efficiency and minimal environmental impact electrolyzed oxidizing water eow also named acidic electrolyzed water is one of the promising broad spectrum biocidal agents for microbial decontamination kim et al 2021 eow is commonly produced by the electrolysis of a dilute nacl solution in an electrochemical cell equipped with anode and cathode electrodes there is an alkaline equivalent of electrolyzed water in cathode cell because of the exsitence of ion exchange membrane the biochemical activity of eow is directly linked to the presence of the highly reactive chlorine species rcs and reactive oxygen species ros produced in water including free chlorine cl2 hocl clo chlorine radicals cl cl2 huang et al 2016 hydroxyl radicals oh and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 jeong et al 2006 it is well known that electrochemical parameters including electrode materials types of membranes cell voltage current density reaction time and ph define the eow production methods however the disinfection efficacy of eow produced from the current electrochemical systems is still unsatisfactory due to the relatively low concentrations of these highly reactive species and the potential deterioration of eow stability when exposed to light and the ambient environment further enhancement of antimicrobial efficacy of eow can be achieved by combining the electrochemical processes with other technologies such as uv or visible light irradiation giving rise to photo assisted electrochemical disinfection systems wherein electrogenerated mediators are photo activated by the irradiation resulting in an increased generation of oxidizing agents in the bulk solution however the photo assisted electrochemical approach can only employ renewable solar energy to drive the chemical reactions but show a relatively long processing time for the desirable performance due to the limitation of weak photo currents and the electrochemical approach needs electricity to power the process but leading to fast and effective reactions for potential applications cold atmospheric plasmas provide a promising sustainable alternative approach to produce reactive physical and chemical agents such as uv electrons ions neutral species excited atoms and free radical xu et al 2021 which have been successfully applied in biomedical environmental food and agricultural applications judee et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 similar to eow plasma activated water paw produced by reactions between the plasma generated reactive species and water molecules is also regarded as a viable green solution featuring high antibacterial activity the biochemical activity of paw is directly linked to the presence of the highly reactive oxygen and nitrogen species rons in water as well as the high oxidation reduction potential and low or high ph value depending on the gas and reaction conditions rumbach et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 2020 the typical half lifetimes of long lived no2 and no3 are days months or longer in vitro the half life of h2o2 is 10 5 s in vivo and hours days months or longer in vitro yan et al 2021 if saline water is treated by plasma free chlorine could also be produced in paw which play a key role in bactericidal effects similar to the eow an et al 2019 liu et al 2017 therefore developing a hybrid plasma electrochemical system to effectively control and reveal the mechanisms of generation of reactive chemical species in eow is vital for eow related biological environmental and industrial applications various combinations of plasma and electrochemical processes have recently been explored for nanomaterials synthesis water purification and sustainable ammonia production gao et al 2003 hawtof et al 2019 sun et al 2021 these innovative methods rely on a plasma replacing the metal cathode in an electrochemical process while the reactions take place at a gas liquid interface instead of a solid liquid interface importantly the non equilibrium plasma electrons and other species are injected into the solution to react at the interface however plasma liquid interactions involve multiple physio chemical processes such as ion injection neutral species dissolution electron bombardment electrolysis and uv photon induced photolysis rumbach et al 2013 this is why it is very challenging if possible at all to decouple the plasma specific and conventional electrochemical effects in the hybrid system in addition the influence of plasmas on the eow production and the biochemical activity of the plasma enhanced eow p eow along with identifying the crucial reactive species responsible for the sterilization have not been explored this study aims to explore and compare the antimicrobial efficacy of saline activated by the plasma enhanced electrolysis and electrolysis only systems and gain a deeper insight into the physio chemical processes of plasma water interactions using an ion exchange membrane iem and reveal the plausible mechanisms that regulate the biochemical activity of p eow in applications the ions transportation between anode and cathode of iem relys on the interactions with the water mobility and polymer dynamics foglia et al 2022 in this context a hybrid plasma electrochemical system for p eow production is developed by combining a customized nonthermal plasma source and an electrochemical cell as shown in scheme 1 to simplify the complex reactions in the plasma electrochemical system and decouple the electrochemical behavior of the anode and cathode cells a cation exchange membrane cem which can selectively pass through aqueous cations e g na and h is employed to separate the anode and cathode cell chambers intentional addition of cem does not change the original reaction system yet enables the generation and sorting of unique ionic or radical species that are impossible in common electrolysis owing to the cem two distinct solutions are obtained after electrochemical reactions namely the acidic solution from the anode cell and the alkaline solution from the cathode cell for comparison an anion exchange membrane aem which can selectively pass through anions and a bipolar membrane bpm for which h2o in the membrane is dissociated into h and oh and then migrate to the cathode and anode cell respectively are also employed in this study the concentrations of reactive species including long lived species no2 no3 h2o2 ammonia nitrogen and chlorine produced in the saline solution from the plasma enhanced electrolysis and electrolysis only systems with or without cem are determined staphylococcus aureus s aureus is selected as a model microbial organism to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy of the eow and p eow produced under different conditions as shown in scheme 1 we demonstrate a new solution combining the eow with atmospheric pressure plasmas to inactivated microbes effectively further in depth analyses of the plasma electrochemical reactions and the inactivation mechanisms behind the p eow enhanced water sterilization are studied further studies reveal the plausible mechanisms of the achieved excellent p eow stability 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the cation exchange membrane anion exchange membrane and bipolar membrane were purchased from fumatech germany the physical and chemical features of these three membranes are listed in table s1 including thickness ion exchange capacity selectivity water splitting efficiency and ion transport rate the surface morphologies of these membranes are shown in fig s1 saline solution 0 9 nacl was purchased from yuyitang china amplexr red and griess reagents were purchased from beyotime china the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd reagents were purchased from hach usa all chemicals were used as received without further purification 2 2 plasma electrochemical system the atmospheric pressure plasma jet appj used in this work was custom designed to operate with the electrochemical cell and induced the targeted reactions as shown in fig 1 a a hollow stainless steel needle with an outer and inner diameter of 0 8 and 0 5 mm was used as the electrode of the plasma jet source a platinum pt needle with a diameter of 0 5 mm was another electrode for the plasma system the he flow rate was controlled by mass flow controllers brookes 5850e with a constant rate of 0 2 standard liter per minute slm the dc power supply with the output voltage in a range of 0 24 kv was connected to the hollow stainless steel electrode which was positioned above 3 mm from the liquid surface the other side of the pt electrode that inserted in the saline was connected to the dc power supply in a series of resistance r1 and r2 the resistor r1 of 10 mω was used to ensure the stability of the plasma discharge while the resistor r2 of 1 kω was used to measure the discharge current the electrolysis only system had a very similar structure where the hollow stainless steel needle was replaced with another pt needle to enable effective control of the reactive chemistries the reaction cell containing 3 ml saline solution was divided into two parts using a cem during the experiment the phase averaged current was measured using an oscilloscope mdo34 tektronix and was set to be the same for the hybrid plasma electrochemical system and the individual electrochemical system 150 μa when the hollow stainless steel was connected to the anode or cathode of the dc power supply the plasma jet was considered as a positive or negative plasma jet respectively with the same discharge current the applied voltage waveforms in fig 1 b were similar for the positive and negative plasma jets the discharge current of the positive and negative plasma jet had repetitive pulses with a cycle time of 20 and 30 μs respectively the discharge current waveform of the positive one was similar to the previous study wang and shashurin 2017 while the current waveform for electrolysis under same current had a constant shape during the processing during the plasma electrolysis current pulses mainly originate from the breakdown of gas molecules which also results in plasma ignition no matter whether a dc or other power supplies are employed moreover the negative ions accumulated in the gas gap can result in electron avalanches and then positive ions move toward the cathode which makes the electron ionization ceases and results in a marked decrease of current until the normal gradients are restored trichel 1938 leading to a repetitive behavior of the pulses in contrast the conventional electrolysis produces a constant and stable current for inducing electrochemical reactions 2 3 physicochemical measurements of p eow the ph and orp value of the treated solution was measured with a ph meter mettler toledo fe20 and an orp meter mettler toledo s210 respectively the amplex red reagent and the griess reagent was employed to detect h2o2 and no2 no3 concentrations respectively their absolute concentrations were measured by a microplate reader thermo scientific varioskan flash reader the concentration of free chlorine combined chlorine and nitrogen concentrations were determined by the dpd method measured by the hach dr3900 spectrophotometer the detection limits of the instruments for h2o2 no2 and no3 are 1 2 and 2 μmol l respectively and for the free chlorine combined chlorine and ammonia nitrogen are 0 02 0 02 and 0 1 mg l respectively all measurements of these species were performed following the protocols provided by assay manufacturers 2 4 bacterial inactivation the preparation method of staphylococcus aureus s aureus was described in our previous work xia et al 2019 the od600 value of the bacteria cells for this work was resuspended to 2 and the s aureus suspension was incubated with the treated saline solution for 5 min then was dropped onto tsb agar plates serially and incubated at 37 overnight finally the numbers of surviving bacteria were calculated by the grown colony forming units cfus 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in ph and orp values of the solution produced by plasma electrolysis and electrolysis only with or without cem the cases of the cell reactions with and without a cem are compared to investigate the aqueous reactive species produced in the plasma electrolysis or electrolysis only systems the change of ph and orp values of the cell solution treated by the plasma jet and electrolysis are presented in fig 2 when the cem is installed in the cell the ph of the solution in the anode cell decreases with time while that in the cathode cell increases with time irrespective of the discharge mode the lowest ph value around 3 is obtained in the anode cell of the positive plasma jet with a discharge time of 15 min when a positive plasma jet is ignited in the cell with cem electrolytic reactions 1 3 deborde and von gunten 2008 kim et al 2021 and acidification reactions 4 5 machala et al 2019 pandis and seinfeld 1989 of the plasma in the anode cell make the solution acidic while reactions 6 in the cathode cell induced by electrolysis make the solution alkaline in the case of a negative plasma jet ignited in the cell with cem the electrolytic reactions in the anode cell and cathode cell also make the solution acidic and alkaline respectively however the plasma induced acidification reactions in the cathode cell make the solution ph lower than that of the positive plasma jet when the cell without a membrane is exposed to the positive plasma jet the cell solution also becomes acidic but the ph value decreases slower than that of the cem case as shown in fig 2 a in contrast the ph values of the solution almost remain stable for the negative plasma electrolysis and electrolysis only systems in the positive plasma electrochemical system the concurrent plasma water interactions and electrochemical reactions can produce numerous h ions in the chemical forms of hclo hno2 and hno3 though these species can be neutralized by oh ions from the cathode cell the solution ph still slowly decreased while in the negative plasma electrochemical system the lack of plasma acidification effect in the anode part results in the constant ph value of the solution similar results of ph and orp values in the case of the cell with aem or bpm are shown in fig s2 and s3 1 2 h 2 o 2 h o 2 4 e 2 2 c l c l 2 2 e 3 h 2 o c l 2 h c l o h c l 4 o h n o n o 2 h 5 o h n o 2 n o 3 h 6 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 2 o h as shown in fig 2 b opposite to an increased orp of the solution in the anode cell the values of the solution in the cathode cell decrease with the treatment time under three different configurations when the positive plasma jet contacts the solution in a cem separated electrochemical cell the oxidation reactions occurring around the anode could produce oxidizing products such as free chlorine combined chlorine and ros on the other hand electro reduction reactions occurring around the cathode could produce abundant reductants like h and h2 which can reduce the orp value of the cathode solution the cl2 hclo and clo species referred to as free chlorine have strong water disinfection ability for example hypochlorous acid hclo a potent bactericidal agent could contribute to approximately 7 0 log reduction for e coli after the 5 min treatment of hclo 0 1 μm combined chlorine including chloramine shows weak bacterial inactivation by comparing these three configurations the orp value of the anode cell solution is the lowest in the hybrid positive plasma electrochemical cell which may be due to the conversion of free chlorine to combined chlorine on the other hand high free chlorine contents in the anode solution with a negative plasma jet result in a high orp value in the case of the electrochemical cell without a membrane oxidizing species will also be produced in the reaction cell for all three configurations leading to an increase in orp values however since the solution volume of the cell without a membrane is twice as much as that of the cell with cem the lower concentration in the cell without a membrane may result in a lower orp value of the treated solution more details about the chemistries of aqueous reactive species are discussed in the following sections 3 2 aqueous species produced by electrolysis only with cem concentrations of aqueous species produced by the electrolysis only are investigated when the cem was placed in the electrochemical cell fig 3 a shows the concentrations of free and combined chlorine after the electrolysis only treatment for 15 min with the cem clearly only free chlorine was detected in the anode cell solution while no combined chlorine was generated in the anode or cathode cell solution the hydrogen evolution reaction will reduce the h concentration in the cathode cell which may result in the high transportation rate of h from the anode to the cathode through cem and then boost reactions 2 3 so the concentration of free chlorine in the anode cell produced by electrolysis only was high hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is a common oxidant with a long lifetime it is well known that the plasma induced dissociation of water molecules during plasma water interactions can contribute to h2o2 production liu et al 2022 mota lima et al 2019 and electrolysis only can also produce h2o2 through the electrochemical pathway as shown in fig 3 b the concentration of h2o2 detected in the anode cell with cem is only about tens of μm and the cathode solution contains no h2o2 these results indicate that the reactive species can only be generated in the anode cell the solution produced in the anode cell is called eow which has been widely used in diverse biology related applications the cem can selectively pass through cations and prevent the reactions that occur in the entire electrochemical cell from interfering reactions 1 3 describe the formation of free chlorine in the anode cell and reaction 6 reflects that the evolution of h2 occurs in the cathode cell meanwhile the results for h2o2 generation are similar to the case of the cell containing aem or bpm fig s5 c 3 3 aqueous reactive species produced by plasma electrolysis with cem as discussed above only free chlorine and h2o2 can be generated in eow with cem since the plasma discharge can produce various reactive species we replace an electrolysis electrode with a plasma jet to study the influence of the plasma on the eow production especially when the cem is installed in the cell fig 4 a and d show the concentrations of free and combined chlorine produced by the plasma electrolysis treatment for 15 min with cem from these results we can see that free chlorine could only be detected in the anode cell when a positive plasma jet is employed as one electrode and its concentration is very low however it can be detected in both the anode and cathode cells for the negative plasma jet while the concentration of free chlorine in the anode cell is much higher than that in the cathode cell on the other hand combined chlorine can only be produced in the cell directly discharged by the plasma electrode regardless of the use of the positive or negative plasma jets compared to the results in fig 3 a we find that the formation of combined chlorine is related to the polarity of the plasma jet for a positive plasma jet chlorine compounds are mainly in the form of combined chlorine after the plasma discharge so it is likely that some plasma generated reactive species would react with free chlorine to produce combined chlorine especially since rons are the main products from the plasma liquid initeractions chlorine ions in the solution can be oxidized by rons into cl2 and other chlorine compounds as given by 7 rons chlorine ions c l 2 8 rons chlorine ions cl o hclo 9 rons free chlorine combined chlorine for the negative plasma jet the production of highly concentrated free chlorine in the anode cell would be attributed to reactions 2 3 besides the formation of free chlorine and combined chlorine in the cathode cell can also be interpreted by reactions 7 9 as shown in fig 4 a and d free chlorine concentrations are significantly different in the anode and cathode solutions which would be influenced by the plasma electrolysis one of the possible explanations is the different electrochemical electrodes that can induce different chemical reactions for example cl can be quickly reduced to cl2 and form other free chlorine at the pt electrode a solid electrode besides the high concentration of combined chlorine in the positive plasma enhanced eow pp eow may also be the cause of the observed low free chlorine concentration as previously reported the presence of organic and inorganic nitrogen species in water would result in a range of reactions with free chlorine to form complexed chlorinated molecules in reactions 10 12 meador and fisher 2013 and the reaction rate coefficients for reaction 10 and 11 are 3 07 106 and 1 5 102 m 1 s 1 meador and fisher 2013 which demonstrates that free chlorine can be converted into the combined chlorine moreover the production rate of hclo 4 3 104 m 1 s 1 is slower than the formation of combined chlorine thus the free chlorine concentration is relatively low in this case in this context free chlorine may react with these reactive nitrogen species to form combined chlorine and then reduce free chlorine concentration in addition no2 is also a product of plasma water interactions and it may react with free chlorine to form other chloride species like clno2 as shown in reactions 13 15 ke et al 2018 liu et al 2017 moreover the formation of combined chlorine in the cathode cell with the negative plasma jet also contributes to the low free chlorine concentration 10 n h 3 hclo n h 2 cl h 2 o 11 n h 2 c l hclo nhc l 2 h 2 o 12 nhc l 2 hclo nc l 3 h 2 o 13 no 2 hclo cln o 2 o h 14 no 2 c l 2 cln o 2 c l 15 no 2 cl o 2 n o 2 cl 0 2 in addition though the discharge electrode used in the anode cell is the same for electrolysis only and negative plasma electrolysis negative plasma enhanced eow np eow shows a higher concentration of free chlorine fig 4d differ from electrolysis only that only hydrogen evolution reaction could occur in the cathode cell plenty of reactive species could be generated by the negative plasma jet in the cathode cell these species would participate in diverse reaction processes accordingly the gain and loss equilibration of electrons through the redox reactions suggests that the multiple reduction reactions occurred in the cathode cell would impel the oxidation reaction in the anode cell since more h were consumed in the cathode cell reaction 19 28 and 29 under the negative plasma jet it promotes the transportation of h from anode cell to cathode cell and ultimately shifting the balance of the reaction 3 to produce more free chlorine consequently the diverse effects occurring in the cathode cells promote the dynamic transfer processes between the anode and cathode cells oldham et al found that the reduction reactions only take place near the centerline of the plasma jet whereas the oxidation reactions take place in the adjacent solution oldham and thimsen 2022 which is different from the case of electrolysis using a solid electrode as discussed above the formation of combined chlorine may be related to the n contained species so long lived species no2 and no3 and ammonia nitrogen species were measured in this study ammonia nitrogen refers to nitrogen in water in the form of free ammonia nh3 and ammonium ion nh4 fig 4 c and f show the concentrations of aqueous no2 no3 and ammonia nitrogen species detected in the cell with cem for the positive and negative plasma jets as shown in fig 4 b and e no2 no3 and ammonia nitrogen can only be detected in the cell where the plasma jet acts as a discharge electrode besides no2 species are only detected in the cathode cell with cem of the negative plasma jet it has been reported that plasmas can produce significant amounts of no2 species which play a role in sterilization and disinfection hansch et al 2015 however for the positive plasma jet free chlorine with strong oxidation capacity will react with no2 in the anode cell to form other species when the cem is installed in the cell as shown in reactions 13 15 since positive plasma jet can produce lots of no2 in the aqueous solution the reactions 13 15 with high reaction rates would be proceeded to the right side hence no no2 can be detected in the pp eow these results confirm that no2 species would react with free chlorine leading to a low concentration of free chlo fig 4 for the negative plasma jet no2 is mainly produced in the cathode cell though free chlorine can also be generated in the cathode cell significant amounts of free chlorine are produced in the anode cell and the cem only selectively transports cations i g h na so no2 may not be completely consumed by free chlorine reaction 13 and 14 then no2 consumed by h reaction 28 may promote reaction 3 to produce more free chlorine besides the combined chlorine concentration in the cathode cell is not very high from fig 4 c and f one can see that no3 species are generated by the plasma in the anode cell for the positive plasma jet with the much higher concentration compared with the negative plasma jet in the cathode cell since the cem is installed in the cell the reactive species produced in the anode or cathode cell will be initially separated from each other free chlorine and no3 are produced in the same cell with the positive plasma jet and produced in different cells for the negative plasma jet since free chlorine would react with and oxidize no2 to form no3 and other forms of nitrogen species more no3 would be generated in the pp eow fig s4 a and b shows the similar results of no2 and no3 concentrationsin the aem and bpm cases these results are consistent with the previous report that the density of no radicals increased in the positive plasma discharge while the density of o radicals increased in the negative plasma discharge when using helium as a working gas yonemori and ono 2015 a plausible no3 production reaction is 16 o 2 no no 3 moreover the types of released gas are different towards to the two plasma electrodes in the plasma electrolysis system oxygen is produced in the anode cell for the positive plasma jet while hydrogen is generated in the cathode cell for the negative plasma jet therefore the production of no3 may be driven by reactions 17 and 18 ki et al 2020 for the positive jet configuration conversely for the negative jet hydrogen would reduce the concentration of no3 as shown in reaction 19 lakhian and dickson anderson 2018 consequently the concentration of no3 for the positive plasma jet is higher than that of no3 for the negative plasma jet 17 4 no o 2 h 2 o 4 no 2 4 h 18 3 no 2 3 h 2 no no 3 h h 2 o 19 no 3 h 2 no 2 h 2 o fig 4 c and e show that the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in anode cell for positive plasma jet is higher than that in cathode cell for negative plasma jet ammonia synthesis using cold plasma has been reported to be a novel green approach peng et al 2016 and can be described by reactions 20 26 the evaporation of h2o is also the reason for the h production tian and kushner 2014 the formation of ammonia nitrogen may also be related to the nitrite and nitrate in the solution as shown in reactions 28 29 lakhian and dickson anderson 2018 which may need more h to be transported from the anode cell to the cathode cell and then enhance the formation of hclo reactions 3 for the positive plasma jet reactions 20 21 and 27 would be the main sources of n and h radicals which are the reactants for the formation of nh3 and nh4 while for the negative plasma jet h2 is produced in the cathode cell which can react to form h and then to form nh3 and nh4 by the plasma jet the results for the ammonia nitrogen species shown in fig 4 b and e are in accordance with the results for the combined chlorine presented in fig 4 a and c 20 n 2 n n 21 h 2

after the 15 min treatment by the positivet and negative plasma jet are shown in fig 4 c and f respectively from these results h2o2 concentration in the pp eow is the highest and there is little h2o2 measured in the cathode cell of the positive plasma jet since oh radicals are predominantly generated by the positive plasma jet these oh radicals can recombine to form h2o2 resulting in a high concentration of h2o2 in the anode cell as shown in reactions 30 32 sun et al 2019 tian and kushner 2014 30 h e h 2 o h 2 o he 31 h 2 o h 2 o h 3 o oh 32 oh oh h 2 o 2 fig 4 f reveals that more h2o2 is produced in the cathode cell than in the anode cell by the negative plasma jet owing to the different electrodes compared to the results in fig 3 b we can conclude that h2o2 in p eow is mainly produced through the plasma water interactions by comparing h2o2 concentrations generated by the plasma jets of different polarity it is found that the h2o2 concentration detected in the cell exposed to the negative plasma jet is much lower compared to the positive plasma jet which is consistent with the previous results chen et al 2018 the content of ohaq produced by the positive plasma jet was 1 7 times higher than that produced by the negative plasma jet together with the higher h2o2 production for the positive plasma jet besides for the negative plasma jet the h2o2 is detected in the cathode cell where the ph value is alkaline therefore the dissociation of h2o2 may take place according to the following reactions pastina and laverne 2001 since the reaction rate of reaction 34 is 1 3 1010 m 1 s 1 the abundant oh in cathode cell would consume much of the plasma generated h2o2 which may be one of the main reasons for the low h2o2 concentration of the negative plasma jet 33 h 2 o 2 h ho 2 34 h 2 o 2 o h ho 2 h 2 o 3 4 aqueous reactive species produced by plasma electrolysis without cem since the presence of cem in the cell can make differences in the formation of reactive species in the anode and cathode cells the influence of cem on the concentration of aqueous reactive species is investigated fig 5 shows the free chlorine combined chlorine h2o2 nox and nh3 n produced in the cell without cem the saline was treated with a plasma jet for 15 min as shown in fig 5 a for the positive plasma treated solution pp w the free chlorine concentration detected in the cell is the same as that in the pp eow fig 4a the concentration of combined chlorine for pp eow fig 4a nearly doubled compared to the pp w fig 5a the two times larger volume of the cell without cem than that of the anode cell would be the reason for the observed difference of the combined chlorine concentration as discussed above free chlorine would be converted to combined chlorine through plasma enhanced electrolysis for the negative plasma treated solution np w the concentration of free chlorine shown in fig 5 a is much lower though the anode electrode can promote the formation of free chlorine n containing species generated by the negative plasma jet could consume some of the free chlorine however the concentration of combined chlorine for the np w is low as shown in fig 5 a therefore there may be some other causes for the observed lower concentration of free chlorine free chlorine from the anode side like cl2 could react with h2o2 through reaction 35 liu et al 2017 resulting in a small production of free chlorine h2o2 can oxidize cl into hclo or clo by reactions 36 and 37 though they have a low rate coefficient of 1 8 10 9 m 1 s 1 and 8 3 10 7 m 2 s 1 knipping and dabdub 2002 respectively 35 c l 2 h 2 o 2 2 c l 2 h o 2 36 h 2 o 2 c l clo aq h 2 o 37 h 2 o 2 c l h hcl o aq h 2 o as shown in fig 5 b no2 can only be detected in the cell for the pp w which is different from the case of the cell with cem fig 4 b and e for the positive plasma jet the concentration of free chlorine is relatively low which may not be able to consume no2 completely for the negative plasma jet the low concentration of no2 fig 4e and high concentration of free chlorine fig 4d may result in the very low concentration of no2 in the cell without cem on the other hand no3 species can be detected in the cell for both the pp w and np w as shown in fig 5 b compared to the case of the cell with cem we find that the differences in the cell volume may be the reason for the lower no3 concentration detected in the cell without cem as shown in fig 5 b ammonia nitrogen is also detected in the cell of pp w while there is no ammonia nitrogen detected for the np w the volume of the cell without a membrane is twice that of the half cell with cem leading to a lower concentration of ammonia nitrogen in the aqueous solution moreover the concentration of ammonia nitrogen of the np w in the cells cannot be detected with a detection limit of 0 1 mg l fig 5 c shows the concentration of h2o2 in the cell using the positive plasma jet and negative plasma jet as one electrochemical electrode respectively obviously the concentration of h2o2 is lower compared to the cells with cem one reason for the low production of h2o2 may be the large volume twice of the cell in this case while we can see that the concentration of h2o2 of pp w is still lower than half that of pp eow shown in fig 4 f as mentioned above h2o2 could be consumed by chlorine and then results in a lower concentration of h2o2 in the cell reaction 35 and 36 compared to the case of the cell with cem we find that for the positive plasma jet the differences in concentrations of reactive species may all be attributed to the different volumes of the cell this is because all kinds of reactive species could be generated from the anode side when the positive plasma jet is employed irrespective of the cem presence however for the negative plasma jet the cem can separate the free chlorine and plasma generated reactive species which prevents or at least significantly delays the reactions among these species 3 5 comparison of the inactivation effects between eow and p eow in the bacterial inactivation experiments the bacterial suspensions are incubated for 5 min in saline after the 15 min treatment of the plasma electrolysis and electrolysis only fig 6 a and b show the bacterial inactivation performance for the case of the cell under three configurations with and without cem respectively the results for the case of aem and bpm are shown in fig s6 a and b all the solutions in the cathode cells have no bacterial inactivation and the results are not presented here it is clearly seen that all the treated solutions from the cell without the membrane exhibit lower bacterial inactivation effects than that of the anode solution from the cell with cem previous study suggested that bacteria can be efficiently inactivated when the solution ph is below 4 7 whereas the biological activity of the solution is hardly affected by the plasma treatment above this ph value ercan et al 2016 it is well accepted that aqueous rons produced through the plasma water interactions contribute to bacterial inactivation indeed h2o2 is regarded as the main sterilization agent in plasma activated water zhang et al 2013 it was also reported that the acidified nitrite and hydrogen peroxide were the most important bactericidal rons reagents in the plasma treatment machala et al 2013 for the positive plasma jet the sterilization effects of the pp eow and pp w are not statistically significant p cem 0 223 p wm 0 93 as shown in fig 6 a and b the combined chlorine shows lower disinfection ability than free chlorine oomori et al 2000 therefore though the concentration of combined chlorine detected in the anode cell for positive plasma jet is not very low the solution still has no sterilization ability fig 6 a shows that the np eow for the negative plasma jet completely kills the bacteria however the statistical results demonstrated that the sterilization effects between the control and np w did not differ significantly p 0 051 which shows weak inactivation effects fig 6 b for electrolysis the survival rate of s aureus treated by the solution from an anode cell decreases faster than that of a cell without cem as shown in fig 6 c only np eow still shows a strong sterilization effect after 5 days storage since the solutions are stored in sealed containers without light exposure the effective sterilization could be attributed to the high concentration of free chlorine fig 6d bacteria effects show better consistency with the concentration of free chlorine produced in the p eow the solution pp eow from the positive plasma electrolysis system contains highly concentrated combined chlorine h2o2 and no3 instead of free chlorine microbial results show that pp eow does not play a significant sterilization effect for two possible reasons first the sterilization ability of combined chlorine is lower than of free chlorine and a much higher concentration is needed to ensure better bacteria inactivation effects the second reason is the absence of no2 since the bactericidal effect of plasma activated water is mainly due to the synergistic effect of h2o2 and no2 species naitali et al 2010 while in the negative plasma electrolysis system the np eow shows better sterilization effects due to abundant free chlorine in the water collectively these results indicate that the bacterial inactivation should be attributed to the effects of free chlorine 3 6 plausible mechanisms of the plasma effects table 1 summarizes the physio chemical characteristics of the p eow including solution ph concentrations of reactive species and bacterial inactivation performance from this table we can find that free chlorine should be responsible for better bacterial inactivation besides the absence of nitrite ions in pp eow may result in poor inactivation we can clearly see that the reactive species in the anode and cathode cells are distinctly separated regardless of using the positive or negative plasma jets combined chlorine and ammonia nitrogen were mainly produced by the plasma electrode nitrite ions were only detected in the cathode cell with the negative plasma jet according to the above results it is interesting that a high concentration of free chlorine will enhance the bactericidal effects in some cases for this phenomenon we propose the plausible mechanisms of the aqueous chemical processes in solution with cem as presented in fig 7 the schematic of the electrolysis treatment is not given since it only involves simple oxidation the production of free chlorine and reduction hydrogen evolution reactions in the anode and cathode cells first the acidic and alkaline processes in anode and cathode cells can be seen in both positive and negative plasma enhanced electrolysis treatments which are due to the oxidation and reduction reactions that occur in the solution the discharge process of the positive plasma jet is shown in fig 7 a upon the hydrogen gas evolution in the cathode cell the solution becomes alkaline and the evolution of oxygen and chlorine gases in the anode cell makes the solution acidic then some cl2 molecules are dissolved into the solution to form hclo and or clo in the anode cell collectively referred to as free chlorine yet the nox and nh3 n species generated by the plasma can react with free chlorine to form combined chlorine which results in a low concentration of free chlorine in the anode cell as shown in fig 7 b for the negative plasma jet the evolution of oxygen and chlorine gases also occurs in the anode cell then produces the free chlorine in the np eow which makes the solution acidic on the other hand for the cathode cell the solution becomes alkaline after the discharge due to the cathode reactions mainly including hydrogen evolution the electron induced reduction reactions and reactions of the production of free chlorine and combined chlorine the formation of nox and nh3 n species in the cathode cell could promote generation of free chlorine to form combined chlorine the acidification effect of the negative plasma jet slows the alkalization process in the cathode cell which eliminates the difference in the acidity and alkalinity between the two cells the electron related reactions in the cathode cell can promote the oxidation processes in the anode cell though the saline concentration decreases with the plasma discharge time 4 conclusion water contamination with pathogenic microorganisms remain a significant concern to public health and environment current antibacterial chemical agents still have substantial drawbacks including low sterilization efficiency toxic by products or strict treating conditions therefore a green and efficient agent for water sterilization is needed which has been addressed in this work to resolve these issues and reveal the mechanisms of physio chemical processed of plasma water interactions we first devised a dedicated experimental system containing the plasma jet and electrolysis cell in this study the use of a cation exchange membrane cem splits the cell into two sections and the reactive species are different in the two cells aqueous h2o2 and no3 are mainly produced from the plasma side the usage of ion exchange membranes can change the concentration of aqueous no2 free chlorine can be produced by plasma enhanced electrolysis and electrolysis only treatment but amounts of free chlorine can further react to form combined chlorine under the plasma enhanced electrolysis treatments where the solution exposed to the plasma jet the consumption of h in the cathode cell in the negative jet case promote the process of the formation of free chlorine in negative plasma activated electrolyzed oxidizing water np eow which show the most effective bacteria inactivation the inhibiting effects of alkali in cathode cell and the injection of eaq anode cell for the negative polarity plasma jet discharge may also be the reason for high concentration of free chlorine importantly the np eow remains efficient sterilization capacity after several days storage this study provides a promising alternative solution for efficient and friendly water sterilization approach by inactivating bacteria and gives an insight into plasma enhanced electrolysis which may accelerate the

15478,pathogenic microorganisms pose a global threat to public health and environment common antibacterial chemicals produce toxic residues inevitably harming the environment electrolyzed oxidizing water eow a promising environment friendly alternative disinfectant still lacks effective production processes sufficient bactericidal efficacy and stability while the enabling physico chemical mechanisms remain unclear here we report for the first time an effective hybrid plasma electrochemical eow production process and reveal the mechanisms by combining nonthermal plasmas and a two chamber electrochemical cell separated by a cation exchange membrane cem for decoupling the chemical reactions during the plasma treatment of water experimental results demonstrate that combined chlorine chloramine was the main chlorine product in the plasma enhanced eow p eow without a membrane owing to the consumption of free chlorine cl2 hocl clo by plasma generated reactive nitrogen species with a cem in the plasma electrolysis system and through controlling the plasma discharge polarity the production of free chlorine and other reactive species can be selectively controlled with the highest concentration of free chlorine obtained in the negative plasma enhanced eow np eow according to the transportation of cations by the cem the high concentrations of free chlorine may be attributed to the higher consuptions of h in cathode cell of negative plasma the study of antibacterial ability of eow produced under different conditions revealed that staphylococcus aureus cells were best inactivated by the np eow with cem which is mainly attributed to the higher concentration of free chlorine this study demonstrates the feasibility of plasma enhanced microbial electrolytic disinfection and offers new insights into the fundamental aspects of p eow chemistries for the future development of sustainable efficient and cost effective multipurpose sustainable chemical

ecosystems sagova mareckova et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 zitvogel et al 2018 some microorganisms with an outstanding ability to degrade various organic compounds can be used to clean stubborn contaminants and some moulds can contribute to the production of different types of foods food supplements or even pharmaceuticals huang et al 2020 thibeault et al 2021 however harmful microbes may cause pathogenic diseases to living organisms and bacteria induced contaminations or damages to food materials and instruments can lead to major economic losses numerous approaches for sterilization have been extensively investigated including heating ultraviolet irradiation and using chemical disinfectants klampfl et al 2012 however these approaches suffer from limited ranges of processing subjects low sterilization efficiency production of toxic by products of health and environmental concerns and some other issues therefore environmentally benign and effective alternatives for sterilization are urgently needed to ensure sufficient antibacterial efficiency and minimal environmental impact electrolyzed oxidizing water eow also named acidic electrolyzed water is one of the promising broad spectrum biocidal agents for microbial decontamination kim et al 2021 eow is commonly produced by the electrolysis of a dilute nacl solution in an electrochemical cell equipped with anode and cathode electrodes there is an alkaline equivalent of electrolyzed water in cathode cell because of the exsitence of ion exchange membrane the biochemical activity of eow is directly linked to the presence of the highly reactive chlorine species rcs and reactive oxygen species ros produced in water including free chlorine cl2 hocl clo chlorine radicals cl cl2 huang et al 2016 hydroxyl radicals oh and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 jeong et al 2006 it is well known that electrochemical parameters including electrode materials types of membranes cell voltage current density reaction time and ph define the eow production methods however the disinfection efficacy of eow produced from the current electrochemical systems is still unsatisfactory due to the relatively low concentrations of these highly reactive species and the potential deterioration of eow stability when exposed to light and the ambient environment further enhancement of antimicrobial efficacy of eow can be achieved by combining the electrochemical processes with other technologies such as uv or visible light irradiation giving rise to photo assisted electrochemical disinfection systems wherein electrogenerated mediators are photo activated by the irradiation resulting in an increased generation of oxidizing agents in the bulk solution however the photo assisted electrochemical approach can only employ renewable solar energy to drive the chemical reactions but show a relatively long processing time for the desirable performance due to the limitation of weak photo currents and the electrochemical approach needs electricity to power the process but leading to fast and effective reactions for potential applications cold atmospheric plasmas provide a promising sustainable alternative approach to produce reactive physical and chemical agents such as uv electrons ions neutral species excited atoms and free radical xu et al 2021 which have been successfully applied in biomedical environmental food and agricultural applications judee et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 similar to eow plasma activated water paw produced by reactions between the plasma generated reactive species and water molecules is also regarded as a viable green solution featuring high antibacterial activity the biochemical activity of paw is directly linked to the presence of the highly reactive oxygen and nitrogen species rons in water as well as the high oxidation reduction potential and low or high ph value depending on the gas and reaction conditions rumbach et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 2020 the typical half lifetimes of long lived no2 and no3 are days months or longer in vitro the half life of h2o2 is 10 5 s in vivo and hours days months or longer in vitro yan et al 2021 if saline water is treated by plasma free chlorine could also be produced in paw which play a key role in bactericidal effects similar to the eow an et al 2019 liu et al 2017 therefore developing a hybrid plasma electrochemical system to effectively control and reveal the mechanisms of generation of reactive chemical species in eow is vital for eow related biological environmental and industrial applications various combinations of plasma and electrochemical processes have recently been explored for nanomaterials synthesis water purification and sustainable ammonia production gao et al 2003 hawtof et al 2019 sun et al 2021 these innovative methods rely on a plasma replacing the metal cathode in an electrochemical process while the reactions take place at a gas liquid interface instead of a solid liquid interface importantly the non equilibrium plasma electrons and other species are injected into the solution to react at the interface however plasma liquid interactions involve multiple physio chemical processes such as ion injection neutral species dissolution electron bombardment electrolysis and uv photon induced photolysis rumbach et al 2013 this is why it is very challenging if possible at all to decouple the plasma specific and conventional electrochemical effects in the hybrid system in addition the influence of plasmas on the eow production and the biochemical activity of the plasma enhanced eow p eow along with identifying the crucial reactive species responsible for the sterilization have not been explored this study aims to explore and compare the antimicrobial efficacy of saline activated by the plasma enhanced electrolysis and electrolysis only systems and gain a deeper insight into the physio chemical processes of plasma water interactions using an ion exchange membrane iem and reveal the plausible mechanisms that regulate the biochemical activity of p eow in applications the ions transportation between anode and cathode of iem relys on the interactions with the water mobility and polymer dynamics foglia et al 2022 in this context a hybrid plasma electrochemical system for p eow production is developed by combining a customized nonthermal plasma source and an electrochemical cell as shown in scheme 1 to simplify the complex reactions in the plasma electrochemical system and decouple the electrochemical behavior of the anode and cathode cells a cation exchange membrane cem which can selectively pass through aqueous cations e g na and h is employed to separate the anode and cathode cell chambers intentional addition of cem does not change the original reaction system yet enables the generation and sorting of unique ionic or radical species that are impossible in common electrolysis owing to the cem two distinct solutions are obtained after electrochemical reactions namely the acidic solution from the anode cell and the alkaline solution from the cathode cell for comparison an anion exchange membrane aem which can selectively pass through anions and a bipolar membrane bpm for which h2o in the membrane is dissociated into h and oh and then migrate to the cathode and anode cell respectively are also employed in this study the concentrations of reactive species including long lived species no2 no3 h2o2 ammonia nitrogen and chlorine produced in the saline solution from the plasma enhanced electrolysis and electrolysis only systems with or without cem are determined staphylococcus aureus s aureus is selected as a model microbial organism to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy of the eow and p eow produced under different conditions as shown in scheme 1 we demonstrate a new solution combining the eow with atmospheric pressure plasmas to inactivated microbes effectively further in depth analyses of the plasma electrochemical reactions and the inactivation mechanisms behind the p eow enhanced water sterilization are studied further studies reveal the plausible mechanisms of the achieved excellent p eow stability 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the cation exchange membrane anion exchange membrane and bipolar membrane were purchased from fumatech germany the physical and chemical features of these three membranes are listed in table s1 including thickness ion exchange capacity selectivity water splitting efficiency and ion transport rate the surface morphologies of these membranes are shown in fig s1 saline solution 0 9 nacl was purchased from yuyitang china amplexr red and griess reagents were purchased from beyotime china the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd reagents were purchased from hach usa all chemicals were used as received without further purification 2 2 plasma electrochemical system the atmospheric pressure plasma jet appj used in this work was custom designed to operate with the electrochemical cell and induced the targeted reactions as shown in fig 1 a a hollow stainless steel needle with an outer and inner diameter of 0 8 and 0 5 mm was used as the electrode of the plasma jet source a platinum pt needle with a diameter of 0 5 mm was another electrode for the plasma system the he flow rate was controlled by mass flow controllers brookes 5850e with a constant rate of 0 2 standard liter per minute slm the dc power supply with the output voltage in a range of 0 24 kv was connected to the hollow stainless steel electrode which was positioned above 3 mm from the liquid surface the other side of the pt electrode that inserted in the saline was connected to the dc power supply in a series of resistance r1 and r2 the resistor r1 of 10 mω was used to ensure the stability of the plasma discharge while the resistor r2 of 1 kω was used to measure the discharge current the electrolysis only system had a very similar structure where the hollow stainless steel needle was replaced with another pt needle to enable effective control of the reactive chemistries the reaction cell containing 3 ml saline solution was divided into two parts using a cem during the experiment the phase averaged current was measured using an oscilloscope mdo34 tektronix and was set to be the same for the hybrid plasma electrochemical system and the individual electrochemical system 150 μa when the hollow stainless steel was connected to the anode or cathode of the dc power supply the plasma jet was considered as a positive or negative plasma jet respectively with the same discharge current the applied voltage waveforms in fig 1 b were similar for the positive and negative plasma jets the discharge current of the positive and negative plasma jet had repetitive pulses with a cycle time of 20 and 30 μs respectively the discharge current waveform of the positive one was similar to the previous study wang and shashurin 2017 while the current waveform for electrolysis under same current had a constant shape during the processing during the plasma electrolysis current pulses mainly originate from the breakdown of gas molecules which also results in plasma ignition no matter whether a dc or other power supplies are employed moreover the negative ions accumulated in the gas gap can result in electron avalanches and then positive ions move toward the cathode which makes the electron ionization ceases and results in a marked decrease of current until the normal gradients are restored trichel 1938 leading to a repetitive behavior of the pulses in contrast the conventional electrolysis produces a constant and stable current for inducing electrochemical reactions 2 3 physicochemical measurements of p eow the ph and orp value of the treated solution was measured with a ph meter mettler toledo fe20 and an orp meter mettler toledo s210 respectively the amplex red reagent and the griess reagent was employed to detect h2o2 and no2 no3 concentrations respectively their absolute concentrations were measured by a microplate reader thermo scientific varioskan flash reader the concentration of free chlorine combined chlorine and nitrogen concentrations were determined by the dpd method measured by the hach dr3900 spectrophotometer the detection limits of the instruments for h2o2 no2 and no3 are 1 2 and 2 μmol l respectively and for the free chlorine combined chlorine and ammonia nitrogen are 0 02 0 02 and 0 1 mg l respectively all measurements of these species were performed following the protocols provided by assay manufacturers 2 4 bacterial inactivation the preparation method of staphylococcus aureus s aureus was described in our previous work xia et al 2019 the od600 value of the bacteria cells for this work was resuspended to 2 and the s aureus suspension was incubated with the treated saline solution for 5 min then was dropped onto tsb agar plates serially and incubated at 37 overnight finally the numbers of surviving bacteria were calculated by the grown colony forming units cfus 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in ph and orp values of the solution produced by plasma electrolysis and electrolysis only with or without cem the cases of the cell reactions with and without a cem are compared to investigate the aqueous reactive species produced in the plasma electrolysis or electrolysis only systems the change of ph and orp values of the cell solution treated by the plasma jet and electrolysis are presented in fig 2 when the cem is installed in the cell the ph of the solution in the anode cell decreases with time while that in the cathode cell increases with time irrespective of the discharge mode the lowest ph value around 3 is obtained in the anode cell of the positive plasma jet with a discharge time of 15 min when a positive plasma jet is ignited in the cell with cem electrolytic reactions 1 3 deborde and von gunten 2008 kim et al 2021 and acidification reactions 4 5 machala et al 2019 pandis and seinfeld 1989 of the plasma in the anode cell make the solution acidic while reactions 6 in the cathode cell induced by electrolysis make the solution alkaline in the case of a negative plasma jet ignited in the cell with cem the electrolytic reactions in the anode cell and cathode cell also make the solution acidic and alkaline respectively however the plasma induced acidification reactions in the cathode cell make the solution ph lower than that of the positive plasma jet when the cell without a membrane is exposed to the positive plasma jet the cell solution also becomes acidic but the ph value decreases slower than that of the cem case as shown in fig 2 a in contrast the ph values of the solution almost remain stable for the negative plasma electrolysis and electrolysis only systems in the positive plasma electrochemical system the concurrent plasma water interactions and electrochemical reactions can produce numerous h ions in the chemical forms of hclo hno2 and hno3 though these species can be neutralized by oh ions from the cathode cell the solution ph still slowly decreased while in the negative plasma electrochemical system the lack of plasma acidification effect in the anode part results in the constant ph value of the solution similar results of ph and orp values in the case of the cell with aem or bpm are shown in fig s2 and s3 1 2 h 2 o 2 h o 2 4 e 2 2 c l c l 2 2 e 3 h 2 o c l 2 h c l o h c l 4 o h n o n o 2 h 5 o h n o 2 n o 3 h 6 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 2 o h as shown in fig 2 b opposite to an increased orp of the solution in the anode cell the values of the solution in the cathode cell decrease with the treatment time under three different configurations when the positive plasma jet contacts the solution in a cem separated electrochemical cell the oxidation reactions occurring around the anode could produce oxidizing products such as free chlorine combined chlorine and ros on the other hand electro reduction reactions occurring around the cathode could produce abundant reductants like h and h2 which can reduce the orp value of the cathode solution the cl2 hclo and clo species referred to as free chlorine have strong water disinfection ability for example hypochlorous acid hclo a potent bactericidal agent could contribute to approximately 7 0 log reduction for e coli after the 5 min treatment of hclo 0 1 μm combined chlorine including chloramine shows weak bacterial inactivation by comparing these three configurations the orp value of the anode cell solution is the lowest in the hybrid positive plasma electrochemical cell which may be due to the conversion of free chlorine to combined chlorine on the other hand high free chlorine contents in the anode solution with a negative plasma jet result in a high orp value in the case of the electrochemical cell without a membrane oxidizing species will also be produced in the reaction cell for all three configurations leading to an increase in orp values however since the solution volume of the cell without a membrane is twice as much as that of the cell with cem the lower concentration in the cell without a membrane may result in a lower orp value of the treated solution more details about the chemistries of aqueous reactive species are discussed in the following sections 3 2 aqueous species produced by electrolysis only with cem concentrations of aqueous species produced by the electrolysis only are investigated when the cem was placed in the electrochemical cell fig 3 a shows the concentrations of free and combined chlorine after the electrolysis only treatment for 15 min with the cem clearly only free chlorine was detected in the anode cell solution while no combined chlorine was generated in the anode or cathode cell solution the hydrogen evolution reaction will reduce the h concentration in the cathode cell which may result in the high transportation rate of h from the anode to the cathode through cem and then boost reactions 2 3 so the concentration of free chlorine in the anode cell produced by electrolysis only was high hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is a common oxidant with a long lifetime it is well known that the plasma induced dissociation of water molecules during plasma water interactions can contribute to h2o2 production liu et al 2022 mota lima et al 2019 and electrolysis only can also produce h2o2 through the electrochemical pathway as shown in fig 3 b the concentration of h2o2 detected in the anode cell with cem is only about tens of μm and the cathode solution contains no h2o2 these results indicate that the reactive species can only be generated in the anode cell the solution produced in the anode cell is called eow which has been widely used in diverse biology related applications the cem can selectively pass through cations and prevent the reactions that occur in the entire electrochemical cell from interfering reactions 1 3 describe the formation of free chlorine in the anode cell and reaction 6 reflects that the evolution of h2 occurs in the cathode cell meanwhile the results for h2o2 generation are similar to the case of the cell containing aem or bpm fig s5 c 3 3 aqueous reactive species produced by plasma electrolysis with cem as discussed above only free chlorine and h2o2 can be generated in eow with cem since the plasma discharge can produce various reactive species we replace an electrolysis electrode with a plasma jet to study the influence of the plasma on the eow production especially when the cem is installed in the cell fig 4 a and d show the concentrations of free and combined chlorine produced by the plasma electrolysis treatment for 15 min with cem from these results we can see that free chlorine could only be detected in the anode cell when a positive plasma jet is employed as one electrode and its concentration is very low however it can be detected in both the anode and cathode cells for the negative plasma jet while the concentration of free chlorine in the anode cell is much higher than that in the cathode cell on the other hand combined chlorine can only be produced in the cell directly discharged by the plasma electrode regardless of the use of the positive or negative plasma jets compared to the results in fig 3 a we find that the formation of combined chlorine is related to the polarity of the plasma jet for a positive plasma jet chlorine compounds are mainly in the form of combined chlorine after the plasma discharge so it is likely that some plasma generated reactive species would react with free chlorine to produce combined chlorine especially since rons are the main products from the plasma liquid initeractions chlorine ions in the solution can be oxidized by rons into cl2 and other chlorine compounds as given by 7 rons chlorine ions c l 2 8 rons chlorine ions cl o hclo 9 rons free chlorine combined chlorine for the negative plasma jet the production of highly concentrated free chlorine in the anode cell would be attributed to reactions 2 3 besides the formation of free chlorine and combined chlorine in the cathode cell can also be interpreted by reactions 7 9 as shown in fig 4 a and d free chlorine concentrations are significantly different in the anode and cathode solutions which would be influenced by the plasma electrolysis one of the possible explanations is the different electrochemical electrodes that can induce different chemical reactions for example cl can be quickly reduced to cl2 and form other free chlorine at the pt electrode a solid electrode besides the high concentration of combined chlorine in the positive plasma enhanced eow pp eow may also be the cause of the observed low free chlorine concentration as previously reported the presence of organic and inorganic nitrogen species in water would result in a range of reactions with free chlorine to form complexed chlorinated molecules in reactions 10 12 meador and fisher 2013 and the reaction rate coefficients for reaction 10 and 11 are 3 07 106 and 1 5 102 m 1 s 1 meador and fisher 2013 which demonstrates that free chlorine can be converted into the combined chlorine moreover the production rate of hclo 4 3 104 m 1 s 1 is slower than the formation of combined chlorine thus the free chlorine concentration is relatively low in this case in this context free chlorine may react with these reactive nitrogen species to form combined chlorine and then reduce free chlorine concentration in addition no2 is also a product of plasma water interactions and it may react with free chlorine to form other chloride species like clno2 as shown in reactions 13 15 ke et al 2018 liu et al 2017 moreover the formation of combined chlorine in the cathode cell with the negative plasma jet also contributes to the low free chlorine concentration 10 n h 3 hclo n h 2 cl h 2 o 11 n h 2 c l hclo nhc l 2 h 2 o 12 nhc l 2 hclo nc l 3 h 2 o 13 no 2 hclo cln o 2 o h 14 no 2 c l 2 cln o 2 c l 15 no 2 cl o 2 n o 2 cl 0 2 in addition though the discharge electrode used in the anode cell is the same for electrolysis only and negative plasma electrolysis negative plasma enhanced eow np eow shows a higher concentration of free chlorine fig 4d differ from electrolysis only that only hydrogen evolution reaction could occur in the cathode cell plenty of reactive species could be generated by the negative plasma jet in the cathode cell these species would participate in diverse reaction processes accordingly the gain and loss equilibration of electrons through the redox reactions suggests that the multiple reduction reactions occurred in the cathode cell would impel the oxidation reaction in the anode cell since more h were consumed in the cathode cell reaction 19 28 and 29 under the negative plasma jet it promotes the transportation of h from anode cell to cathode cell and ultimately shifting the balance of the reaction 3 to produce more free chlorine consequently the diverse effects occurring in the cathode cells promote the dynamic transfer processes between the anode and cathode cells oldham et al found that the reduction reactions only take place near the centerline of the plasma jet whereas the oxidation reactions take place in the adjacent solution oldham and thimsen 2022 which is different from the case of electrolysis using a solid electrode as discussed above the formation of combined chlorine may be related to the n contained species so long lived species no2 and no3 and ammonia nitrogen species were measured in this study ammonia nitrogen refers to nitrogen in water in the form of free ammonia nh3 and ammonium ion nh4 fig 4 c and f show the concentrations of aqueous no2 no3 and ammonia nitrogen species detected in the cell with cem for the positive and negative plasma jets as shown in fig 4 b and e no2 no3 and ammonia nitrogen can only be detected in the cell where the plasma jet acts as a discharge electrode besides no2 species are only detected in the cathode cell with cem of the negative plasma jet it has been reported that plasmas can produce significant amounts of no2 species which play a role in sterilization and disinfection hansch et al 2015 however for the positive plasma jet free chlorine with strong oxidation capacity will react with no2 in the anode cell to form other species when the cem is installed in the cell as shown in reactions 13 15 since positive plasma jet can produce lots of no2 in the aqueous solution the reactions 13 15 with high reaction rates would be proceeded to the right side hence no no2 can be detected in the pp eow these results confirm that no2 species would react with free chlorine leading to a low concentration of free chlo fig 4 for the negative plasma jet no2 is mainly produced in the cathode cell though free chlorine can also be generated in the cathode cell significant amounts of free chlorine are produced in the anode cell and the cem only selectively transports cations i g h na so no2 may not be completely consumed by free chlorine reaction 13 and 14 then no2 consumed by h reaction 28 may promote reaction 3 to produce more free chlorine besides the combined chlorine concentration in the cathode cell is not very high from fig 4 c and f one can see that no3 species are generated by the plasma in the anode cell for the positive plasma jet with the much higher concentration compared with the negative plasma jet in the cathode cell since the cem is installed in the cell the reactive species produced in the anode or cathode cell will be initially separated from each other free chlorine and no3 are produced in the same cell with the positive plasma jet and produced in different cells for the negative plasma jet since free chlorine would react with and oxidize no2 to form no3 and other forms of nitrogen species more no3 would be generated in the pp eow fig s4 a and b shows the similar results of no2 and no3 concentrationsin the aem and bpm cases these results are consistent with the previous report that the density of no radicals increased in the positive plasma discharge while the density of o radicals increased in the negative plasma discharge when using helium as a working gas yonemori and ono 2015 a plausible no3 production reaction is 16 o 2 no no 3 moreover the types of released gas are different towards to the two plasma electrodes in the plasma electrolysis system oxygen is produced in the anode cell for the positive plasma jet while hydrogen is generated in the cathode cell for the negative plasma jet therefore the production of no3 may be driven by reactions 17 and 18 ki et al 2020 for the positive jet configuration conversely for the negative jet hydrogen would reduce the concentration of no3 as shown in reaction 19 lakhian and dickson anderson 2018 consequently the concentration of no3 for the positive plasma jet is higher than that of no3 for the negative plasma jet 17 4 no o 2 h 2 o 4 no 2 4 h 18 3 no 2 3 h 2 no no 3 h h 2 o 19 no 3 h 2 no 2 h 2 o fig 4 c and e show that the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in anode cell for positive plasma jet is higher than that in cathode cell for negative plasma jet ammonia synthesis using cold plasma has been reported to be a novel green approach peng et al 2016 and can be described by reactions 20 26 the evaporation of h2o is also the reason for the h production tian and kushner 2014 the formation of ammonia nitrogen may also be related to the nitrite and nitrate in the solution as shown in reactions 28 29 lakhian and dickson anderson 2018 which may need more h to be transported from the anode cell to the cathode cell and then enhance the formation of hclo reactions 3 for the positive plasma jet reactions 20 21 and 27 would be the main sources of n and h radicals which are the reactants for the formation of nh3 and nh4 while for the negative plasma jet h2 is produced in the cathode cell which can react to form h and then to form nh3 and nh4 by the plasma jet the results for the ammonia nitrogen species shown in fig 4 b and e are in accordance with the results for the combined chlorine presented in fig 4 a and c 20 n 2 n n 21 h 2

after the 15 min treatment by the positivet and negative plasma jet are shown in fig 4 c and f respectively from these results h2o2 concentration in the pp eow is the highest and there is little h2o2 measured in the cathode cell of the positive plasma jet since oh radicals are predominantly generated by the positive plasma jet these oh radicals can recombine to form h2o2 resulting in a high concentration of h2o2 in the anode cell as shown in reactions 30 32 sun et al 2019 tian and kushner 2014 30 h e h 2 o h 2 o he 31 h 2 o h 2 o h 3 o oh 32 oh oh h 2 o 2 fig 4 f reveals that more h2o2 is produced in the cathode cell than in the anode cell by the negative plasma jet owing to the different electrodes compared to the results in fig 3 b we can conclude that h2o2 in p eow is mainly produced through the plasma water interactions by comparing h2o2 concentrations generated by the plasma jets of different polarity it is found that the h2o2 concentration detected in the cell exposed to the negative plasma jet is much lower compared to the positive plasma jet which is consistent with the previous results chen et al 2018 the content of ohaq produced by the positive plasma jet was 1 7 times higher than that produced by the negative plasma jet together with the higher h2o2 production for the positive plasma jet besides for the negative plasma jet the h2o2 is detected in the cathode cell where the ph value is alkaline therefore the dissociation of h2o2 may take place according to the following reactions pastina and laverne 2001 since the reaction rate of reaction 34 is 1 3 1010 m 1 s 1 the abundant oh in cathode cell would consume much of the plasma generated h2o2 which may be one of the main reasons for the low h2o2 concentration of the negative plasma jet 33 h 2 o 2 h ho 2 34 h 2 o 2 o h ho 2 h 2 o 3 4 aqueous reactive species produced by plasma electrolysis without cem since the presence of cem in the cell can make differences in the formation of reactive species in the anode and cathode cells the influence of cem on the concentration of aqueous reactive species is investigated fig 5 shows the free chlorine combined chlorine h2o2 nox and nh3 n produced in the cell without cem the saline was treated with a plasma jet for 15 min as shown in fig 5 a for the positive plasma treated solution pp w the free chlorine concentration detected in the cell is the same as that in the pp eow fig 4a the concentration of combined chlorine for pp eow fig 4a nearly doubled compared to the pp w fig 5a the two times larger volume of the cell without cem than that of the anode cell would be the reason for the observed difference of the combined chlorine concentration as discussed above free chlorine would be converted to combined chlorine through plasma enhanced electrolysis for the negative plasma treated solution np w the concentration of free chlorine shown in fig 5 a is much lower though the anode electrode can promote the formation of free chlorine n containing species generated by the negative plasma jet could consume some of the free chlorine however the concentration of combined chlorine for the np w is low as shown in fig 5 a therefore there may be some other causes for the observed lower concentration of free chlorine free chlorine from the anode side like cl2 could react with h2o2 through reaction 35 liu et al 2017 resulting in a small production of free chlorine h2o2 can oxidize cl into hclo or clo by reactions 36 and 37 though they have a low rate coefficient of 1 8 10 9 m 1 s 1 and 8 3 10 7 m 2 s 1 knipping and dabdub 2002 respectively 35 c l 2 h 2 o 2 2 c l 2 h o 2 36 h 2 o 2 c l clo aq h 2 o 37 h 2 o 2 c l h hcl o aq h 2 o as shown in fig 5 b no2 can only be detected in the cell for the pp w which is different from the case of the cell with cem fig 4 b and e for the positive plasma jet the concentration of free chlorine is relatively low which may not be able to consume no2 completely for the negative plasma jet the low concentration of no2 fig 4e and high concentration of free chlorine fig 4d may result in the very low concentration of no2 in the cell without cem on the other hand no3 species can be detected in the cell for both the pp w and np w as shown in fig 5 b compared to the case of the cell with cem we find that the differences in the cell volume may be the reason for the lower no3 concentration detected in the cell without cem as shown in fig 5 b ammonia nitrogen is also detected in the cell of pp w while there is no ammonia nitrogen detected for the np w the volume of the cell without a membrane is twice that of the half cell with cem leading to a lower concentration of ammonia nitrogen in the aqueous solution moreover the concentration of ammonia nitrogen of the np w in the cells cannot be detected with a detection limit of 0 1 mg l fig 5 c shows the concentration of h2o2 in the cell using the positive plasma jet and negative plasma jet as one electrochemical electrode respectively obviously the concentration of h2o2 is lower compared to the cells with cem one reason for the low production of h2o2 may be the large volume twice of the cell in this case while we can see that the concentration of h2o2 of pp w is still lower than half that of pp eow shown in fig 4 f as mentioned above h2o2 could be consumed by chlorine and then results in a lower concentration of h2o2 in the cell reaction 35 and 36 compared to the case of the cell with cem we find that for the positive plasma jet the differences in concentrations of reactive species may all be attributed to the different volumes of the cell this is because all kinds of reactive species could be generated from the anode side when the positive plasma jet is employed irrespective of the cem presence however for the negative plasma jet the cem can separate the free chlorine and plasma generated reactive species which prevents or at least significantly delays the reactions among these species 3 5 comparison of the inactivation effects between eow and p eow in the bacterial inactivation experiments the bacterial suspensions are incubated for 5 min in saline after the 15 min treatment of the plasma electrolysis and electrolysis only fig 6 a and b show the bacterial inactivation performance for the case of the cell under three configurations with and without cem respectively the results for the case of aem and bpm are shown in fig s6 a and b all the solutions in the cathode cells have no bacterial inactivation and the results are not presented here it is clearly seen that all the treated solutions from the cell without the membrane exhibit lower bacterial inactivation effects than that of the anode solution from the cell with cem previous study suggested that bacteria can be efficiently inactivated when the solution ph is below 4 7 whereas the biological activity of the solution is hardly affected by the plasma treatment above this ph value ercan et al 2016 it is well accepted that aqueous rons produced through the plasma water interactions contribute to bacterial inactivation indeed h2o2 is regarded as the main sterilization agent in plasma activated water zhang et al 2013 it was also reported that the acidified nitrite and hydrogen peroxide were the most important bactericidal rons reagents in the plasma treatment machala et al 2013 for the positive plasma jet the sterilization effects of the pp eow and pp w are not statistically significant p cem 0 223 p wm 0 93 as shown in fig 6 a and b the combined chlorine shows lower disinfection ability than free chlorine oomori et al 2000 therefore though the concentration of combined chlorine detected in the anode cell for positive plasma jet is not very low the solution still has no sterilization ability fig 6 a shows that the np eow for the negative plasma jet completely kills the bacteria however the statistical results demonstrated that the sterilization effects between the control and np w did not differ significantly p 0 051 which shows weak inactivation effects fig 6 b for electrolysis the survival rate of s aureus treated by the solution from an anode cell decreases faster than that of a cell without cem as shown in fig 6 c only np eow still shows a strong sterilization effect after 5 days storage since the solutions are stored in sealed containers without light exposure the effective sterilization could be attributed to the high concentration of free chlorine fig 6d bacteria effects show better consistency with the concentration of free chlorine produced in the p eow the solution pp eow from the positive plasma electrolysis system contains highly concentrated combined chlorine h2o2 and no3 instead of free chlorine microbial results show that pp eow does not play a significant sterilization effect for two possible reasons first the sterilization ability of combined chlorine is lower than of free chlorine and a much higher concentration is needed to ensure better bacteria inactivation effects the second reason is the absence of no2 since the bactericidal effect of plasma activated water is mainly due to the synergistic effect of h2o2 and no2 species naitali et al 2010 while in the negative plasma electrolysis system the np eow shows better sterilization effects due to abundant free chlorine in the water collectively these results indicate that the bacterial inactivation should be attributed to the effects of free chlorine 3 6 plausible mechanisms of the plasma effects table 1 summarizes the physio chemical characteristics of the p eow including solution ph concentrations of reactive species and bacterial inactivation performance from this table we can find that free chlorine should be responsible for better bacterial inactivation besides the absence of nitrite ions in pp eow may result in poor inactivation we can clearly see that the reactive species in the anode and cathode cells are distinctly separated regardless of using the positive or negative plasma jets combined chlorine and ammonia nitrogen were mainly produced by the plasma electrode nitrite ions were only detected in the cathode cell with the negative plasma jet according to the above results it is interesting that a high concentration of free chlorine will enhance the bactericidal effects in some cases for this phenomenon we propose the plausible mechanisms of the aqueous chemical processes in solution with cem as presented in fig 7 the schematic of the electrolysis treatment is not given since it only involves simple oxidation the production of free chlorine and reduction hydrogen evolution reactions in the anode and cathode cells first the acidic and alkaline processes in anode and cathode cells can be seen in both positive and negative plasma enhanced electrolysis treatments which are due to the oxidation and reduction reactions that occur in the solution the discharge process of the positive plasma jet is shown in fig 7 a upon the hydrogen gas evolution in the cathode cell the solution becomes alkaline and the evolution of oxygen and chlorine gases in the anode cell makes the solution acidic then some cl2 molecules are dissolved into the solution to form hclo and or clo in the anode cell collectively referred to as free chlorine yet the nox and nh3 n species generated by the plasma can react with free chlorine to form combined chlorine which results in a low concentration of free chlorine in the anode cell as shown in fig 7 b for the negative plasma jet the evolution of oxygen and chlorine gases also occurs in the anode cell then produces the free chlorine in the np eow which makes the solution acidic on the other hand for the cathode cell the solution becomes alkaline after the discharge due to the cathode reactions mainly including hydrogen evolution the electron induced reduction reactions and reactions of the production of free chlorine and combined chlorine the formation of nox and nh3 n species in the cathode cell could promote generation of free chlorine to form combined chlorine the acidification effect of the negative plasma jet slows the alkalization process in the cathode cell which eliminates the difference in the acidity and alkalinity between the two cells the electron related reactions in the cathode cell can promote the oxidation processes in the anode cell though the saline concentration decreases with the plasma discharge time 4 conclusion water contamination with pathogenic microorganisms remain a significant concern to public health and environment current antibacterial chemical agents still have substantial drawbacks including low sterilization efficiency toxic by products or strict treating conditions therefore a green and efficient agent for water sterilization is needed which has been addressed in this work to resolve these issues and reveal the mechanisms of physio chemical processed of plasma water interactions we first devised a dedicated experimental system containing the plasma jet and electrolysis cell in this study the use of a cation exchange membrane cem splits the cell into two sections and the reactive species are different in the two cells aqueous h2o2 and no3 are mainly produced from the plasma side the usage of ion exchange membranes can change the concentration of aqueous no2 free chlorine can be produced by plasma enhanced electrolysis and electrolysis only treatment but amounts of free chlorine can further react to form combined chlorine under the plasma enhanced electrolysis treatments where the solution exposed to the plasma jet the consumption of h in the cathode cell in the negative jet case promote the process of the formation of free chlorine in negative plasma activated electrolyzed oxidizing water np eow which show the most effective bacteria inactivation the inhibiting effects of alkali in cathode cell and the injection of eaq anode cell for the negative polarity plasma jet discharge may also be the reason for high concentration of free chlorine importantly the np eow remains efficient sterilization capacity after several days storage this study provides a promising alternative solution for efficient and friendly water sterilization approach by inactivating bacteria and gives an insight into plasma enhanced electrolysis which may accelerate the

15479,the high salinity and coexistence of scaling ions ca2 mg2 hco3 in wastewater challenge the efficacy and durability of palladium pd mediated electrocatalytic hydrodechlorination ehdc reaction for chlorinated organic pollutant detoxification due to the accompanying cl poisoning at pd sites and scaling on electrode in a concentrated nacl solution 5 8 g l 1 with ca2 80 0 mg l 1 mg2 30 0 mg l 1 and hco3 180 0 mg l 1 the ehdc efficiency of pd towards 2 4 dichlorophenol decreases significantly from 67 8 to 33 1 in 72 0 h of reaction and the electrode is covered with layers of fluffy aragonite precipitate herein we demonstrate the inclusion of a commercial antiscalant 2 phosphonobutane 1 2 4 tricarboxylic acid pbtc can prevent both scale formation and cl poisoning leading to an efficient and steady ehdc process a mechanistic study reveals that the unique dual function of pbtc primarily originates from the bearing phosphonate and carboxyl groups with the large affinity of these groups especially the phosphonate group for scaling cations and pd the pbtc can chelate and stabilize the scaling cations in water and replace cl at pd surface it can also release protons and trigger the formation of more electron deficient pdδ species via pbtc pd binding leading to an enhanced ehdc this work provides effective solutions to the scaling poisoning issues that commonly encountered in real wastewater and paves a solid road for ehdc application in pollution abatement keywords hydrodechlorination electrocatalysis chlorinated organic pollutant scaling catalyst poisoning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction electrocatalytic hydrodechlorination ehdc which couples hydrogenolysis of the ccl bonds with renewable electric energy has attracted vast research interest in environmental remediation of persistent chlorinated organic pollutants cops wu et al 2022 ehdc reaction proceeds with the generation of adsorbed reductive atomic hydrogens hads at the cathode surface by facilely delivering electrons to h2o molecules they are active to attack and cleave the ccl bonds leading to a decreased toxicity chemical stability of cops and an improved biodegradability of contaminated water waclawek et al 2019 deng et al 2021 such a process is free of extra chemical inclusion and sludge production making ehdc a sustainable and environmentally friendly technology metallic palladium pd is the priority catalyst for ehdc due to its robust performance in hads generation pollutant adsorption and ccl bond activation as pd has a low earth abundance current research primarily focuses on the strategies to improve its mass activity fortunately to date various efficient measures have been developed such as engineering pd into nanoscale sizes or single sites li et al 2021 dispersing pd on the skeleton of a 3d porous support c wu et al 2021 arming pd with active supports e g tio2 wang et al 2020 layered double hydroxide lv et al 2022 ni2coo4 w yu et al 2021 or ligands amine jiang et al 2021 li et al 2020 and doping pd with a second element ag p y chen et al 2021 for example peng et al peng et al 2019 developed robust ag32pd68 alloy nanoparticles for ehdc the mass activity of which was three times that of bare pd nanoparticles despite these advancements little attention has been given to the impacts of the quality of wastewater which is generally more complex than the synthetic wastewater used in lab tests j wu et al 2021 for example the cop effluents in the dyeing pharmaceutical and petrochemical industries usually contain concentrated nacl ranging from 1 to 50 g l 1 zhou et al 2018 it has been documented that cl tends to chelate strongly with pd resulting in profound poisoning effects on pd mediated catalysis huang et al 2021 xu et al 2018 it is thus expected that in these salt laden wastewaters pd catalysts will not work as efficiently and sustainably as that in lab tests garcia segura et al 2020 on the other hand industrial wastewater usually contains scaling ions ca2 mg2 hco3 etc especially when natural water or some scaling ion containing chemicals are used in the industrial processes gao et al 2022 since the ehdc process continuously consumes h a high concentration of oh is present near the cathode which is conducive to mineral scaling the scaling process is a critical issue that is detrimental to the electrocatalytic reaction system it will not only hamper the ehdc reaction by burying the active catalytic center but also increase the energy loss by increasing the electron transfer resistance at catalyst pollutant interfaces rolf et al 2022 given the harsh reaction conditions that might be encountered in salt laden wastewater treatment efficient strategies to enhance the resistance of the ehdc system to both cl poisoning and scaling are desired antiscaling has been extensively studied in circulating cooling and membrane mediated separation distillation systems lee et al 2020 the use of organic antiscalants such as 2 phosphonobutane 1 2 4 tricarboxylic acid pbtc and poly acrylic acid paa al sabagh et al 2018 yin et al 2021 is considered the most efficient and economical way to prevent the scale formation these antiscalants which generally possess abundant carboxyl cooh phosphonate p o oh 2 or amino nhx groups can strongly chelate the scaling ions to make them dispersible in water and simultaneously interfere the nucleation and crystal growth of the scale body because of their spatial molecular structures y chen et al 2021 ansari et al 2020 although lack of relevant studies robust antiscaling by using these antiscalants may still be expected in an electrochemical system on the other hand several works have demonstrated that cl poisoning of noble metals m can be alleviated by decorating the m surface with specific organic ligands these ligands usually possess functional groups such as cooh p o oh 2 or nh2 to bind strongly to m along with the strong binding the ligands can weaken m cl binding via their unique ligand effects and then replace the cl at m surface wu et al 2012 öznur et al 2019 yamazaki et al 2019 strmcnik et al 2010 given that the antiscalant and the ligand have similar structural features i e abundant functional groups dual anti cl poisoning and antiscaling might be anticipated by introducing antiscalants to the ehdc systems herein several commercial organic antiscalants including paa w yu et al 2021 ansari et al 2021 pbtc liu et al 2022 reiss et al 2020 and poly ethyleneimine pei yin et al 2021 were chosen and introduced to the ehdc system pd nanoparticles deposited on carbon black pd c were synthesized as the model catalyst synthetic salt laden wastewater was prepared with 5 8 g l 1 nacl a certain amount of ca2 mg2 and hco3 lee et al 2020 shen et al 2020 and 50 mg l 1 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp a model cop to determine the efficacy of the antiscalants the ehdc performance of pd c was first compared before and after the addition of different antiscalants in the synthetic salt laden wastewater the surface features of the electrode and the solution composition before and after a long term continuous flow ehdc reaction were characterized by various techniques finally the mechanism of action of the antiscalant involved in the dual anti cl poisoning and antiscaling was analyzed with experimental spectroscopy and theoretical calculations and the optimal chemical structure of the antiscalant was proposed 2 experimental section 2 1 materials calcium chloride cacl2 magnesium chloride hexahydrate mgcl2 6h2o sodium chloride nacl sodium sulfate na2so4 sodium hydroxide naoh perchloric acid hclo4 phosphoric acid h3po4 sodium bicarbonate nahco3 and methanol were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china pbtc sodium borohydride nabh4 and pei mw 1800 were obtained from adamas reagent co ltd china paa mw 2000 was purchased from shanghai aladdin reagent co ltd china citric acid was purchased from chongqing boyi chemical reagent co ltd china nafion solution 5 wt was purchased from sigma aldrich carbon black vulcan xc 72r was provided by cabot carbon paper toray 090 was employed as the substrate of the working electrode and was boiled in hno3 solution for 2 0 h prior to use 2 2 synthesis of the pd c catalyst and working electrode typically 15 0 mg of carbon black was dispersed in a mixture of water 15 0 ml and ethanol 15 0 ml under intense sonication then 10 0 ml of a na2pdcl4 aqueous solution 1 7 mg ml 1 was added dropwise to the above carbon black dispersion after 0 5 h of magnetic stirring the solution ph was adjusted to 10 with a 1 0 m naoh solution and another 10 0 ml of the nabh4 solution 320 mg l 1 was added dropwise to reduce pd2 to pd after reaction for 0 5 h the catalyst was collected by filtration washed with water and ethanol and then dried at 45 c here the tuning of ph to 10 prior to nabh4 addition was necessary as the alkaline condition enabled the conversion of pdcl4 2 species to pd oh 2 clusters which facilitated the pd2 reduction and more importantly the even and strong anchoring of pd particles on carbon support huang et al 2020 the pd c working electrode was prepared as follows a catalyst ink 4 0 mg l 1 was first prepared by dispersing 21 4 mg of the pd c catalyst and 26 8 µl of nafion solution in an ethanol solution with the aid of sonication the ink was then drop casted onto the two sides of the carbon paper accessible working area 3 cm 2 cm and the solvent was gradually evaporated under irradiation of an infrared heat lamp the working electrode featured a catalyst film anchored on the surface of carbon paper 2 3 ehdc test the ehdc test was carried out in a customized h typed continuous flow reaction cell with two chambers 100 ml separated by a cation exchange membrane cmi 7000 a three electrode electrocatalysis system was adopted with the pt plate and the ag agcl rod as the encounter and reference electrodes respectively the cathode chamber was fed with an aqueous solution flow rate 36 ml h 1 that contained 2 4 dcp 50 mg l 1 concentrated salt nacl or na2so4 and scaling ions ca2 mg2

influent respectively the faradaic current efficiency f e for 2 4 dcp removal was calculated as 1 f e 4 c phenol 2 c mono cp f v i 100 where c phenol and c mono cp denote the concentration m of the product phenol and the intermediate mono cp o cp and p cp and f and i denote the faraday constant 96 500 c mol 1 and the instant current a in ehdc respectively v denotes the flow rate l s 1 of the

40 60 and the ph was adjusted with orthophosphoric acid the total organic carbon toc content in water was obtained on toc l shimadzu japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization of the pd c catalyst the pd c catalyst was synthesized via a facile wet chemical reduction method as shown in the tem and hrtem images of the catalyst in fig 1a pd nanoparticles with a mean size of 6 06 nm and a typical lattice fringe 0 23 nm of metallic pd 111 facets were evenly dispersed over the carbon nanosheet the diffraction peaks at 2θ 39 5 45 6 and 68 1 in the xrd pattern in fig 1b confirmed the metallic state of the pd phase by icsd 98 006 4918 nieto sandoval et al 2021 fig 1c presents the pd 3d xps spectra of the catalyst indicating a mixed state of pd0 and pd2 the minor amount pd2 originated from the oxidation of the surface atoms of the pd nanoparticles upon exposure to air shu et al 2020 the pd mass loading and electrochemical surface active area of the catalyst were measured to be 27 7 wt and 23 7 m2 g 1 pd fig s1 respectively 3 2 ehdc in salt laden water with scaling ions to simulate the practical application scenario an h type continuous flow cell as schematically shown in fig 2a was customized for long term ehdc tests 72 0 h to determine the effect of the salty solution on the performance of pd ehdc was first conducted in concentrated nacl 5 8 g l 1 0 10 m and na2so4 7 1 g l 1 0 05 m solution respectively the effects of the scaling ions were then investigated in the 5 8 g l 1 nacl solution that contained ca2 80 0 mg l 1 mg2 30 0 mg l 1 and hco3 180 0 mg l 1 at concentrations close to that in natural water lee et al 2020 fig 2b shows that in a bare na2so4 solution approximate 74 4 of the 2 4 dcp was removed from the water under a working potential of 0 85 v vs ag agcl and more importantly this removal efficiency was preserved during 72 0 h of reaction in contrast in a bare nacl solution the removal efficiency was close 72 6 to that in the na2so4 solution at the beginning but gradually decreased to 36 4 after 72 0 h of reaction indicating that the concentrated cl has a profound detrimental impact on ehdc due to its poisoning effect on active pd sites the inclusion of scaling ions in the nacl solution did not aggravate the catalyst deactivation and resulted in an ehdc efficiency initial 67 8 and final 33 1 comparable to that in the bare nacl solution this was unexpected as the scaling process might also bury the active sites which was detrimental to ehdc these abnormal phenomena suggested that the scaling behavior may partially alleviate the cl poisoning by interdicting the cl pd complexation fig 2b also showed that the solution ph increased to above 10 0 in all three reaction systems because of the fast proton consumption by ehdc and the side hydrogen evolution reaction her wang et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 the ph was the lowest in the scaling ion containing system possibly due to the presence of hco3 that releases h during ehdc fig 2c showed that the na2so4 system displayed the highest and most steady f e whereas both the bare and the scaling ion included nacl systems showed lower and gradually descending f e throughout the long term reaction verifying that the concentrated cl hindered the ehdc reaction the f e was higher in the presence of scaling ions possibly due to the alleviating effect of the scaling behavior on cl poisoning fig 2d shows that the electrode was covered with a dense layer of fluffy white precipitates after 72 0 h of reaction in the scaling ion containing nacl system these precipitates consisted of an assembly of irregular particles with a mean size of around 40 80 μm as seen in the sem image fig s2 and were determined to be the aragonite phase caco3 by the xrd pattern pdf 41 1475 fig 2e aragonite is believed to form after the solution ph increase through the reaction of ca2 oh hco3 caco3 h2o the ca2 and mg2 contents in the influent and effluent were analyzed by icp oes the results in fig 2f reveal that the number of ca2 in the solution decreased by 65 7 after 72 0 h of reaction due to the formation of aragonite the mg2 concentration changed little consistent with the xrd result that no mg containing mineral was discerned on electrode fig 2e and the xps result that little mg was identified on electrode surface fig 2f the absence of mg2 in scaling body can be ascribed to either the absence of crystallization directing agent e g the citric acid see below or the fact that the solution ph during reaction was not alkaline enough to trigger the mg oh 2 formation the critical ph for mg oh 2 and caco3 precipitation in our system was calculated to be 10 1 and 7 1 respectively see the calculation process in the si 3 3 effects of the antiscalants to prevent scaling on the electrode during ehdc three commercial antiscalants i e pbtc pei and paa were chosen and applied in the ehdc system in the scaling ion containing nacl solution digital and sem images of the electrodes after reaction for 72 0 h in the presence of different antiscalants 200 mg l 1 are presented in fig 3a the used electrode was free of precipitates in the presence of pbtc however in the presence of paa and pei scaling was not eliminated but alleviated to some extent as the particle distribution was much less dense as marked by green dash circle than that in the control fig 2d paa outperformed pei as the precipitate was almost invisible and the particles were much smaller 1 0 μm and sparsely distributed on the electrode the xrd patterns of the used electrodes in fig 3b reveal that the aragonite phase was present only in the pei involved system verifying that pbtc and paa are more efficient in antiscaling fig 3c shows that the addition of pbtc promoted ehdc but could not prevent the efficiency from descending under the investigated dose 200 mg l 1 in comparison the inclusion of paa and pei both led to inferior ehdc performance and the adverse effect of pei was more significant fig 3c also shows that the solution ph in all the systems were kept at a value larger than 10 during ehdc indicating that the h released from the functional groups were consumed immediately by ehdc exerting neglectable effects on both the scaling and ehdc process fig 3d shows that the f e towards ehdc in all the investigated systems gradually decreased with reaction time and followed an order of pei paa pbtc control it appeared abnormal as the peak f e was reached in the control but the peak ehdc efficiency was achieved in the presence of pbtc this might be ascribed to the fact that pbtc can release h from its cooh and po oh 2 groups the initial solution ph reached 5 99 in the presence of 200 mg l 1 pbtc vs 8 20 in control and 6 18 and 9 31 with paa and pei respectively a lower ph can increase the yield of hads on the pd surface which promotes the side her it has been well documented that antiscalants inhibit scaling primarily by bearing cooh nh2 and po oh 2 functional moieties they are capable of stabilizing the scaling cations such as ca2 mg2 and al3 in solution via a complexation effect and prohibiting the nucleation and crystal growth of the precipitate via their spatial structure spinthaki et al 2018 fig 3e displayed the change in the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 during reaction when different antiscalants were employed in the control the mg2 concentration remained constant while 61 2 of ca2 precipitated in the form of aragonite in the presence of pbtc the contents of ca2 and mg2 in effluent remained almost constant and few ca and mg elements were discerned by edx analyses on the used electrode fig 3f confirming the superior performance of pbtc in antiscaling the inclusion of pei did not alleviate the ca2 precipitation 68 6 precipitated but induced the precipitation of 75 1 mg2 however the edx spectra in fig 3g reflected a small amount of mg2 on electrode which could be ascribed to the fact that the mg oh 2 precipitates were dispersed in the effluent see fig s3 pei was therefore ascertained to be inefficient in antiscaling in our system and was not employed in the following study the presence of paa decreased the proportion of ca2 precipitation to 14 9 but still precipitates 33 8 of the mg2 the edx results in fig 3h also show a larger amount of mg than ca on electrode surface however unlike the deposition on the aragonite surface in the presence of pei fig 3g the mg element was evenly distributed on the electrode in the presence of paa indicative of the different antiscaling mechanisms of mg2 in the presence of paa and pei respectively given the robust performance of pbtc the effects of its dose i e 200 400 and 600 mg l 1 were investigated to obtain more insight into its efficacy the digital and sem images of the electrodes in fig 4a show that under all three investigated concentrations scaling was eliminated with no precipitates observed on the electrode surface the corresponding edx results in figs 4b c confirm that the mg and ca contents on the electrode were very low even after 72 0 h of reaction confirming the high antiscaling efficiency of pbtc fig 4d presents the ehdc efficiency and solution ph at different pbtc concentrations during 72 0 h of reaction with the pbtc dose increasing from 200 to 600 mg l 1 the ehdc became more efficient and more impressively its decrease with the reaction time induced by cl poisoning became much slower specifically the ehdc decreased by only 7 2 in 72 0 h of reaction at 600 mg l 1 pbtc in comparison to 39 5 at 200 mg l 1 of pbtc all these demonstrate that in addition to antiscaling pbtc has the potential to relieve the poisoning effect of cl and promote ehdc this result also suggests that more pbtc should be used to prevent scaling and improve the ehdc in wastewater that contains concentrated cl phosphorus is a strictly regulated element that can trigger severe eutrophication in water system and a threshold concentration of 0 3 mg l 1 was set for wastewater discharge in the integrated wastewater discharge standard gb 8978 1996 to eliminate the phosphorus related environmental risk flocculation precipitation technology using the traditional polyaluminum chloride and polyacrylamide pac pam flocculants was employed to remove the pbtc from the effluent as observed in fig 4e the toc and phosphorus were both significantly decreased from 88 8 to 6 6 mg l 1 and 31 6 to 0 3 mg l 1 respectively corresponding chemicals cost for pbtc removal from every ton of treated water by coagulation precipitation process was roughly estimated to be 0 51 table s1 3 4 origin of the superior antiscaling performance of pbtc the above experimental results have demonstrated the superior performance of pbtc in antiscaling however two questions remain i why does the pbtc outperform paa in antiscaling ii how does paa facilitate mg2 precipitation pbtc is a small molecule with three cooh groups and one po oh 2 group while paa is a large polymer mw 2000 armed with only cooh groups the superior performance of pbtc over that of paa in antiscaling may therefore arise from either its smaller molecular size or the bearing po oh 2 group to preclude the molecular size effect citric acid ca which has a molecular size comparable to that of pbtc but is armed with only cooh groups was introduced in the ehdc system the sem image of the electrode in fig s4 reveals that the pd nanoparticles were encapsulated within dense layers of the intercrossed lamellar scale body the xrd pattern indicates the formation of a ca2 and mg2 mixed mineral scale correspondingly the ca containing reaction system resulted in a much inferior and unsteady ehdc performance compared to the control all these results demonstrate that the po oh 2 group is primarily responsible for the robust performance of pbtc it has been documented that a robust antiscalant should have a high complexation strength and capacity for scaling cations as revealed by the solubility product of caco3 mgco3 ca3 po4 2 and mg3 po4 2 table s2 po oh 2 should chelate more intensely with both ca2 and mg2 than cooh on the other hand as shown in fig 5a the o and oh moieties in the po oh 2 group had a more open spatial structure 3d vs 2d for cooh and kept farther away from each other than that in the cooh group which endowed the po oh 2 group with a larger capacity for cations spinthaki et al 2018 ji et al 2017 these results thus reasonably explain the positive role of the po oh 2 group in antiscaling the presence of paa and ca promoted the mg2 precipitation whereas the pbtc almost hindered the mg2 precipitation this should not be associated with the solution ph as the solution ph during ehdc in the presence of paa was a little bit lower than that in the presence of pbtc fig 3c it has been well documented that ca is an important structure directing agent used in the preparation of mg2 containing minerals polat and sayan 2019 for example zhu et al zhu et al 2021 successfully synthesized coral like mg oh 2 particles with ca and they claimed that ca was the key to the lamellar structure mao et al mao et al 2011 also made use of ca to induce the crystallization of lamellar mg oh 2 on cotton fabrics given the similar lamellar structure of the scale body with the above reported mg oh 2 particles fig s4 we proposed that paa and ca with cooh groups might serve as structure directing agents to boost the nucleation and crystal growth of the mg2 included scale 3 5 origin of the anti cl poisoning effect of pbtc fig 4d showed that pbtc was impressively efficient in alleviating the cl poisoning and promoting the ehdc as pbtc is a small organic molecule with both po oh 2 and cooh groups its anti cl poisoning function might result from its ability to replace the cl at pd surface via these functional groups this speculation was first supported by our density functional theory dft calculation results in fig 5b which show that the deprotonated cooh and p o oh 2 groups bind more strongly with pd than the cl see the details of calculation process in si on the other hand the xps survey spectra evidenced the presence of more p and less cl on electrode when more pbtc was included fig 5c one may wonder why pbtc will not poison the pd like cl this might be attributed to the much larger molecular size of pbtc than that of cl which makes it impossible to chelate pd as densely as cl as the pbtc binds with the surface pd we speculated that it might also serve as the surface ligand to optimize the ehdc process on pd via the ligand effect jiang et al 2021 to gain insight into the effect of pbtc on the electronic structure of pd the pd 3d xps spectra of the used electrodes in the pbtc free and containing systems were compared long et al 2021 as observed in fig 5d the pd2 content on pd surface increased from 0 29 in the control derived from the na2so4 system to 0 33 derived from the bare nacl system and further to 0 38 and 0 42 when 200 and 400 mg l 1 of pbtc were further employed it was concluded that the pbtc enabled enrichment of the electron deficient pd species pdδ 0 δ 2 on the electrode possibly due to the large electronegativity of the o atoms on functional groups c wu et al 2021 song et al 2017 recently several research groups have demonstrated that pdδ is more active than metallic pd0 species for ehdc due to its robust performance in hads generation stabilization and pollutant adsorption activation lv et al 2022 w yu et al 2021 huang et al 2021 we therefore concluded that pbtc boosted ehdc through enriching the active pdδ species to obtain more insight into the effect of pbtc on hads generation and stabilization cvs of pd c in the absence and presence of pbtc were conducted as observed the negative scan of voltammogram in fig 5e the reduction peak corresponding to the conversion of h to hads in the presence of pbtc moved to a more positive potential at around 0 20 v when compared to that in bare nacl system zheng et al 2021 deng et al 2022 furthermore as shown in the positive scan of voltammogram the productions of both the hads and absorbed hydrogen species habs were intensified when more pbtc were included whereas the h2 production was hindered in some extent qin et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 as the pbtc would release protons to solution that could lower the ph the cv of pd c in bare nacl solution but with a ph equal to that in the presence of 200 mg l 1 pbtc named nacl hcl system hcl was used to tune ph was also investigated intriguingly the yields of hads and habs followed a decreasing order of nacl pbtc system nacl hcl system nacl system whereas the h2 yield followed a reverse order of nacl pbtc system nacl hcl system nacl system all these results confirmed that the pbtc ligand could intensify both the generation and stabilization of hads and prevent its evolution to her we believed that this unique function of pbtc was associated with its dual functions i it could release protons to enhance proton transfer and hads production ii it could trigger the formation of more electron deficient pdδ species via intense pbtc pd binding contributing to both the production and stabilization of hads 4 conclusion herein we demonstrated that the inclusion of the commercial antiscalant pbtc could achieve the dual purposes of antiscaling and anti cl poisoning during ehdc in a salt laden solution containing scaling ions a mechanistic study revealed that the unique dual function of pbtc primarily originated from its p o oh 2 and cooh groups these groups can chelate and stabilize the scaling cations in water due to their large complexation strength and capacity with the scaling cations the p o oh 2 group outperformed the cooh group due to its more open spatial structure furthermore these groups with high binding strengths with pd enabled pbtc to replace the cl readily at pd surface which not only alleviated cl poisoning but also gave rise to more electron deficient pdδ species for an enhanced ehdc this work provides effective solutions to the scaling poisoning issues that may be encountered in

15479,the high salinity and coexistence of scaling ions ca2 mg2 hco3 in wastewater challenge the efficacy and durability of palladium pd mediated electrocatalytic hydrodechlorination ehdc reaction for chlorinated organic pollutant detoxification due to the accompanying cl poisoning at pd sites and scaling on electrode in a concentrated nacl solution 5 8 g l 1 with ca2 80 0 mg l 1 mg2 30 0 mg l 1 and hco3 180 0 mg l 1 the ehdc efficiency of pd towards 2 4 dichlorophenol decreases significantly from 67 8 to 33 1 in 72 0 h of reaction and the electrode is covered with layers of fluffy aragonite precipitate herein we demonstrate the inclusion of a commercial antiscalant 2 phosphonobutane 1 2 4 tricarboxylic acid pbtc can prevent both scale formation and cl poisoning leading to an efficient and steady ehdc process a mechanistic study reveals that the unique dual function of pbtc primarily originates from the bearing phosphonate and carboxyl groups with the large affinity of these groups especially the phosphonate group for scaling cations and pd the pbtc can chelate and stabilize the scaling cations in water and replace cl at pd surface it can also release protons and trigger the formation of more electron deficient pdδ species via pbtc pd binding leading to an enhanced ehdc this work provides effective solutions to the scaling poisoning issues that commonly encountered in real wastewater and paves a solid road for ehdc application in pollution abatement keywords hydrodechlorination electrocatalysis chlorinated organic pollutant scaling catalyst poisoning data

vast research interest in environmental remediation of persistent chlorinated organic pollutants cops wu et al 2022 ehdc reaction proceeds with the generation of adsorbed reductive atomic hydrogens hads at the cathode surface by facilely delivering electrons to h2o molecules they are active to attack and cleave the ccl bonds leading to a decreased toxicity chemical stability of cops and an improved biodegradability of contaminated water waclawek et al 2019 deng et al 2021 such a process is free of extra chemical inclusion and sludge production making ehdc a sustainable and environmentally friendly technology metallic palladium pd is the priority catalyst for ehdc due to its robust performance in hads generation pollutant adsorption and ccl bond activation as pd has a low earth abundance current research primarily focuses on the strategies to improve its mass activity fortunately to date various efficient measures have been developed such as engineering pd into

ag32pd68 alloy nanoparticles for ehdc the mass activity of which was three times that of bare pd nanoparticles despite these advancements little attention has been given to the impacts of the quality of wastewater which is generally more complex than the synthetic wastewater used in lab tests j wu et al 2021 for example the cop effluents in the dyeing pharmaceutical and petrochemical industries usually contain concentrated nacl ranging from 1 to 50 g l 1 zhou et al 2018 it has been documented that cl tends to chelate strongly with pd resulting in profound poisoning effects on pd mediated catalysis huang et al 2021 xu et al 2018 it is thus expected that in these salt laden wastewaters pd catalysts will not work as efficiently and sustainably as that in lab tests garcia segura et al 2020 on the other hand industrial wastewater usually contains scaling ions ca2 mg2 hco3 etc especially when natural water or some scaling ion containing chemicals are used in the industrial processes gao et al 2022 since the ehdc process continuously consumes h a high concentration of oh is present near the cathode which is conducive to mineral scaling the scaling process is a critical issue that is detrimental to the electrocatalytic reaction system it will not only hamper the ehdc reaction by burying the active catalytic center but also increase the energy loss by increasing the electron transfer resistance at catalyst pollutant interfaces rolf et al 2022 given the harsh reaction conditions that might be encountered in salt laden wastewater treatment efficient strategies to enhance the resistance of the ehdc system to both cl poisoning and scaling are desired antiscaling has been extensively studied in circulating cooling and membrane mediated separation distillation systems lee et al 2020 the use of organic antiscalants such as 2 phosphonobutane 1 2 4 tricarboxylic acid pbtc and poly acrylic acid paa al sabagh et al 2018 yin et al 2021 is considered the most efficient and economical way to prevent the scale formation these antiscalants which generally possess abundant carboxyl cooh phosphonate p o oh 2 or amino nhx groups can strongly chelate the scaling ions to make them dispersible in water and simultaneously interfere the nucleation and crystal growth of the scale body because of their spatial molecular structures y chen et al 2021 ansari et al 2020 although lack of relevant studies robust antiscaling by using these antiscalants may still be expected in an electrochemical system on the other hand several works have demonstrated that cl poisoning of noble metals m can be alleviated by decorating the m surface with specific organic ligands these ligands usually possess functional groups such as cooh p o oh 2 or nh2 to bind strongly to m along with the strong binding the ligands can weaken m cl binding via their unique ligand effects and then replace the cl at m surface wu et al 2012 öznur et al 2019 yamazaki et al 2019 strmcnik et al 2010 given that the antiscalant and the ligand have similar structural features i e abundant functional groups dual anti cl poisoning and antiscaling might be anticipated by introducing antiscalants to the ehdc systems herein several commercial organic antiscalants including paa w yu et al 2021 ansari et al 2021 pbtc liu et al 2022 reiss et al 2020 and poly ethyleneimine pei yin et al 2021 were chosen and introduced to the ehdc system pd nanoparticles deposited on carbon black pd c were synthesized as the model catalyst synthetic salt laden wastewater was prepared with 5 8 g l 1 nacl a certain amount of ca2 mg2 and hco3 lee et al 2020 shen et al 2020 and 50 mg l 1 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp a model cop to determine the efficacy of the antiscalants the ehdc performance of pd c was first compared before and after the addition of different antiscalants in the synthetic salt laden wastewater the surface features of the electrode and the solution composition before and after a long term continuous flow ehdc reaction were characterized by various techniques finally the mechanism of action of the antiscalant involved in the dual anti cl poisoning and antiscaling was analyzed with experimental spectroscopy and theoretical calculations and the optimal chemical structure of the antiscalant was proposed 2 experimental section 2 1 materials calcium chloride cacl2 magnesium chloride hexahydrate mgcl2 6h2o sodium chloride nacl sodium sulfate na2so4 sodium hydroxide naoh perchloric acid hclo4 phosphoric acid h3po4 sodium bicarbonate nahco3 and methanol were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china pbtc sodium borohydride nabh4 and pei mw 1800 were obtained from adamas reagent co ltd china paa mw 2000 was purchased from shanghai aladdin reagent co ltd china citric acid was purchased from chongqing boyi chemical reagent co ltd china nafion solution 5 wt was purchased from sigma aldrich carbon black vulcan xc 72r was provided by cabot carbon paper toray 090 was employed as the substrate of the working electrode and was boiled in hno3 solution for 2 0 h prior to use 2 2 synthesis of the pd c catalyst and working electrode typically 15 0 mg of carbon black was dispersed in a mixture of water 15 0 ml and ethanol 15 0 ml under intense sonication then 10 0 ml of a na2pdcl4 aqueous solution 1 7 mg ml 1 was added dropwise to the above carbon black dispersion after 0 5 h of magnetic stirring the solution ph was adjusted to 10 with a 1 0 m naoh solution and another 10 0 ml of the nabh4 solution 320 mg l 1 was added dropwise to reduce pd2 to pd after reaction for 0 5 h the catalyst was collected by filtration washed with water and ethanol and then dried at 45 c here the tuning of ph to 10 prior to nabh4 addition was necessary as the alkaline condition enabled the conversion of pdcl4 2 species to pd oh 2 clusters which facilitated the pd2 reduction and more importantly the even and strong anchoring of pd particles on carbon support huang et al 2020 the pd c working electrode was prepared as follows a catalyst ink 4 0 mg l 1 was first prepared by dispersing 21 4 mg of the pd c catalyst and 26 8 µl of nafion solution in an ethanol solution with the aid of sonication the ink was then drop casted onto the two sides of the carbon paper accessible working area 3 cm 2 cm and the solvent was gradually evaporated under irradiation of an infrared heat lamp the working electrode featured a catalyst film anchored on the surface of carbon paper 2 3 ehdc test the ehdc test was carried out in a customized h typed continuous flow reaction cell with two chambers 100 ml separated by a cation exchange membrane cmi 7000 a three electrode electrocatalysis system was adopted with the pt plate and the ag agcl rod as the encounter and reference electrodes respectively the cathode chamber was fed with an aqueous solution flow rate 36 ml h 1 that contained 2 4 dcp 50 mg l 1 concentrated salt nacl or na2so4 and scaling ions ca2 mg2 and hco3 while the anode chamber was fed with a 50 mm na2so4 solution the ehdc efficiency was calculated by 1 c eff c inf 100 where c eff and c inf denote the 2 4 dcp concentration in the effluent and influent respectively the faradaic current efficiency f e for 2 4 dcp removal was calculated as 1 f e 4 c phenol 2 c mono cp f v i 100 where c phenol and c mono cp denote the concentration m of the product phenol and the intermediate mono cp o cp and p cp and f and i denote the faraday constant 96 500 c mol 1 and the instant current a in ehdc respectively v denotes the flow rate l s 1 of the wastewater 2 4 characterization all electrochemical studies including cyclic voltammetry cv and ehdc tests were performed on a chi600e electrochemical workstation chenhua co china x ray diffraction

40 60 and the ph was adjusted with orthophosphoric acid the total organic carbon toc content in water was obtained on toc l shimadzu japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization of the pd c catalyst the pd c catalyst was synthesized via a facile wet chemical reduction method as shown in the tem and hrtem images of the catalyst in fig 1a pd nanoparticles with a mean size of 6 06 nm and a typical lattice fringe 0 23 nm of metallic pd 111 facets were evenly dispersed over the carbon nanosheet the diffraction peaks at 2θ 39 5 45 6 and 68 1 in the xrd pattern in fig 1b confirmed the metallic state of the pd phase by icsd 98 006 4918 nieto sandoval et al 2021 fig 1c presents the pd 3d xps spectra of the catalyst indicating a mixed state of pd0 and pd2 the minor amount pd2 originated from the oxidation of the surface atoms of the pd nanoparticles upon exposure to air shu et al 2020 the pd mass loading and electrochemical surface active area of the catalyst were measured to be 27 7 wt and 23 7 m2 g 1 pd fig s1 respectively 3 2 ehdc in salt laden water with scaling ions to simulate the practical application scenario an h type continuous flow cell as schematically shown in fig 2a was customized for long term ehdc tests 72 0 h to determine the effect of the salty solution on the performance of pd ehdc was first conducted in concentrated nacl 5 8 g l 1 0 10 m and na2so4 7 1 g l 1 0 05 m solution respectively the effects of the scaling ions were then investigated in the 5 8 g l 1 nacl solution that contained ca2 80 0 mg l 1 mg2 30 0 mg l 1 and hco3 180 0 mg l 1 at concentrations close to that in natural water lee et al 2020 fig 2b shows that in a bare na2so4 solution approximate 74 4 of the 2 4 dcp was removed from the water under a working potential of 0 85 v vs ag agcl and more importantly this removal efficiency was preserved during 72 0 h of reaction in contrast in a bare nacl solution the removal efficiency was close 72 6 to that in the na2so4 solution at the beginning but gradually decreased to 36 4 after 72 0 h of reaction indicating that the concentrated cl has a profound detrimental impact on ehdc due to its poisoning effect on active pd sites the inclusion of scaling ions in the nacl solution did not aggravate the catalyst deactivation and resulted in an ehdc efficiency initial 67 8 and final 33 1 comparable to that in the bare nacl solution this was unexpected as the scaling process might also bury the active sites which was detrimental to ehdc these abnormal phenomena suggested that the scaling behavior may partially alleviate the cl poisoning by interdicting the cl pd complexation fig 2b also showed that the solution ph increased to above 10 0 in all three reaction systems because of the fast proton consumption by ehdc and the side hydrogen evolution reaction her wang et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 the ph was the lowest in the scaling ion containing system possibly due to the presence of hco3 that releases h during ehdc fig 2c showed that the na2so4 system displayed the highest and most steady f e whereas both the bare and the scaling ion included nacl systems showed lower and gradually descending f e throughout the long term reaction verifying that the concentrated cl hindered the ehdc reaction the f e was higher in the presence of scaling ions possibly due to the alleviating effect of the scaling behavior on cl poisoning fig 2d shows that the electrode was covered with a dense layer of fluffy white precipitates after 72 0 h of reaction in the scaling ion containing nacl system these precipitates consisted of an assembly of irregular particles with a mean size of around 40 80 μm as seen in the sem image fig s2 and were determined to be the aragonite phase caco3 by the xrd pattern pdf 41 1475 fig 2e aragonite is believed to form after the solution ph increase through the reaction of ca2 oh hco3 caco3 h2o the ca2 and mg2 contents in the influent and effluent were analyzed by icp oes the results in fig 2f reveal that the number of ca2 in the solution decreased by 65 7 after 72 0 h of reaction due to the formation of aragonite the mg2 concentration changed little consistent with the xrd result that no mg containing mineral was discerned on electrode fig 2e and the xps result that little mg was identified on electrode surface fig 2f the absence of mg2 in scaling body can be ascribed to either the absence of crystallization directing agent e g the citric acid see below or the fact that the solution ph during reaction was not alkaline enough to trigger the mg oh 2 formation the critical ph for mg oh 2 and caco3 precipitation in our system was calculated to be 10 1 and 7 1 respectively see the calculation process in the si 3 3 effects of the antiscalants to prevent scaling on the electrode during ehdc three commercial antiscalants i e pbtc pei and paa were chosen and applied in the ehdc system in the scaling ion containing nacl solution digital and sem images of the electrodes after reaction for 72 0 h in the presence of different antiscalants 200 mg l 1 are presented in fig 3a the used electrode was free of precipitates in the presence of pbtc however in the presence of paa and pei scaling was not eliminated but alleviated to some extent as the particle distribution was much less dense as marked by green dash circle than that in the control fig 2d paa outperformed pei as the precipitate was almost invisible and the particles were much smaller 1 0 μm and sparsely distributed on the electrode the xrd patterns of the used electrodes in fig 3b reveal that the aragonite phase was present only in the pei involved system verifying that pbtc and paa are more efficient in antiscaling fig 3c shows that the addition of pbtc promoted ehdc but could not prevent the efficiency from descending under the investigated dose 200 mg l 1 in comparison the inclusion of paa and pei both led to inferior ehdc performance and the adverse effect of pei was more significant fig 3c also shows that the solution ph in all the systems were kept at a value larger than 10 during ehdc indicating that the h released from the functional groups were consumed immediately by ehdc exerting neglectable effects on both the scaling and ehdc process fig 3d shows that the f e towards ehdc in all the investigated systems gradually decreased with reaction time and followed an order of pei paa pbtc control it appeared abnormal as the peak f e was reached in the control but the peak ehdc efficiency was achieved in the presence of pbtc this might be ascribed to the fact that pbtc can release h from its cooh and po oh 2 groups the initial solution ph reached 5 99 in the presence of 200 mg l 1 pbtc vs 8 20 in control and 6 18 and 9 31 with paa and pei respectively a lower ph can increase the yield of hads on the pd surface which promotes the side her it has been well documented that antiscalants inhibit scaling primarily by bearing cooh nh2 and po oh 2 functional moieties they are capable of stabilizing the scaling cations such as ca2 mg2 and al3 in solution via a complexation effect and prohibiting the nucleation and crystal growth of the precipitate via their spatial structure spinthaki et al 2018 fig 3e displayed the change in the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 during reaction when different antiscalants were employed in the control the mg2 concentration remained constant while 61 2 of ca2 precipitated in the form of aragonite in the presence of pbtc the contents of ca2 and mg2 in effluent remained almost constant and few ca and mg elements were discerned by edx analyses on the used electrode fig 3f confirming the superior performance of pbtc in antiscaling the inclusion of pei did not alleviate the ca2 precipitation 68 6 precipitated but induced the precipitation of 75 1 mg2 however the edx spectra in fig 3g reflected a small amount of mg2 on electrode which could be ascribed to the fact that the mg oh 2 precipitates were dispersed in the effluent see fig s3 pei was therefore ascertained to be inefficient in antiscaling in our system and was not employed in the following study the presence of paa decreased the proportion of ca2 precipitation to 14 9 but still precipitates 33 8 of the mg2 the edx results in fig 3h also show a larger amount of mg than ca on electrode surface however unlike the deposition on the aragonite surface in the presence of pei fig 3g the mg element was evenly distributed on the electrode in the presence of paa indicative of the different antiscaling mechanisms of mg2 in the presence of paa and pei respectively given the robust performance of pbtc the effects of its dose i e 200 400 and 600 mg l 1 were investigated to obtain more insight into its efficacy the digital and sem images of the electrodes in fig 4a show that under all three investigated concentrations scaling was eliminated with no precipitates observed on the electrode surface the corresponding edx results in figs 4b c confirm that the mg and ca contents on the electrode were very low even after 72 0 h of reaction confirming the high antiscaling efficiency of pbtc fig 4d presents the ehdc efficiency and solution ph at different pbtc concentrations during 72 0 h of reaction with the pbtc dose increasing from 200 to 600 mg l 1 the ehdc became more efficient and more impressively its decrease with the reaction time induced by cl poisoning became much slower specifically the ehdc decreased by only 7 2 in 72 0 h of reaction at 600 mg l 1 pbtc in comparison to 39 5 at 200 mg l 1 of pbtc all these demonstrate that in addition to antiscaling pbtc has the potential to relieve the poisoning effect of cl and promote ehdc this result also suggests that more pbtc should be used to prevent scaling and improve the ehdc in wastewater that contains concentrated cl phosphorus is a strictly regulated element that can trigger severe eutrophication in water system and a threshold concentration of 0 3 mg l 1 was set for wastewater discharge in the integrated wastewater discharge standard gb 8978 1996 to eliminate the phosphorus related environmental risk flocculation precipitation technology using the traditional polyaluminum chloride and polyacrylamide pac pam flocculants was employed to remove the pbtc from the effluent as observed in fig 4e the toc and phosphorus were both significantly decreased from 88 8 to 6 6 mg l 1 and 31 6 to 0 3 mg l 1 respectively corresponding chemicals cost for pbtc removal from every ton of treated water by coagulation precipitation process was roughly estimated to be 0 51 table s1 3 4 origin of the superior antiscaling performance of pbtc the above experimental results have demonstrated the superior performance of pbtc in antiscaling however two questions remain i why does the pbtc outperform paa in antiscaling ii how does paa facilitate mg2 precipitation pbtc is a small molecule with three cooh groups and one po oh 2 group while paa is a large polymer mw 2000 armed with only cooh groups the superior performance of pbtc over that of paa in antiscaling may therefore arise from either its smaller molecular size or the bearing po oh 2 group to preclude the molecular size effect citric acid ca which has a molecular size comparable to that of pbtc but is armed with only cooh groups was introduced in the ehdc system the sem image of the electrode in fig s4 reveals that the pd nanoparticles were encapsulated within dense layers of the intercrossed lamellar scale body the xrd pattern indicates the formation of a ca2 and mg2 mixed mineral scale correspondingly the ca containing reaction system resulted in a much inferior and unsteady ehdc performance compared to the control all these results demonstrate that the po oh 2 group is primarily responsible for the robust performance of pbtc it has been documented that a robust antiscalant should have a high complexation strength and capacity for scaling cations as revealed by the solubility product of caco3 mgco3 ca3 po4 2 and mg3 po4 2 table s2 po oh 2 should chelate more intensely with both ca2 and mg2 than cooh on the other hand as shown in fig 5a the o and oh moieties in the po oh 2 group had a more open spatial structure 3d vs 2d for cooh and kept farther away from each other than that in the cooh group which endowed the po oh 2 group with a larger capacity for cations spinthaki et al 2018 ji et al 2017 these results thus reasonably explain the positive role of the po oh 2 group in antiscaling the presence of paa and ca promoted the mg2 precipitation whereas the pbtc almost hindered the mg2 precipitation this should not be associated with the solution ph as the solution ph during ehdc in the presence of paa was a little bit lower than that in the presence of pbtc fig 3c it has been well documented that ca is an important structure directing agent used in the preparation of mg2 containing minerals polat and sayan 2019 for example zhu et al zhu et al 2021 successfully synthesized coral like mg oh 2 particles with ca and they claimed that ca was the key to the lamellar structure mao et al mao et al 2011 also made use of ca to induce the crystallization of lamellar mg oh 2 on cotton fabrics given the similar lamellar structure of the scale body with the above reported mg oh 2 particles fig s4 we proposed that paa and ca with cooh groups might serve as structure directing agents to boost the nucleation and crystal growth of the mg2 included scale 3 5 origin of the anti cl poisoning effect of pbtc fig 4d showed that pbtc was impressively efficient in alleviating the cl poisoning and promoting the ehdc as pbtc is a small organic molecule with both po oh 2 and cooh groups its anti cl poisoning function might result from its ability to replace the cl at pd surface via these functional groups this speculation was first supported by our density functional theory dft calculation results in fig 5b which show that the deprotonated cooh and p o oh 2 groups bind more strongly with pd than the cl see the details of calculation process in si on the other hand the xps survey spectra evidenced the presence of more p and less cl on electrode when more pbtc was included fig 5c one may wonder why pbtc will not poison the pd like cl this might be attributed to the much larger molecular size of pbtc than that of cl which makes it impossible to chelate pd as densely as cl as the pbtc binds with the surface pd we speculated that it might also serve as the surface ligand to optimize the ehdc process on pd via the ligand effect jiang et al 2021 to gain insight into the effect of pbtc on the electronic structure of pd the pd 3d xps spectra of the used electrodes in the pbtc free and containing systems were compared long et al 2021 as observed in fig 5d the pd2 content on pd surface increased from 0 29 in the control derived from the na2so4 system to 0 33 derived from the bare nacl system and further to 0 38 and 0 42 when 200 and 400 mg l 1 of pbtc were further employed it was concluded that the pbtc enabled enrichment of the electron deficient pd species pdδ 0 δ 2 on the electrode possibly due to the large electronegativity of the o atoms on functional groups c wu et al 2021 song et al 2017 recently several research groups have demonstrated that pdδ is more active than metallic pd0 species for ehdc due to its robust performance in hads generation stabilization and pollutant adsorption activation lv et al 2022 w yu et al 2021 huang et al 2021 we therefore concluded that pbtc boosted ehdc through enriching the active pdδ species to obtain more insight into the effect of pbtc on hads generation and stabilization cvs of pd c in the absence and presence of pbtc were conducted as observed the negative scan of voltammogram in fig 5e the reduction peak corresponding to the conversion of h to hads in the presence of pbtc moved to a more positive potential at around 0 20 v when compared to that in bare nacl system zheng et al 2021 deng et al 2022 furthermore as shown in the positive scan of voltammogram the productions of both the hads and absorbed hydrogen species habs were intensified when more pbtc were included whereas the h2 production was hindered in some extent qin et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 as the pbtc would release protons to solution that could lower the ph the cv of pd c in bare nacl solution but with a ph equal to that in the presence of 200 mg l 1 pbtc named nacl hcl system hcl was used to tune ph was also investigated intriguingly the yields of hads and habs followed a decreasing order of nacl pbtc system nacl hcl system nacl system whereas the h2 yield followed a reverse order of nacl pbtc system nacl hcl system nacl system all these results confirmed that the pbtc ligand could intensify both the generation and stabilization of hads and prevent its evolution to her we believed that this unique function of pbtc was associated with its dual functions i it could release protons to enhance proton transfer and hads production ii it could trigger the formation of more electron deficient pdδ species via intense pbtc pd binding contributing to both the production and stabilization of hads 4 conclusion herein we demonstrated that the inclusion of the commercial antiscalant pbtc could achieve the dual purposes of antiscaling and anti cl poisoning during ehdc in a salt laden solution containing scaling ions a mechanistic study revealed that the unique dual function of pbtc primarily originated from its p o oh 2 and cooh groups these groups can chelate and stabilize the scaling cations in water due to their large complexation strength and capacity with the scaling cations the p o oh 2 group outperformed the cooh group due to its more open spatial structure furthermore these groups with high binding strengths with pd enabled pbtc to replace the cl readily at pd surface which not only alleviated cl poisoning but also gave rise to more electron deficient pdδ species for an enhanced ehdc this work provides effective solutions to the scaling poisoning issues that may be encountered in
