15775,biochar is a valuable treatment option for faecal sludge management fsm however the sanitation application rates of biochar in fsm are not well established there is also a gap in knowledge about the effect of actual raw sewage effluent and sludge on organic and inorganic contaminants migration of biochar treated soil this study investigated the concentration and migration rates of n p e coli and faecal coliform bacteria through different soil bed biochar column treatments leached with raw faecal sludge and sewage effluent forty four soil bed leaching columns with pinewood biochar rates at 5 10 and 20 t ha were set at the bloemspruit wastewater plant south africa the pinewood biochar used had a ph of 10 21 total c composition of 92 surface area of 517 m² g and a pore size of 1 7 nm it was found that the 20 t biochar per ha treatment with faecal sludge increased water retention flows of 33 mm h at 0 t ha compared to 0 8 mm h at 20 t ha and leachates purification high detections were observed for faecal coliforms and e coli above 4331 cfu 100 ml from the effluent and faecal sludge in soils without biochar detection of e coli at 20 t ha decreased to 1 cfu 100 ml while the faecal coliforms still had counts above 10 cfu 100 ml the results showed a decreasing rate of nitrates phosphates zinc and copper with an increasing biochar application rate pinewood biochar showed significant removal efficiencies of bacteria between 89 and 98 and nitrates and phosphates between 68 and 98 significant differences were seen at p 0 05 between the means of the treatments with and without biochar the results from the study show that pinewood biochar applied at rates between 5 and 20 t ha has a high organic and inorganic contaminants reduction potential for fsm graphical

other on site sanitation systems strande et al 2014 unicef and who 2017 krueger et al 2020 globally sanitation issues water resource contamination and protection have an interconnected relationship especially in most developing countries like south africa sa sanitation matters 2014 people living in rural and underdeveloped urban areas largely depend solely on on site sanitation systems such as pit latrines and untreated drinking groundwater sources rosa and clasen 2010 stats sa s ghs 2017 mamera et al 2020a mamera et al 2020b although latrine sanitation systems are certainly more beneficial than open defecation unicef and who 2017 the pollution potential to groundwater resources due to contaminants leaching including n p e coli and faecal coliform bacteria from these systems can cause threats to humans and the environment thus sustainable ways to improve and minimize inorganic and organic contaminants migration from pit latrines must be sought faecal sludge typically has ten times more organic and pathogenic pollutants than municipal wastewater ingallinella et al 2002 disposal of untreated faecal sludge from on site facilities to water resources is harmful to the environment and public welfare ingallinella et al 2002 krueger et al 2020 typically filled latrines are either closed on site or emptied for off site disposal dwaf 2008 still and foxon 2012 mamera et al 2020a disposal of faecal sludge causes an increase in these systems operation and maintenance costs accumulation of the untreated disposed faecal sludge can lead to water resources and environmental contamination challenges still and foxon 2012 sanitation matters 2014 mamera et al 2020a mamera et al 2021 therefore implementing and developing sustainable ways for fsm that provide a viable solution to reduce contamination and cost of disposal is essential krueger et al 2020 several researchers have evaluated other faecal sludge treatment management strategies these include thermochemical treatment technologies like combustion gold et al 2018 onabanjo et al 2016 gasification recalde et al 2018 and hydrothermal carbonization fakkaew et al 2018 among these proposed strategies the feasibility of biochar use in faecal sludge treatment in wastewater has also been suggested bond et al 2018 wang and wang 2019 have also evaluated the importance and use of biochar as an effective bio adsorbent through several research works in the past decade as an emerging potential faecal treatment material in wastewater management biochar is a high carbon based bio adsorbent produced from any organic material at temperatures between 350 and 800 c in an oxygen limited environment through the process of pyrolysis it has well developed pore structures and high oxygen containing functional groups and minerals in that promote its high adsorption performance biochar can strongly retain several organic contaminants in environmental media thus reducing environmental risks associated with contaminants and the reconditioning needs once applied kołodynska et al 2018 weber and quicker 2018 biochars have various potential benefits such as use as an adsorbent koetlisi and muchaonyerwa 2017 soil amendment woldetsadik et al 2018 carbon sequestration solid fuel ward et al 2014 and also the treatment of sludge through combustion in waste management smith et al 2009 joseph and lehmann 2015 studies have also successfully examined the incorporation of biochar for sanitation purposes to manage faecal sludge krueger et al 2020 several benefits have been reported from its use in faecal sludge waste management which include a reduction in faecal bacteria pathogens like faecal coliforms and e coli mohanty et al 2014 excreta dehydration associated with its high water adsorption mohanty et al 2014 rogers et al 2018 higher nutrients exchanges increases in ph and reduced nitrogen leaching bai et al 2018 aghoghovwia et al 2022 barrier for organic and inorganic contaminants percolation towards groundwater sources mohanty et al 2014 biochar also has the potential to serve as an active soil c sink because it has a high fraction of recalcitrant c and can therefore remain stable for hundreds to thousands of years xu et al 2015 the high recalcitrant c fraction also reduces the need for the regeneration process of biochar in soils as the active colloidal sites for adsorption can slowly exchange sorbed organic and inorganic elements into solution dai et al 2019 biochar regeneration is an inverse method of adsorption hu 2018 ifthikar et al 2018 dai et al 2019 there are several regeneration methods other than natural ways which have been developed including thermal regeneration hu 2018 solvent regeneration zhang et al 2018 supercritical fluid organic and inorganic solvent regeneration hu 2018 among several other techniques however thermal regeneration is commonly used in industrial and wastewater treatment plants and is mostly considered the best cost effective technique with a higher regeneration efficiency roman et al 2013 faecal sludge is commonly treated with pyrolysis products produced by combustion gasification and hydrothermal carbonization fakkaew et al 2018 although biochar has been used in fsm studies mohanty et al 2014 bai et al 2018 rogers et al 2018 krueger et al 2020 its application rates for sanitation purposes are still not well established ibi 2014 most studies are based on using alternative wastewater other than the actual sewage effluent and sludge biochar is a unique bio adsorbent because it has various raw materials sources low production cost natural recyclability of its adsorption sites and soil nutrient recovery ability it is thus more advantageous when biochar is used in faecal waste treatment processes the use of faecal effluent and sludge in the environment can also affect the movement of bacteria and inorganic nutrients contaminants the study hypothesized that biochar can immobilize bacteria and inorganic contaminants migrations to water resources thus the overall aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of biochar treatments on organic and inorganic contaminants migration retention the specific objectives were to 1 characterize the pinewood biochar properties 2 determine the concentration and migration rates of n p e coli and faecal coliform bacteria through different soil bed column treatments at varying biochar application rates leached with faecal sludge and sewage effluent and 3 establish effective application rates in sludge management as well as assess the soil fertility for cations at the end of the experiment to determine its potential use as a soil amendment for agricultural purposes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location the experiments were located

sewage effluent was directly collected from the main input to the pst section dense faecal sludge was initially passed through the testing box from the tanks prior to collection two liters of deionized water control sewage effluent and faecal sludge were then placed on top of each of the respective treatments soils amended with biochar columns each column was leached with an additional 3 5

results presented in table 3 showed that untreated soils had a lower water retention as flows occurred after an hour at a rate of 33 mm h soils biochar and sewage effluent treatments reached flows 17 mm h at similar times 2 h treatments with the faecal sludge had a lower water conduction and higher retention of the effluent breakthrough the effluent retention increased in proportion to the biochar rates i e 5 20 t ha reaching as high as 40 h before an initial breakthrough 0 8 mm h at 20 t ha table 3 moreover the collected leachates proportionally became transparent as the biochar rates increased from 0 20 t ha fig s2 3 3 bacteria and chemical contaminants 3 3 1 sewage effluent and faecal sludge characteristics in the study the analyzed results showed higher counts of both e coli 1 0

in the raw sewage effluent than faecal sludge while phosphates were high in the faecal sludge than the raw sewage effluent table 4 3 3 2 bacterial solution migrations the results presented in fig 1 showed a higher mobility of both faecal coliforms sludge 4176 cfu 100 ml effluent 5176 cfu 100 ml treatments and e coli sludge 4331 cfu 100 ml effluent 5231 cfu 100 ml in soils without biochar generally migration of both faecal coliforms and e coli bacteria was drastically reduced as the biochar application increased 5 20 t ha treatments leached with the raw effluent had a slightly high movement of faecal coliforms e g at 5 t ha 4029 cfu 100 ml than treatments leached with sludge e g at 5 t ha 1214 cfu 100 ml the highest aqueous removal in the study was observed for the e coli bacteria at 20 t ha as the detection decreased to 1 cfu 100 ml in the leachates these counts were slightly above the recommended detection limits for drinking water in the united states and south africa 1 cfu 100 ml usepa 2009 sans 2011 there was also high retention of faecal coliforms at the same rate even though the counts were still above 10 cfu 100 ml all the control treatments leached with only deionized water had bacteria counts below 1 cfu 100 ml fig 1 significant differences were seen between treatments without biochar and with biochar at varying rates in the faecal sludge and effluent fig 1 a and b 3 4 chemical contaminants migration the findings presented in fig 2 showed that solution movement of nitrates and phosphates was high in untreated soils the results showed that nitrates were leached to a high fraction reaching 15 mg l in the control treatments while phosphates reached 1 3 mg l the leaching of nitrates and phosphates was reduced as the biochar rates increased from 5 t ha to 20 t ha from both the effluent and sludge the results showed that leached nitrates at 5 t ha in the effluent 5 01 mg l and sludge 4 07 mg l gradually each decreased at 20 t ha 0 14 mg l respectively movement of phosphates 0 17 0 50 mg l into solution was low from both the effluent and sludge treated with biochar fig 2 significant difference at p 0 001 were seen between not applying and applying biochar for nitrates and phosphates movements fig 2 a 3 5 bacteria the results presented in fig 3 shows the removal efficiencies calculated from the studied bacteria and chemical contaminants high effluent and sludge removal efficiency was observed for both e coli and faecal coliforms 85 99 an increase in the biochar rates also proportionally increased the bacteria removal efficiency 5 20 t ha in both the effluent and sludge a higher efficiency above 98 removal from the initial concentrations was observed for e coli bacteria faecal coliforms removal was slightly lower than e coli bacteria reaching below 85 fig 3a untreated soils in the study also had acceptable removal efficiencies 77 90 of both e coli and faecal coliforms fig 3a similar to soils amended with biochar untreated soils also showed that faecal coliforms had a high tendency to move into solution than e coli fig 3a removal efficiencies for faecal coliforms and e coli showed significant difference between treatments with and without biochar amendments leached with sludge and sewage effluent fig 3a and b the treatments leached with effluent had significant differences for faecal coliforms from all the biochar application rates 5 10 t ha compared to e coli which only had differences in treatments leached with faecal sludge 3 5 1 nitrates and phosphates the results calculated for the removal of nitrates and phosphates from the initial effluents and sludge indicated that phosphates had a high retention from the soil and biochar rates at 5 and 10 t ha fig 4 in the effluent removal efficiencies ranging from 93 to 97 were observed for phosphates while in the sludge removal efficiencies between 94 and 98 were found for phosphates fig 4b nitrates had removal efficiencies ranging from 71 98 effluent and 68 98 sludge at a 20 t ha application rate nitrates were removed more than phosphates fig 4a untreated soils without biochar had removal efficiencies in the effluent of 64 nitrates 89 phosphates and in sludge 62 nitrates and 89 phosphates fig 4 significant difference were seen in the removal efficiencies of nitrates and phosphates for the treatments with and without biochar applications fig 4a and b treatments leached with faecal sludge showed that at an application rate of 10 t ha similar phosphates removal efficiencies were observed at 5 t ha and 20 t ha fig 4b 3 6 nutrient recovery and retention during wastewater treatment both the soils without and treated with biochar amendments showed an increase in the soil ph i e 5 20 t ha table 5 soil ph in treatments with sludge ranged from 6 09 to 6 82 and with effluent from ph 6 51 to 7 46 with increasing rates of biochar application soils treated with the effluent and sludge without biochar had low ph values 5 80 to 5 85 overall treatments with the effluent had a slightly higher ph value than those treated with sludge table 5 treatments with both the effluent and sludge showed a drastic change in the soil nutrient concentrations of k ca mg and p the highest ca 867 mg kg accumulation was seen at 5 t ha and in soils with sludge 847 mg kg high soil retention of k 469 mg kg was observed using the effluent at 20 t ha high increases in p were also observed in treatments with sludge 58 to 60 mg kg than in soils treatments with effluent 42 to 48 mg kg soils without biochar treated with sludge had an increase in p 70 mg kg as compared to effluent soils 43 mg kg which were also similar to the control soils p 43 mg kg table 5 high mg 225 mg kg retention was seen at 5 t ha on soils leached with sludge in the study sodium and sulfur soil contents were below 48 mg kg and 30 mg kg in the study the exchangeable acidity was below 0 5 cmolc kg in all the treatments total soil cations had a slight increase from the controls 6 71 cmolc kg to 7 08 cmolc kg in soils amended with biochar which were leached with the effluent and sludge reserve k 1 81 2 07 cmolc kg was high in lower biochar rates 5 10 t ha than at 20 t ha 0 68 0 79 cmolc kg from both effluent and sludge treatments the sludge had a slightly high reserve k 2 35 cmolc kg table 5 high oc contents were seen at 20 t ha in sludge 4 effluent 2 91 and in controls 2 89 treatments respectively n volatilization 20 was high in most treatments except for soils only 17 4 and biochar treated soils at 20 t ha 16 7 leached with sludge in most treatments in the study the acid saturation was below 0 72 and the exchangeable na was below 3 table 5 soils leached with sludge had a high accumulation of fe 67 mg kg and mn 41 mg kg respectively table 5 fe and mn gradually decreased as the biochar rates increased 5 20 t ha in the controls effluent and sludge treated soils zn ions had a range of 3 83 4 53 mg kg from all the treatments the only exception was observed in the control soils without biochar with a slightly lower concentration of 3 27 mg kg table 5 cu had a tendency to also decrease at high biochar rates i e sludge 0 99 mg kg at 5 t ha to 0 72 mg kg at 20 t ha effluent 0 86 mg kg at 5 t ha to 0 73 mg kg at 20 t ha controls had cu contents between 0 82 and 0 94 mg kg significant differences at p 0 001 and

sewage effluent significant differences were observed in almost all the soil elements except only for soil total cations and saturated acidity between treatments with and without biochar ammedments table 5 4 discussion 4 1 biochar characterization adsorbents rich in carbon like biochar are essential in the remediation of contaminated wastewater characterization of such carbon based adsorbents using their physical and chemical properties can be applied in relation to specific uses huggins et al 2016 ahmed et al 2018 dai et al 2019 mamera et al 2021 huggins et al 2016 using granular wood derived biochar with pores sizes of 100 nm observed a low surface area 152 m2 g as contrasted to granular activated carbon 895 m2 g their findings compared well with the surface area of the biochar used in this study table 1 however the pores sizes were lower in this study indicating more micropores the biochar in the present study had similar properties to the activated carbon studied in huggins et al 2016 which might be attributed to the production process keiluweit et al 2010 suggested that increases in the bet and dft n2 surface area in biochar can occur due to restructuring of amorphous biomass to turbostractic char associated with increased temperatures 600 c lu et al 2012 and ashoori et al 2019 observed that the mineral composition of biochar also contributes to its adsorption of contaminants the presence of mineral components causes co precipitation and inner sphere complexation that enhances adsorption the chemical compositions in table 2 were within acceptable thresholds below findings from studies like huggins et al 2016 k 26 1 g kg ca 4 g kg na 1 9 g kg mg 2 3 g kg and fe 8 3 g kg mineral compositions of carbon based adsorbents are essential for selecting appropriate materials to reduce toxic leaching of heavy metals and the target specific contaminant wang and ren 2015 hu et al 2018 gabhane et al 2020 mamera et al 2021 4 2 leaching columns bacteria and chemical contaminants similar to organic biomass high carbon contents such as biochar table 2 tend to act as bio filters and have an increased surface area brady and weil 2008 zhang et al 2018 ashoori et al 2019 these properties could account for the observed enhanced filtration of leachates in fig s2 and the increased water retention in table 3 birch et al 2005 used biochar in stormwater filtration and also observed a similar effect krueger et al 2020 also observed increased filtration due to high contents of c h n volatile matter and fixed carbon in biochar mixed with faecal sludge other studies using various filter materials like zeolite and activated carbon also observed similar effects in purification and filtration processes reddy et al 2014 birch et al 2005 zheng et al 2019 in other studies barnes et al 2014 kameyama et al 2019 and li et al 2021 using biochar on sandy soils as in this study observed an improved water retention and reduced movement 30 mm h to below 5 mm h because of the bio adsorbent such changes were attributed to a higher surface area and portions of the volume of pores that are 1 or lesser to 10 μm in diameter promoting interstitial pore spaces in the related size intervals moreover the varying sizes and shapes of biochar in sandy soils tends to reduce the pores within soil particles interpore which promotes micropores 5 μm to 30 μm in diameter due to intrapores of biochar kameyama et al 2019 tang et al 2019 li et al 2021 similar factors might also have played a role in the water migration rates in table 5 studies have shown that microbial removal can be influenced by the initial inflow counts and precursor microbial counts chandrasena et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 xiang et al 2020 research using faecal effluent and sludge have also reported higher concentrations above 70 000 cfu 100 ml birch et al 2005 uchimiya et al 2010 guest et al 2012 gold et al 2017 sun et al 2018 these results compare well to the characterized wastewater reported in table 4 the reduced column mobility of faecal coliforms and e coli in the present study might also have depended on the structure such findings have also been attributed to the availability of larger macropores in biochar these pores can harbor bacterial growth providing enough area for convective forces promoting physical and biological retention lehmann et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 dai et al 2019 such properties minimize bacteria s aqueous leaching similar to the present study findings in fig 1 simpson 2008 also observed that dominant micropores in biochar can reduce the overall surface area for adsorption this is attributed to the diameter and size of bacteria 0 4 mm to 4 mm that causes limited access to micropores due to biofilm formation simpson 2008 zheng et al 2019 thus the availability of macropores provides a significant advantage in wastewater treatments lehmann et al 2011 moreover the high biochar ph could also have promoted adsorption of the bacteria in the present study some studies have also suggested that differences in the chemical environment like the initial ph can influence growth and retention of bacteria in the filter media foulquier et al 2011 chen et al 2019 tang et al 2019 the biochar mechanism of adsorption of organic contaminants can be grouped into electrostatic attraction pore filling π π electron donor acceptor interaction h bonding complexes adsorption hydrophobic interactions partition uncarbonized fraction and spectrometer exchange ahmed et al 2018 dai et al 2019 the amount of biochar organic contaminants retention increases with the increase of oxygen containing functional groups partly due to π π electron donor acceptor interaction the carboxylic acid nitro and ketonic groups on the surface of biochar act as electron acceptors forming π π electron donor acceptor interaction with aromatic molecules thereby enhancing the adsorption of aromatic molecules ahmed et al 2018 dai et al 2019 different types of hydroxyl and amine groups in biochar can also be used as π electron donor sites ahmed et al 2018 the surface of biochar is mostly negatively charged thus enhancing electrostatic attraction between biochar and positively charged organic compounds the strength of electrostatic attraction relies on the size of each atomic charge and the distance between two atoms rosales et al 2017 while the biochar with low surface oxidation usually causes hydrophobicity this type of biochar reacts with hydrophobic organic compounds by hydrophobic interactions to attain the removal process of organic contaminants inyang and dickenson 2015 dai et al 2019 as in the present study krueger et al 2020 also reported low nitrate and p concentrations 1 54 and 0 81 g kg respectively in faecal sludge such findings were lower than previous reported faecal sludge contents e g 31 and 24 g kg in china and uganda respectively liu et al 2014 gold et al 2017 this usually occurs in tanks where faecal sludge settles like septic tanks similar to the processing tanks which the faecal sludge was sourced in this present study fig 2 p is mostly not retained in tanks due to separations of liquids and solid fractions which causes a discharge of soluble p cairncross and feachem 1993 only 20 30 of total p is likely to be retained lusk et al 2017 this might have been the cause for the low n and p in table 4 and fig 2 moreover the organic held and condensed p can be hydrolyzed to become soluble orthophosphate lost through the effluent wilhelm et al 1994 gill et al 2009 ashoori et al 2019 chen et al 2019 reddy et al 2014 also working with columns reported a reduction in nitrates 27 mg l to 1 5 mg l and phosphates 0 57 mg l to 0 3 mg l other studies have also reported reduction of nh 4 and no 3 in municipal wastewater treatment using different biochar types yang et al 2017 using pine sawdust 100 to 5 38 mg l and wheat straw 100 to 2 08 mg l xu et al 2018 using wood waste 8203 to 47 5 mg l li et al 2017 using sugarcane residue 200 to 22 mg l decreases in po3 4 as well xu et al 2018 using wood waste 318 to 116 mg l zheng et al 2019 using hickory wood chips 8 to 6 mg l dugdug et al 2018 using hardwood 25 to 2 mg l wan et al 2017 using bambo 50 to 13 mg l these removals were associated to mechanisms of biochar like chemical bonding and electrostatic interaction with the surface functional groups π π interactions surface adsorption and interlayer anion exchange such findings compare well to this study s results figs 2 and 3 several studies using biochar have also reported high removal efficiencies reddy et al 2014 and ashoori et al 2019 both nitrates and phosphates exceeded 85 huggins et al 2016 had 90 nitrates and 97 phosphates birch et al 2005 had 65 nitrates 51 phosphates and 96 faecal coliforms and e coli guest et al 2012 had 98 for both faecal coliforms and e coli these reported findings were also compareable to results in fig 3 however other studies have also observed low efficiency below 30 for faecal coliforms and e coli reddy et al 2014 4 3 nutrient recovery and retention during wastewater treatment soil analysis to know the ability of a bio adsorbent to retain nutrients is important as presented in table 5 brady and weil 2008 krueger et al 2020 reddy et al 2014 reported slight increases in soil ph after effluent leaching 5 9 7 2 krueger et al 2020 observed high alkaline ph 10 8 from biochar similar to this study this alkaline ph is caused by increases in fractions of inorganic elements novak et al 2009 tang et al 2019 the impact of increased soil ph caused by biochar addition is that it promotes liming of acidic soils as a result of calcium carbonate equivalents cce accumulation ippolito et al 2015 the liming is an advantage caused by the presence of biochar ca and mg ashoori et al 2019 krueger et al 2020 however other studies have also attributed increased n volatilization in alkaline conditions as reported in table 5 in most biochar treated soils brady and weil 2008 tang et al 2019 similar results were observed in this study in fig 4b on the liming effect comparable findings were also reported from faecal sludge leached soils by krueger et al 2020 with concentration contents of 115 4 mg kg ca and 72 2 mg kg mg speciation of ca and mg are important for biochar quality housecroft and sharpe 2012 their carbonates oxides and hydroxides cause a liming effect in the soil by reacting with water and co2 producing bicarbonates with a neutralization effect brady and weil 2008 zheng et al 2019 fellet et al 2011 reported that the nutrient retention associated with cation exchange capacity improved as the biochar composition increased in the media these results also supported the observations in table 5 several studies have also reported an increase in soil p after treatment with faecal sludge between 31 and 81gp kg gold et al 2018 liu et al 2014 woldetsadik et al 2018 tang et al 2019 woldetsadik et al 2018 liu et al 2014 also observed k concentrations as high as 290 mg kg however in the present study in table 5 k contents were much higher biochar has the potential to improve soil nutrients as an adsorbent through reclaiming cations like p k ca and reducing acidic bases from effluents yao et al 2011 ashoori et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 reddy et al 2014 also observed a reduction for zinc 0 86 mg l to 0 5 mg l and copper 3 45 mg l to 0 5 mg l these findings also compared to cu and zn reduction effects in table 5 the organic fractions of biochars contain more carboxyl which can mobilize copper held by an alkaline medium uchimiya et al 2010 seelsaen et al 2006 reported higher removal of cu and zn of 90 93 with the addition of sandy soils in the filter media with biochar sandy soils in the present study in table 5 were also able to retain some of these elements except for fe and mn as they were inherently dominated by these ions brady and weil 2008 zheng et al 2019 the heavy metal immobilization capacity of biochar is directly linked to the total oxygen functional groups revealed by the oxygen o to carbon c ratio o c ratio ph and total acidity uchimiya et al 2011 however the numerous elements on the surface of the filter materials can also lead to parallel leaching of contaminants such as heavy metals hence the need for proper characterization guest et al 2012 sun et al 2018 ashoori et al 2019 dai et al 2019 5 conclusion pinewood biochar with physicochemical properties exhibiting an alkaline ph high c composition high bet surface area and pore sizes was used to evaluate the effect of biochar treatments on organic and inorganic contaminants migration in soil bed columns the results showed that soils without biochar application had high breakthrough counts for faecal coliforms and e coli however increasing biochar application rates combined with faecal sludge in the filter media resulted in reduced initial leachate breakthrough flows high water retention and increased purification ability of leachates in addition nitrates and phosphates declined in leachates with increased biochar rates a critical positive finding from this study was that detection of e coli at 20 t ha decreased significantly more than faecal coliforms higher removal efficiency was observed above 98 for e coil and 85 for faecal coliforms in the effluent and sludge treatments phosphates had removal efficiencies between 93 and 98 in the effluent and faecal sludge treatments however they were lower for nitrates it was observed that pinewood biochar had the highest nutrient increases for ca k and mg high increases in p were observed in sludge treatments compared to soils treated with effluent this data showed that pinewood biochar has the potential to reclaim cations and thus recover nutrients furthermore biochar reduced the heavy metals contents for zn and cu where significant differences were seen at p 0 05 between the means of the treatments with and without biochar pinewood biochar showed a high potential to reduce organic and chemical contaminants leaching in sludge management at application rates between 5 and 20 t ha we recommend that future research

15775,biochar is a valuable treatment option for faecal sludge management fsm however the sanitation application rates of biochar in fsm are not well established there is also a gap in knowledge about the effect of actual raw sewage effluent and sludge on organic and inorganic contaminants migration of biochar treated soil this study investigated the concentration and migration rates of n p e coli and faecal coliform bacteria through different soil bed biochar column treatments leached with raw faecal sludge and sewage effluent forty four soil bed leaching columns with pinewood biochar rates at 5 10 and 20 t ha were set at the bloemspruit wastewater plant south africa the pinewood biochar used had a ph of 10 21 total c composition of 92 surface area of 517 m² g and a pore size of 1 7 nm it was found that the 20 t biochar per ha treatment with faecal sludge increased water retention flows of 33 mm h at 0 t ha compared to 0 8 mm h at 20 t ha and leachates purification high detections were observed for faecal coliforms and e coli above 4331 cfu 100 ml from the effluent and faecal sludge in soils without biochar detection of e coli at 20 t ha decreased to 1 cfu 100 ml while the faecal coliforms still had counts above 10 cfu 100 ml the results showed a decreasing rate of nitrates phosphates zinc and copper with an increasing biochar application rate pinewood biochar showed significant removal efficiencies of bacteria between 89 and 98 and nitrates and phosphates between 68 and 98 significant differences were seen at p 0 05 between the means of the treatments with and without biochar the results from the study show that pinewood biochar applied at rates between 5 and 20 t ha has a high organic and inorganic contaminants reduction potential for fsm graphical

pit latrines and untreated drinking groundwater sources rosa and clasen 2010 stats sa s ghs 2017 mamera et al 2020a mamera et al 2020b although latrine sanitation systems are certainly more beneficial than open defecation unicef and who 2017 the pollution potential to groundwater resources due to contaminants leaching including n p e coli and faecal coliform bacteria from these systems can cause threats to humans and the environment thus sustainable ways to improve and minimize inorganic and organic contaminants migration from pit latrines must be sought faecal sludge typically has ten times more organic and pathogenic pollutants than municipal wastewater ingallinella et al 2002 disposal of untreated faecal sludge from on site facilities to water resources is harmful to the environment

contamination challenges still and foxon 2012 sanitation matters 2014 mamera et al 2020a mamera et al 2021 therefore implementing and developing sustainable ways for fsm that provide a viable solution to reduce contamination and cost of disposal is essential krueger et al 2020 several researchers have evaluated other faecal sludge treatment management strategies these include thermochemical treatment technologies like combustion gold et al 2018 onabanjo et al 2016 gasification recalde et al 2018 and hydrothermal carbonization fakkaew et al 2018 among these proposed strategies the feasibility of biochar use in faecal sludge treatment in wastewater has also been suggested bond et al 2018 wang and wang 2019 have also evaluated the importance and use of biochar as an effective bio adsorbent through several research works in the past decade as an emerging potential faecal treatment material in wastewater management biochar is a high carbon based bio adsorbent produced from any organic material at temperatures between 350 and 800 c in an oxygen limited environment through the process of pyrolysis it has well developed pore structures and high oxygen containing functional groups and minerals in that promote its high adsorption performance biochar can strongly retain several organic contaminants in environmental media thus reducing environmental risks associated with contaminants and the reconditioning needs once applied kołodynska et al 2018 weber and quicker 2018 biochars have various potential benefits such as use as an adsorbent koetlisi and muchaonyerwa 2017 soil amendment woldetsadik et al 2018 carbon sequestration solid fuel ward et al 2014 and also the treatment of sludge through combustion in waste management smith et al 2009 joseph and lehmann 2015 studies have also successfully examined the incorporation of biochar for sanitation purposes to manage faecal sludge krueger et al 2020 several benefits have been reported from its use in faecal sludge waste management which include a reduction in faecal bacteria pathogens like faecal coliforms and e coli mohanty et al 2014 excreta dehydration associated with its high water adsorption mohanty et al 2014 rogers et al 2018 higher nutrients exchanges increases in ph and reduced nitrogen leaching bai et al 2018 aghoghovwia et al 2022 barrier for organic and inorganic contaminants percolation towards groundwater sources mohanty et al 2014 biochar also has the potential to serve as an active soil c sink because it has a high fraction of recalcitrant c and can therefore remain stable for hundreds to thousands of years xu et al 2015 the high recalcitrant c fraction also reduces the need for the regeneration process of biochar in soils as the active colloidal sites for adsorption can slowly exchange sorbed organic and inorganic elements into solution dai et al 2019 biochar regeneration is an inverse method of adsorption hu 2018 ifthikar et al 2018 dai et al 2019 there are several regeneration methods other than natural ways which have been developed including thermal regeneration hu 2018 solvent regeneration zhang et al 2018 supercritical fluid organic and inorganic solvent regeneration hu 2018 among several other techniques however thermal regeneration is commonly used in industrial and wastewater treatment plants and is mostly considered the best cost effective technique with a higher regeneration efficiency roman et al 2013 faecal sludge is commonly treated with pyrolysis products produced by combustion gasification and hydrothermal carbonization fakkaew et al 2018 although biochar has been used in fsm studies mohanty et al 2014 bai et al 2018 rogers et al 2018 krueger et al 2020 its application rates for sanitation purposes are still not well established ibi 2014 most studies are based on using alternative wastewater other than the actual sewage effluent and sludge biochar is a unique bio adsorbent because it has various raw materials sources low production cost natural recyclability of its adsorption sites and soil nutrient recovery ability it is thus more advantageous when biochar is used in faecal waste treatment processes the use of faecal effluent and sludge in the environment can also affect the movement of bacteria and inorganic nutrients contaminants the study hypothesized that biochar can immobilize bacteria and inorganic contaminants migrations to water resources thus the overall aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of biochar treatments on organic and inorganic contaminants migration retention the specific objectives were to 1 characterize the pinewood biochar properties 2 determine the concentration and migration rates of n p e coli and faecal coliform bacteria through different soil bed column treatments at varying biochar application rates leached with faecal sludge and sewage effluent and 3 establish effective application rates in sludge management as well as assess the soil fertility for cations at the end of the experiment to determine its potential use as a soil amendment for agricultural purposes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location the experiments were located

generally migration of both faecal coliforms and e coli bacteria was drastically reduced as the biochar application increased 5 20 t ha treatments leached with the raw effluent had a slightly high movement of faecal coliforms e g at 5 t ha 4029 cfu 100 ml than treatments leached with sludge e g at 5 t ha 1214 cfu 100 ml the highest aqueous removal in the study was observed for the e coli bacteria at 20 t ha as the detection decreased to 1 cfu 100 ml in the leachates these counts were slightly above the recommended detection limits for drinking water in the united states and south africa 1 cfu 100 ml usepa 2009 sans 2011 there was also high retention of faecal coliforms at the same rate even though the counts were still above 10 cfu 100 ml all the control treatments leached with only deionized water had bacteria counts below 1 cfu 100 ml fig 1 significant differences were seen between treatments without biochar and with biochar at varying rates in the faecal sludge and effluent fig 1 a and b 3 4 chemical contaminants migration the findings presented in fig 2 showed that solution movement of nitrates and phosphates was high in untreated soils the results showed that nitrates were leached to a high fraction reaching 15 mg l in the control treatments while phosphates reached 1 3 mg l the leaching of nitrates and phosphates was reduced as the biochar rates increased from 5 t ha to 20 t ha from both the effluent and sludge the results showed that leached nitrates at 5 t ha in the effluent 5 01 mg l and sludge 4 07 mg l gradually each decreased at 20 t ha 0 14 mg l respectively movement of phosphates 0 17 0 50 mg l into solution was low from both the effluent and sludge treated with biochar fig 2 significant difference at p 0 001 were seen between not applying

contaminants high effluent and sludge removal efficiency was observed for both e coli and faecal coliforms 85 99 an increase in the biochar rates also proportionally increased the bacteria removal efficiency 5 20 t ha in both the effluent and sludge a higher efficiency above 98 removal from the initial concentrations was observed for e coli bacteria faecal coliforms removal was slightly lower than e coli bacteria reaching below 85 fig 3a untreated soils in the study also had acceptable removal efficiencies 77 90 of both e coli and faecal coliforms fig 3a similar to soils amended with biochar untreated soils also showed that faecal coliforms had a high tendency to move into solution than e coli fig 3a removal efficiencies for faecal coliforms and e coli showed significant difference between treatments with and without biochar amendments leached with sludge and sewage effluent fig 3a and b the treatments leached with effluent had significant differences for faecal coliforms from all the biochar application rates 5 10 t ha compared to e coli which only had differences in treatments leached with faecal sludge 3 5 1 nitrates and phosphates the results calculated for the removal of nitrates and phosphates from the initial effluents and sludge indicated that phosphates had a high retention from the soil and biochar rates at 5 and 10 t ha fig 4 in the effluent removal efficiencies ranging from 93 to 97 were observed for phosphates while in the sludge removal efficiencies between 94 and 98 were found for phosphates fig 4b nitrates had removal efficiencies ranging from 71 98 effluent and 68 98 sludge at a 20 t ha application rate nitrates were removed more than phosphates fig 4a untreated soils without biochar had removal efficiencies in the effluent of

biochar applications fig 4a and b treatments leached with faecal sludge showed that at an application rate of 10 t ha similar phosphates removal efficiencies were observed at 5 t ha and 20 t ha fig 4b 3 6 nutrient recovery and retention during wastewater treatment both the soils without and treated with biochar amendments showed an increase in the soil ph i e 5 20 t ha table 5 soil ph in treatments with sludge ranged from 6 09 to 6 82 and with effluent from ph 6 51 to 7 46 with increasing rates of biochar application soils treated with the effluent and sludge without biochar had low ph values 5 80 to 5 85 overall treatments with the effluent had a slightly higher ph value than those treated with sludge table 5 treatments with both the effluent and sludge showed a drastic change in the soil nutrient concentrations of k ca mg and p the highest ca 867 mg kg accumulation was seen at 5 t ha and in soils with sludge 847 mg kg high soil retention of k 469 mg kg was observed using the effluent at 20 t ha high increases in p were also observed in treatments with sludge 58 to 60 mg kg than in soils treatments with effluent 42 to 48 mg kg soils without biochar treated with sludge had an increase in p 70 mg kg as compared to effluent soils 43 mg kg which were also similar to the control soils p 43 mg kg table 5 high mg 225 mg kg retention was seen at 5 t ha on soils leached with

increase from the controls 6 71 cmolc kg to 7 08 cmolc kg in soils amended with biochar which were leached with the effluent and sludge reserve k 1 81 2 07 cmolc kg was high in lower biochar rates 5 10 t ha than at 20 t ha 0 68 0 79 cmolc kg from both effluent and sludge treatments the sludge had a slightly high reserve k 2 35 cmolc kg table 5 high oc contents were seen at 20 t ha in sludge 4 effluent 2 91 and in controls 2 89 treatments respectively n volatilization 20 was high in most treatments except for soils only 17 4 and biochar treated soils at 20 t ha 16 7 leached with sludge in

table 5 4 discussion 4 1 biochar characterization adsorbents rich in carbon like biochar are essential in the remediation of contaminated wastewater characterization of such carbon based adsorbents using their physical and chemical properties can be applied in relation to specific uses huggins et al 2016 ahmed et al 2018 dai et al 2019 mamera et al 2021 huggins et al 2016 using granular wood derived biochar with pores sizes of 100 nm observed a low surface area 152 m2 g as contrasted to granular activated carbon 895 m2 g their findings compared well with the surface area of the biochar used in this study table 1 however the pores sizes were lower in this study indicating more micropores the biochar in the present study had similar properties to the activated carbon studied in huggins et al 2016 which might be attributed to the production process keiluweit et al 2010 suggested that increases in the bet and dft n2 surface area in biochar can occur due to restructuring of amorphous biomass to turbostractic char associated with increased temperatures 600 c lu et al 2012 and ashoori et al 2019 observed that the mineral composition of biochar also contributes to its adsorption of contaminants the presence of mineral components causes co precipitation and inner sphere complexation that enhances adsorption the chemical compositions in table 2 were within acceptable thresholds below findings from studies like huggins et al 2016 k 26 1 g kg ca 4 g kg na 1 9 g kg mg 2 3 g kg and fe 8 3 g kg mineral compositions of carbon based adsorbents are essential for selecting appropriate materials to reduce toxic leaching of heavy metals and the target specific contaminant wang and ren 2015 hu et al 2018 gabhane et al 2020 mamera et al 2021 4 2 leaching columns bacteria and chemical contaminants similar to organic biomass high carbon contents such as biochar table 2 tend to act as bio filters and have an increased surface area brady and weil 2008 zhang et al 2018 ashoori et al 2019 these properties could account for the observed enhanced filtration of leachates in fig s2 and the increased water retention in table 3 birch et al 2005 used biochar in stormwater filtration and also observed a similar effect krueger et al 2020 also observed increased filtration due to high contents of c h n volatile matter and fixed carbon in biochar mixed with faecal sludge other studies using various filter materials like zeolite and activated carbon also observed similar effects in purification and filtration processes reddy et al 2014 birch et al 2005 zheng et al 2019 in other studies barnes et al 2014 kameyama et al 2019 and li et al 2021 using biochar on sandy soils as in this study observed an improved water retention and reduced movement 30 mm h to below 5 mm h because of the bio adsorbent such changes were attributed to a higher surface area and portions of the volume of pores that are 1 or lesser to 10 μm in diameter promoting interstitial pore spaces in the related size intervals moreover the varying sizes and shapes of biochar in sandy soils tends to reduce the pores within soil particles interpore which promotes micropores 5 μm to 30 μm in diameter due to intrapores of biochar kameyama et al 2019 tang et al 2019 li et al 2021 similar factors might also have played a role in the water migration rates in table 5 studies have shown that microbial removal can be influenced by the initial inflow counts and precursor microbial counts chandrasena et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 xiang et al 2020 research using faecal effluent and sludge have also reported higher concentrations above 70 000 cfu 100 ml birch et al 2005 uchimiya et al 2010 guest et al 2012 gold et al 2017 sun et al 2018 these results compare well to the characterized wastewater reported in table 4 the reduced column mobility of faecal coliforms and e coli in the present study might also have depended on the structure such findings have also been attributed to the availability of larger macropores in biochar these pores can harbor bacterial growth providing enough area for convective forces promoting physical and biological retention lehmann et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 dai et al 2019 such properties minimize bacteria s aqueous leaching similar to the present study findings in fig 1 simpson 2008 also observed that dominant micropores in biochar can reduce the overall surface area for adsorption this is attributed to the diameter and size of bacteria 0 4 mm to 4 mm that causes limited access to micropores due to biofilm formation simpson 2008 zheng et al 2019 thus the availability of macropores provides a significant advantage in wastewater treatments lehmann et al 2011 moreover the high biochar ph could also have promoted adsorption of the bacteria in the present study some studies have also suggested that differences in the chemical environment like the initial ph can influence growth and retention of bacteria in the filter media foulquier et al 2011 chen et al 2019 tang et al 2019 the biochar mechanism of adsorption of organic contaminants can be grouped into electrostatic attraction pore filling π π electron donor acceptor interaction h bonding complexes adsorption hydrophobic interactions partition uncarbonized fraction and spectrometer exchange ahmed et al 2018 dai et al 2019 the amount of biochar organic contaminants retention increases with the increase of oxygen containing functional groups partly due to π π electron donor acceptor interaction the carboxylic acid nitro and ketonic groups on the surface of biochar act as electron acceptors forming π π electron donor acceptor interaction with aromatic molecules thereby enhancing the adsorption of aromatic molecules ahmed et al 2018 dai et al 2019 different types of hydroxyl and amine groups in biochar can also be used as π electron donor sites ahmed et al 2018 the surface of biochar is mostly negatively charged thus enhancing electrostatic attraction between biochar and positively charged organic compounds the strength of electrostatic attraction relies on the size of each atomic charge and the distance between two atoms rosales et al 2017 while the biochar with low surface oxidation usually causes hydrophobicity this type of biochar reacts with hydrophobic organic compounds by hydrophobic interactions to attain the removal process of organic contaminants inyang and dickenson 2015 dai et al 2019 as in the present study krueger et al 2020 also reported low nitrate and p concentrations 1 54 and 0 81 g kg respectively in faecal sludge such findings were lower than previous reported faecal sludge contents e g 31 and 24 g kg in china and uganda respectively liu et al 2014 gold et al 2017 this usually occurs in tanks where faecal sludge settles like septic tanks similar to the processing tanks which the faecal sludge was sourced in this present study fig 2 p is mostly not retained in tanks due to separations of liquids and solid fractions which causes a discharge of soluble p cairncross and feachem 1993 only 20 30 of total p is likely to be retained lusk et al 2017 this might have been the cause for the low n and p in table 4 and fig 2 moreover the organic held and condensed p can be hydrolyzed to become soluble orthophosphate lost through the effluent wilhelm et al 1994 gill et al 2009 ashoori et al 2019 chen et al 2019 reddy et al 2014 also working with columns reported a reduction in nitrates 27 mg l to 1 5 mg l and phosphates 0 57 mg l to 0 3 mg l other studies have also reported reduction of nh 4 and no 3 in municipal wastewater treatment using different biochar types yang et al 2017 using pine sawdust 100 to 5 38 mg l and wheat straw 100 to 2 08 mg l xu et al 2018 using wood waste 8203 to 47 5 mg l li et al 2017 using sugarcane residue 200 to 22 mg l decreases in po3 4 as well xu et al 2018 using wood waste 318 to 116 mg l zheng et al 2019 using hickory wood chips 8 to 6 mg l dugdug et al 2018 using hardwood 25 to 2 mg l wan et al 2017 using bambo 50 to 13 mg l these removals were associated to mechanisms of biochar like chemical bonding and electrostatic interaction with the surface functional groups π π interactions surface adsorption and interlayer anion exchange such findings compare well to this study s results figs 2 and 3 several studies using biochar have also reported high removal efficiencies reddy et al 2014 and ashoori et al 2019 both nitrates and phosphates exceeded 85 huggins et al 2016 had 90 nitrates and 97 phosphates birch et al 2005 had 65 nitrates 51 phosphates and 96 faecal coliforms and e coli guest et al 2012 had 98 for both faecal coliforms and e coli these reported findings were also compareable to results in fig 3 however other studies have also observed low efficiency below 30 for faecal coliforms and e coli reddy et al 2014 4 3 nutrient recovery and retention during wastewater treatment soil analysis to know the ability of a bio adsorbent to retain nutrients is important as presented in table 5 brady and weil 2008 krueger et al 2020 reddy et al 2014 reported slight increases in soil ph after effluent leaching 5 9 7 2 krueger et al 2020 observed high alkaline ph 10 8 from biochar similar to this study this alkaline ph is caused by increases in fractions of inorganic elements novak et al 2009 tang et al 2019 the impact of increased soil ph caused by biochar addition is that it promotes liming of acidic soils as a result of calcium carbonate equivalents cce accumulation ippolito et al 2015 the liming is an advantage caused by the presence of biochar ca and mg ashoori et al 2019 krueger et al 2020 however other studies have also attributed increased n volatilization in alkaline conditions as reported in table 5 in most biochar treated soils brady and weil 2008 tang et al 2019 similar results were observed in this study in fig 4b on the liming effect comparable findings were also reported from faecal sludge leached soils by krueger et al 2020 with concentration contents of 115 4 mg kg ca and 72 2 mg kg mg speciation of ca and mg are important for biochar quality housecroft and sharpe 2012 their carbonates oxides and hydroxides cause a liming effect in the soil by reacting with water and co2 producing bicarbonates with a neutralization effect brady and weil 2008 zheng et al 2019 fellet et al 2011 reported that the nutrient retention associated with cation exchange capacity improved as the biochar composition increased in the media these results also supported the observations in table 5 several studies have also reported an increase in soil p after treatment with faecal sludge between 31 and 81gp kg gold et al 2018 liu et al 2014 woldetsadik et al 2018 tang et al 2019 woldetsadik et al 2018 liu et al 2014 also observed k concentrations as high as 290 mg kg however in the present study in table 5 k contents were much higher biochar has the potential to improve soil nutrients as an adsorbent through reclaiming cations like p k ca and reducing acidic bases from effluents yao et al 2011 ashoori et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 reddy et al 2014 also observed a reduction for zinc 0 86 mg l to 0 5 mg l and copper 3 45 mg l to 0 5 mg l these findings also compared to cu and zn reduction effects in table 5 the organic fractions of biochars contain more carboxyl which can mobilize copper held by an alkaline medium uchimiya et al 2010 seelsaen et al 2006 reported higher removal of cu and zn of 90 93 with the addition of sandy soils in the filter media with biochar sandy soils in the present study in table 5 were also able to retain some of these elements except for fe and mn as they were inherently dominated by these ions brady and weil 2008 zheng et al 2019 the heavy metal immobilization capacity of biochar is directly linked to the total oxygen functional groups revealed by the oxygen o to carbon c ratio o c ratio ph and total acidity uchimiya et al 2011 however the numerous elements on the surface of the filter materials can also lead to parallel leaching of contaminants such as heavy metals hence the need for proper characterization guest et al 2012 sun et al 2018 ashoori et al 2019 dai et al 2019 5 conclusion pinewood biochar with physicochemical properties exhibiting an alkaline ph high c composition high bet surface area and pore sizes was used to evaluate the effect of biochar treatments on organic and inorganic contaminants migration in soil bed columns the results showed that soils without biochar application had high breakthrough counts for faecal coliforms and e coli however increasing biochar application rates combined with faecal sludge in the filter media resulted in reduced initial leachate breakthrough flows high water retention and increased purification ability of leachates in addition nitrates and phosphates declined in leachates with increased biochar rates a critical positive finding from this study was that detection of e coli at 20 t ha decreased significantly more than faecal coliforms higher removal efficiency was observed above 98 for e coil and 85 for faecal coliforms in the effluent and sludge treatments phosphates had removal efficiencies between 93 and 98 in the effluent and faecal sludge treatments however they were lower for nitrates it was observed that pinewood biochar had the highest nutrient increases for ca k and mg high increases in p were observed in sludge treatments compared to soils treated with effluent this data showed that pinewood biochar has the potential to reclaim cations and thus recover nutrients furthermore biochar reduced the heavy metals contents for zn and cu where significant differences were seen at p 0 05 between the means of the treatments with and without biochar pinewood biochar showed a high potential to reduce organic and chemical contaminants leaching in sludge management at application rates between 5 and 20 t ha we recommend that future research evaluate other types of biochar using different feedstock materials and pyrolysis conditions for wastewater management strategies funding this research was funded by the national research fund nrf and

15776,crop production is the biggest water user and key contributor to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions increasing crop yields to ensure adequate food supply under water and land scarcity is excessively dependents on intensive agricultural inputs such as fertilizers pesticides agri films or energy resulting in unintended environmental consequences supply chains bringing environmental intensive inputs from their place of production to the croplands however most food related environmental assessments ignore the environmental burden of agricultural input production trade and consumption here we estimate spatially detailed water wf and carbon footprints cf of wheat maize and rice production in china with extended system boundary from upstream raw material mining to the field the agricultural inputs account for up to 24 and 89 of a crop s wf and cf respectively at the provincial level the total local generated wf in chinese northern provinces and cf in shanxi and inner mongolia provinces for producing crops and agricultural inputs transgresses the corresponding downscaled blue water and carbon planetary boundaries the study broadens the scope of traditional environmental impact assessments in agricultural production and sheds light on the significances to manage the linkages between the crop production and the agricultural inputs upstream supply chains towards more efficient water use and less greenhouse gas emissions in food system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords crop production agricultural inputs water footprint carbon

as well as 23 34 of anthropogenic greenhouse gas ghg emissions tubiello et al 2013 crippa et al 2021 around 41 52 of irrigation water is used at the expense of environmental flow requirements jägermeyr et al 2017 mekonnen and hoekstra 2020 rosa et al 2019 while the environmental burden of food production is global in scope the majority of the burdens are felt at the local level increasing crop irrigation requirements challenge local water sustainable supplies excessive fertilizers impair local ecosystems and agricultural inputs such as diesel and fossil fuel based electricity contribute to poor air quality tilman et al 2001 chen et al 2014 the environmental burden of food production is often attributed to the crop field mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 goucher et al 2017 chen et al 2014 hu et al 2020 or increasingly the final consumer xu et al 2020 poore and nemecek 2018 dalin et al 2017 however the food supply chain does not begin at the farm field instead the food supply chain extends backwards from the farm field to include major inputs to crop production such as fertilizers pesticides and energy these agricultural inputs in turn require production inputs such as coal natural gas sulfur pyrite phosphate rock and others supply chains connect farm fields to the inputs used in crop production as well as the associated environmental burden of these agricultural inputs in the same way that global supply chains connect farm fields to the final consumer water and carbon footprints provide comprehensive indicators for supply chain based environmental impact assessments any process of any product under the global supply chain may be accompanied by inter and intra national logistics which means the inter regional transfer of water and carbon related environmental impacts embedded in the logistics o rourke 2014 currently there are a number of studies that consider the transfer of water and carbon related environmental impacts from food consumption in the agricultural sector steen olsen et al 2012 yang et al 2020 hertwich and peters 2009 zhao et al 2015 several studies show the crop production system boundary of environmental impact analysis including agricultural inputs and supply chains mungkung et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 zhai et al 2019a 2019b chen et al 2021 xu et al 2020 however they only account for the carbon footprints related to the agricultural inputs and keep the abovementioned incomplete boundary for water footprint accounting moreover to the best of our knowledge the evaluation of the burden shifts of water and carbon footprints along inter regional logistics of agricultural inputs is still lacking in this study we investigate the environmental footprint of the crop production considering for the first time the production trade and consumption of agricultural inputs in order to better understand hidden environmental tradeoffs and resultant impacts on regional environmental sustainability we map the upstream supply chain network for crop production and its environmental burden in china circa the year 2016 using spatially detailed records of production inter and intra national trade of agricultural inputs between china provinces fig 1 we assess three staple crops wheat maize and rice that account for 92 of china s crop production nbsc 2017 we evaluate the upstream food supply chain using multiple environmental metrics including consumptive water use blue and green wfs water quality grey wf and ghg emissions carbon footprint cf at a subnational scale the environmental burden of evaluated crops and agricultural inputs is compared to downscaled planetary boundaries for water use and ghg emissions 2 methods and data 2 1 system boundary we link raw materials processed agricultural inputs and harvested wheat maize rice and through domestic and international supply chains so to capture and distinguish the direct wf dwf and cf dcf at the farm field as well as crop indirect wf iwf and cf icf associated with the agricultural inputs fig 2 as for a region the environmental footprint can also be divided into internal and external parts the internal footprints refer to local water appropriation ghg emissions within the regional boundary whereas the external footprints are virtual water carbon imports embedded in imported goods in this analysis we distinguish the external environmental footprints related to both inter and intra national logistics of upstream inputs at each supply chain stage from raw material to farm field for each province the supply chain of crop production consists of two primary stages from mining to farm the raw material to input product chain and the input product to crop chain which represent the processes of producing and consuming agricultural inputs respectively fig 2 the latter stage has been the conventional system boundary of life cycle assessment for agricultural production seed nitrogen n fertilizer phosphate p2o5 fertilizer potash k2o fertilizer agricultural film pesticide electricity and diesel that are used for field irrigation and mechanical tillage were included in the current study 2 2 estimating direct wf and cf of crop production the wf cf of crop production consists of the direct wf cf dwf dcf and indirect wf cf iwf icf the dwf is the traditional wf accounting scope of crop production the blue and green dwf of each crop were calculated by dividing the blue and green evapotranspiration over the growing season by the crop yields zhuo et al 2016a chukalla et al 2015 while the corresponding grey dwf was defined for n and p2o5 fertilizer as described by hoekstra et al 2011 1 d w f b c 10 t 1 g p e t b t y c 2 d w f g c 10 t 1 g p e t g t y c 3 d w f g c α a r c m a x c n a t 1 y c where d w f

the sum of the ghgs emissions from cropland and from fuel burning i e diesel in mechanized farming ghgs emissions were converted to their co2 equivalent co2e using 100 year global warming potentials fuglestvedt et al 2003 the ghgs i e co2 emissions per unit crop kg co2e kg crop from fuel combustion is calculated by multiplying the direct component of the fuel s carbon emission factor i e the co2 directly emitted during fuel combustion by the corresponding fuel consumption the ghgs emissions from cropland per unit crop kg co2e kg crop is calculated by dividing the ghgs emissions co2e from farmland by the crop yield per unit area specifically the ghgs emissions from farmland refer to the direct n2o emissions and indirect n2o emissions i e volatilisation and leaching runoff from n fertilizer application ipcc 2019 for rice cultivation the farmland ghgs emissions also include the field ch4 emissions the calculation formula is as follows ipcc 2019 5 g h g f i e l d n 2 o d n v o l

emissions nh3 volatilisation and n leaching and runoff respectively these terms can be calculated based on the nitrogen losses model developed by chen et al 2014 as shown in supplementary section 1 the coefficients 0 01 and 0 011 indicate that 1 and 1 1 of the volatilized nh3 n and leached no3 n are lost as n2o n respectively ipcc 2006 2019 gw p n 2 o and gw p c h 4 are the 100 year global warming potential of n2o and ch4 gwp 273 for n2o and 27 2 for ch4 ipcc 2021 respectively and are applied to convert these ghgs into co2 equivalents co2e the data on ch4 emission from rice cultivation in different province is extracted from guidelines for preparation of greenhouse gas inventories at the provincial level in china ndrc 2011 2 3 estimating iwf and icf of crop production related to agricultural inputs the iwf icf of crop production is the consumption of fresh water ghg emissions from production storage and delivery of inputs used in crop production to the farm gate 6 i w f c i w f c o n s i c i 7 i c f c i c f c o n s i c i where i w f c m3 t and i c f c t co2e t refer to the iwf and icf of growing crop c w f c o n s i m3 t and c f c o n s i t co2e t is the wf and cf of unit mass of input i consumed in crop production c i t t is the quantity of inputs i consumed to produce per tonne of crop estimation of w f c o n s i and c f c o n s i considers virtual water and carbon flows associated with import of inputs from other regions outside the province where the crop grows such virtual water and carbon imports constitute the external wf and cf respectively for the province we track the external blue and grey wfs as well as cf related to both international and inter provincial imports of each considered agricultural inputs and upstream products per province the corresponding virtual water and carbon imports of a product in a province equals to the amount of imported goods multiplied with the corresponding wf and cf respectively of producing unit mass of the goods in the exporting places for any input product i consumed in a given province x its wf cf in m3 t can be divided into the internal and external part the internal wf cf w f c o n s i n t i x m3 t is related to the consumption of local produced products the external wf cf is related to the consumption of imported goods either from international trade or inter provincial transfers the

external wf related to the interprovincial and international trade of input i respectively w f i x m3 t w f i y m3 t and w f i z m3 t refer to the wf of production of input i in province x importing province y and importing country z respectively in the absence of data on the wf of specific country inputs we use the national average values instead p i x t yr i i y t yr and i i z t yr refer to the production quantity of input i in province x imported quantity of input i by province x from exporting province y imported quantity by province x from exporting country z respectively w f t y x m3 t and w f t z x m3 t refer to water resources consumed in the transportation process when province x imports input i from province y and country z respectively the calculation formula is shown in supplementary section 2 amongst the various inputs of crop production we assume that seed consumption is entirely derived from local production so that the wf of seed consumption is equal to the wf of crop production in 2015 the cf of seed consumption adopted the estimation of chen et al 2014 international and inter provincial trade data on energy inputs e g coal crude oil and electricity were obtained from the china energy statistical yearbook nbsc 2016 and gao et al 2018 the shortest distance method was used to calculate the inter provincial trade data for other energy and industrial inputs fischer et al 2010 yang and zhao 2012 that is the corresponding volume of interprovincial input trade is calculated using the linear programming method as done in other studies zhuo et al 2019 based on annual supply and demand balance of each input in each province taking into account input movement between international and domestic provinces and using the shortest transportation distance as a constraint the formula is as follows minimize t c i x 1 y 1 h 1 x 31 y 31 h 4 t i n t x h i c x h t i n t h y i c h y x 1 y 1 x 31 y 31 t l o c x y i c x y subject to x y 1 31 and h 1 4 11 x 1 y

inputs production the wf cf of industrial input includes direct wf cf dwf dcf and indirect wf cf iwf icf as shown in fig 3 amongst them the dwf refers to the water consumption during the input production in general the wf of industrial inputs does not consider the green wf in this study the wf of industrial input only includes blue wf and grey wf the calculation for the grey dwf of industrial product is based on the quantitative framework of water footprint assessment manual hoekstra et al 2011 12 d w f i l v p c m a x c n a t where d w f i m3 t is the grey dwf of a product i l m3 t is the wastewater volume per unit of the industrial product v p mg l is the concentration of pollutants in the wastewater pollutants in the industrial sector take into account the main pollutants discharged during the production of agricultural inputs such as cod total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen and suspended matter ss the emission of each pollutant in each agricultural input is different and the specific emission information is shown in supplementary tables 3 5 the discharge limit of water pollutants in various industries is adopted as c m a x in the absence of this value we adopted the water quality level iv in the china s national surface water quality standard mep 2002 we adopted the corresponding water quality level i in the china s national surface water quality standard as c n a t mep 2002 the dcf refers to the direct ghgs emissions from the production of inputs primarily from burning fossil fuels the dcf from fuel combustion is calculated by multiplying the direct component of the fuel s carbon emission factor i e the co2 directly emitted during fuel combustion by the corresponding fuel consumption the iwf icf of inputs refers to the consumption of fresh water ghg emissions of the upstream products during the production processing and transportation of the upstream products needed in the production of inputs the ghgs emissions are also converted into co2 equivalents co2e the iwf icf of input is the sum of the product of the quantity of upstream inputs consumed per unit of input and the wf of corresponding upstream input consumption when the locations of production and consumption of upstream product are the same the wf cf of corresponding upstream input consumption equal to the wf cf of upstream input production the wf cf of product consumption is calculated by the same formulas 8 10 fig 3 depicts the upstream products for which regional trade exists furthermore the quantification of wf cf of input must begin at the most upstream point in the input production supply chain and the wf cf of each upstream product production and consumption should be calculated sequentially as can be seen from fig 3 the upstream of inputs supply chain is all energy inputs so the quantification of wf cf of crop production inputs begin with the energy wf cf the primary energy courses include coal crude oil and natural gas the wf of the primary energy is the direct water input in mining the blue wf data for coal crude oil and natural gas in all chinese provinces were obtained from gao et al 2018 while the national average grey wf was obtained from ding et al 2018 the wf of secondary energy i e diesel and electricity is the sum of the indirect wf related to the primary energy and the direct wf in production and processing the indirect wf of secondary energy is obtained from combining the wf of primary energy consumption calculated by us with its consumption for electricity here refers to thermal power its direct wf and primary energy i e coal consumption also come from gao et al 2018 and for the wf of crude oil processing products production its direct wf and primary energy consumption i e crude oil are from ding et al 2018 wf of diesel was obtained by multiplying the wf of crude oil processing products by the value fraction and dividing it by the product fraction of the diesel produced hoekstra et al 2011 the product fraction and value fraction of diesel are 0 383 and 0 398 respectively the product fraction is based on the report of sinopec that 0 383 t of diesel can be refined from 1 t of crude oil the value fraction is the ratio of the market value of diesel to the aggregated market value of crude oil processing products in 2016 the national average carbon emission factor of energy products i e coal diesel and nature gas and the proportion of direct emissions during combustion is derived from li et al 2013 the data of china s electricity is from ren et al 2020 the average carbon emission factor of the world s energy products is derived from ipcc 2006 in addition considering that the cf of energy product consumption is not different amongst provinces the ratio of internal cf and external cf of regional energy products is equal to its production and import ratio for a more detailed description of each input see the supplementary section 3 and the material consumption inventory wastewater discharge and ghgs emission data required for the calculation of the wf and cf of other industrial product and their inputs are shown in supplementary tables 3 6 2 5 comparing to provincial blue water and carbon planetary boundaries the impacts of staple crop production agricultural input production and exports on regional sustainability are tested by comparing each province s total local generated blue wf and cfs to the corresponding local blue water and carbon planetary boundaries the total local generated blue wf and cf of each province include the total internal blue wf cf of crop production in the corresponding province and the locally generated blue wf cf associated with the production of agricultural inputs for export that is the blue wf cf for nonlocal crop production li et al 2020 scaled down global blue water planetary boundary to 57 different sectors in 176 countries and regions in proportion to each sector s water withdrawals to the total water withdrawals the blue water planetary boundary at the provincial level in china is calculated as the sum of the blue water planetary boundaries related to agricultural sector and the planetary boundaries of the multiple industrial sectors related to agricultural production in each province the industrial sectors included are coal oil gas minerals petroleum and coal products chemical and plastic products mineral products electricity gas manufacture distribution water and transport hu et al 2020 estimated china s agricultural carbon planetary boundary at 1 1 gt co2e yr by scaling the global agricultural carbon planetary boundary 5 3 gt co2e yr according to the proportion of chinese population the global agricultural carbon planetary boundary is derived by combining the non co2 emission planetary boundary for agriculture 4 7 gt co2e yr reported by springmann et al 2018 along with co2 emissions from direct energy use in agriculture co2 emissions from direct energy use accounted for 11 15 of the total emissions the same downscaling method i e population ratio was used for provincial agricultural carbon planetary boundaries in this study the total local generated blue wf and cf associated with staple crop production for each province is the sum of blue wf cf for local and nonlocal crop production within each province formula is as follows 13 w f b x c y w f b i n t c x p c x w f b p e c x y

2017 nbsc 2017 in simulating the soil water balances by the aquacrop model the soil texture data were retrieved from isric database dijkshoorn et al 2008 the soil water content data was from batjes 2012 most of the material consumption inventory wastewater discharge and ghgs emission data required for the calculation of the wf and cf of industrial product and their inputs were derived from national statistics national standards industrial reports and the academic literature see supplementary tables 3 6 the consumption of n p2o5 k2o per crop was calculated by dividing the crop specific fertilizer application rate by crop yield the quantity of seed pesticides and electricity consumed per unit of crop was obtained from compilation of the national agricultural costs and returns 2016 ndrc 2017 the quantity of pesticides diesel and electricity consumed was calculated from corresponding product price per unit of crop obtained from compilation of the national agricultural costs and

geographical locations were derived from the list of state energy conservation supervision enterprises of major industries in 2018 published by the miit 2018 and the baidu map https map baidu com respectively data on shipping distance related to international trade is obtained from website https sea distances org in trade estimation of agricultural inputs national data on the supply and demand balance of inputs are mostly derived from industry reports in the absence of national demand data we use the apparent consumption of inputs that is output plus imports minus exports the output import and export of agricultural inputs at the national level were obtained from yearbook of chinese chemical industry cncic 2016 and china industry information network http www chyxx com demand data for provincial inputs are obtained by aggregating downstream industries demand of agricultural inputs in each province the latter can be obtained by downscaling the consumption of downstream industries at the national level in proportion to the province s contribution to the national total output of downstream industries the provincial output and national consumption data of downstream related products of agricultural inputs required for trade flow simulation were obtained from yearbook of chinese chemical industry cncic 2016 and the data centres of longzhong information technology co ltd https www oilchem net and china industry information network http www chyxx com 3 results 3 1 environmental footprints of the crop production supply chain the national average blue wf of wheat maize and rice production is 445 220 and 327 m3 t respectively whereas the national average cf is 0 77 0 62 and 1 33 t co2e t respectively note that wheat and rice s blue wfs are significantly higher than maize because of their higher irrigation water requirements while rice s cf is nearly double that of maize and wheat with the unique component resulted from the ch4 emission from paddy fields the total blue wf of crop production is 185 27 gm3 yr the total cf is 543 45 mt co2e yr the blue wf and cf of staple crop production within china exhibit significant heterogeneities between provinces and crops fig 4 the blue wf is generally higher for crops grown in the northern provinces due to the comparatively dry climate and intensive irrigation wang et al 2019 high value regions of cf were concentrated in east coast south coast as well as a few northern regions such as beijing tianjin inner mongolia and shaanxi the contribution of agricultural inputs to a crop s total blue wf which is represented by the ratio of iwf to wf is relatively small at the national level 6 2 and 2 for wheat maize and rice respectively different farm and industrial production processes across places can lead to a visible weight of iwf fig 4a eight provinces have the rate of blue iwf of wheat exceeding 10 the biggest blue iwf of wheat is 24 of wheat s total blue wf in fujian provinces for maize the biggest rate of blue iwf is 16 in yunnan province for rice the biggest rate of blue iwf is 5 in ningxia provinces compared with maize and rice wheat has a higher proportion of blue iwf in total blue wf because of the higher blue wf and application rates of wheat seeds supplementary table 7 seed n fertilizer and p2o5 fertilizer production account for the majority of the blue iwfs in most provinces fig 5 a in some northern provinces the contribution of p2o5 fertilizer is similar to that of n fertilizer in the blue iwf of three crops the contribution of pesticides to the blue iwf of rice exceeds that of p2o5 fertilizer in provinces in the east coast and hunan province fig 5a in this main text we focus on the blue wf results related to the analysis of the grey wf and green wf can be seen in the supplementary results the dcf in the field especially ch4 emissions dominate rice s cf which ranges from 54 to 84 across provinces in contrast the rate of icf to cf for wheat and maize production ranges from 40 to 89 at provincial level fig 4b except for some provinces in the jing jin north coast and northeast where thermal power generation is the dominant contributor to the icf the supply chain of n fertilizer contributes the bulk of provinces crop icfs fig 5b 3 2 environmental burden shifting interprovincial and international agricultural supply chains allow some of the environmental burden of food production to be shifted from where the crop is grown although over 95 of china s staple crops wf occurs at the farm field i e dwf much of the cf of wheat and maize production occurs upstream within the agricultural supply chain i e icf particularly for crops grown in eastern china fig 6 a b the external cf of all the three crops is largely embodied in inter provincial trade of n fertilizer and upstream electricity inputs for example more than 70 of external cf of all the three crops in guangdong and gansu provinces are driven by the production and interprovincial trade of n fertilizer supplementary fig 2 3 in other cases such as the hubei sichuan and inner mongolia provinces a province s external cf are mainly driven by the interprovincial trade of upstream inputs for local n fertilizer production supplementary fig 2 3 moreover at the national level electricity inputs contribute 39 of the cf of n fertiliser production supplementary fig 4 demonstrating the large but hidden role fossil fuel based electricity has in agricultural production s environmental footprint fig 6d shows the inter provincial virtual carbon flows of considered agricultural inputs virtual carbon generally flows from the west to east china matching the locations of fossil fuel based energy production and consumption the cf of inputs such as fertilizers agri films and pesticides used to supply major grain producing areas is largely transferred from their upstream energy and power producing areas china s current power structure is still dominated by coal based thermal power generation supplementary table 8 shanxi and inner mongolia as the main producing areas of coal driven electricity are the largest net cf exporters accounting for 23 30 mt co2e yr and 18 24 mt co2e yr of the total exports respectively the virtual carbon flows from shanxi to hebei the 4th largest wheat producing area jiangsu the 4th largest rice producing area and henan the 1st largest wheat producing area and from inner mongolia to shandong the 2nd largest wheat and 3rd largest maize production base in the country accounted for 23 31 mt co2e yr of the national total the corresponding inter provincial virtual water flows are shown in supplementary fig 5 rural farmlands shift environmental pressures associated with food production to urban areas through supply chain previous studies defined the boundaries of the food production system as farm to fork marston et al 2015 largely ignoring the food system components before the farm field naturally these studies conclude that urban areas displace the environmental burden of their food demand to rural areas that grow their food however by tracking available production locations of agricultural inputs across the country and matching them with national land use data with a spatial resolution of 30 m for 2015 obtained from the resource and environment data cloud platform https www resdc cn we find that environmental burden shifting between urban and rural areas is not unilateral all agricultural inputs except p2o5 fertilizer are predominately produced in urban areas and contribute to local air pollution supplementary fig 6 3 3 transgressing part of provincial water and carbon planetary boundaries china s staple crop production is violating regional water and carbon planetary boundaries the total local generated blue wf and cf associated with staple crop production for each province are compared to corresponding downscaled planetary boundaries li et al 2020 hu et al 2020 fig 7 at the national level the total local generated blue wf 185 1 gm3 yr of staple crops appears sustainable since less than a third 30 of the national blue water planetary boundary is utilized however here we highlight that the sustainability of crop production varies significantly within the country fig 7a wide spread wheat and maize production drive the crop related blue wf in six relatively water scarce northern provinces tianjin hebei shandong henan ningxia and shanxi provinces to exceed their local blue water planetary boundaries amongst them the blue wf in ningxia is five times higher than its blue water planetary boundary compared with the national carbon planetary boundary total cf 535 mt co2e yr of staple food crops within the country seems sustainable at 49 of national pbs of carbon emission but it changes into an adverse story when downscaling to provincial levels shanxi and inner mongolia the two major power generation bases have cfs related to staple crop production reaching 133 and 174 of the local carbon planetary boundary respectively fig 7b and the cfs of crop production in six provinces heilongjiang jiangxi hunan guizhou shaanxi xinjiang has reached more than 60 of the carbon planetary boundaries in china 45 of the cf related to staple crop production is concentrated in seven provinces shanxi accounts for the largest cf 39 mt co2e yr due to its heavy dependency on fossil fuel based energy this is followed by henan 39 mt co2e yr and anhui provinces 35 mt co2e yr mainly due to the scale of local staple crop cultivation more than two thirds of total cf in four provinces shanxi inner mongolia guizhou and qinghai respectively is associated with the nonlocal crop production thus demonstrating how nonlocal demands can shape environmental outcomes often in a negative way 4 discussion 4 1 agricultural inputs and supply chains are crucial by evaluating environmental impacts associated with the agriculture inputs and supply chain upstream before the farm field we find that the agricultural inputs in the supply chain of crop production account for up to 24 and 89 of a crop s wf and cf respectively at the provincial level in china interprovincial virtual blue water and carbon flows embedded in the trade of agricultural inputs reached 889 mm3 and 134 mt co2e respectively at the same time production of agricultural inputs for export directly leads to unsustainable carbon emissions in shanxi inner mongolia and guizhou provinces given the larger environmental impact the crop supply chain should not be ignored moreover the current study shows that the upstream partners responsible for the supply and processing of raw materials and energy for inputs are also accountable for improving water efficiency and mitigating ghgs emissions from crop production in addition to the agricultural sector itself at the national level industrial products accounted for 73 and 54 of the blue iwfs of maize and rice respectively and more than 95 of the three crops icfs fig 5 unfortunately the current water resources and ghgs emissions managements are in silos cooperation across different sectors especially between the chemical industry and agriculture should be strengthened 4 2 practical implementations and suggestions improving the food system within sustainable limits will require a multifaceted approach that considers all actors within the supply chain network to be more specific at the farm field well known measures to improve water use efficiency reduce nutrient runoff and mitigate ghgs emissions could be more widely employed for example rainwater harvesting mulching no till farming high efficiency irrigation systems and laser field levelling can be used to decrease the use of scarce blue water wang et al 2018 wang and shangguan 2015 precision agriculture technology can minimize fertilizer applications thereby reducing water pollution and ghg emissions adding biochar and nitrification inhibitor to soils applying n fertilizer deeper to reduce n2o emission from n fertilizer application hu et al 2013 carbon sequestration within the soil chen et al 2021 and optimizing irrigation applications to reduce ch4 emissions from rice fields guo et al 2017 are additional strategies to reduce the environmental footprint of food production without limiting production water and carbon markets and caps could spur innovation across the entire food sector as well create new opportunities and investments from other sectors for the chemical industry supply agricultural inputs more water saving and low carbon production materials and process designs should be encouraged a shift toward clean renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power will significantly reduce the wf and cf of the food system bogdanov et al 2019 in addition we need to be alert to the fragility of international trade networks which are vulnerable to climate change natural disasters economic development and international relations puma et al 2015 bringing the food system within sustainable limits is made more challenging due to broader concerns beyond the environment our results show regions like shanxi and inner mongolia depend on environmentally damaging mining heavy industry energy production and agriculture to lift their economy and the livelihoods of their people thus despite the considerable environmental damage attributable to the food system in these provinces it will likely not be tenable to limit their production or exports to more sustainable levels an alternative approach to limiting production and exports is to focus investments in clean energy improving manufacturing efficiencies and precision agriculture within these regions investments aimed at addressing the supply chain stages and locations where the greatest environmental damage occurs as detailed in this study can improve both environmental concerns and economic competitiveness greater information sharing and transparency within the food industry including best practices disclosure of water uses and ghg emissions and industry specific cf and wf benchmarks marston et al 2020 can help shift the entire food system toward a smaller environmental footprint consumer preferences may help incentivize the food industry to move in this direction though it remains unclear the degree to which market forces can shift the food system toward a more environmentally sustainable outcome potter et al 2021 instead government coordination investments incentives and regulations may prove more effective 4 3 limitations and uncertainties there are limitations to be in caution a lack of detailed facility level data required us to simplify the diversity of industrial product varieties and production processes across china we assumed widely used varieties production processes and energy consumption types such as urea for n fertilizer reverse flotation for k2o fertilizer production and coal based thermal power generation in addition our study focuses on one year 2016 thus the current analysis did not capture inter annual variability in wfs and cfs due to the impact of year to year changes in agricultural production meteorological conditions industrial and energy sector structure trade patterns and national policies due to the lack of a database of available seed wf showing spatial differences we treat the seed as field crops which may underestimate the iwf of crops although there may be underestimates it is not expected to change the key conclusion that the crop iwf is nonnegligible it is still highly recommended to take specific field measurements of wf of seedlings for smaller scale assessments compared to previous studies chen et al 2021 the current shown national average cf of rice and wheat is 5 and 4 lower respectively while that of maize is 24 higher which is related to the study s system boundary and the carbon emission factor of each stage of the supply chain straw burning and manure compost are not considered in this study but the ghgs emission of seeds are we also consider regional differences in carbon emission factors of crop production supply chain inputs in addition we used the nitrogen loss model to calculate the n2o emissions caused by n fertilizer application in the field most studies have found a strong exponential relationship between n loss and input chen et al 2014 cui et al 2013 calculating n2o emissions using the common ipcc methodology will have a big impact on the results in areas of overfertilisation particularly in china therefore we believe that the current results are relatively more reasonable the national average wf of the three crops estimated in the current study is much higher than that of mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 and zhang et al 2018 which is mainly due to our high grey wfs two reasons explain this phenomenon the one is the broader system boundaries our study considered the indirect water pollution caused by inputs throughout their life cycle while other studies only considered grey dwf caused by the application of n and p2o5 fertilizer the second is the difference between our maximum allowable and natural nitrogen concentration cmax cnat in formula 3 used a more stringent assumption of 0 8 mg l while mekonnen and hoekstra was 10 mg l 5 conclusion this study systematically analyses the linkages between the final consumption of agricultural production and the upstream sectors as well as the resulting inter regional transfer of environmental impacts and regional sustainability by looking at the supply chain of staple crop production from upstream to downstream in a geographically refined manner the study broadens the scope of traditional agricultural production impact assessments and the same assessment methods can also be applied to many other countries sectors and products facing similar sustainability challenges at the same time because agriculture is the primary water user and carbon emitter such assessments are essential to ensure regional food security and sustainable development in the face of rising global trade water scarcity and strict carbon neutrality targets credit authorship contribution

15776,crop production is the biggest water user and key contributor to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions increasing crop yields to ensure adequate food supply under water and land scarcity is excessively dependents on intensive agricultural inputs such as fertilizers pesticides agri films or energy resulting in unintended environmental consequences supply chains bringing environmental intensive inputs from their place of production to the croplands however most food related environmental assessments ignore the environmental burden of agricultural input production trade and consumption here we estimate spatially detailed water wf and carbon footprints cf of wheat maize and rice production in china with extended system boundary from upstream raw material mining to the field the agricultural inputs account for up to 24 and 89 of a crop s wf and cf respectively at the provincial level the total local generated wf in chinese northern provinces and cf in shanxi and inner mongolia provinces for producing crops and agricultural inputs transgresses the corresponding downscaled blue water and carbon planetary boundaries the study broadens the scope of traditional environmental impact assessments in agricultural production and sheds light on the significances to manage the linkages between the crop production and the agricultural inputs upstream supply chains

as well as 23 34 of anthropogenic greenhouse gas ghg emissions tubiello et al 2013 crippa et al 2021 around 41 52 of irrigation water is used at the expense of environmental flow requirements jägermeyr et al 2017 mekonnen and hoekstra 2020 rosa et al 2019 while the environmental burden of food production is global in scope the majority of the burdens are felt at the local level increasing crop irrigation requirements challenge local water sustainable supplies excessive fertilizers impair local ecosystems and agricultural inputs such as diesel and fossil fuel based electricity contribute to poor air quality tilman et al 2001 chen et al 2014 the environmental burden of food production is often attributed to the crop field mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 goucher et al 2017 chen et al 2014 hu et al 2020 or increasingly the final consumer xu et al 2020 poore and nemecek 2018 dalin et al 2017 however the food supply chain does not begin at the farm field instead the food supply chain extends backwards from the farm field to include major inputs to crop production such as fertilizers pesticides and energy these agricultural inputs in turn require production inputs such as coal natural gas sulfur pyrite phosphate rock and others supply chains connect farm fields to the inputs used in crop production as well as the associated environmental burden of these agricultural inputs in the same way that global supply chains connect farm fields to the final consumer water and carbon footprints provide comprehensive indicators for supply chain based environmental impact assessments any process of any product under the global supply chain may be accompanied by inter and intra national logistics which means the inter regional transfer of water and carbon related environmental impacts embedded in the logistics o rourke 2014 currently there are a number of studies that consider the transfer of water and carbon related environmental impacts from food consumption in the agricultural sector steen olsen et al 2012 yang et al 2020 hertwich and peters 2009 zhao et al 2015 several studies show the crop production system boundary of environmental impact analysis including agricultural inputs and supply chains mungkung et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 zhai et al 2019a 2019b chen et al 2021 xu et al 2020 however they only account for the carbon footprints related to the agricultural inputs and keep the abovementioned incomplete boundary for water footprint accounting moreover to the best of our knowledge the evaluation of the burden shifts of water and carbon footprints along inter regional logistics of agricultural inputs is still lacking in this study we investigate the environmental footprint of the crop production considering for the first time the production trade and consumption of agricultural inputs in order to better understand hidden environmental tradeoffs and resultant impacts on regional environmental sustainability we map the upstream supply chain network for crop production and its environmental burden in china circa the year 2016 using spatially detailed records of production inter and intra national trade of agricultural inputs between china provinces fig 1 we assess three staple crops wheat maize and rice that account for 92 of china s crop production nbsc 2017 we evaluate the upstream food supply chain using multiple environmental metrics including consumptive water use blue and green wfs water quality grey wf and ghg emissions carbon footprint cf at a subnational scale the environmental burden of evaluated crops and agricultural inputs is compared to downscaled planetary boundaries for water use and ghg emissions 2 methods and data 2 1 system boundary we link raw materials processed agricultural inputs and harvested wheat maize rice and through domestic and international supply chains so to capture and distinguish the direct wf dwf and cf dcf at the farm field as well as crop indirect wf iwf and cf icf associated with the agricultural inputs fig 2 as for a region the environmental footprint can also be divided into internal and external parts the internal footprints refer to local water appropriation ghg emissions within the regional boundary whereas the external footprints are virtual water carbon imports embedded in imported goods in this analysis we distinguish the external environmental footprints related to both inter and intra national logistics of upstream inputs at each supply chain stage from raw material to farm field for each province the supply chain of crop production consists of two primary stages from mining to farm the raw material to input product chain and the input product to crop chain which represent the processes of producing and consuming agricultural inputs respectively fig 2 the latter stage has been the conventional system boundary of life cycle assessment for agricultural production seed nitrogen n fertilizer phosphate p2o5 fertilizer potash k2o fertilizer agricultural film pesticide electricity and diesel that are used for field irrigation and mechanical tillage were included in the current study 2 2 estimating direct

green dwf of each crop were calculated by dividing the blue and green evapotranspiration over the growing season by the crop yields zhuo et al 2016a chukalla et al 2015 while the corresponding grey

the sum of the ghgs emissions from cropland and from fuel burning i e diesel in mechanized farming ghgs emissions were converted to their co2 equivalent co2e using 100 year global warming potentials fuglestvedt et al 2003 the ghgs i e co2 emissions per unit crop kg co2e kg crop from fuel combustion is calculated by multiplying the direct component of the fuel s carbon emission factor i e the co2 directly emitted during fuel combustion by the corresponding fuel consumption the ghgs emissions from cropland per unit crop kg co2e kg crop is calculated by dividing the ghgs emissions co2e from farmland by the crop yield per unit area specifically the ghgs emissions from farmland refer to the direct n2o emissions and indirect n2o emissions i e volatilisation and leaching runoff from n

province we track the external blue and grey wfs as well as cf related to both international and inter provincial imports of each considered agricultural inputs and upstream products per province the corresponding virtual water and carbon imports of a product in a province equals to the amount of imported goods multiplied with the corresponding wf and cf respectively of producing unit mass of the

supplementary section 2 amongst the various inputs of crop production we assume that seed consumption is entirely derived from local production so that the wf of seed consumption is equal to the wf of

production in general the wf of industrial inputs does not consider the green wf in this study the wf of industrial input only includes blue wf and grey wf the calculation for the grey dwf of industrial product is based on the quantitative framework of water footprint assessment manual hoekstra et al 2011 12 d w f i l v p c m a x c n a t where d w f i m3 t is the grey dwf of a product i l m3 t is the wastewater volume per unit of the industrial product v p mg l is the concentration of pollutants in the wastewater pollutants in the industrial sector take into account the main pollutants discharged during the production of agricultural inputs such as cod total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen and suspended matter ss the emission of each pollutant in each agricultural input is different and the specific emission information is shown in supplementary tables 3 5 the discharge limit of water pollutants in various industries is adopted as c m a x in the absence of this value we adopted the water quality level iv in the china s national surface water quality standard mep 2002 we adopted the corresponding water quality level i in the china s national surface water quality standard as c n a t mep 2002 the dcf refers to the direct ghgs emissions from the production of inputs primarily from burning fossil fuels the dcf from fuel combustion is calculated by multiplying the direct component of the fuel s carbon emission factor i e the co2 directly emitted during fuel combustion by the corresponding fuel consumption the iwf icf of inputs refers to the consumption of fresh water ghg emissions of the upstream products during the production processing and transportation of the upstream products needed in the production of inputs the ghgs emissions are also converted into co2 equivalents co2e the iwf icf of input is the sum of the product of the quantity of upstream inputs consumed per unit of input and the wf of corresponding upstream input consumption when the locations of production and consumption of upstream product are the same the wf cf of corresponding upstream input consumption equal to the wf cf of upstream input production the wf cf of product consumption is calculated by the same formulas 8 10 fig 3 depicts the upstream products for which regional trade exists furthermore the quantification of wf cf of input must begin at the most upstream point in the input production supply chain and the wf cf of each upstream product production and consumption should be calculated sequentially as can be seen from fig 3 the upstream of inputs supply chain is all energy inputs so the quantification of wf cf of crop production inputs begin with the energy wf cf the primary energy courses include coal crude oil and natural gas the wf of the primary energy is the direct water input in mining the blue wf data for coal crude oil and natural gas in all chinese provinces were obtained from gao et al 2018 while the national average grey wf was obtained from ding et al 2018 the wf of secondary energy i e diesel and electricity is the sum of the indirect wf related to the primary energy and the direct wf in production and processing the indirect wf of secondary energy is obtained from combining the wf of primary energy consumption calculated by us with its consumption for electricity here refers to thermal power its direct wf and primary energy i e coal consumption also come from gao et al 2018 and for the wf of crude oil processing products production its direct wf and primary energy consumption i e crude oil are from ding et al 2018 wf of diesel was obtained by multiplying the wf of crude oil processing products by the value fraction and dividing it by the product fraction of the diesel produced hoekstra et al 2011 the product fraction and value fraction of diesel are 0 383 and 0 398 respectively the product fraction is based on the report of sinopec that 0 383 t of diesel can be refined from 1 t of crude oil the value fraction is the ratio of the market value of diesel to the aggregated market value of crude oil processing products in 2016 the national average carbon emission factor of energy products i e coal diesel and nature gas and the proportion of direct emissions during combustion is derived from li et al 2013 the data of china s electricity is from ren et al 2020 the average carbon emission factor of the world s energy products is derived from ipcc 2006 in addition considering that the cf of energy product consumption is not different amongst provinces the ratio of internal cf and external cf of regional energy products is equal to its production and import ratio for a more detailed description of each input see the supplementary section 3 and the material consumption inventory wastewater discharge and ghgs emission data required for the calculation of the wf and cf of other industrial product and their inputs are shown in supplementary tables 3 6 2 5 comparing to provincial blue water and carbon planetary boundaries the impacts of staple crop production agricultural input production and exports on regional sustainability are tested by comparing each province s total local generated blue wf and cfs to the corresponding local blue water and carbon planetary boundaries the total local generated blue wf and cf of each province include the total internal blue wf cf of crop production in the corresponding province and the locally generated blue wf cf associated with the production of agricultural inputs for export that is the blue wf cf for nonlocal crop production li et al 2020 scaled down global blue water planetary boundary to 57 different sectors in 176 countries and regions in proportion to each sector s water withdrawals to the total water withdrawals the blue water planetary boundary at the provincial level in china is calculated as the sum of the blue water planetary boundaries related to agricultural sector and the planetary boundaries of the multiple industrial sectors related to agricultural production in each province the industrial sectors included are coal oil gas minerals petroleum and coal products chemical and plastic products mineral products electricity gas manufacture distribution water and transport hu et al 2020 estimated china s agricultural carbon planetary boundary at 1 1 gt co2e yr by scaling the global agricultural carbon planetary boundary 5 3 gt co2e yr according to the proportion of chinese population the global agricultural carbon planetary boundary is derived by combining the non co2 emission planetary boundary for agriculture 4 7 gt co2e yr reported by springmann et al 2018 along with co2 emissions from direct energy use in agriculture co2 emissions from direct energy use accounted for 11 15 of the total emissions the same downscaling method i e population ratio was used for provincial agricultural carbon planetary boundaries in this study the total local generated blue wf and cf associated with staple crop production for each province is the sum of blue wf cf for local and nonlocal crop production within each province formula is as follows 13 w f b x c y w f b i n t c x p c x w f b p e c x y

model were acquired from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn en data on the planting area and crop yields for each province was obtained from the china statistical yearbook 2017 nbsc 2017 in simulating the soil water balances by the aquacrop model the soil texture data were retrieved from isric database dijkshoorn et al 2008 the soil water content data was from batjes 2012 most of the material consumption inventory wastewater discharge and ghgs emission data required for the calculation of the wf and cf of industrial product and their inputs were derived from national statistics national standards industrial reports and the academic literature see supplementary tables 3 6 the consumption of n p2o5 k2o per crop was calculated by dividing the crop specific fertilizer application rate by crop yield the quantity of seed pesticides and electricity consumed per unit of crop was obtained from compilation of the national agricultural costs and returns 2016 ndrc 2017 the quantity of pesticides diesel and electricity consumed was calculated from corresponding product price per unit of crop obtained from compilation of the national agricultural costs and returns 2016 ndrc 2017 provinces lacking data were supplemented by those of neighbouring provinces the data describing the production of agricultural inputs e g fertilizers energy etc and their geographical locations were derived from the list of state energy conservation supervision enterprises of major industries in 2018 published by the miit 2018 and the baidu map https map baidu com respectively data on shipping distance related to international trade is obtained from website https sea distances org in trade estimation of agricultural inputs national data on the supply and demand balance of inputs are mostly derived from industry reports in the absence of national demand data we use the apparent consumption of inputs that is output plus imports minus exports the output import and export of agricultural inputs at the national level were obtained from yearbook of chinese chemical industry cncic 2016 and china industry information network http www chyxx com demand data for provincial inputs are obtained by aggregating downstream industries demand of agricultural inputs in each province the latter can be obtained by downscaling the consumption of downstream industries at the national level in proportion to the province s contribution to the national total output of downstream industries the provincial output and national consumption data of downstream related products of agricultural inputs required for trade flow simulation were obtained from yearbook of chinese chemical industry cncic 2016 and the data centres of longzhong information technology co ltd https www oilchem net and china industry information network http www chyxx com 3 results 3 1 environmental footprints of the crop production supply chain the national average blue wf of wheat maize and rice production is 445 220 and 327 m3 t respectively whereas the national average cf is 0 77 0 62 and 1 33 t co2e t respectively note that wheat and rice s blue wfs are significantly higher than maize because of their higher irrigation water requirements while rice s cf is nearly double that of maize and wheat with the unique component resulted from the ch4 emission from paddy fields the total blue wf of crop production is 185 27 gm3 yr the total cf is 543 45 mt co2e yr the blue wf and cf of staple crop production within china exhibit significant heterogeneities between provinces and crops fig 4 the blue wf is generally higher for crops grown in the northern provinces due to the comparatively dry climate and intensive irrigation wang et al 2019 high value regions of cf were concentrated in east coast south coast as well as a few northern regions such as beijing tianjin inner mongolia and shaanxi the contribution of agricultural inputs to a crop s total blue wf which is represented by the ratio of iwf to wf is relatively small at the national level 6 2 and 2 for wheat maize and rice respectively different farm and industrial production processes across places can lead to a visible weight of iwf fig 4a eight provinces have the rate of blue iwf of wheat exceeding 10 the biggest blue iwf of wheat is 24 of wheat s total blue wf in fujian provinces for maize the biggest rate of blue iwf is 16 in yunnan province for rice the biggest rate of blue iwf is 5 in ningxia provinces compared with maize and rice wheat has a higher proportion of blue iwf in total blue wf because of the higher blue wf and application rates of wheat seeds supplementary table 7 seed n fertilizer and p2o5 fertilizer production account for the majority of the blue iwfs in most provinces fig 5 a in some northern provinces the contribution of p2o5 fertilizer is similar to that of n fertilizer in the blue iwf of three crops the contribution of pesticides to the blue iwf of rice exceeds that of p2o5 fertilizer in provinces in the east coast and hunan province fig 5a in this main text we focus on the blue wf results related to the analysis of the grey wf and green wf can be seen in the supplementary results the dcf in the field especially ch4 emissions dominate rice s cf which ranges from 54 to 84 across provinces in contrast the rate of icf to cf for wheat and maize production ranges from 40 to 89 at provincial level fig 4b except for some provinces in the jing jin north coast and northeast where thermal power generation is the dominant contributor to the icf the supply chain of n fertilizer contributes the bulk of provinces crop icfs fig 5b 3 2 environmental burden shifting interprovincial and international agricultural supply chains allow some of the environmental burden of food production to be shifted from where the crop is grown although over 95 of china s staple crops wf occurs at the farm field i e dwf much of the cf of wheat and maize production occurs upstream within the agricultural supply chain i e icf particularly for crops grown in eastern china fig 6 a b the external cf of all the three crops is largely embodied in inter provincial trade of n fertilizer and upstream electricity inputs for example more than 70 of external cf of all the three crops in guangdong and gansu provinces are driven by the production and interprovincial trade of n fertilizer supplementary fig 2 3 in other cases such as the hubei sichuan and inner mongolia provinces a province s external cf are mainly driven by the interprovincial trade of upstream inputs for local n fertilizer production supplementary fig 2 3 moreover at the national level electricity inputs contribute 39 of the cf of n fertiliser production supplementary fig 4 demonstrating the large but hidden role fossil fuel based electricity has in agricultural production s environmental footprint fig 6d shows the inter provincial virtual carbon flows of considered agricultural inputs virtual carbon generally flows from the west to east china matching the locations of fossil fuel based energy production and consumption the cf of inputs such as fertilizers agri films and pesticides used to supply major grain producing areas is largely transferred from their upstream energy and power producing areas china s current power structure is still dominated by coal based thermal power generation supplementary table 8 shanxi and inner mongolia as the main producing areas of coal driven electricity are the largest net cf exporters accounting for 23 30 mt co2e yr and 18 24 mt co2e yr of the total exports respectively the virtual carbon flows from shanxi to hebei the 4th largest wheat producing area jiangsu the 4th largest rice producing area and henan the 1st largest wheat producing area and from inner mongolia to shandong the 2nd largest wheat and 3rd largest maize production base in the country accounted for 23 31 mt co2e yr of the national total the corresponding inter provincial virtual water flows are shown in supplementary fig 5 rural farmlands shift environmental pressures associated with food production to urban areas through supply chain previous studies defined the boundaries of the food production system as farm to fork marston et al 2015 largely ignoring the food system components before the farm field naturally these studies conclude that urban areas displace the environmental burden of their food demand to rural areas that grow their food however by tracking available production locations of agricultural inputs across the country and matching them with national land use data with a spatial resolution of 30 m for 2015 obtained from the resource and environment data cloud platform https www resdc cn we find that environmental burden shifting between urban and rural areas is not unilateral all agricultural inputs except p2o5 fertilizer are predominately produced in urban areas and contribute to local air pollution supplementary fig 6 3 3 transgressing part of provincial water and carbon planetary boundaries china s staple crop production is violating regional water and carbon planetary boundaries the total local generated blue wf and cf associated with staple crop production for each province are compared to corresponding downscaled planetary boundaries li et al 2020 hu et al 2020 fig 7 at the national level the total local generated blue wf 185 1 gm3 yr of staple crops appears sustainable since less than a third 30 of the national blue water planetary boundary is utilized however here we highlight that the sustainability of crop production varies significantly within the country fig 7a wide spread wheat and maize production drive the crop related blue wf in six relatively water scarce northern provinces tianjin hebei shandong henan ningxia and shanxi provinces to exceed their local blue water planetary boundaries amongst them the blue wf in ningxia is five times higher than its blue water planetary boundary compared with the national carbon planetary boundary total cf 535 mt co2e yr of staple food crops within the country seems sustainable at 49 of national pbs of carbon emission but it changes into an adverse story when downscaling to provincial levels shanxi and inner mongolia the two major power generation bases have cfs related to staple crop production reaching 133 and 174 of the local carbon planetary boundary respectively fig 7b and the cfs of crop production in six provinces heilongjiang jiangxi hunan guizhou shaanxi xinjiang has reached more than 60 of the carbon planetary boundaries in china 45 of the cf related to staple crop production is concentrated in seven provinces shanxi accounts for the largest cf 39 mt co2e yr due to its heavy dependency on fossil fuel based energy this is followed by henan 39 mt co2e yr and anhui provinces 35 mt co2e yr mainly due to the scale of local staple crop cultivation more than two thirds of total cf in four provinces shanxi inner mongolia guizhou and qinghai respectively is associated with the nonlocal crop production thus demonstrating how nonlocal demands can shape environmental outcomes often in a negative way 4 discussion 4 1 agricultural inputs and supply chains are crucial by evaluating environmental impacts associated with the agriculture inputs and supply chain upstream before the farm field we find that the agricultural inputs in the supply chain of crop production account for up to 24 and 89 of a crop s wf and cf respectively at the provincial level in china interprovincial virtual blue water and carbon flows embedded in the trade of agricultural inputs reached 889 mm3 and 134 mt co2e respectively at the same time production of agricultural inputs for export directly leads to unsustainable carbon emissions in shanxi inner mongolia and guizhou provinces given the larger environmental impact the crop supply chain should not be ignored moreover the current study shows that the upstream partners responsible for the supply and processing of raw materials and energy for inputs are also accountable for improving water efficiency and mitigating ghgs emissions from crop production in addition to the agricultural sector itself at the national level industrial products accounted for 73 and 54 of the blue iwfs of maize and rice respectively and more than 95 of the three crops icfs fig 5 unfortunately the current water resources and ghgs emissions managements are in silos cooperation across different sectors especially between the chemical industry and agriculture should be strengthened 4 2 practical implementations and suggestions improving the food system within sustainable limits will require a multifaceted approach that considers all actors within the supply chain network to be more specific at the farm field well known measures to improve water use efficiency reduce nutrient runoff and mitigate ghgs emissions could be more widely employed for example rainwater harvesting mulching no till farming high efficiency irrigation systems and laser field levelling can be used to decrease the use of scarce blue water wang et al 2018 wang and shangguan 2015 precision agriculture technology can minimize fertilizer applications thereby reducing water pollution and ghg emissions adding biochar and nitrification inhibitor to soils applying n fertilizer deeper to reduce n2o emission from n fertilizer application hu et al 2013 carbon sequestration within the soil chen et al 2021 and optimizing irrigation applications to reduce ch4 emissions from rice fields guo et al 2017 are additional strategies to reduce the environmental footprint of food production without limiting production water and carbon markets and caps could spur innovation across the entire food sector as well create new opportunities and investments from other sectors for the chemical industry supply agricultural inputs more water saving and low carbon production materials and process designs should be encouraged a shift toward clean renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power will significantly reduce the wf and cf of the food system bogdanov et al 2019 in addition we need to be alert to the fragility of international trade networks which are vulnerable to climate change natural disasters economic development and international relations puma et al 2015 bringing the food system within sustainable limits is made more challenging due to broader concerns beyond the environment our results show regions like shanxi and inner mongolia depend on environmentally damaging mining heavy industry energy production and agriculture to lift their economy and the livelihoods of their people thus despite the considerable environmental damage attributable to the food system in these provinces it will likely not be tenable to limit their production or exports to more sustainable levels an alternative approach to limiting production and exports is to focus investments in clean energy improving manufacturing efficiencies and precision agriculture within these regions investments aimed at addressing the supply chain stages and locations where the greatest environmental damage occurs as detailed in this study can improve both environmental concerns and economic competitiveness greater information sharing and transparency within the food industry including best practices disclosure of water uses and ghg emissions and industry specific cf and wf benchmarks marston et al 2020 can help shift the entire food system toward a smaller environmental footprint consumer preferences may help incentivize the food industry to move in this direction though it remains unclear the degree to which market forces can shift the food system toward a more environmentally sustainable outcome potter et al 2021 instead government coordination investments incentives and regulations may prove more effective 4 3 limitations and uncertainties there are limitations to be in caution a lack of detailed facility level data required us to simplify the diversity of industrial product varieties and production processes across china we assumed widely used varieties production processes and energy consumption types such as urea for n fertilizer reverse flotation for k2o fertilizer production and coal based thermal power generation in addition our study focuses on one year 2016 thus the current analysis did not capture inter annual variability in wfs and cfs due to the impact of year to year changes in agricultural production meteorological conditions industrial and energy sector structure trade patterns and national policies due to the lack of a database of available seed wf showing spatial differences we treat the seed as field crops which may underestimate the iwf of crops although there may be underestimates it is not expected to change the key conclusion that the crop iwf is nonnegligible it is still highly recommended to take specific field measurements of wf of seedlings for smaller scale assessments compared to previous studies chen et al 2021 the current shown national average cf of rice and wheat is 5 and 4 lower respectively while that of maize is 24 higher which is related to the study s system boundary and the carbon emission factor of each stage of the supply chain straw burning and manure compost are not considered in this study but the ghgs emission of seeds are we also consider regional differences in carbon emission factors of crop production supply chain inputs in addition we used the nitrogen loss model to calculate the n2o emissions caused by n fertilizer application in the field most studies have found a strong exponential relationship between n loss and input chen et al 2014 cui et al 2013 calculating n2o emissions using the common ipcc methodology will have a big impact on the results in areas of overfertilisation particularly in china therefore we believe that the current results are relatively more reasonable the national average wf of the three crops estimated in the current study is much higher than that of mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 and zhang et al 2018 which is mainly due to our high grey wfs two reasons explain this phenomenon the one is the broader system boundaries our study considered the indirect water pollution caused by inputs throughout their life cycle while other studies only considered grey dwf caused by the application of n and p2o5 fertilizer the second is the difference between our maximum allowable and natural nitrogen concentration cmax cnat in formula 3 used a more stringent assumption of 0 8 mg l while mekonnen and hoekstra was 10 mg l 5 conclusion this study systematically analyses the linkages between the final consumption of agricultural production and the upstream sectors as well as the resulting inter regional transfer of environmental impacts and regional sustainability by looking at the supply chain of staple crop production from upstream to downstream in a geographically refined manner the study broadens the scope of traditional agricultural production impact assessments and the same assessment methods can also be applied to many other countries sectors and products facing similar sustainability challenges at the same time because agriculture is the primary water user and carbon emitter such assessments are essential to ensure regional food security and sustainable development in the face of rising global trade water scarcity and strict carbon neutrality targets credit authorship contribution

fractionation coupled with an organic carbon detector ffff ocd the underlying mechanism of om membrane adhesive interactions affecting ob cleaning was elucidated the results indicate that humic acid a typical humic substance and tannic acid a typical polyphenolic compound induced stronger adhesive interaction with nf ro membranes than biopolymers and lmwo when the mass loss of an om due to adhesion

in lower ob cleaning efficiency due to their higher aromatic content enhancing hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding calcium facilitated adhesion of some om types such as humic substances polyphenolics and biopolymers increased irreversible organic fouling potential and weakened ob cleaning which was verified by both ffff ocd and membrane filtration results this work provides a guidance to formulate strategies to enhance spontaneous ob cleaning such as first identifying the adhesion of om in feedwater surface and ground waters using ffff ocd and then removing sticky om using

flux referred to as critical flux with deviating from the linear flux tmp relationship the tractive force overcomes electrostatic repulsive force between the om and the membrane surface leading to the mechanical deposition of om on the membrane surface field and pearce 2011 field et al 1995 wiesner et al 1989 this deposition is reversible in the absence of adhesive interactions referred to as stickiness between om and membrane and the deposited om can be released by a decrease in the tractive force stickiness is an adhesive property enabling a substance to form bonds with a surface upon contact which requires a certain tensile force to separate substances from surfaces gay 2002 gay and leibler 1999 kendall 2004 stickier foulants have stronger adhesive forces bonds with the surface than the cohesive bonds within foulants foulants noren et al 2019 a significant correlation between the intermolecular adhesive force and fouling rates has been verified lee and elimelech 2006 potential mechanisms interfacial interactions that contributed to stickiness are summarised in figure 1 adhikari et al 2001 allen 2003 gay 2002 gay and leibler 1999 li et al 2015 williams et al 1999 these stickiness mechanisms are elaborated as follows i mechanical interlocking is a physical interaction caused by the rough membrane surface trapping om molecules adhikari et al 2001 gay 2002 ii electrostatic attractive interaction occurs when the membrane s surface and om have opposite charges yet this is uncommon as both are usually negatively charged at neutral ph amy 2008 yoon et al 1998 iii van der waals interaction an intermolecular attraction between molecules occurs when om molecules and membrane surfaces are close to each other 0 3 0 6 nm allen 1984 iv chemical bonding for example ionic bonds occurs when multivalent cations such as calcium ions interact with negatively charged om and membrane surface as a bridge or glue yoon et al 1998 v hydrophobic interactions occur when the hydrophobic om approaches and adheres to the hydrophobic membrane surface li et al 2015 xiao et al 2011 vi hydrogen bonding results from the attractive force between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to an electronegative atom such as an o or n atom from om and another electronegative atom from the membrane surface or vice versa gutierrez et al 2015 li et al 2015 the strength comparison of these intermolecular attractions is chemical bonding electrostatic attraction hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interactions van der waals interaction allen 1984 the dominant adhesive interactions such as chemical bonding and hydrogen bonds are related to the functional groups of om and membrane surface and solution chemistry gutierrez et al 2015 yamamura et al 2008 the electrostatic interactions are affected by the charge of om and membrane surfaces childress and elimelech 2000 whereas the hydrophobic interactions are controlled by the hydrophobicity of om and membrane surfaces gutierrez et al 2015 these factors affecting adhesive interactions are summarised in table s1 specifically larger om molecules are pulled more strongly by permeate flow and thus easier deposition on the membrane surface hwang et al 2006 a less negatively charged om is easier to deposit onto a negatively charged membrane surface via a balance of electrostatic repulsive force and permeate tractive force li et al 2015 the hydrophobic fraction of om favours the hydrophobic membrane surface via hydrophobic interaction bessiere et al 2009 li et al 2015 the functional groups play an important role in the charge and hydrophobicity of om dom leenheer and croué 2003 carboxylic and phenolic groups are considered as the most common functional groups contributing to the negative charge of om sillanpää 2015 where these groups can be titrated bratskaya et al 2008 some om such as benzoic acid and biopolymer that form a hydrogen bond with aromatic polyamide chains of membrane contribute to irreversible fouling gutierrez et al 2015 li et al 2015 the aromaticity of om such as phenolic moieties plays an important role in irreversible organic fouling due to the enhanced hydrophobic interactions li et al 2019 specific ultraviolet absorbance of dom at 254 nm of wavelength suva254 strongly correlates with the aromatic content and hydrophobic om fractions and is therefore commonly used to indicate the aromaticity leenheer and croué 2003 weishaar et al 2003 membrane characteristics also affect the deposition and stickiness the high permeability of membranes with large pore size increases mechanical deposition via enhancing the permeate tractive force while membranes with higher om removal promote it via concentration polarisation cp less negatively charged and hydrophobic membrane surfaces facilitate the stickiness via reduced electrostatic repulsive interactions and increased hydrophobic interactions contreras et al 2011 gutierrez et al 2015 xiao et al 2011 a rough membrane surface enlarges the contact area and enhances the stickiness via mechanical interlocking gay and leibler 1999 sherman et al 2009 solution chemistry including ph salinity and the presence of multivalent cations such as calcium ions ca2 affects the charge and structure of om and subsequent stickiness braghetta et al 1997 lee and elimelech 2006 lower ph and higher salinity increase adhesive forces via reduced electrostatic repulsion between om molecular and membrane surface lee and elimelech 2006 ca2 enhances stickiness via chemical bonding which contributes to irreversible fouling ca2 also facilitates the deposition due to charge neutralisation complexation of ca2 with carboxylic groups of om and intermolecular bridging iskrenova tchoukova et

preparation operational complexity and equipment sensitivity and accuracy kendall 2004 for instance afm has been used to quantify the adhesive forces between om and membrane surfaces at a molecular level ang et al 2006 gutierrez et al 2015 lee and elimelech 2006 li and elimelech 2004 sherman et al 2009 however the measurement requires the attachment of suitable coated colloidal probes to the

hartmann and williams 2002 kim et al 2009 phuntsho et al 2011 thus it is a suitable and promising tool for indirectly quantifying the adhesive interaction the conventional detectors used in ffff such as ultraviolet visible light uv vis spectroscopy are incompatible with various om types because some do not absorb uv light hallé and meyn 2017 hence the ffff channel coupled with an organic carbon detector ocd would be impeccable to quantify the adhesive interaction of a wide range of om types to nf ro membranes the quantification of om membrane adhesive interactions is critical for nf ro systems for prescribing suitable membrane cleaning methods protocols for small scale directly coupled pv nf ro systems in rural areas where o m remains a greater challenge and chemical cleaning is not practical controlling organic fouling requires a simple easy to use and effective method without chemicals spontaneous ob induced by solar irradiance fluctuation is a suitable and promising self cleaning method to control mitigate membrane fouling cai et al 2021 daly et al 2020 jiang et al 2015 previous studies have investigated the feasibility of spontaneous ob for nf ro scaling organic fouling humic acid with calcium cai et al 2021 cai et al 2022 but the effects of various om types and their adhesions to nf ro membrane on ob cleaning efficiency remains unclear this work evaluates the suitability of spontaneous ob cleaning for eleven common om types to cover a broader range of om regarding their degree of adhesion via correlating the ob cleaning efficiency from nf ro filtration experiments and the mass loss due to adhesive interaction determined by ffff ocd the underlying mechanism of various om types affecting spontaneous ob cleaning was elucidated the novelty relies on the cleaning effectiveness of spontaneous ob as an environmentally friendly self cleaning method for a wide range of om the understanding of om adhesive interaction with membranes enables the selection of appropriate pre treatment processes to remove sticky om before filtration as ob cleaning is ineffective for very sticky om 2 materials and methods 2 1 organic matter and reagents preparation eleven om

biopolymers with higher molecular weight sa is a polysaccharide commonly used as a model organic foulant lipopolysaccharide lps was recently proposed as a better model for polysaccharides than sa kimura et al 2019 and was therefore added to the selection overall the polyphenolic compounds and humic substances are more hydrophobic likely due to their high aromatic content and phenolic groups see table s2 biopolymers and humic substances with more carboxylic groups are more negatively charged than other om types at neutral ph see table s4 stock solutions 1 0 g l of glu ha aus ta tann tea

suez france ta tann tea and bsa solutions were used within 48 hours after preparation since these were easy to degrade other om were used within five days this work will determine the extent of adhesive interactions between these om and nf ro membranes a five litre feed solution with 15 1 mg l doc of each om type was prepared with deionised di water electrical conductivity 1 μs cm ph 7 0 0 4 to facilitate the flux decline and adhesive interaction a concentration of 10 mm nacl prepared from 99 5 purity powder emsure milliporesigma germany as background electrolyte and 1 mm nahco3 prepared

analytical grade roth germany or 1 m naoh a concentration of 1 5 mm cacl2 60 mg l ca2 prepared from 99 8 purity powder vwr chemicals germany in feed solution was chosen to verify the role of ca2 since this concentration is the typical ca2 concentration in groundwater and is commonly used in organic fouling experiments schäfer et al 1998 tayfur et al 2008 2 2 sample analytical methods the doc concentrations of stock solution and samples were determined by the toc analyser sievers m9 suez france with 15 ammonium persulfate as oxidiser and 6 m phosphoric acid acidification of samples due to differing oxidation efficiencies for different om types the flow rate of the oxidiser 1 2 µl min was varied to obtain the maximum doc concentration i e maximum oxidation efficiency for each om type a uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 25 perkin elmer usa measured the uv absorbance of each om type at 254 nm with a high precision cuvette 10 mm path length no 100 10 40 hellma analytics germany and then the suva254 of om was calculated to correlate with the aromaticity of each om type results shown in table s2 a liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd model 9 doc labor germany quantified the fractions of om types huber et al 2011 nguyen et al 2021 an ion chromatography ic metrohm 850 professional ic switzerland measured the ca2 concentration using a standard cation column metrosep c4 150 4 0 metrohm switzerland with standard eluent 1 7 mm nitric acid and 0 7 mm dipicolinic acid supelco sigma aldrich germany the calibration curves for toc analyser ic and lc ocd are reported in si section 5 the total charge of these om types at neural ph 7 5 8 5 was estimated via a polyelectrolyte titration method using a streaming current cell of the particle charge analyser pca micrometrix usa the pca instrument was connected to an automatic titrator easyplus mettler toledo usa the output signal of the pca instrument mv was used to determine the isoelectric point during the titration a volume 100 ml of om sample 15 2 mgc l with 10 mm nacl and 1 mm nahco3 was poured into a cylindrical cell where a precision piston oscillates up and down with a frequency of 4 hz the sample was then titrated with standard cationic polymers solution poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride pdadmac fujifilm wako japan until the isoelectric point was reached then the total charge of an anionic sample at those specific conditions ph salinity was calculated as microequivalents μeq l of the required titrant to the isoelectric point the detailed measurement process is presented in si section 2 3 and the results are shown in table s3 a well established potentiometric titration method was used to measure the carboxylic and phenolic acidity of each om type collins et al 1986 rodríguez and núñez 2011 a volume 100 ml of blanks mill q water and organic samples 100 mgc l was used for the titration all the samples including blanks contained 10 mm nacl to maintain a constant ionic strength the initial ph of all the samples blanks was adjusted to ph 3 0 with 1 m hcl and then purged with n2 to eliminate the co2 for at least one hour after that the sample was titrated to ph 10 0 by stepwise additions of a carbonate free 10 mm naoh solution under the n2 atmosphere to minimise the effects of co2 during the titration the n2 atmosphere during titration was maintained by feeding n2 gas to the glass beaker through the perforated lid and simultaneously purging the solution with n2 gas the ph value of the sample and the consuming naoh volume during stepwise additions were recorded the ph value of samples and feed solution was measured by a ph meter ph cond 3320 wtw germany with a ph sensor sentix 81 germany carboxylic acidity was defined as the milliequivalents of the naoh required to titrate the sample from ph 3 to 8 subtracting the blank titration and phenolic acidity was defined as twice the milliequivalents of the base to titrate from ph 8 to 10 the assumptions for these definitions are shown in si 2 4 the results of the measured acidity of carboxylic and phenolic groups of each om are shown in table s4 the polyelectrolyte titration is to estimate and compare the total charges of om 15 mgc l at neutral ph 7 5 to 8 5 with 10 mm nacl and 1 mm nahco3 these results can only provide the total charge of om solution at specific ph and ionic strength but cannot identify the sources of charge and the contributions of different negative charged functional groups or the electrostatic double layer to the total charges of om while the potentiometric titration is to quantify the negatively charged functional groups namely carboxylic groups and phenolic groups which only provide the amount of functional groups and the charge contributed by these functional groups but not the total charges both methods complement each other and provide insights into the relationship between om s charge functional groups and the stickiness 2 3 nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membrane characteristics a flat sheet commercial thin film composite tfc nf membrane nf270 and ro membrane bw30 filmtectm dupont water solutions co usa were selected to cover a wide range of dense membrane performance and surface properties table s6 shows the surface properties of both membranes relating to the adhesive interactions including pore size surface charge at ph 8 active layer polymer roughness and contact angle hydrophobicity nf270 membrane has a smoother more negatively charged and hydrophobic surface than bw30 membrane likely due to different active layer materials and structures nf270 has higher pure water permeability 12 16 l m2h bar than bw30 3 5 l m2h bar due to its large pore radius the extent of adhesive interaction of various om with these two membranes is expected to vary due to different membrane surface characteristics 2 4 bench scale crossflow nf ro system powered by solar array simulator a bench scale crossflow nf ro system powered by a solar array simulator sas 62050h 600s chroma ate usa performed filtration experiments with spontaneous osmotic backwash as reported previously cai et al 2022 the effective membrane area is 47 cm2 with the flow channel dimension of 19 cm in length 2 5 cm in width and 0 07 cm in height the sas simulated the one third power output of two pv panels low velocity power setting 100w 69v as the same setting from the previous study cai et al 2022 a chiller mc250 lauda brinkmann germany maintained a stable feed solution temperature of 25 1 c a bi directional liquid flow sensor sls 1500 sensirion switzerland was installed to monitor permeate flowrate and osmotic backwash performance cai et al 2022 the system s hydrodynamics were controlled by the opening of a pressure control valve pump engineering badger rc200 germany and the power from sas namely controlled solar irradiance fluctuations the opening of the control valve was fixed at 21 22 to achieve 10 0 5 bar operating pressure and 0 4 m s crossflow velocity at 800 w m2 solar irradiance set point condition such settings were chosen within a typical operation range 0 05 0 5 m s of spiral wound modules lau et al 2010 all components including pipe valves and crossflow filtration cell of the filtration system are made of stainless steel so the stiffness of the system components allows the high operating pressure up to 20 bar and handle the variation of the feed pressure and feed flow system damage leakage caused by the sudden and frequent change in applied pressure due to the solar irradiance fluctuation is unlikely as the research aim is to investigate the impact of om types on spontaneous ob cleaning efficiency the solar energy fluctuating conditions were identical for filtration experiments with different om feed solutions a typical controlled solar irradiance fluctuating condition was selected namely peak solar irradiance of 800 w m2 for one hour dropping to zero due to large cloud coverage for three minutes the corresponding applied pressure dropped from 10 0 5 bar to zero pump off such fluctuation induced a typical spontaneous ob cleaning process three minutes to investigate its cleaning efficiency for different om types cai et al 2022 the filtration experiments were performed in constant pressure mode 10 bar at 800 w m2 with permeate and concentrate circulating to the feed tank 2 5 filtration protocol and experimental design the detailed filtration protocol has been previously reported cai et al 2022 briefly each filtration experiment contains four steps i membrane pre conditioning soaking in 10 mm nacl for one hour ii membrane compaction at 10 bar using di water for one hour to achieve stable water flux iii three filtration cycles to ensure the reproducibility with the feedwater of choice and controlled solar irradiance fluctuation each cycle contains a one hour constant 10 bar filtration with three minutes of ob 800 w m2 0 and iv membrane coupon was taken off and the system was cleaned thoroughly with 1 mm naoh solution and plenty of tap water and di water at 60 l h feed flowrate for one hour a fresh membrane coupon was used for each experiment filtration experiments contain two batches the first used eleven om types without ca2 to investigate the impact of om types the adhesion variations via different hydrophobic interaction hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction on ob cleaning the second selected six representative om types from eleven om in the presence of ca2 adhesion enhancement via ionic bridging based on the results from the first batch experiments these six om fp ha aus ta sa and lps from the four different groups varying size hydrophobicity functional groups and fractions interact with calcium differently hence they were selected to verify the role of ca2 on adhesive interactions 2 6 adhesive interaction quantification via coupled ffff ocd an ffff system af2000 multiflow ffff postnova germany was connected to a uv vis spectrophotometer pn3212 postnova germany and then to an ocd model 9 doc labor germany in series see figure 2 to quantify the mass loss due to adhesive interaction as an indicator for the extent of adhesive interaction a polyester based spacer of nominal thickness of 500 µm was placed on the top of the membrane effective area 33 4 cm2 to create the channel the same nf270 and bw30 membranes were used in the ffff channel the ocd including a gräntzel thin film reactor and a non dispersive infrared detector was used to quantify the organic mass of various om types bypassing or from the ffff channel nguyen et al 2021 first om samples 15 mgc l with 10 mm nacl and 1 mm nahco3 injection volume 50 µl bypassed the ffff channel to obtain total organic carbon without a loss namely no adhesive interactions and permeation second the same om sample flowed through the ffff channel with nf ro membranes nf270 bw30 in three steps see table s5 and figure s3 i sample injection and focusing step for four min focus flowrate 3 3 ml min ii elution step i without focus flow for 25 min iii elution step ii without permeate flow for 14 min during the injection of the dom into the ffff channel a focus flow is also introduced to near the middle of channel a part of the focus flow meets the injection flow and forms a boundary where the om is focused into a band after this injection focusing step for 4 min the focus flow is stopped and the om begins to elute to the detector in figure 2 peak 1 during elution step i represents the om eluting over the membrane without interactions and peak 2 during elution step ii represents the reversible physical deposition of om due to the permeate flow permeate tractive force lastly the om mass loss percentage due to adhesive interactions between om and membrane m a s s l o s s a d h e s i o n indicating the extent of adhesive interaction hartmann and williams 2002 was calculated using eq 1 1 m a s s l o s s a d h e s i o n m b y p a s s m f f f f m

and reversible om by permeation peak 2 m p om mass of ffff permeate mgc all were determined by ocd after optimising the flow conditions in the ffff system to maximise the adhesive interaction the permeate flowrate of 3 ml min and concentrate flowrate i e detector flowrate of 0 5 ml min were selected for the elution stages the optimisation process and results are shown in figure s2 with the detailed elution protocol presented in table s5 the mobile phase for ffff ocd was selected depending on the research aims with the characteristics of the mobile phase shown in table 1 due to the small volume 50 µl of the organic sample injected into the ffff channel the ca2 in the sample is not sufficient to verify the effect of ca2 on adhesive interaction thus the ca2 was added to the phosphate mobile phase 1 mm phosphate with 1 5 mm cacl2 to verify the role of ca2 on adhesive interaction the low ph 5 0 0 1 of this buffer was used to prevent calcium phosphate crystallisation the controlled mobile phase was the phosphate buffer with the same ph and ionic strength a similar approach to investigate the role of ca2 on organic fouling using ffff was previously reported hartmann and williams 2002 2 7 data and error analysis the parameters including flux decline represent the extent of fouling flux recovery and maximum ob flux represent the ob cleaning efficiency and suva254 indicating the aromaticity of each om type were calculated using the equations shown in table 2 the error estimation and analysis methods are presented in si section 5 in detail 3 results and discussion previous studies cai et al 2021 cai et al 2022 focused on the feasibility and mechanism of spontaneous ob on typical scaling and organic fouling control in directly coupled pv nf ro systems in this work the spontaneous ob cleaning efficiency was examined and correlated with the extent of adhesive interactions determined by coupled ffff ocd with these eleven om types then the om characteristics especially aromaticity hydrophobicity contributing to the adhesive interaction were discussed lastly the effect of ca2 ions on ob cleaning efficiency with six selected om types was examined with the role of calcium ions on adhesive interaction verified via ffff ocd 3 1 spontaneous osmotic backwash for various organic matter types different om types can cause different flux performance and spontaneous ob cleaning efficiency to investigate the impact of different om types the filtration experiments with spontaneous ob cleaning were conducted using eleven om feed solutions the normalised flux performance of eleven om types as a function of time is presented in figure s7 the summarised flux decline and flux recovery after ob cleaning as a function of om types are shown in figure 3 figure 3 shows different om types with nf270 causing a more significant variation of flux decline than bw30 under the same operating pressure 10 bar this can probably be attributed to higher cp and larger permeate tractive force with a higher initial flux of nf270 causing more deposition table s7 shows the estimated permeate tractive force for each om with these two membranes confirming a higher permeate tractive force with nf270 figure 3a and c show that humic substances especially ha and polyphenolic compounds especially ta caused more flux decline and less flux recovery after ob indicating irreversible fouling is induced by these om and ob may not be effective for these om types especially for ta 25 flux recovery with the nf270 membrane sa caused a 25 flux decline but 98 flux recovery after ob while ta and ha caused 9 11 flux decline and 20 80 flux recovery after ob indicating both ha and ta are stickier than sa more flux decline of sa is likely due to the reversible physical deposition of large sa molecules to verify this hypothesis coupled ffff ocd with eleven om types were carried out and the ocd signals bypassing and flowing through the ffff channel with nf270 membranes were monitored as a function of elution time as shown in figure 4 figure 4 shows a significant second peak from 35 to 50 min with sa compared to other om types implying sa s major fractions cause significant reversible physical deposition this observation substantiates why sa caused a higher flux decline 25 while it was almost 100 reversible with spontaneous ob see figure 3a and c ha had the smallest peak area among humic substances with ta having the smallest peak area among polyphenolic compounds implying both ha and ta had stronger adhesive interaction with nf270 than other om types this result appears to correlate with ha and ta s flux decline and ob cleaning performance figure 3 therefore the correlation between the extent of adhesive interaction between om and membrane and the ob cleaning efficiency is examined in the next section 3 2 correlation between adhesive interaction and osmotic backwash this section addresses the research question of whether stronger adhesive interaction namely more mass loss between om and membrane would weaken ob cleaning efficiency therefore flux decline flux recovery after ob and ob flux with eleven om types from the filtration experiments as a function of mass loss percentage of these om due to adhesive interaction obtained from coupled ffff ocd with nf270 and bw30 membranes are shown in figure 5 for bw30 membranes figure 5d shows an increasing trend in flux decline with mass loss due to adhesion figure 5e and f show a decreasing trend in spontaneous ob cleaning efficiency with mass loss this result confirms that stronger om membrane adhesive interaction would weaken ob cleaning interestingly for nf270 membranes figure 5a when the mass loss of om due to adhesive interaction ffff ocd was higher than a certain range 39 to 45 the flux decline started to be significant 9 indicating the increase of stickiness enhances organic fouling figure 5b and c show that when the mass loss of om was below this critical range the spontaneous ob was most effective 85 flux recovery with 40 l m2h ob flux above this range ob became ineffective 50 flux recovery with 25 l m2h ob flux these results indicate the existence of a critical adhesion range of om the adhesive forces between om and membrane are balanced with the thrust force imposed by spontaneous ob when this imposed force is larger than adhesive forces the spontaneous ob can lift up the om and achieve a higher cleaning efficiency but when it is smaller than the adhesive forces the ob is ineffective the results show that the critical adhesive interaction region causing significant flux decline and inhibiting the flux recovery was only observed with nf270 membranes but not with bw30 membranes this may attribute to the less significant flux decline in the case of bw30 membranes due to the lower permeate tractive force for each om under the same pressure compared to nf270 membranes this means the flux of bw30 for the om may be lower than the critical flux so that the critical adhesive interaction region is not observed therefore the operating pressure flux may play an important role in this adhesive interaction region polyphenolic compounds and humic substances rather than lmwo and biopolymers appear to induce stronger adhesive interactions with the nf270 membrane adversely affecting the ob cleaning therefore these sticky om types should be removed during pre treatment processes to mitigate irreversible organic fouling overall these results demonstrate the coupled ffff ocd is a suitable method for quantifying a wide range extent of adhesive interaction of different om types in the next section the om characteristics especially aromaticity contributing to the adhesive interaction are discussed 3 3 organic matter characteristics contributing to adhesive interaction this section aims to identify the main organic matter characteristics correlated with the adhesive interaction in the absence of multivalent cations polyphenolic compounds especially ta and humic substances especially ha caused stronger adhesive interactions than lmwo and biopolymers see figure 5 implying the adhesive interaction may be independent of the molecular size of om at neural ph 7 5 to 8 5 biopolymers e g sa and humic substances e g ha are more negatively charged than polyphenolic compounds e g ta and lmwo see polyelectrolyte titration results table s3 and thus these om types should cause very weak adhesive interactions with negatively charged nf ro membranes in the absence of calcium ions however ha had strong adhesive interaction with nf ro see figure 5 35 to 42 mass loss due to adhesion without calcium ions implying the total charge of humic substances may not directly correlate with the adhesive interaction ha may contain phenolic or polyphenolic compounds such as ta like compounds banach szott and debska 2008 de melo et al 2016 which potentially contribute to the adhesive interaction with membranes and subsequent organic fouling the potentiometric titration results table s4 show the highest phenolic group acidity of ta and the second highest phenolic group acidity of ha 50 of ta implying the phenolic groups play a role in adhesive interaction with membranes li et al 2019 ta and ha are more hydrophobic with higher suva254 than other om types see table s2 suggesting that aromaticity plays a role in adhesive interaction therefore the mass loss of eleven om types due to the adhesive interaction and the flux recovery after ob as a function of suva254 indicating the aromaticity of om are presented in figure 6 figure 6a and c show more mass loss due to adhesion of om to nf270 and bw30 with an increase of suva254 of om implying the om s aromaticity plays an important role in adhesive interaction between these om and polyamide membrane surface coronell et al 2008 figure 6b and d show that less flux recovery after ob with an increase of suva254 of om indicates the ob cleaning is not effective for the om with higher aromatic content such as ta and ha the high aromaticity of om adversely affects the ob cleaning efficiency likely due to the enhanced hydrophobic interaction li et al 2019 and hydrogen bonding li et al 2015 between aromatic om and aromatic membrane surface tannin was out of the correlation trend and had low flux recovery with low aromaticity indicating other om characteristics of tannin such as very weak negatively charge see table s2 may contribute more to the strong adhesion and weak ob cleaning efficiency 3 4 spontaneous osmotic backwash for various organic matter types with calcium calcium affects the ob cleaning efficiency for different om types and this section aims to investigate the impact of the calcium on the flux performance and ob cleaning efficiency based on previous results six om types fp ha aus ta sa lps were selected from different groups based on different interactions with calcium and consequently variable adhesive interactions with nf ro membranes the flux performance of nf270 and bw30 membranes with these selected om with and without calcium as a function of operating time is shown in figure 7 figure 7 shows that for humics such as ha polyphenolic compounds such as ta and biopolymers such as sa and lps the addition of ca2 resulted in more flux decline whereas for low molecular weight om such as fp ca2 did not enhance the flux decline 3 figure 7b c f and g show for ha and ta with ca2 the flux after ob cleaning was not recovered suggesting the ineffectiveness of spontaneous ob when the feedwater contains humic substances or polyphenolic compounds with ca2 for biopolymers with ca2 figure 7d and h the flux after ob was recovered to 75 95 implying a higher ob cleaning efficiency for biopolymers even with ca2 lee et al observed similar ob cleaning efficiency 80 for both ha and sa with 1 mm cacl2 which was due to higher feed salinity 0 5 m nacl and longer backwash duration 10 min lee et al 2021 nf270 membranes caused a more significant flux decline than that of bw30 with ca2 under the same operating pressure implying more open nf membranes nf270 induce more irreversible organic fouling than denser ro membranes bw30 with ca2 under the same operating pressure more cp and larger permeate tractive force of nf270 are the major contributors to more mechanical deposition of om ca complex and subsequent significant flux decline of nf270 membranes these results suggest more irreversible fouling and deteriorated ob cleaning efficiency with ca2 especially for humic substances and polyphenolic compounds one of the reasons is that ca2 enhances the adhesive interaction of these om biopolymers humics and polyphenolic compounds between om and membranes but not for lmwo therefore the next section aims to verify this hypothesis 3 5 verification of calcium enhanced adhesive interaction via ffff ocd this section aims to verify whether calcium enhances adhesive interaction between om and nf ro membranes and thus weakens the ob cleaning efficiency coupled ffff ocd quantified the mass loss of these six representative om types due to adhesive interaction in the presence of ca2 the mass loss of the six representative om types due to the adhesion using different mobile phases with and without ca2 ions in ffff ocd is shown in figure 8 figure 8a and b show that with the mobile phase containing ca2 the mass loss of humics and polyphenolic compounds and biopolymers due to adhesive integration increased in contrast the mass loss did not increase for lmwo such as fp this result suggests the ca2 indeed enhances the adhesive interaction of these om types including humic substance polyphenolic om and biopolymers to nf ro membranes but not for lmwo the potential mechanisms to explain the calcium enhanced adhesive interaction as shown in figure 8 based on literature are proposed i ca2 forms ionic bridges between negatively charged functional groups such as carboxylic groups or phenolic groups of humic acid polyphenolic compounds biopolymer and negatively charged nf ro membrane surface coronell et al 2008 yoon et al 1998 and ii the ca2 bridged organic complexes form a sticky layer on the membrane surface iskrenova tchoukova et al 2010 xin et al 2015 however ffff ocd cannot verify these mechanisms to understand which one is dominant requiring further investigations ca2 did not enhance the adhesion of lmwo such as fp to membranes more mass loss which is possibly due to i lower stickiness of ca lmwo complex and ii higher permeation of small ca lmwo complex it should be noted that the calculated mass loss of om shown in figure 8 is due to adhesive interaction and not the permeation the om types such as humics and polyphenolic compounds with more mass loss in presence of ca2 see figure 8a and b caused lower flux recovery after ob see figure 8c and d indicating calcium enhanced adhesive interaction weakens the ob cleaning efficiency overall these results demonstrate that calcium ions indeed enhance the adhesive interaction between some om types including humics polyphenol and biopolymers and membrane surface and such ca enhanced adhesion adversely affects the ob cleaning efficiency 4 conclusions this work investigated the underlying mechanism of eleven om types affecting spontaneous ob via correlating the ob cleaning efficiency from filtration experiments with the adhesive interaction of om types as determined by coupled ffff ocd the results show humic acid a typical humic substance and tannic acid a typical polyphenolic compound induced stronger adhesive interaction with nf ro membranes than biopolymers and low molecular weight om resulting in lower ob cleaning efficiency a critical adhesion range of om types was observed with nf270 membranes once the adhesion between om such as tannic acid and membrane exceeds this range the irreversible organic fouling potential increases and spontaneous ob becomes ineffective the dom fraction of biopolymers caused significant membrane flux decline 25 but higher ob cleaning efficiency 99 due to the reversible physical deposition polyphenolic compounds and humic substances with higher aromaticity such as tannic acid caused the lowest ob cleaning efficiency most likely due to the stronger adhesive interaction via enhanced hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding the ffff ocd results demonstrate i the coupled ffff ocd is a suitable method for quantifying the adhesive interaction between om and membranes indirectly and ii calcium ions indeed enhance the adhesive interaction of some om types such as humics polyphenolic compounds and biopolymers thereby weakening the ob cleaning efficiency this work brings several important implications to reduce organic fouling potential and improve the ob cleaning efficiency in directly coupled pv nf ro systems where it is important to i determine the stickiness of om in feedwater such as surface water and groundwater using coupled ffff ocd and possibly removing the sticky om using appropriate pre treatment processes such as ultrafiltration ii decrease water hardness calcium ions to reduce calcium enhanced adhesion and thus irreversible organic fouling potential this work would benefit from further verification and investigation of adhesive interaction mechanisms

15777,organic matter om in surface and ground waters may cause membrane fouling that is laborious to clean once established spontaneous osmotic backwash ob induced by solar irradiance fluctuation has been demonstrated for early mineral scaling organic fouling control in decentralised small scale photovoltaic powered nanofiltration reverse osmosis pv nf ro membrane systems however various om types will interact differently with membranes which in turn affects the effectiveness of ob this work evaluates the suitability of spontaneous ob cleaning for eleven om types covering low molecular weight organics lmwo humic substances polyphenolic compounds and biopolymers regarding adhesive interactions with nf ro membranes the adhesive interactions were quantified by an asymmetric flow field flow fractionation coupled with an organic carbon detector ffff ocd the underlying mechanism of om membrane adhesive interactions affecting ob cleaning was elucidated the results indicate that humic acid a typical humic substance and tannic acid a typical polyphenolic compound induced stronger adhesive interaction with nf ro membranes than biopolymers and lmwo when the mass loss of an om due to adhesion was below a critical range the spontaneous ob is most effective 85 flux recovery and above this range the ob becomes ineffective 50 flux recovery polyphenolic compounds and humic substances resulted in lower ob cleaning efficiency due to their higher aromatic content enhancing hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding calcium facilitated adhesion of some om types such as humic substances polyphenolics and biopolymers increased irreversible organic fouling potential and weakened ob cleaning which was verified by both ffff ocd and membrane filtration results this work provides a guidance to formulate strategies to enhance spontaneous ob cleaning such as first identifying the adhesion of om in feedwater surface and ground waters using ffff ocd and then removing sticky om using

grid rural areas encounter various surface and groundwater impurities bilton et al 2011 kharraz et al 2017 schäfer et al 2007 the impurities characteristics and their interactions with the membrane affect the system s performance resulting in permeate flux reduction and membrane fouling the typical impurities include inorganic and organic colloids particles and microbes thorsen and fløgstad 2006 among these foulant types organic matter om caused severe membrane fouling issues more specifically dissolved organic matter dom defined as the organic fractions passing through a 0 45 µm filter sillanpää 2015 has been significant foulants for irreversible organic fouling of nf ro membranes chon and cho 2016 her et al 2007 mustafa et al 2016 the mechanical deposition serves as a precursor for organic fouling ang et al 2006 continuous deposition of om or dom could cause severe organic fouling of nf ro increasing operation and maintenance o m costs qu et al 2020 permeate flux across the membrane driven by transmembrane pressure tmp provides a tractive force for om to approach the membrane surface seidel and elimelech 2002 xie et al 2015 once the permeate flux is above a threshold flux referred to as critical flux with deviating from the linear flux tmp relationship the tractive force overcomes electrostatic repulsive force between the om and the membrane surface leading to the mechanical deposition of om on the membrane surface field and pearce 2011 field et al 1995 wiesner et al 1989 this deposition is reversible in the absence of adhesive interactions referred to as stickiness between om and membrane and the deposited om can be released by a decrease in the tractive force stickiness is an adhesive property enabling a substance to form bonds with a surface upon contact which requires a certain tensile force to separate substances from surfaces gay 2002 gay and leibler 1999 kendall 2004 stickier foulants have stronger adhesive forces bonds with the surface than the cohesive bonds within foulants foulants noren et al 2019 a significant correlation between the intermolecular adhesive force and fouling rates has been verified lee and elimelech 2006 potential mechanisms interfacial interactions that contributed to stickiness are summarised in figure 1 adhikari et al 2001 allen 2003 gay 2002 gay and leibler 1999 li et al 2015 williams et al 1999 these stickiness mechanisms are elaborated as follows i mechanical interlocking is a physical interaction caused by the rough membrane surface trapping om molecules adhikari et al 2001 gay 2002 ii electrostatic attractive interaction occurs when the membrane s surface and om have opposite charges yet this is uncommon as both are usually negatively charged at neutral ph amy 2008 yoon et al 1998 iii van der waals interaction an intermolecular attraction between molecules occurs when om molecules and membrane surfaces are close to each other 0 3 0 6 nm allen 1984 iv chemical bonding for example ionic bonds occurs when multivalent cations such as calcium ions interact with negatively charged om and membrane surface as a bridge or glue yoon et al 1998 v hydrophobic interactions occur when the hydrophobic om approaches and adheres to the hydrophobic membrane surface li et al 2015 xiao et al 2011 vi hydrogen bonding results from the attractive force between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to an electronegative atom such as an o or n atom from om and another electronegative atom from the membrane surface or vice versa gutierrez et al 2015 li et al 2015 the strength comparison of these intermolecular attractions is chemical bonding electrostatic attraction hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interactions van der waals interaction allen 1984 the dominant adhesive interactions such as chemical bonding and hydrogen bonds are related to the functional groups of om and membrane surface and solution chemistry gutierrez et al 2015 yamamura et al 2008 the electrostatic interactions are affected by the charge of om and membrane surfaces childress and elimelech 2000 whereas the hydrophobic interactions are controlled by the hydrophobicity of om and membrane surfaces gutierrez et al 2015 these factors affecting adhesive interactions are summarised in table s1 specifically larger om molecules are pulled more strongly by permeate flow and thus easier deposition on the membrane surface hwang et al 2006 a less negatively charged om is easier to deposit onto a negatively charged membrane surface via a balance of electrostatic repulsive force and permeate tractive force li et al 2015 the hydrophobic fraction of om favours the hydrophobic membrane surface via hydrophobic interaction bessiere et al 2009 li et al 2015 the functional groups play an important role in the charge and hydrophobicity of om dom leenheer and croué 2003 carboxylic and phenolic groups are considered as the most common functional groups contributing to the negative charge of om sillanpää 2015 where these groups can be titrated bratskaya et al 2008 some om such as benzoic acid and biopolymer that form a hydrogen bond with aromatic polyamide chains of membrane contribute to irreversible fouling gutierrez et al 2015 li et al 2015 the aromaticity of om such as phenolic moieties plays an important role in irreversible organic fouling due to the enhanced hydrophobic interactions li et al 2019 specific ultraviolet absorbance of dom at 254 nm of wavelength suva254 strongly correlates with the aromatic content and hydrophobic om fractions and is therefore commonly used to indicate the aromaticity leenheer and croué 2003 weishaar et al 2003 membrane characteristics also affect the deposition and stickiness the high permeability of membranes with large pore size increases mechanical deposition via enhancing the permeate tractive force while membranes with higher om removal promote it via concentration polarisation cp less negatively charged and hydrophobic membrane surfaces facilitate the stickiness via reduced electrostatic repulsive interactions and increased hydrophobic interactions contreras et al 2011 gutierrez et al 2015 xiao et al 2011 a rough membrane surface enlarges the contact area and enhances the stickiness via mechanical interlocking gay and leibler 1999 sherman et al 2009 solution chemistry including ph salinity and the presence of multivalent cations such as calcium ions ca2 affects the charge and structure of om and subsequent stickiness braghetta et al 1997 lee and elimelech 2006 lower ph and higher salinity increase adhesive forces via reduced electrostatic repulsion between om molecular and membrane surface lee and elimelech 2006 ca2 enhances stickiness via chemical bonding which contributes to irreversible fouling ca2 also facilitates the deposition due to charge neutralisation complexation of ca2 with carboxylic groups of om and intermolecular bridging iskrenova tchoukova et al 2010 lee and elimelech 2006 schäfer et al 1998 xin et al 2015 interfacial tensile adhesive forces or adhesive failure energy measurements are key to directly quantify stickiness zosel 1985 direct

molecules in waters li and elimelech 2004 sherman et al 2009 determining adhesive force at the molecular level rather than bulk liquid level presents challenges and difficulties regarding sample preparation operational complexity and equipment sensitivity and accuracy kendall 2004 for instance afm has been used to quantify the adhesive forces between om and membrane surfaces at a molecular level ang et al 2006 gutierrez et al 2015 lee and elimelech 2006 li and elimelech 2004 sherman et al 2009 however the measurement requires the attachment of suitable coated colloidal probes to the cantilever as an om surrogate and performs in a fluid cell with test solutions therefore it is challenging to use this technique for a wide range of om asymmetric flow field flow fractionation ffff differentiates and quantifies irreversible mass loss due to adhesive interaction between organic foulants and membranes and reversible mechanical deposition by permeate tractive force ham et al 2013 hartmann and williams 2002 kim et al 2009 phuntsho et al 2011 thus it is a suitable and promising tool for indirectly quantifying the adhesive interaction the conventional detectors used in ffff such as ultraviolet visible light uv vis spectroscopy are incompatible with various om types because some do not absorb uv light hallé and meyn 2017 hence the ffff channel coupled with an organic carbon detector ocd would be impeccable to quantify the adhesive interaction of a wide range of om types to nf ro membranes the quantification of om membrane adhesive interactions is critical for nf ro systems for prescribing suitable membrane cleaning methods protocols for small scale directly coupled pv nf ro systems in rural areas where o m remains a greater challenge and chemical cleaning is not practical controlling organic fouling requires a simple easy to use and effective method without chemicals spontaneous ob induced by solar irradiance fluctuation is a suitable and promising self cleaning method to control mitigate membrane fouling cai et al 2021 daly et al 2020 jiang et al 2015 previous studies have investigated the feasibility of spontaneous ob for nf ro scaling organic fouling humic acid with calcium cai et al 2021 cai et al 2022 but the effects of various om types and their adhesions to nf ro membrane on ob cleaning efficiency remains unclear this work evaluates the suitability of spontaneous ob cleaning for eleven common om types to cover a broader range of om regarding their degree of adhesion via correlating the ob cleaning efficiency from nf ro filtration experiments and the mass loss due to adhesive interaction determined by ffff ocd the underlying mechanism of various om types affecting spontaneous ob cleaning was elucidated the novelty relies on the cleaning effectiveness of spontaneous ob as an environmentally friendly self cleaning method for a wide range of om the understanding of om adhesive interaction with membranes enables the selection of appropriate pre treatment processes to remove sticky om before filtration as ob cleaning is ineffective for very sticky om 2 materials and methods 2 1 organic matter and reagents preparation eleven om

total charge carboxylic and phenolic acidity are summarised in table s2 table s3 and table s4 in supporting information si properties of these om types have partially been reported nguyen et al 2021

serum albumin bsa a7738 99 purity sigma aldrich usa and lipopolysaccharide lps l9143 97 purity from pseudomonas aeruginosa 10 purified by phenol extraction sigma aldrich israel are classified as biopolymers with higher molecular weight sa is a polysaccharide commonly used as a model organic foulant lipopolysaccharide lps was recently proposed as a better model for polysaccharides than sa kimura et al 2019 and was therefore added to the selection overall the polyphenolic compounds and humic substances are more hydrophobic likely due to their high aromatic content and phenolic groups see table s2 biopolymers and humic substances with more carboxylic groups are more negatively charged than other om types at neutral ph see table s4 stock solutions 1 0 g l of glu ha aus ta tann tea

om bsa and lps stock solutions were prepared with gentle mixing by hand for twenty minutes to avoid vigorous agitation leading to aggregation of om the fp stock solution was prepared by diluting the

suez france ta tann tea and bsa solutions were used within 48 hours after preparation since these were easy to degrade other om were used within five days this work will determine the extent of adhesive interactions between these om and nf ro membranes a five litre feed solution with 15 1 mg l doc of each om type was prepared with deionised di water electrical conductivity 1 μs cm ph 7 0 0 4 to facilitate the flux decline and adhesive interaction a concentration of 10 mm nacl prepared from 99 5 purity powder emsure milliporesigma germany as background electrolyte and 1 mm nahco3 prepared from 99 7 purity powder emsure milliporesigma germany as a natural buffer were used in each feed solution all feed solution ph was adjusted to 8 0 0 1 by adding drops of 1 m hcl diluted from 37 hcl analytical grade roth germany or 1 m naoh a concentration of 1 5 mm cacl2 60 mg l ca2 prepared from 99 8 purity powder vwr chemicals germany in feed solution was chosen to verify the role of ca2 since this concentration is the typical ca2 concentration in groundwater and is commonly used in organic fouling experiments schäfer et al 1998 tayfur et al 2008 2 2 sample analytical methods the doc concentrations of stock solution and samples were determined by the toc analyser sievers m9 suez france with 15 ammonium persulfate as oxidiser and 6 m phosphoric acid acidification of samples due to differing oxidation efficiencies for different om types the flow rate of the oxidiser 1 2 µl min was varied to obtain the maximum doc concentration i e maximum oxidation efficiency for each om type a uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 25 perkin elmer usa measured the uv absorbance of each om type at 254 nm with a high precision cuvette 10 mm path length no 100 10 40 hellma analytics germany and then the suva254 of om was calculated to correlate with the aromaticity of each om type results shown in table s2 a liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd model 9 doc labor germany quantified the fractions of om types huber et al 2011 nguyen et al 2021 an ion chromatography ic metrohm 850 professional ic switzerland measured the ca2 concentration using a standard cation column metrosep c4 150 4 0 metrohm switzerland with standard eluent 1 7 mm nitric acid and 0 7 mm dipicolinic acid supelco sigma aldrich germany the calibration curves for toc analyser ic and lc ocd are reported in si section 5 the total charge of these om types at neural ph 7 5 8 5 was estimated via a polyelectrolyte titration method using a streaming current cell of the particle charge analyser pca micrometrix usa the pca instrument was connected to an automatic titrator easyplus mettler toledo usa the output signal of the pca instrument mv was used to determine the isoelectric point during the titration a volume 100 ml of om sample 15 2 mgc l with 10 mm nacl and 1 mm nahco3 was poured into a cylindrical cell where a precision piston oscillates up and down with a frequency of 4 hz the sample was then titrated with standard cationic polymers solution poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride pdadmac fujifilm wako japan until the isoelectric point was reached then the total charge of an anionic sample at those specific conditions ph salinity was calculated as microequivalents μeq l of the required titrant to the isoelectric point the detailed measurement process is presented in si section 2 3 and the results are shown in table s3 a well established potentiometric titration method was used to measure the carboxylic and phenolic acidity of each om type collins et al 1986 rodríguez and núñez 2011 a volume 100 ml of blanks mill q water and organic samples 100 mgc l was used for the titration all the samples including blanks contained 10 mm nacl to maintain a constant ionic strength the initial ph of all the samples blanks was adjusted to ph 3 0 with 1 m hcl and then purged with n2 to eliminate the co2 for at least one hour after that the sample was titrated to ph 10 0 by stepwise additions of a carbonate free 10 mm naoh solution under the n2 atmosphere to minimise the effects of co2 during the titration the n2 atmosphere during titration was maintained by feeding n2 gas to the glass beaker through the perforated lid and simultaneously purging the solution with n2 gas the ph value of the sample and the consuming naoh volume during stepwise additions were recorded the ph value of samples and feed solution was measured by a ph meter ph cond 3320 wtw germany with a ph sensor sentix 81 germany carboxylic acidity was defined as the milliequivalents of the naoh required to titrate the sample from ph 3 to 8 subtracting the blank titration and phenolic acidity was defined as twice the milliequivalents of the base to titrate from ph 8 to 10 the assumptions for these definitions are shown in si 2 4 the results of the measured acidity of carboxylic and phenolic groups of each om are shown in table s4 the polyelectrolyte titration is to estimate and compare the total charges of om 15 mgc l at neutral ph 7 5 to 8 5 with 10 mm nacl and 1 mm nahco3 these results can only provide the total charge of om solution at specific ph and ionic strength but cannot identify the sources of charge and the contributions of different negative charged functional groups or the electrostatic double layer to the total charges of om while the potentiometric titration is to quantify the negatively charged functional groups namely carboxylic groups and phenolic groups which only provide the amount of functional groups and the charge contributed by these functional groups but not the total charges both methods complement each other and provide insights into the relationship between om s charge functional groups and the stickiness 2 3 nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membrane characteristics a flat sheet commercial thin film composite tfc nf membrane nf270 and ro membrane bw30 filmtectm dupont water solutions co usa were selected to cover a wide range of dense membrane performance and surface properties table s6 shows the surface properties of both membranes relating to the adhesive interactions including pore size surface charge at ph 8 active layer polymer roughness and contact angle hydrophobicity nf270 membrane has a smoother more negatively charged and hydrophobic surface than bw30 membrane likely due to different active layer materials and structures nf270 has higher pure water permeability 12 16 l m2h bar than bw30 3 5 l m2h bar due to its large pore radius the extent of adhesive interaction of various om with these two membranes is expected to vary due to different membrane surface characteristics 2 4 bench scale crossflow nf ro system powered by solar array simulator a bench scale crossflow nf ro system powered by a solar array simulator sas 62050h 600s chroma ate usa performed filtration experiments with spontaneous osmotic backwash as reported previously cai et al 2022 the effective membrane area is 47 cm2 with the flow channel dimension of 19 cm in length 2 5 cm in width and 0 07 cm in height the sas simulated the one third power output of two pv panels low velocity power setting 100w 69v as the same setting from the previous study cai et al 2022 a chiller mc250 lauda brinkmann germany maintained a stable feed solution temperature of 25 1 c a bi directional liquid flow sensor sls 1500 sensirion switzerland was installed to monitor permeate flowrate and osmotic backwash performance cai et al 2022 the system s hydrodynamics were controlled by the opening of a pressure control valve pump engineering badger rc200 germany and the power from sas namely controlled solar irradiance fluctuations the opening of the control valve was fixed at 21 22 to achieve 10 0 5 bar operating pressure and 0 4 m s crossflow velocity at 800 w m2 solar irradiance set point condition such settings were chosen within a typical operation range 0 05 0 5 m s of spiral wound modules lau et al 2010 all components including pipe valves and crossflow filtration cell of the filtration system are made of stainless steel so the stiffness of the system components allows the high operating pressure up to 20 bar and handle the variation of the feed pressure and feed flow system damage leakage caused by the sudden and frequent change in applied pressure due to the solar irradiance fluctuation is unlikely as the research aim is to investigate the impact of om types on spontaneous ob cleaning efficiency the solar energy fluctuating conditions were identical for filtration experiments with different om feed solutions a typical controlled solar irradiance fluctuating condition was selected namely peak solar irradiance of 800 w m2 for one hour dropping to zero due to large cloud coverage for three minutes the corresponding applied pressure dropped from 10 0 5 bar to zero pump off such fluctuation induced a typical spontaneous ob cleaning process three minutes to investigate its cleaning efficiency for different om types cai et al 2022 the filtration experiments were performed in constant pressure mode 10 bar at 800 w m2 with permeate and concentrate circulating to the feed tank 2 5 filtration protocol and experimental design the detailed filtration protocol has been previously reported cai et al 2022 briefly each filtration experiment contains four steps i membrane pre conditioning soaking in 10 mm nacl for one hour ii membrane compaction at 10 bar using di water for one hour to achieve stable water flux iii three filtration cycles to ensure the reproducibility with the feedwater of choice and controlled solar irradiance fluctuation each cycle contains a one hour constant 10 bar filtration with three minutes of ob 800 w m2 0 and iv membrane coupon was taken off and the system was cleaned thoroughly with 1 mm naoh solution and plenty of tap water and di water at 60 l h feed flowrate for one hour a fresh membrane coupon was used for each experiment filtration experiments contain two batches the first used eleven om types without ca2 to investigate the impact of om types the adhesion variations via different hydrophobic interaction hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction on ob cleaning the second selected six representative om types from eleven om in the presence of ca2 adhesion enhancement via ionic bridging based on the results from the first batch experiments these six om fp ha aus ta sa and lps from the four different groups varying size hydrophobicity functional groups and fractions interact with calcium differently hence they were selected to verify the role of ca2 on adhesive interactions 2 6 adhesive interaction quantification via coupled ffff ocd an ffff system af2000 multiflow ffff postnova germany was connected to a uv vis spectrophotometer pn3212 postnova germany and then to an ocd model 9 doc labor germany in series see figure 2 to quantify the mass loss due to adhesive interaction as an indicator for the extent of adhesive interaction a polyester based spacer of nominal thickness of 500 µm was placed on the top of the membrane effective area 33 4 cm2 to create the channel the same nf270 and bw30 membranes were used in the ffff channel the ocd including a gräntzel thin film reactor and a non dispersive infrared detector was used to quantify the organic mass of various om types bypassing or from the ffff channel nguyen et al 2021 first om samples 15 mgc l with 10 mm nacl and 1 mm nahco3 injection volume 50 µl bypassed the ffff channel to obtain total organic carbon without a loss namely no adhesive interactions and permeation second the same om sample flowed through the ffff channel with nf ro membranes nf270 bw30 in three steps see table s5 and figure s3 i sample injection and focusing step for four min focus flowrate 3 3 ml min ii elution step i without focus flow for 25 min iii elution step ii without permeate flow for 14 min during the injection of the dom into the ffff channel a focus flow is also introduced to near the middle of channel a part of the focus flow meets the injection flow and forms a boundary where the om is focused into a band after this injection focusing step for 4 min the focus flow is stopped and the om begins to elute to the detector in figure 2 peak 1 during elution step i represents the om eluting over the membrane without interactions and peak 2 during elution step ii represents the reversible physical deposition of om due to the permeate flow permeate tractive force lastly the om mass loss percentage due to adhesive interactions between om and membrane m a s s l o s s a d h e s i o n indicating the extent of adhesive interaction hartmann and williams 2002 was calculated using eq 1 1 m a s s l o s s a d h e s i o n m b y p a s s m f f f f m p m b y p a s s 100 where m b y p a s s om mass bypassing ffff channel corresponding to total mass mgc m f f f f om mass mg after eluting through ffff channel mgc including non interaction om peak 1 and reversible om by permeation peak 2 m p om mass of ffff permeate mgc all were determined by ocd after optimising the flow conditions in the ffff system to maximise the adhesive interaction the permeate flowrate of 3 ml min and concentrate flowrate i e detector flowrate of 0 5 ml min were selected for the elution stages the optimisation process and results are shown in figure s2 with the detailed elution protocol presented in table s5 the mobile phase for ffff ocd was selected depending on the research aims with the characteristics of the mobile phase shown in table 1 due to the small volume 50 µl of the organic sample injected into the ffff channel the ca2 in the sample is not sufficient to verify the effect of ca2 on adhesive interaction thus the ca2 was added to the phosphate mobile phase 1 mm phosphate with 1 5 mm cacl2 to verify the role of ca2 on adhesive interaction the low ph 5 0 0 1 of this buffer was used to prevent calcium phosphate crystallisation the controlled mobile phase was the phosphate buffer with the same ph and ionic strength a similar approach to investigate the role of ca2 on organic fouling using ffff was previously reported hartmann and williams 2002 2 7 data and error analysis the parameters including flux decline represent the extent of fouling flux recovery and maximum ob flux represent the ob cleaning efficiency and suva254 indicating the aromaticity of each om type were calculated using the equations shown in table 2 the error estimation and analysis methods are presented in si section 5 in detail 3 results and discussion previous studies cai et al 2021 cai et al 2022 focused on the feasibility and mechanism of spontaneous ob on typical scaling and organic fouling control in directly coupled pv nf ro systems in this work the spontaneous ob cleaning efficiency was examined and correlated with the extent of adhesive interactions determined by coupled ffff ocd with these eleven om types then the om characteristics especially aromaticity hydrophobicity contributing to the adhesive interaction were discussed lastly the effect of ca2 ions on ob cleaning efficiency with six selected om types was examined with the role of calcium ions on adhesive interaction verified via ffff ocd 3 1 spontaneous osmotic backwash for various organic matter types different om types can cause different flux performance and spontaneous ob cleaning efficiency to investigate the impact of different om types the filtration experiments with spontaneous ob cleaning were conducted using eleven om feed solutions the normalised flux performance of eleven om types as a function of time is presented in figure s7 the summarised flux decline and flux recovery after ob cleaning as a function of om types are shown in figure 3 figure 3 shows different om types with nf270 causing a more significant variation of flux decline than bw30 under the same operating pressure 10 bar this can probably be attributed to higher cp and larger permeate tractive force with a higher initial flux of nf270 causing more deposition table s7 shows the estimated permeate tractive force for each om with these two membranes confirming a higher permeate tractive force with nf270 figure 3a and c show that humic substances especially ha and polyphenolic compounds especially ta caused more flux decline and less flux recovery after ob indicating irreversible fouling is induced by these om and ob may not be effective for these om types especially for ta 25 flux recovery with the nf270 membrane sa caused a 25 flux decline but 98 flux recovery after ob while ta and ha caused 9 11 flux decline and 20 80 flux recovery after ob indicating both ha and ta are stickier than sa more flux decline of sa is likely due to the reversible physical deposition of large sa molecules to verify this hypothesis coupled ffff ocd with eleven om types were carried out and the ocd signals bypassing and flowing through the ffff channel with nf270 membranes were monitored as a function of elution time as shown in figure 4 figure 4 shows a significant second peak from 35 to 50 min with sa compared to other om types implying sa s major fractions cause significant reversible physical deposition this observation substantiates why sa caused a higher flux decline 25 while it was almost 100 reversible with spontaneous ob see figure 3a and c ha had the smallest peak area among humic substances with ta having the smallest peak area among polyphenolic compounds implying both ha and ta had stronger adhesive interaction with nf270 than other om types this result appears to correlate with ha and ta s flux decline and ob cleaning performance figure 3 therefore the correlation between the extent of adhesive interaction between om and membrane and the ob cleaning efficiency is examined in the next section 3 2 correlation between adhesive interaction and osmotic backwash this section addresses the research question of whether stronger adhesive interaction namely more mass loss between om and membrane would weaken ob cleaning efficiency therefore flux decline flux recovery after ob and ob flux with eleven om types from the filtration experiments as a function of mass loss percentage of these om due to adhesive interaction obtained from coupled ffff ocd with nf270 and bw30 membranes are shown in figure 5 for bw30 membranes figure 5d shows an increasing trend in flux decline with mass loss due to adhesion figure 5e and f show a decreasing trend in spontaneous ob cleaning efficiency with mass loss this result confirms that stronger om membrane adhesive interaction would weaken ob cleaning interestingly for nf270 membranes figure 5a when the mass loss of om due to adhesive interaction ffff ocd was higher than a certain range 39 to 45 the flux decline started to be significant 9 indicating the increase of stickiness enhances organic fouling figure 5b and c show that when the mass loss of om was below this critical range the spontaneous ob was most effective 85 flux recovery with 40 l m2h ob flux above this range ob became ineffective 50 flux recovery with 25 l m2h ob flux these results indicate the existence of a critical adhesion range of om the adhesive forces between om and membrane are balanced with the thrust force imposed by spontaneous ob when this imposed force is larger than adhesive forces the spontaneous ob can lift up the om and achieve a higher cleaning efficiency but when it is smaller than the adhesive forces the ob is ineffective the results show that the critical adhesive interaction region causing significant flux decline and inhibiting the flux recovery was only observed with nf270 membranes but not with bw30 membranes this may attribute to the less significant flux decline in the case of bw30 membranes due to the lower permeate tractive force for each om under the same pressure compared to nf270 membranes this means the flux of bw30 for the om may be lower than the critical flux so that the critical adhesive interaction region is not observed therefore the operating pressure flux may play an important role in this adhesive interaction region polyphenolic compounds and humic substances rather than lmwo and biopolymers appear to induce stronger adhesive interactions with the nf270 membrane adversely affecting the ob cleaning therefore these sticky om types should be removed during pre treatment processes to mitigate irreversible organic fouling overall these results demonstrate the coupled ffff ocd is a suitable method for quantifying a wide range extent of adhesive interaction of different om types in the next section the om characteristics especially aromaticity contributing to the adhesive interaction are discussed 3 3 organic matter characteristics contributing to adhesive interaction this section aims to identify the main organic matter characteristics correlated with the adhesive interaction in the absence of multivalent cations polyphenolic compounds especially ta and humic substances especially ha caused stronger adhesive interactions than lmwo and biopolymers see figure 5 implying the adhesive interaction may be independent of the molecular size of om at neural ph 7 5 to 8 5 biopolymers e g sa and humic substances e g ha are more negatively charged than polyphenolic compounds e g ta and lmwo see polyelectrolyte titration results table s3 and thus these om types should cause very weak adhesive interactions with negatively charged nf ro membranes in the absence of calcium ions however ha had strong adhesive interaction with nf ro see figure 5 35 to 42 mass loss due to adhesion without calcium ions implying the total charge of humic substances may not directly correlate with the adhesive interaction ha may contain phenolic or polyphenolic compounds such as ta like compounds banach szott and debska 2008 de melo et al 2016 which potentially contribute to the adhesive interaction with membranes and subsequent organic fouling the potentiometric titration results table s4 show the highest phenolic group acidity of ta and the second highest phenolic group acidity of ha 50 of ta implying the phenolic groups play a role in adhesive interaction with membranes li et al 2019 ta and ha are more hydrophobic with higher suva254 than other om types see table s2 suggesting that aromaticity plays a role in adhesive interaction therefore the mass loss of eleven om types due to the adhesive interaction and the flux recovery after ob as a function of suva254 indicating the aromaticity of om are presented in figure 6 figure 6a and c show more mass loss due to adhesion of om to nf270 and bw30 with an increase of suva254 of om implying the om s aromaticity plays an important role in adhesive interaction between these om and polyamide membrane surface coronell et al 2008 figure 6b and d show that less flux recovery after ob with an increase of suva254 of om indicates the ob cleaning is not effective for the om with higher aromatic content such as ta and ha the high aromaticity of om adversely affects the ob cleaning efficiency likely due to the enhanced hydrophobic interaction li et al 2019 and hydrogen bonding li et al 2015 between aromatic om and aromatic membrane surface tannin was out of the correlation trend and had low flux recovery with low aromaticity indicating other om characteristics of tannin such as very weak negatively charge see table s2 may contribute more to the strong adhesion and weak ob cleaning efficiency 3 4 spontaneous osmotic backwash for various organic matter types with calcium calcium affects the ob cleaning efficiency for different om types and this section aims to investigate the impact of the calcium on the flux performance and ob cleaning efficiency based on previous results six om types fp ha aus ta sa lps were selected from different groups based on different interactions with calcium and consequently variable adhesive interactions with nf ro membranes the flux performance of nf270 and bw30 membranes with these selected om with and without calcium as a function of operating time is shown in figure 7 figure 7 shows that for humics such as ha polyphenolic compounds such as ta and biopolymers such as sa and lps the addition of ca2 resulted in more flux decline whereas for low molecular weight om such as fp ca2 did not enhance the flux decline 3 figure 7b c f and g show for ha and ta with ca2 the flux after ob cleaning was not recovered suggesting the ineffectiveness of spontaneous ob when the feedwater contains humic substances or polyphenolic compounds with ca2 for biopolymers with ca2 figure 7d and h the flux after ob was recovered to 75 95 implying a higher ob cleaning efficiency for biopolymers even with ca2 lee et al observed similar ob cleaning efficiency 80 for both ha and sa with 1 mm cacl2 which was due to higher feed salinity 0 5 m nacl and longer backwash duration 10 min lee et al 2021 nf270 membranes caused a more significant flux decline than that of bw30 with ca2 under the same operating pressure implying more open nf membranes nf270 induce more irreversible organic fouling than denser ro membranes bw30 with ca2 under the same operating pressure more cp and larger permeate tractive force of nf270 are the major contributors to more mechanical deposition of om ca complex and subsequent significant flux decline of nf270 membranes these results suggest more irreversible fouling and deteriorated ob cleaning efficiency with ca2 especially for humic substances and polyphenolic compounds one of the reasons is that ca2 enhances the adhesive interaction of these om biopolymers humics and polyphenolic compounds between om and membranes but not for lmwo therefore the next section aims to verify this hypothesis 3 5 verification of calcium enhanced adhesive interaction via ffff ocd this section aims to verify whether calcium enhances adhesive interaction between om and nf ro membranes and thus weakens the ob cleaning efficiency coupled ffff ocd quantified the mass loss of these six representative om types due to adhesive interaction in the presence of ca2 the mass loss of the six representative om types due to the adhesion using different mobile phases with and without ca2 ions in ffff ocd is shown in figure 8 figure 8a and b show that with the mobile phase containing ca2 the mass loss of humics and polyphenolic compounds and biopolymers due to adhesive integration increased in contrast the mass loss did not increase for lmwo such as fp this result suggests the ca2 indeed enhances the adhesive interaction of these om types including humic substance polyphenolic om and biopolymers to nf ro membranes but not for lmwo the potential mechanisms to explain the calcium enhanced adhesive interaction as shown in figure 8 based on literature are proposed i ca2 forms ionic bridges between negatively charged functional groups such as carboxylic groups or phenolic groups of humic acid polyphenolic compounds biopolymer and negatively charged nf ro membrane surface coronell et al 2008 yoon et al 1998 and ii the ca2 bridged organic complexes form a sticky layer on the membrane surface iskrenova tchoukova et al 2010 xin et al 2015 however ffff ocd cannot verify these mechanisms to understand which one is dominant requiring further investigations ca2 did not enhance the adhesion of lmwo such as fp to membranes more mass loss which is possibly due to i lower stickiness of ca lmwo complex and ii higher permeation of small ca lmwo complex it should be noted that the calculated mass loss of om shown in figure 8 is due to adhesive interaction and not the permeation the om types such as humics and polyphenolic compounds with more mass loss in presence of ca2 see figure 8a and b caused lower flux recovery after ob see figure 8c and d indicating calcium enhanced adhesive interaction weakens the ob cleaning efficiency overall these results demonstrate that calcium ions indeed enhance the adhesive interaction between some om types including humics polyphenol and biopolymers and membrane surface and such ca enhanced adhesion adversely affects the ob cleaning efficiency 4 conclusions this work investigated the underlying mechanism of eleven om types affecting spontaneous ob via correlating the ob cleaning efficiency from filtration experiments with the adhesive interaction of om types as determined by coupled ffff ocd the results show humic acid a typical humic substance and tannic acid a typical polyphenolic compound induced stronger adhesive interaction with nf ro membranes than biopolymers and low molecular weight om resulting in lower ob cleaning efficiency a critical adhesion range of om types was observed with nf270 membranes once the adhesion between om such as tannic acid and membrane exceeds this range the irreversible organic fouling potential increases and spontaneous ob becomes ineffective the dom fraction of biopolymers caused significant membrane flux decline 25 but higher ob cleaning efficiency 99 due to the reversible physical deposition polyphenolic compounds and humic substances with higher aromaticity such as tannic acid caused the lowest ob cleaning efficiency most likely due to the stronger adhesive interaction via enhanced hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding the ffff ocd results demonstrate i the coupled ffff ocd is a suitable method for quantifying the adhesive interaction between om and membranes indirectly and ii calcium ions indeed enhance the adhesive interaction of some om types such as humics polyphenolic compounds and biopolymers thereby weakening the ob cleaning efficiency this work brings several important implications to reduce organic fouling potential and improve the ob cleaning efficiency in directly coupled pv nf ro systems where it is important to i determine the stickiness of om in feedwater such as surface water and groundwater using coupled ffff ocd and possibly removing the sticky om using appropriate pre treatment processes such as ultrafiltration ii decrease water hardness calcium ions to reduce calcium enhanced adhesion and thus irreversible organic fouling potential this work would benefit from further verification and investigation of adhesive interaction mechanisms

15778,wastewater based epidemiology wbe was applied to evaluate seasonal variations of the consumption of pharmaceuticals i e antibiotics nsaids antiepileptics antihypertensives and others caffeine alcohol and nicotine in latvia throughout 2021 in addition weekly variation of caffeine nicotine and alcohol consumption was investigated pronounced seasonality was observed in the consumption of antibiotics and decongestants as well as caffeine nicotine and alcohol correlation with covid 19 statistics was observed in the case of macrolide antibiotics and antiasthmatic salbutamol comparison of the estimated consumption values obtained using the wbe approach and the statistics revealed that the majority of compounds data are in good agreement except angiotensin ii receptor blocker group antihypertensives where the most overestimated consumption values were observed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater based epidemiology caffeine alcohol nicotine 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid 1 introduction the analysis of wastewater in order to determine levels of various chemicals including pharmaceutically active substances illicit drugs persistent organic pollutants and other exogenous contaminants has been employed for decades the main objective of aforementioned analyses has mostly been to evaluate the overall wastewater treatment process to monitor contamination removal efficiencies and to assess wastewater effluent as a point source of environmental contamination during the last decade growing interest has been shown towards a new approach named wastewater based epidemiology wbe it is based on the analysis of specific human metabolic excretion products biomarkers in wastewater as indicators of consumption or population exposure to different substances by normalisation of analyte influent concentration to per capita mass loads using the daily flow and the size of the population within wastewater treatment plant wwtp catchment boundaries gracia lor et al 2017 despite being a relatively new scientific discipline wbe has rapidly revealed its potential to provide independent timely low cost resource and complementary epidemiologic information on the exposure and consumption of illicit and licit drugs pharmaceuticals and personal care products emerging environmental contaminants and diet markers at high spatial and temporal resolutions wbe offers the possibility of i estimating the amount of a target chemical or biological agent in the wastewater stream to provide qualitative or quantitative information on the total and mean population exposure to the substance of interest in a given sewer catchment ii observation of spatial or temporal trends or response to specific events within catchment iii direct comparisons between catchments of different population sizes and thus between sampling sites world wide boogaerts et al 2021a wbe has been widely used as a tool to provide real time information on consumption of legal and illegal drugs of abuse by the population boogaerts et al 2021a galani et al 2021 however wbe is feasible to achieve more ambitious objectives such as establishing exposure to certain agents pesticides personal care products persistent organic pollutants and pathogens as well as incidence of specific diseases diabetes allergies oxidative stress and cancer wbe has also been successfully applied for monitoring of infectious disease and sars cov 2 rna spread among the population sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 in a recent review about wbe as a tool for pharmaceutical use monitoring it has been identified that most studies are focused only on a period of 7 days or less and fewer than 10 pharmaceuticals are studied boogaerts et al 2021a in contrast to illicit drugs short term variations in pharmaceutical consumption are less expected since pharmaceutical treatment requires frequent dose intervals and fixed treatment schemes for this reason it is more useful and informative to monitor long term consumption patterns in the use of pharmaceuticals in order to compare consumption data between catchments of different population sizes and thus between sampling sites worldwide it is imperative to normalise measured concentrations for varying population sizes and flow rates several population normalisation strategies have been described in wbe studies hydrochemical parameters such as chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod total nitrogen n or total phosphorous p could be used for the estimation of population however these parameters do not specifically reflect human metabolism residues rather any biodegradable substance that enters into the sewer system daughton 2012 recently population normalisation approach using human metabolism biomarkers such as creatinine coprostanol cholesterol pharmaceuticals or food additives has been introduced systematic evaluation of eligibility of various previously suggested population biomarker candidates has revealed that cotinine and 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid 5 hiaa both have a good correlation with the census of population however neurotransmitter metabolite 5 hiaa may be more suitable for comparison of results obtained in different countries due to its endogenous origin chen et al 2014 in the present study wbe was used to determine seasonal changes in consumption levels of different pharmaceutical compounds during 2021 in addition three widely used psychoactive substances caffeine alcohol and nicotine were studied including both seasonal and weekly changes throughout weekdays during 2021 all the samples were collected from the wwtp of riga which is serving a population that represents the 37 of the total latvian population biomarkers of public health parent compounds and their metabolites as well as biomarkers of recreational drug use nicotine alcohol and caffeine were identified and quantified using 2d lc ms ms methodology the objective of the study was to investigate the drug use and lifestyle patterns and reveal the application of various treatments throughout 2021 in latvia by estimating the consumption of 57 pharmaceutically active compounds and 3 recreational drugs of interest and comparing the use patterns during the calendar period of 2021 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and materials hplc gradient grade methanol and ultrafree mc centrifugal

with approximate concentration of 1000 mg l 1 were prepared by weighing 10 mg of standard and dissolving in methanol the purity of the standard was considered in the calculation of final concentration the stock solutions were stored at 20 c two working solutions with appropriate concentrations for each compound were prepared for the spe and the dilute and shoot method respectively by diluting the appropriate volume of stock solution in methanol and stored at 4 c for the maximum period of six months 2 2 selection of analytes in total 60 compounds were selected for the present study the pharmaceutical substances were chosen based on the information available in the annual report by the state agency of medicines of the republic of latvia state agency of medicines 2021 the majority of them are also listed as essential medicines by the world health organization alcohol related marker ethyl sulphate nicotine biomarker cotinine and caffeine were selected as lifestyle biomarkers endogenous compound 5 hiaa was measured for normalisation of the measured concentrations of selected drugs for varying population sizes and flow rates 2 3 collection of samples sampling was conducted from december 2020 to december 2021 in a wwtp in riga latvia the capacity of this wwtp is 200 000 m3 day 1 and it serves 697 000 inhabitants the main input consists of wastewater from communal use while industrial use accounts for less than 15 of the input water each of the composite samples of influent ww was collected over a 24 h period by an automated sampler asp station 2000 vacuum system rps20 endress hauser usa by collecting a 200 ml aliquot at varying time intervals proportional to the instantaneous wastewater flow rate minimum subsampling frequency at the lowest inlet flow was 24 times per day sampling was conducted each week beginning on monday morning through tuesday morning during the whole sampling period resulting in a total of 51 composite samples in addition 29 grab samples were collected each weekday morning over a 6 week long period from june 29th to august 6th 2021 all samples were collected into 1 5 l polyethylene terephthalate bottles immediately frozen and stored at 20 c until analysis prior analysis an aliquot of sample was filtered through glass fibre filter using vacuum filtration 2 4 sample preparation and instrumental analysis samples were analysed within four weeks since the collection in order to avoid chemical degradation sample analysis was performed by applying the procedure described elsewhere pugajeva et al 2021 briefly sample preparation was performed by spe and dilute and shoot protocols instrumental analysis was carried out on a 2d hplc ms ms instrument in prm mode by scanning two ion transitions for each compound quantification was performed by multiple level procedural calibration on deionised water internal standards of salbutamol d3 and ibuprofen d3 were used in the reconstitution step in order to compensate for matrix effects during lc ms ms analyses multiple fortified wastewater samples were analysed within each batch to calculate recoveries and ensure quality control 2 5 consumption calculation one of the main challenges in wbe is the back calculation of drug use due to the existence of many parameters that must be considered population flow rates pharmacokinetic data in sewer and storage stability gracia lor et al 2017 in the present study the population biomarker approach was used in order to reduce the uncertainty of the estimation of the population size and daily wwtp flow rate chen et al 2014 all the values used for calculations are summarised in the supporting information table s1 consumption of selected drugs was calculated according to eq 1 1 consumption c marker c f e r hiaa c hiaa e f marker where consumption was measured in mg inh 1 day 1 except consumption of alcohol that was expressed in ml inh 1 day 1 by applying density factor of ethanol ρ 0 789 g ml 1 cmarker ng l 1 was the measured concentration of the biomarker in untreated wastewater chiaa ng l 1 was the measured concentration of 5 hiaa in untreated wastewater and cf was correction factor obtained considering molecular mass ration of parent drug and measured biomarker where applicable value of 4 16 mg inh 1 day 1 was used as the average daily excretion rate of 5 hiaa er hiaa chen et al 2014 ef is the excretion factor of the selected biomarker consumption of pharmaceuticals was calculated as illustrated by eq 2 in order to express drug consumption in defined daily doses ddd per 1000 inhabitants per day 2 consumptio n pharm consumption ddd 1000 eq 3 was applied to alcohol and nicotine consumption values in order to express the consumption to the population aged 15 years or older which is 84 1 of the total population in latvia 3 consumptio n 15 consumption 0 841 finally in order to perform comparison with other data sources alcohol consumption was translated into standard alcohol doses by dividing the obtained consumption value by alcohol content in a standard alcohol drink as reflected in eq 4 nicotine consumption was expressed in daily cigarette consumption by dividing the obtained consumption by the average nicotine intake per cigarette according to eq 5 boogaerts et al 2021b 4 consumptio n alcohol doses consumptio n alcohol 12 5 5 consumptio n cigarettes consumptio n nicotine 0 9 3 results and discussion 20 out of 60 tested compounds were not detected in any wastewater sample analysed during the present study among those compounds were gastric and ulcer medicaments pantoprazole and ranitidine and its metabolites antibacterial triclocarban antidepressants fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine and paroxetine rheumatoid arthritis medication sulfasalazine antithrombotic agent clopidogrel corticosteroid dexamethasone antispasmodic drotaverine antihyperlipidemic agents gemfibrozil pravastatin and simvastatin thyroid hormone levothyroxine uricostatic allopurinol and beta blocker propranolol the rest of the compounds were present in all of the samples at quantifiable levels the summary of the concentrations is available in the supporting information table s2 the obtained concentrations were used for further consumption calculations 5 hiaa was not quantifiable in two of the analysed samples those two samples were excluded from the data set 3 1 consumption estimation seasonal and yearly average consumption values as well as reported consumption statistics are summarised in table 1 as can it be observed from the results in some cases calculated consumption values are significantly higher than reported in the statistics the most overestimated consumption values were obtained for macrolides erythromycin and azithromycin sulphanilamide group antibiotic trimethoprim and nsaids diclofenac indomethacin and ketoprofen consumption of antihypertensive drugs representing angiotensin ii receptor blockers and ace inhibitor ramipril were also overestimated however the consumption of beta blocker antihypertensives were in good agreement with the statistics in the case of antidepressant venlafaxine significant overestimation occurred when consumption was calculated using the parent compound however the consumption of venlafaxine was less overestimated when metabolite o desmethyl venlafaxine was used as a biomarker the observed high frequency of consumption overestimation might be due to several reasons the excretion factor has one of the most noteworthy contributions in both overestimates and underestimates of consumption in order to obtain accurate estimates of pharmaceutical and psychotropic drug consumption by wbe the excretion factors of parent compounds or their metabolites are essential this important parameter is often obtained from a small number of human pharmacokinetic studies usually involving small numbers of subjects bruno et al 2014 attempts have been made towards refining excretion factors for illicit drugs such as codeine methadone and ketamine du et al 2020 however for the majority of pharmaceuticals excretion factors still rely solely on pharmacokinetic data lack of necessary information as well as wide variety of different values have been observed in the literature this problem has already been identified in the study of excretion factors applied for ketamine consumption estimation du et al 2020 in the study it was revealed that using excretion factors obtained from pharmacokinetic data lead to overestimation of ketamine consumption this might be due to different administration routes and doses as well as differences between individuals in the pharmacokinetic studies another important factor in consumption estimation is formation and deconjugation of glucuronides it was observed that for compounds that undergo glucuronidation during metabolism the total excretion factor of unchanged drug and its glucuronides should be used for consumption estimation this is due to the cleavage of glucuronide metabolites in the wwtp tanks in the presence of biofilm gao et al 2017 for example in case of carbamazepine the excretion factor of unchanged drug is about 1 but for carbamazepine n glucuronide it is 11 bahlmann et al 2014 this would result in 10 fold overestimation of carbamazepine consumption if only excretion of unchanged drug would be taken into account this assumption is approved by several studies bahlmann et al 2014 du et al 2020 furthermore the consumption of carbamazepine estimated by using parent compound and its glucuronides is in good agreement with that obtained by using carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide as carbamazepine consumption biomarker indicating that glucuronides should be taken into account therefore summary excretion factors of the biomarker and its glucuronide were used for calculations where possible see supporting information unfortunately for some compounds for example losartan there was no information available regarding glucuronide excretion factor as can be seen in table 1 this results in a drastic overestimation finally it should be noted that since for the majority of pharmaceuticals parent compound was used as their biomarker routes of entry other than human excretion are possible among those is inappropriate utilisation of unused drugs as well as influent of hospital wastewaters furthermore medications designed for topical use such as gels creams lotions sprays and others are efficiently discharged to sewers as a result of their intended use via bathing or washing these factors might result in elevated concentrations in wastewaters and consequently overestimation of consumption this is clearly observed in the case of diclofenac which is widely used in the form of topical gel consequently the estimated diclofenac consumption by using the wbe approach results in 5 fold overestimation compared to the statistics state agency of medicines 2021 3 2 seasonal variation of pharmaceuticals graphical depiction of seasonal variations of monthly consumption among four main drug classes included in the study is shown in fig 1 all individual graphs are included in the supporting information file 3 2 1 antibiotics significantly lower p value 0 05 antibiotic consumption was observed during summer months compared to the rest of the year the same trend has been observed by other authors golovko et al 2014 the observed trend is in accordance with antibiotic use in the treatment of respiratory tract infections which are most common in autumn winter and early spring moreover macrolide group antibiotics namely azithromycin and clarithromycin have shown efficacy in the improvement of early covid 19 symptoms rashad et al 2021 significant positive correlation was observed between the consumption data and 14 day cumulative infection rate 0 69 p value 0 05 for azithromycin and 0 93 p value 0 05 for clarithromycin vraa 2021 the same observation has been made by other authors perkons et al 2022 in the case of other antibiotics no correlation with covid 19 cases was observed 3 2 2 non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs the most significant contribution in the total nsaid consumption was observed from ibuprofen 26 4ddd 1000 inh 1 day 1 and diclofenac 87 0 ddd 1000 inh 1 day 1 which are the two most consumed nsaids according to the statistics state agency of medicines 2021 a slight increase in the total consumption of nsaids was observed in spring and summer the increase coincides with the rise of air temperatures and change of overall weather conditions in latvia as well as school holidays consequently more outdoor physical activities take place and risks of injuries increase nsaids are mainly used to treat minor injuries and inflammations therefore data are in good agreement similar results have been observed by other authors boogaerts et al 2021a 3 2 3 antiepileptics consumption of antiepileptic agents was relatively constant throughout the year as expected a slight increase was observed in spring and summer consistent with findings of a study of epileptic seizure seasonality procopio et al 2006 interesting trend was observed for oxcarbazepine the notable increase in consumption began in june reaching the maximum in october this observation needs further investigation however possible explanation may be the replacement of other antiepileptic agents with oxcarbazepine 3 2 4 antihypertensives three types of antihypertensive agents were included in the study ace inhibitors angiotensin ii receptor blockers and beta blockers all three groups showed similar trends contrary to the worldwide observed trend of higher antihypertensive agent consumption during the colder months of the year in our study a slight increase occurred in may and june this was true for all of the compounds selected for the study except for valsartan a moderate correlation between the consumption of antihistamines and antihypertensives has been found bodík et al 2021 since most allergic occurrences happen in spring this could cause an increase in the consumption of antihypertensives as well however this finding needs further investigation 3 2 5 others very pronounced trend was observed for antiasthmatic agent salbutamol average consumption determined in autumn was significantly higher p value 0 05 than in rest of the months 0 90 and 0 45 ddd 1000 inh 1 day 1 respectively the peak in salbutamol consumption coincides with the second wave of covid 19 when the highest hospitalisation rate in latvia occurred there have been indications that salbutamol is used for covid 19 induced respiratory complications elbeddini et al 2020 seasonality in consumption was observed in the case of decongestant xylomethozaline average consumption during spring and summer was lower than during autumn and winter 6 1 and 8 4 ddd 1000 inh 1 day 1 respectively p value 0 05 decongestants are used as short term relief of nasal congestion that typically occurs in colder months 3 3 consumption of psychoactive drugs 3 3 1 alcohol alcohol consumption was estimated by measuring concentrations of ethyl sulphate direct ethanol metabolite the obtained average consumption was 37 4 ml inh15 1 day 1 3 0 doses inh15 1 day 1 or 13 7 l inh15 1 year 1 the obtained value is slightly higher than reported alcohol consumption in latvia in 2020 12 6 l inh15 1 year 1 spkc 2021 the results may indicate either alcohol consumption among inhabitants younger than 15 years old use of illegal alcohol or increase of alcohol consumption since 2020 overall it can be concluded that data obtained by wbe using ethyl sulphate as alcohol biomarker are in good agreement with statistically estimated consumption consumption obtained in latvia is higher than obtained by wbe in spain belgium and china 18 15 3 and 7 5 ml inh15 1 day 1 respectively more similar value was obtained in the usa 29 4 ml inh15 1 day 1 gao et al 2020 values obtained in a recent wbe study done in lithuania are very similar to our results ranging from 1 7 to 7 4 doses inh15 1 day 1 boogaerts et al 2021b seasonal and weekly variations of alcohol consumption are shown in fig 2 the highest average values were observed in december may and june 38 6 42 9 and 37 2 ml inh 1 day 1 respectively these observations are in accordance with previously described increase in alcohol consumption during holiday periods uitenbroek 1996 elevated value in december is most likely due to christmas and new year holidays the peak in alcohol consumption in may and june could be a result of increased air temperatures and improved overall weather conditions that lead to more outdoor gatherings where alcohol is consumed furthermore the most popular latvian festival celebrating the summer solstice is on the 23rd of june consumption of beer is one of the traditions of this celebration a significant difference p value 0 05 was observed between monday and other weekdays the average consumption value determined in the samples collected on monday was 29 4 ml inh 1 day 1 whereas on the other days 17 3 to 23 2 ml inh 1 day 1 ethyl sulphate excretion in urine reaches the maximum in 5 h after alcohol intake total detection time might be up to 48 h or even longer if higher amounts of alcohol are consumed helander and beck 2008 furthermore it is important to take into account the travel time of the sewage from households to the wwtp that can range up to 14 hours in the studied catchment area since the sampling was done in the morning ethyl sulphate concentrations in the samples represent the alcohol intake in a day before sampling therefore the observed increase in alcohol consumption is in good agreement with the fact that more alcohol is consumed during the weekend the same observation has been made by other authors lai et al 2018 and driver et al 2020 3 3 2 caffeine consumption of caffeine was estimated by measuring the excreted parent compound caffeine the average calculated caffeine consumption throughout 2021 in latvia was 501 mg inh 1 day 1 the obtained value is 76 higher than estimated caffeine consumption in latvia in 2013 285 mg per day per inhabitant aged 18 50 skds 2013 it is also higher than the reported average intake 227 mg of european and north american adults in 2011 persad 2011 however it has been shown that caffeine consumption is higher in northern countries for instance in scandinavian countries caffeine consumption as high as 400 mg inh 1 day 1 has been reported samsonsen et al 2013 the observed overestimation is most likely due to sources of caffeine other than human metabolism according to united states environmental protection agency us epa caffeine in domestic wastewater may be as a result of unconsumed coffee tea or soft drinks disposed down household drains which may contribute to elevated concentrations of caffeine edwards et al 2015 other caffeine metabolites such as paraxanthine should be used in order to perform a more accurate caffeine consumption estimation seasonal and weekly consumption trends of caffeine are shown in fig 2 the highest average caffeine intake was observed in february and march it corresponds to the fact that more hot caffeine containing beverages are consumed in colder weather other authors have observed similar trends rossato et al 2015 no pronounced trends were noticed in caffeine consumption throughout weekdays non significant p value 0 05 decrease took place on monday indicating lower consumption of caffeinated beverages on the weekend that is in good agreement with other authors observation driver et al 2020 3 3 3 nicotine consumption of nicotine was estimated by using its metabolite cotinine as a biomarker the average calculated nicotine consumption in 2021 was 5 9 mg inh15 1 day 1 or 6 6 cig inh15 1 day 1 for comparison purposes nicotine consumption expressed to whole population was calculated as well 5 3 mg inh 1 day 1 other authors have obtained nicotine consumption values ranging from 0 5 to 12 9 mg inh 1 day 1 by using the wbe approach gao et al 2020 the obtained value of 6 6 cig inh15 1 day 1 was within the range of 3 5 to 10 6 cig inh15 1 day 1 that was obtained in lithuania in 2019 boogaerts et al 2021b accurate nicotine consumption data in latvia is not available however taking into account the percentage of daily smokers in latvia in 2019 22 1 eurostat 2021 and the average daily intake of nicotine per smoker 25 mg day 1 fagerström 2005 it can be calculated that the average nicotine consumption in latvia is 5 5 mg inh 1 day 1 consequently it can be concluded that nicotine consumption estimated by the wbe approach is in good agreement with statistics the slightly elevated consumption could originate from increased use of alternative nicotine containing products such as various electronic cigarettes and smokeless tobacco pouches that have recently gained popularity in europe and latvia seasonal and weekly variations are shown in fig 2 as can be seen a significant increase p value 0 05 in nicotine consumption occurs in may june and july as mentioned in section 3 3 1 during these months the air temperature in latvia raises and more outdoor gatherings take place there is research that shows the positive correlation between alcohol consumption and occasional smoking occurrence nichter et al 2010 regarding weekly trends nicotine consumption was consistent throughout weekdays 4 conclusions the results of this study illustrate the applicability of wbe to evaluate pharmaceutical and psychoactive substance use at the population level while wbe has been widely adopted by scientific society and well established for the measurement of illicit drugs its application for the measurement of pharmaceuticals has been more limited furthermore a gap in knowledge has been identified regarding the seasonality of pharmaceutical consumption significant seasonal variations were observed in the consumption of antibiotics and decongestant xylomethozaline as well as caffeine nicotine and alcohol a pronounced increase of antiasthmatic agent salbutamol has been observed in the autumn of 2021 that coincides with the highest hospitalisation rate of covid 19 patients a significant correlation was found between macrolide antibiotic azithromycin and clarithromycin consumption and covid 19 14 day cumulative infection rate caffeine and nicotine consumption was relatively constant throughout five weekdays while alcohol consumption estimation indicated the elevated use throughout the weekends comparison of estimated consumption values and the statistics revealed discrepancies that indicate the current limitations of the wbe approach lack of accurate excretion data leads to the overestimation of consumption that was most pronounced in the case of angiotensin ii receptor blocker group antihypertensives it was found out that the application of the parent compound as a biomarker was not suitable for consumption estimation of caffeine and diclofenac alcohol and nicotine consumption estimations were in good agreement

15778,wastewater based epidemiology wbe was applied to evaluate seasonal variations of the consumption of pharmaceuticals i e antibiotics nsaids antiepileptics antihypertensives and others caffeine alcohol and nicotine in latvia throughout 2021 in addition weekly variation of caffeine nicotine and alcohol consumption was investigated pronounced seasonality was observed in the consumption of antibiotics and decongestants as well as caffeine nicotine and alcohol correlation with covid 19 statistics was observed in the case of macrolide antibiotics and antiasthmatic salbutamol comparison of the estimated consumption values obtained using the wbe approach and the statistics revealed that the majority of compounds data are in good agreement except angiotensin ii receptor blocker group antihypertensives where the most overestimated consumption values were observed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater based epidemiology caffeine alcohol nicotine 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid 1 introduction the analysis of wastewater in order to determine levels of various chemicals including pharmaceutically active substances illicit drugs persistent organic pollutants and other exogenous contaminants has been employed for decades the main objective of aforementioned analyses has mostly been to evaluate the overall wastewater treatment process to monitor contamination removal efficiencies and to assess wastewater effluent as a point source of environmental contamination during the last decade growing interest has been shown towards a new approach named wastewater based epidemiology wbe it is based on the analysis of specific human metabolic excretion products biomarkers in wastewater as indicators of consumption or population exposure to different substances by normalisation of analyte influent concentration to per capita mass loads using the daily flow and the size of the population within wastewater treatment plant wwtp catchment boundaries gracia lor et al 2017 despite being a relatively new scientific discipline wbe has rapidly revealed its potential to provide independent timely low cost resource and complementary epidemiologic information on the exposure and consumption of illicit and licit drugs pharmaceuticals and personal care products emerging environmental contaminants and diet markers at high spatial and temporal resolutions wbe offers the possibility of i estimating the amount of a target chemical or biological agent in the wastewater stream to provide qualitative or quantitative information on the total and mean population exposure to the substance of interest in a given sewer catchment ii observation of spatial or temporal trends or response to specific events within catchment iii direct comparisons between catchments of different population sizes and thus between sampling sites world wide boogaerts et al 2021a wbe has been widely used as a tool to provide real time information on consumption of legal and illegal drugs of abuse by the population boogaerts et al 2021a galani et al 2021 however wbe is feasible to achieve more ambitious objectives such as establishing exposure to certain agents pesticides personal care products persistent organic pollutants and pathogens as well as incidence of specific diseases diabetes allergies oxidative stress and cancer wbe has also been successfully applied for monitoring of infectious disease and sars cov 2 rna spread among the population sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 in a recent review about wbe as a tool for pharmaceutical use monitoring it has been identified that most studies are focused only on a period of 7 days or less and fewer than 10 pharmaceuticals are studied boogaerts et al 2021a in contrast to illicit drugs short term variations in pharmaceutical consumption are less expected since pharmaceutical treatment requires frequent dose intervals and fixed treatment schemes for this reason it is more useful and informative to monitor long term consumption patterns in the use of pharmaceuticals in order to compare consumption data between catchments of different population sizes and thus between sampling sites worldwide it is imperative to normalise measured concentrations for varying population sizes and flow rates several population normalisation strategies have been described in wbe studies hydrochemical parameters such as chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod total nitrogen n or total phosphorous p could be used for the estimation of population however these parameters do not specifically reflect human metabolism residues rather any biodegradable substance that enters into the sewer system daughton 2012 recently population normalisation approach using human metabolism biomarkers such as creatinine coprostanol cholesterol pharmaceuticals or food additives has been introduced systematic evaluation of eligibility of various previously suggested population biomarker candidates has revealed that cotinine and 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid 5 hiaa both have a good correlation with the census of population however neurotransmitter metabolite 5 hiaa may be more suitable for comparison of results obtained in different countries due to its endogenous origin chen et al 2014 in the present study wbe was used to determine seasonal changes in consumption levels of different pharmaceutical compounds during 2021 in addition three widely used psychoactive substances caffeine alcohol and nicotine were studied including both seasonal and weekly changes throughout weekdays during 2021 all the samples were collected from the wwtp of riga which is serving a population that represents the 37 of the total latvian population biomarkers of public health parent compounds and their metabolites as well as biomarkers of recreational drug use nicotine alcohol and caffeine were identified and quantified using 2d lc ms ms methodology the objective of the study was to investigate the drug use and lifestyle patterns and reveal the application of various treatments throughout 2021 in latvia by estimating the consumption of 57 pharmaceutically active compounds and 3 recreational drugs of interest and comparing the use patterns during the calendar period of 2021 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and materials hplc gradient grade methanol and ultrafree mc centrifugal

water purification system all analytical standards used within this study were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa fluka buchs switzerland or lgc standards lomianki poland stock solutions with approximate concentration of 1000 mg l 1 were prepared by weighing 10 mg of standard and dissolving in methanol the purity of the standard was considered in the calculation of final concentration the stock solutions were stored at 20 c two working solutions with appropriate concentrations for each compound were prepared for the spe and the dilute and shoot method respectively by diluting the appropriate volume of stock solution in methanol and stored at 4 c for the maximum period of six months 2 2 selection of analytes in total 60 compounds were selected for the present study the pharmaceutical substances were chosen based on the information available in the annual report by the state agency of medicines of the republic of latvia state agency of medicines 2021 the majority of them are also listed as essential medicines by the world health organization alcohol related marker ethyl sulphate nicotine biomarker cotinine and caffeine were selected as lifestyle biomarkers endogenous compound 5 hiaa was measured for normalisation of the measured concentrations of selected drugs for varying population sizes and flow rates 2 3 collection of samples sampling was conducted from december 2020 to december 2021 in a wwtp in riga latvia the capacity of this wwtp is 200 000 m3 day 1 and it serves 697 000 inhabitants the main input consists of wastewater from communal use while industrial use accounts for less than 15 of the input water each of the composite samples of influent ww was collected over a 24 h period by an automated sampler asp station 2000 vacuum system rps20 endress hauser usa by collecting a 200 ml aliquot at varying time intervals proportional to the instantaneous wastewater flow rate minimum subsampling frequency at the lowest inlet flow was 24 times per day sampling was conducted each week beginning on monday morning through tuesday morning during the whole sampling period resulting in a total of 51 composite samples in addition 29 grab samples were collected each weekday morning over a 6 week long period from june 29th to august 6th 2021 all samples were collected into 1 5 l polyethylene terephthalate bottles immediately frozen and stored at 20 c until analysis prior analysis an aliquot of sample was filtered through glass fibre filter using vacuum filtration 2 4 sample preparation and instrumental analysis samples were analysed within four weeks since the collection in order to avoid chemical degradation sample analysis was performed by applying the procedure described elsewhere pugajeva et al 2021 briefly sample preparation was performed by spe and dilute and shoot protocols instrumental analysis was carried out on a 2d hplc ms ms instrument in prm mode by scanning two ion transitions for each compound quantification was performed by multiple level procedural calibration on deionised water internal standards of salbutamol d3 and ibuprofen d3 were used in the reconstitution step in order to compensate for matrix effects during lc ms ms analyses multiple fortified wastewater samples were analysed within each batch to calculate recoveries and ensure quality control 2 5 consumption calculation one of the main challenges in wbe is the back calculation of drug use due to the existence of many parameters that must be considered population flow rates pharmacokinetic data in sewer and storage stability gracia lor et al 2017 in the present study the population biomarker approach was used in order to reduce the uncertainty of the estimation of the population size and daily wwtp flow rate chen et al 2014 all the values used for calculations are summarised in the supporting information table s1 consumption of selected drugs was calculated according to eq 1 1 consumption c marker c f e r hiaa c hiaa e f marker where consumption was measured in mg inh 1 day 1 except consumption of alcohol that was expressed in ml inh 1 day 1 by applying density factor of ethanol ρ 0 789 g ml 1 cmarker ng l 1 was the measured concentration of the biomarker in untreated wastewater chiaa ng l 1 was the measured concentration of 5 hiaa in untreated wastewater and cf was correction factor obtained considering molecular mass ration of parent drug and measured biomarker where applicable value of 4 16 mg inh 1 day 1 was used as the average daily excretion rate of 5 hiaa er hiaa chen et al 2014 ef is the excretion factor of the selected biomarker consumption of pharmaceuticals was calculated as illustrated by eq 2 in order to express drug consumption in defined daily doses ddd per 1000 inhabitants per day 2 consumptio n pharm consumption ddd 1000 eq 3 was applied to alcohol and nicotine consumption values in order to express the consumption to the population aged 15 years or older which is 84 1 of the total population in latvia 3 consumptio n 15 consumption 0 841 finally in order to perform comparison with other data sources alcohol consumption was translated into standard alcohol doses by dividing the obtained consumption value by alcohol content in a standard alcohol drink as reflected in eq 4 nicotine consumption was expressed in daily cigarette consumption by dividing the obtained consumption by the average nicotine intake per cigarette according to eq 5 boogaerts et al 2021b 4 consumptio n alcohol doses consumptio n alcohol 12 5 5 consumptio n cigarettes consumptio n nicotine 0 9 3 results and discussion 20 out of 60 tested compounds were not detected in any wastewater sample analysed during the present study among those compounds were gastric and ulcer medicaments pantoprazole and ranitidine and its metabolites antibacterial triclocarban antidepressants fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine and paroxetine rheumatoid arthritis medication sulfasalazine antithrombotic agent clopidogrel corticosteroid dexamethasone antispasmodic drotaverine antihyperlipidemic agents gemfibrozil pravastatin and simvastatin thyroid hormone levothyroxine uricostatic allopurinol and beta blocker propranolol the rest of the compounds were present in all of the samples at quantifiable levels the summary of the concentrations is available in the supporting information table s2 the obtained concentrations were used for further consumption calculations 5 hiaa was not quantifiable in two of the analysed samples those two samples were excluded from the data set 3 1 consumption estimation seasonal and yearly average consumption values as well as reported consumption statistics are summarised in table 1 as can it be observed from the results in some cases calculated consumption values are significantly higher than reported in the statistics the most overestimated consumption values were obtained for macrolides erythromycin and azithromycin sulphanilamide group antibiotic trimethoprim and nsaids diclofenac indomethacin and ketoprofen consumption of antihypertensive drugs representing angiotensin ii receptor blockers and ace inhibitor ramipril were also overestimated however the consumption of beta blocker antihypertensives were in good agreement with the statistics in the case of antidepressant venlafaxine significant overestimation occurred when consumption was calculated using the parent compound however the consumption of venlafaxine was less overestimated when metabolite o desmethyl venlafaxine was used as a biomarker the observed high frequency of consumption overestimation might be due to several reasons the excretion factor has one of the most noteworthy contributions in both overestimates and underestimates of consumption in order to obtain accurate estimates of pharmaceutical and psychotropic drug consumption by wbe the excretion factors of parent compounds or their metabolites are essential this important parameter is often obtained from a small number of human pharmacokinetic studies usually involving small numbers of subjects bruno et al 2014 attempts have been made towards refining excretion factors for illicit drugs such as codeine methadone and ketamine du et al 2020 however for the majority of pharmaceuticals excretion factors still rely solely on pharmacokinetic data lack of necessary information as well as wide variety of different values have been observed in the literature this problem has already been identified in the study of excretion factors applied for ketamine consumption estimation du et al 2020 in the study it was revealed that using excretion factors obtained from pharmacokinetic data lead to overestimation of ketamine consumption this might be due to different administration routes and doses as well as differences between individuals in the pharmacokinetic studies another important factor in consumption estimation is formation and deconjugation of glucuronides it was observed that for compounds that undergo glucuronidation during metabolism the total excretion factor of unchanged drug and its glucuronides should be used for consumption estimation this is due to the cleavage of glucuronide metabolites in the wwtp tanks in the presence of biofilm gao et al 2017 for example in case of carbamazepine the excretion factor of unchanged drug is about 1 but for carbamazepine n glucuronide it is 11 bahlmann et al 2014 this would result in 10 fold overestimation of carbamazepine consumption if only excretion of unchanged drug would be taken into account this assumption is approved by several studies bahlmann et al 2014 du et al 2020 furthermore the consumption of carbamazepine estimated by using parent compound and its glucuronides is in good agreement with that obtained by using carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide as carbamazepine consumption biomarker indicating that glucuronides should be taken into account therefore summary excretion factors of the biomarker and its glucuronide were used for calculations where possible see supporting information unfortunately for some compounds for example losartan there was no information available regarding glucuronide excretion factor as can be seen in table 1 this results in a drastic overestimation finally it should be noted that since for the majority of pharmaceuticals parent compound was used as their biomarker routes of entry other than human excretion are possible among those is inappropriate utilisation of unused drugs as well as influent of hospital wastewaters furthermore medications designed for topical use such as gels creams lotions sprays and others are efficiently discharged to sewers as a result of their intended use via bathing or washing these factors might result in elevated concentrations in wastewaters and consequently overestimation of consumption this is clearly observed in the case of diclofenac which is widely used in the form of topical gel consequently the estimated diclofenac consumption by using the wbe approach results in 5 fold overestimation compared to the statistics state agency of medicines 2021 3 2 seasonal variation of pharmaceuticals graphical depiction of seasonal variations of monthly consumption among four main drug classes included in the study is shown in fig 1 all individual graphs are included in the supporting information file 3 2 1 antibiotics significantly lower p value 0 05 antibiotic consumption was observed during summer months compared to the rest of the year the same trend has been observed by other authors golovko et al 2014 the observed trend is in accordance with antibiotic use in the treatment of respiratory tract infections which are most common in autumn winter and early spring moreover macrolide group antibiotics namely azithromycin and clarithromycin have shown efficacy in the improvement of early covid 19 symptoms rashad et al 2021 significant positive correlation was observed between the consumption data and 14 day cumulative infection rate 0 69 p value 0 05 for azithromycin and 0 93 p value 0 05 for clarithromycin vraa 2021 the same observation has been made by other authors perkons et al 2022 in the case of other antibiotics no correlation with covid 19 cases was observed 3 2 2 non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs the most significant contribution in the total nsaid consumption was observed from ibuprofen 26 4ddd 1000 inh 1 day 1 and diclofenac 87 0 ddd 1000 inh 1 day 1 which are the two most consumed nsaids according to the statistics state agency of medicines 2021 a slight increase in the total consumption of nsaids was observed in spring and summer the increase coincides with the rise of air temperatures and change of overall weather conditions in latvia as well as school holidays consequently more outdoor physical activities take place and risks of injuries increase nsaids are mainly used to treat minor injuries and inflammations therefore data are in good agreement similar results have been observed by other authors boogaerts et al 2021a 3 2 3 antiepileptics consumption of antiepileptic agents was relatively constant throughout the year as expected a slight increase was observed in spring and summer consistent with findings of a study of epileptic seizure seasonality procopio et al 2006 interesting trend was observed for oxcarbazepine the notable increase in consumption began in june reaching the maximum in october this observation needs further investigation however possible explanation may be the replacement of other antiepileptic agents with oxcarbazepine 3 2 4 antihypertensives three types of antihypertensive agents were included in the study ace inhibitors angiotensin ii receptor blockers and beta blockers all three groups showed similar trends contrary to the worldwide observed trend of higher antihypertensive agent consumption during the colder months of the year in our study a slight increase occurred in may and june this was true for all of the compounds selected for the study except for valsartan a moderate correlation between the consumption of antihistamines and antihypertensives has been found bodík et al 2021 since most allergic occurrences happen in spring this could cause an increase in the consumption of antihypertensives as well however this finding needs further investigation 3 2 5 others very pronounced trend was observed for antiasthmatic agent salbutamol average consumption determined in autumn was significantly higher p value 0 05 than in rest of the months 0 90 and 0 45 ddd 1000 inh 1 day 1 respectively the peak in salbutamol consumption coincides with the second wave of covid 19 when the highest hospitalisation rate in latvia occurred there have been indications that salbutamol is used for covid 19 induced respiratory complications elbeddini et al 2020 seasonality in consumption was observed in the case of decongestant xylomethozaline average consumption during spring and summer was lower than during autumn and winter 6 1 and 8 4 ddd 1000 inh 1 day 1 respectively p value 0 05 decongestants are used as short term relief of nasal congestion that typically occurs in colder months 3 3 consumption of psychoactive drugs 3 3 1 alcohol alcohol consumption was estimated by measuring concentrations of ethyl sulphate direct ethanol metabolite the obtained average consumption was 37 4 ml inh15 1 day 1 3 0 doses inh15 1 day 1 or 13 7 l inh15 1 year 1 the obtained value is slightly higher than reported alcohol consumption in latvia in 2020 12 6 l inh15 1 year 1 spkc 2021 the results may indicate either alcohol consumption among inhabitants younger than 15 years old use of illegal alcohol or increase of alcohol consumption since 2020 overall it can be concluded that data obtained by wbe using ethyl sulphate as alcohol biomarker are in good agreement with statistically estimated consumption consumption obtained in latvia is higher than obtained by wbe in spain belgium and china 18 15 3 and 7 5 ml inh15 1 day 1 respectively more similar value was obtained in the usa 29 4 ml inh15 1 day 1 gao et al 2020 values obtained in a recent wbe study done in lithuania are very similar to our results ranging from 1 7 to 7 4 doses inh15 1 day 1 boogaerts et al 2021b seasonal and weekly variations of alcohol consumption are shown in fig 2 the highest average values were observed in december may and june 38 6 42 9 and 37 2 ml inh 1 day 1 respectively these observations are in accordance with previously described increase in alcohol consumption during holiday periods uitenbroek 1996 elevated value in december is most likely due to christmas and new year holidays the peak in alcohol consumption in may and june could be a result of increased air temperatures and improved overall weather conditions that lead to more outdoor gatherings where alcohol is consumed furthermore the most popular latvian festival celebrating the summer solstice is on the 23rd of june consumption of beer is one of the traditions of this celebration a significant difference p value 0 05 was observed between monday and other weekdays the average consumption value determined in the samples collected on monday was 29 4 ml inh 1 day 1 whereas on the other days 17 3 to 23 2 ml inh 1 day 1 ethyl sulphate excretion in urine reaches the maximum in 5 h after alcohol intake total detection time might be up to 48 h or even longer if higher amounts of alcohol are consumed helander and beck 2008 furthermore it is important to take into account the travel time of the sewage from households to the wwtp that can range up to 14 hours in the studied catchment area since the sampling was done in the morning ethyl sulphate concentrations in the samples represent the alcohol intake in a day before sampling therefore the observed increase in alcohol consumption is in good agreement with the fact that more alcohol is consumed during the weekend the same observation has been made by other authors lai et al 2018 and driver et al 2020 3 3 2 caffeine consumption of caffeine was estimated by measuring the excreted parent compound caffeine the average calculated caffeine consumption throughout 2021 in latvia was 501 mg inh 1 day 1 the obtained value is 76 higher than estimated caffeine consumption in latvia in 2013 285 mg per day per inhabitant aged 18 50 skds 2013 it is also higher than the reported average intake 227 mg of european and north american adults in 2011 persad 2011 however it has been shown that caffeine consumption is higher in northern countries for instance in scandinavian countries caffeine consumption as high as 400 mg inh 1 day 1 has been reported

highest average caffeine intake was observed in february and march it corresponds to the fact that more hot caffeine containing beverages are consumed in colder weather other authors have observed similar trends rossato et al 2015 no pronounced trends were noticed in caffeine consumption throughout weekdays non significant p value 0 05 decrease took place on monday indicating lower consumption of caffeinated beverages on the weekend that is in good agreement with other authors observation driver et al 2020 3 3 3 nicotine consumption of nicotine was estimated by using its metabolite cotinine as a biomarker the average calculated nicotine consumption in 2021 was 5 9 mg inh15 1 day 1 or 6 6 cig inh15 1 day 1 for comparison purposes nicotine consumption expressed to whole population was calculated as well 5 3 mg inh 1 day 1 other authors have obtained nicotine consumption values ranging from 0 5 to 12 9 mg inh 1 day 1 by using the wbe approach gao et al 2020 the obtained value of 6 6 cig inh15 1 day 1 was within the range of 3 5 to 10 6 cig inh15 1 day 1 that was obtained in lithuania in 2019 boogaerts et al 2021b accurate nicotine consumption data in latvia is not available however taking into account the percentage of daily smokers in latvia in 2019 22 1 eurostat 2021 and the average daily intake of nicotine per smoker 25 mg day 1 fagerström 2005 it can be calculated

cyanobacteria toxin particularly microcystin lr mc lr therefore a simple and highly efficient method for detecting mc lr plays a role in studying the ecological toxicology of mc lr however as mc lr itself is located in a complex environment traditional techniques present complex and false positive defects to address the above issues novel technologies should be explored and discovered herein we describe the development of mc bdkz as the first paradigm of probes that can concurrently report mc lr in natural lakes and cells this novel material shows large stokes shift and possesses good photostability and high sensitivity considering the properties mentioned above mc bdkz not only achieves the detection of mc lr in the lake water samples but also completes the imaging of exogenous mc lr in cells moreover the interference of many factors in the lake and cells is excluded completely in the process of mc lr detection we comprehensively analyzed the response principle and potential application of mc bdkz in the process of mc lr detection compared with the conventional mc lr detection technologies fluorescence probe technology shows better convenience and greatly reduces distance from the practical application in vitro and in vivo we envisioned that the development of this visual research tool could provide crucial clues for exploring the pathogenesis of mc lr in body

toxicity and neurotoxicity chen et al 2016 chen et al 2018 sun et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 the world health organization who recommends that the concentration of mc lr in drinking water should not exceed 1μg l cotruvo 2020 li et al 2021 thus detecting the concentration of mc lr in water environment has always been an important research topic the conventional detection methods of mc lr mainly adopts high performance liquid chromatography hplc liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms protein phosphatase inhibition assay ppia and enzyme link immunosorbent assay elisa technologies chen et al 2020 opuni et al 2021 sassolas et al 2011 zheng and wang 2019 however conventional methods show many disadvantages including high cost false positive results susceptibility to interference and detection procedure complexity thus developing a simple method to detect mc lr in vitro and in vivo is necessary as a molecular tool fluorescence probe has been widely applied to the detection field based on fluorescence response principle table s1 liu et al 2018a liu et al 2017b wang et al 2021a b in particular small molecule fluorescent probes exhibit special advantages in the detection process of target such as simple ease to operation and sensitivity liu et al 2016a liu et al 2018b yuan et al 2012 however developing a fluorescent probe technology for mc lr detection has not been reported we believed that the specific reasons are as follows 1 due to the structural complexity of mc lr the recognition sites of mc lr are difficult to explore 2 in eutrophic lakes and organisms mc lr itself is located in a complex environment diez quijada et al 2019 therefore the current probe technologies could not achieve mc lr detection with high selectivity 3 mc lr is a circular structure composed of seven amino acids dawson 1998 zhang et al 2019 therefore interference of amino acids may affect mc lr detection in vitro and in vivo consequently constructing fluorescent probes for detecting and tracking mc lr exists great challenges to explore novel small molecule fluorescent probes that enable mc lr detection in vivo and in vitro we hope to make breakthroughs in the following aspects first the structure of mc lr may lead to the dissociation of hydrogen ions in water environment this structure feature determines the weak acidity of mc lr water solution thus exploring fluorescent probes with acidic recognition sites will be a key element for achieving mc lr detection second imaging studies of mc lr at the subcellular level are lacking internationally therefore it is crucial to construct fluorescent probes that could be applied to cell imaging numerous interference factors coexisting with mc lr are complex and numerous in organisms therefore excluding interference and achieving the detection of mc lr in vivo are important issues to address to realize the above goal in this work we constructed a novel fluorescence probe mc bdkz for mc lr in vitro and in vivo through acidity changes of the solution that are relevant with the mc lr concentration fig 1 this novel probe not only shows a large stokes shift but also possesses good photostability in terms of the properties mentioned above mc bdkz exhibited strong fluorescence response to mc lr after excluding other factors interference compared with the previous detection technologies mc bdkz shows unique advantages in the detection process of mc lr table 1 we also comprehensively analyzed the response principle and potential application of mc bdkz to mc lr this work will provide important references for real time tracing of exogenous mc lr in organisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 standard solutions preparation mc lr standard solution the 5 0 mg mc lr standards were dissolved in 10 ml of pure water the mc lr standard solution 500 μm was prepared at room temperature mc bdkz standard solution mc bdkz 3 7 mg was weighed and dissolved in 5 ml dmso the concentration of this standard solution was 1 55 mm pbs standard buffer solution a small bag of phosphate standard was added to 0 8 l pure water the solution was transferred to a volumetric flask and pure water was added to achieve a constant volume of 1 l amine acids standard solution the standard solution 500 μm of the amino acid analysis reagent was prepared by dissolving the various relevant amino acids and other polypeptides in pure water including tryptophan trp glycine gly valine val cysteine cys glutamic acid glu glutamine gln alanine ala tyrosine tyr aspartic acid asp threonine thr arginine arg leucine leu serine ser asparagine asn isoleucine ile methionine met proline pro lysine lys phenylalanine phe histidine his glutathione gsh and 2 aminoethanethiol aea all of the above standard solutions required cryopreservation 2 2 the mc lr titration experiment for fluorescence titration experiments of mc bdkz to mc lr in pure water the mc bdkz standard solution 1 55 mm needed to be used at a 10 fold dilution with dmso we successively added 0 1 2 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 and 80 μl mc lr standard solution to 200 μl pcr tubes then pure water was added to achieve 200 μl volume by this operation mc lr solutions with concentrations of 0 2 5 5 0 12 5 25 37 5 50 62 5 75 87 5 100 112 5 125 137 5 150 162 5 175 187 5 and 200 μm were obtained then 2 5 ul of 0 15 mm diluted probe solution was added to the pcr tubes by scanning the fluorescence spectra of all test samples and recording the peak fluorescence intensity at 565 nm a scatter plot was made against the corresponding mc lr concentration when testing the fluorescence titrations spectra in fbs and pbs buffer solutions we should add 120 μl pbs or fbs to pcr tubes first then 0 1 2 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 and 80 μl mc lr were added finally the fixed capacity of 200 μl was achieved with pure water the purpose of this operation was to ensure that pbs and fbs keep the same concentrations during the test when testing the fluorescence titration in fbs the excitation wavelength should be selected at 350 nm and the peak fluorescence intensity should be selected at 450 nm the other steps were the same as those used to measure the fluorescence spectrum in water 2 3 the mc lr selectivity and competitive experiments the amino acid and polypeptide analysis reagents need to keep the same concentrations with mc lr in the experiment in the selectivity experiment 80 μl mc lr standard solution and different kinds of amino acid solutions were absorbed and added into the 200 μl pcr tubes then 120 μl pure water was added to the pcr tubes at a constant volume of 200 μl finally 2 5 μl 0 15 mm mc bdkz solution was added to the pcr tubes we recorded the peak fluorescence intensity at 565 nm and made a bar graph with the corresponding amino acids in the competitive experiment 80 μl mc lr solution and 80 μl different amino acid aqueous solutions were added into the pcr tubes together then 40 μl pure water was added finally we added 2 5 μl 0 15 mm probe solution to determine the fluorescence spectrum 2 4 the ph response experiment we first adjusted the pbs buffer solution to different ph values by using dilute hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide solution the ph levels of pbs buffer solutions were 3 0 3 5 4 0 4 5 5 0 5 5 6 0 6 5 7 0 7 5 8 0 8 5 9 0 9 5 10 0 10 5 and 11 0 after adjusting the ph of pbs buffer solutions 5 ml pbs buffer solution with different ph was added into the 10 ml centrifuge tubes then we added 6 26 μl of 1 55 mm probe standard solution the uv absorption and fluorescence spectra were measured after uniform oscillation 2 5 the treatment and experiment of water samples to test the mc lr detection ability of fluorescent probe in a natural water environment we finally chose to take water samples from erhai lake for mc lr standard addition recovery experiment fig 2 in this experiment two kinds of water samples were tested the samples were collected from water without any treatment and the water was filtered with 0 45 gf c membrane these two water samples were tested by adding mc lr standard sample the 160 μl of raw water without any treatment and the water filtered with 0 45 gf c membrane were added to 200 μl pcr tubes then we added 40 μl of mc lr standard solution to achieve the 200 μl total volume finally we added 2 5 μl 0 15 mm of mc dbkz solution to the pcr tubes the fluorescence spectra were determined at 420 nm excitation 2 6 cell culture and imaging mcf 7 cells were grown in dmem medium containing 10 fbs the temperature of the incubator was set to 37 c and the concentration of co2 should be 5 when the cells grew to the logarithmic phase the cells were inoculated into a petri dish containing cover glass to allow the cells to continue grow after 24 h of growth the cell confluence reached 50 70 then staining and imaging experiments were performed in the co localization experiment mcf 7 cells and 2 μm mc bdkz were cultured in the medium for 30 min then the excess probes were washed with pbs thrice next the culture medium containing 200 nmol l lyso tracker deep red ltdr was added to the cells and then incubated for 10 min to completely remove the excess ltdr the culture medium still needed to be washed thrice with pbs finally the fluorescence images were obtained by using olympus confocal microscope the imaging experiment of mc bdkz to mc lr in cells proceeded as follows mcf 7 cells were inoculated into the imaging dish and treated after the cell density increased to more than 80 the cells were divided into two groups namely experimental group and control group their difference is that the experimental group will add mc lr aqueous solution during the culture process whereas the control group will add the corresponding volume of pure water first both groups of cells were cultured with 1 ml formalin fixed solution for 30 min then the formalin solution was removed and the cells were washed with pbs the group of fixed mcf 7 cells were obtained second the cells were incubated with pbs containing triton x 100 5 for 3 min the purpose of this step was to fenestrate the cells then we washed the cells with clean pbs the fixed and fenestrated mcf 7 cells were obtained third we added 30 μl mc lr aqueous solution to the imaging dishes of the experimental group and 30 μl of pure water was added to the imaging dishes of the control group this two groups of cells were shaken slowly and then kept still for 2 h prior to being treated with 2 μμ mc bdkz for 30 min and cleaning with pbs finally the fluorescence images of these two groups cells were obtained by using olympus confocal microscope 3 results 3 1 response of the probe mc bdkz to mc lr fuorescence titration we successfully synthesized the compound mc bdkz and passed the structure characterization by 1h nmr 13c nmr and hrms see supporting information the absorption and fluorescence spectra of compound mc bdkz in different solutions are shown in fig s1 the fluorescence intensity of mc bdkz in organic phase was much stronger than that in aqueous phase furthermore this kind of compound showed a large stokes shift and fluorescent quantum yield in organic phase φ table s2 in the study of solvation effects of fluorescent probes such compounds are often used for the detection of targets as a novel fluorescence enhancement probe liu et al 2014 wang et al 2018 the optical properties of the compound give the probe itself good application prospects such as the tracking of active molecules and biological imaging we discussed the design concept of the mc lr probe mc bdkz to verify the response ability of mc bdkz to mc lr we first investigated the titration experiments of probe to mc lr in pure water fig 3a the fluorescence intensity change at 565 nm was summarized in fig 3b the fluorescence intensity of compound mc bdkz was increased from 210 to 950 with increasing mc lr then we investigated the titration experiments of the probe to mc lr in pbs buffer solutions fig 3c the fluorescence intensity change of probe in pbs was weaker than in water fig 3d finally we conducted the fluorescence titration experiment of probe to mc lr in fetal bovine serum fbs mc bdkz showed higher fluorescence intensity in fbs than in aqueous phase indicating that mc bdkz could not accurately identify mc lr in blood figs 3e and f mc lr could generate reaction with mc bdkz in aqueous phase and further changed the conjugated system of mc bdkz thus fluorescence intensity of the probe mc bdkz was positively correlated with the mc lr concentration in aqueous phase furthermore the fluorescence intensity of compound mc bdkz increased almost 5 fold in pure water with the increasing of mc lr concentration similarly the fluorescence intensity of the compound mc bdkz also exhibited an increasing trend in the presence of mc lr in buffer solution indicating that mc bdkz had the potential to detect mc lr in cell environment the detection limit for mc bdkz was calculated to be 0 27 μμ fig s2 indicating that the probe is highly sensitive to mc lr in aqueous phase we also performed the fluorescence titration experiments of mc bdkz to mc rr the fluorescence intensity of probe was gradually increased with the mc rr concentration increased fig s3 it is the first report of using such small molecular probe to detect the ecological toxins in water samples we envisioned that the compound mc bdkz may act as a functional probe for detecting mc lr in the ecological environment and biological systems 3 2 response of mc bdkz to mc lr selectivity and competitive experiment to verify the response ability of mc bdkz to mc lr the selectivity and competitive experiments were conducted as we all know mc lr is a cyclic heptapeptide composed of seven amino acids the presence of other amino acids may affect the high selectivity of mc bdkz therefore in the selectivity experiment various relevant amino acids and other polypeptides including trp gly val cys glu gln ala tyr asp thr arg leu ser asn ile met pro lys phe his gsh and aea were further studied the fluorescence spectra of selectivity experiment demonstrated that the probe mc bdkz could emit strong fluorescence signal in the presence of mc lr fig 4a however among various relevant amino acids and other polypeptides three types of amino acids glu asp and gsh could exhibit strong fluorescence signals fig 4b therefore to achieve a high selective detection of mc lr it is very important to exclude background fluorescent interference produced by glu asp and gsh in the natural lakes and cells to investigated the practical application potential of mc bdkz in the complex environment samples we performed fluorescence titration experiment of mc bdkz to mc lr in dianchi water sample mc bdkz could still generate a stable and significant response with mc lr in the dianchi lake water sample the fluorescence intensity of probe was gradually increased with the mc lr concentration increased and the peak fluorescence intensity of mc bdkz remained at 565 nm fig s4a the fluorescence intensity of the probe at 565 nm was fitted with the concentration of mc lr and the fitting line y 5 3344 x 236 2028 r2 0 9635 was obtained fig s4b this result indicated that the probe had the potential to recognize mc lr in complex water samples we further selected 7 common cations zn2 mg2 cu2 mn2 k ba2 and na and 6 anions cl so4 2 oh so3 2 i and hso3 to prove the selectivity of mc bdkz to mc lr the fluorescence signal of mc bdkz to mc lr was higher than that to cations and anions fig s5 and fig s6 the results demonstrated that mc bdkz showed a good selectivity to mc lr in water samples the cells contain various amino acids and polypeptides the presence of these amino acids and polypeptides may affect or interfere the detection of mc bdkz to mc lr in cells to prove the selective detection of probe to mc lr in complex environments the competitive experiments of mc bdkz were also conducted we selected 5 amino acids containing 3 acidic amino acids to perform competitive experiments fig 4c experimental results indicated that the mc bdkz still exhibited a high fluorescence response to mc lr when trp and leu coexist with mc lr however the fluorescence intensities of mc bdkz to mc lr in the presence of glu asp and gsh are higher than mc bdkz to mc lr without amine acids fig 4d glu gsh and asp are belonging to acidic amino acids when these amino acids coexist with mc lr the system is more acidic than the amino acid itself therefore the amino acid interference will be an important factor in the detection process of mc lr how to exclude interference factors will be related to the practical application of the probe in the fluorescent imaging and ecological toxicology fields 3 3 exploration of the mc lr recognition site the structure of mc bdkz was a 2 7 carbazole based compound combined with pyridine the pyridine moiety was often chosen as the site for hydrogen ions as we all know mc lr could dissociate hydrogen ions in aqueous solution making the solution appear acidic thus we envision that probe response to mc lr may be due to the generation of hydrogen bonds between mc lr and the pyridine nitrogen atoms to prove the above conclusion we performed the response experiments of mc bdkz in different acid alkaline ranges 3 0 11 the absorption spectra of mc bdkz to acid alkaline was shown in fig 5a as the acidity gradually increased the uv absorption peak of probe mc bdkz was further red shifted from 350 nm to 425 nm as shown in fig 5b the absorbance of probe decreased with the increasing alkaline solution furthermore the fluorescence spectrum of mc bdkz was analyzed in different acid alkaline ranges the fluorescence peak with 560 nm further red shifted to 625 nm as the alkalinity gradually decreased fig 5c the results indicated that probe exhibited strong signal change in the weak acid range fig 5d we envisioned that the pyridine moiety could act as the mc lr recognition site in the fluorescence titration and selectivity experiments the response mechanism of probe to mc lr may be caused by the hydrogen bonds between pyridine nitrogen atoms and mc lr and further changed the conjugated system of mc bdkz the fluorescence intensity of the fluorescent probe did not change greatly from neutral to alkaline thus the properties of the probe itself would not be affected in neutral or alkaline solutions generally the ph range of natural lake water samples was approximately 7 9 so the acidity and alkalinity of water samples would not interfere with the photophysical properties of the probe itself 3 4 application of mc bdkz in erhai lake samples to test the mc lr detection capability of probe mc bdkz in natural water environment we selected 9 sampling points in erhai lake and further carried out the recovery percentage of standard samples experiments in water samples the sample names of raw water were eh ys1 eh ys2 eh ys3 eh ys4 eh ys5 eh ys6 eh ys7 eh ys8 and eh ys9 the samples of the filtration membrane were named eh gs1 eh gs2 eh gs3 eh gs4 eh gs5 eh gs6 eh gs7 eh gs8 and eh gs9 when measuring the fluorescence intensity of water samples adding mc lr standard substance the fluorescence titration experiment of mc bdkz to mc lr also needed to be conducted fig 6a then the fluorescence data at 565 nm were fitted and a fitting line y 3 3605 x 212 11 with r2 0 9914 was obtained fig 6b the fluorescence spectra of probe to mc lr in untreated and treated water samples are shown in figs 6c and d the fluorescence intensities of the probe in both water samples were weaker than that in pure water the fluorescence data of the labeled water sample at 565 nm were substituted into the fitting equation to calculate the concentration of mc lr figs 6e and f then the above concentration was compared with the actual concentration of the added mc lr to calculate the recovery rate table 2 the calculation results of recovery rate showed different values in the different water samples the reasons behind this phenomenon deserve our in depth consideration observing the water quality parameter data of the sampling point we can see that the water samples are weakly alkaline table s3 in the above ph fluorescence experiments the probe exhibited weak fluorescence signals in alkaline environment considering the above experiment results we inferred that the weak alkalinity of water samples may be the main reason for the occurrence of low standard recovery rate eliminating the ph interference of water sample itself is an important factor to affecting the improvement of detection efficiency 3 5 excluding interference and imaging mc lr in cells in the previous ph experiments the fluorescence intensity of mc bdkz was high and very sensitive in the ph range of 3 0 5 5 whereas the fluorescence intensity was low and fluctuated little in the ph range of 7 11 we envisioned that the acidity maybe interference mc lr detection in cells the acid range of the fluorescence signal is consistent with the weak acid of intracellular lysosomes liu et al 2017a liu et al 2016a yue et al 2017 we inferred that this probe could selectively imaging lysosomes in living cells to distinguish exogenous mc lr localization and lysosomal regions we must find lysosomal regions by co localization experiments with lysosomes firstly we incubated the mcf 7 cells with commercial lysosomal probe ltdr and then further stained the same cells with mc bdkz the confocal image of mc bdkz merged well with that of the ltdr figs 7a and b moreover the pearson s colocalization coefficient was determined as 0 82 figs 7c and d demonstrating that mc bdkz was predominantly located in the lysosomes in addition this probe showed good photostability in the aqueous phase and living cells figs s8 and s9 in the process of cell imaging of exogenous mc lr there are two methods could be performed to eliminate the interference of lysosome and other factors the first method was that excluding lysosomal regions from the exogenous mc lr imaging region in cells the other method was adjusting the microscope parameters to weaken the intracellular fluorescence signals of cells untreated with mc lr under the same conditions imaging pictures of the cells treated with mc lr were obtained fluorescence signals of cells treated with mc lr mainly came from mc lr in order to eliminate more interference factors in cells the second detection method was the best experimental scheme for imaging mc lr thus to prove that mc bdkz can be used for imaging the exogenous mc lr in cells we further conducted the imaging experiment of mc lr based on the second method the mcf 7 cells were divided into two groups experiment group and control group the experimental group s cells were treated with mc lr standard solution another group was selected to the control group the fluorescence imaging of both group cells was obtained by olympus confocal microscope the experimental group s cells showed stronger fluorescence signal than that in the control group figs 8a and b this experiment result demonstrated that the fluorescence signals of cells treated with mc lr mainly came from mc lr in order to more intuitively compare the fluorescence signals induced by mc lr the mean fluorescence intensity of the two group cells was obtained by comparing the mean fluorescence intensities the mean fluorescence intensity of the cells treated with mc lr was found to be 86 07 and the untreated cells fluorescence intensity was 45 99 fig 9 the above results suggested that probe mc bdkz could detect mc lr in complex cell environments whereas intracellular interference factors amino acids and lysosomes could be excluded in the process of mc lr detection 4 discussion 4 1 the design concept of probe mc bdkz for detecting mc lr before developing fluorescent probes to detect mc lr we firstly conducted sufficient literature research mc lr is a cyclic heptapeptide including 2s 3s 8s 9s 3 amino 9 methoxy 2 6 8 trimethyl 10 phenyldeca 4 6 dienoic acid adda glutamate d glu n methyldehydroalanine mdha alanine d ala arginine arg methylaspartate d masp and leucine leu harada et al 1990 namikoshi et al 1990 the d glu and d masp in the mc lr structure contain an ionizable carboxyl group the pka values of this two groups are reported to be 2 09 and 2 19 de maagd et al 1999 rivasseau et al 1998 rudolph böhner et al 1994 therefore mc lr could ionize hydrogen ions after being dissolved in water making mc lr aquatic solution acidic according to this characteristic we designed and synthesized the fluorescence probe mc bdkz the structure of mc bdkz was 2 7 carbazole based ionic salt combined with pyridine in previous reports the pyridine moiety was often chosen as the site for hydrogen ions due to its pka 5 0 liu et al 2016a miao et al 2013 we envisioned that this small molecule probe with special structure may respond to the mc lr next the response of the probe to mc lr was tested in both pure water and pbs mc bdkz had a good response to mc lr in pure water figs 3a and b whereas the response was weaker in pbs than in pure water figs 3c and d pbs buffer could resist the acid and alkali change caused by foreign substances within a range therefore we inferred that the acid base change of solution caused by mc lr concentration may be an important reason for the response of probe to mc lr to further verified the response mechanism of the probe mc bdkz to mc lr the new fluorescent probe bdkz r3 was designed the bdkz r3 was obtained by using the mc bdkz reaction with iodoethane and its structure was shown in fig s10a according to the structural characteristics of probe mc bdkz when the pyridine nitrogen of the probe was combined with iodoethane the new probe bdkz r3 could not bind to hydrogen protons liu et al 2016b to confirmed this mechanism the response of bdkz r3 to mc lr was tested the fluorescence intensity of bdkz r3 was almost the same in both mc lr solutions fig s10b indicating that bdkz r3 could not detect mc lr in water samples thus the pyridine moiety of mc bdkz was taken as a recognition site of mc lr based on the above experiments the response mechanism of mc bdkz to mc lr was investigated in detail as we all know mc lr could ionize hydrogen ions after dissolving in water fig 10a the pyridine nitrogen atoms of the mc bdkz could bind to the hydrogen protons dissociated by mc lr through the formation of hydrogen bond thereby producing efficient internal charge transfer ict effect at the end of pyridine group fig 10b ict effect often cause the fluorescence spectrum changes of the probe and in most cases these changes were likely due to the enhancement of fluorescence signals dong et al 2016 liu et al 2016a liu et al 2018b therefore the fluorescence intensity of probe would change with the increasing mc lr concentration however when using iodoethane to bind mc bdkz the hydrogen site was blocked and then the ict efficiency significantly decreased this is why bdkz r3 could not respond to mc lr in water samples fig 10c 4 2 excluding interference and detecting mc lr we proved that probe mc bdkz exhibits large stokes shift moreover it shows strong fluorescence signals in the presence of mc lr in buffer solution the experiment results demonstrated that mc bdkz should possess excellent imaging ability in biological system as we all know when mc lr enters the cell through the oatp system mc lr can inhibit the intracellular protein phosphatase pp1 2a activity and make cell hyperphosphorylate jasionek et al 2010 kull et al 2004 in addition the mc lr itself contains multiple amino acid structures the mc bdkz is a fluorescence probe for sensitively sensing acid base changes thus we envisioned that mc bdkz could have a good response to exogenous mc lr in cells how to eliminate the interference of other factors in vivo and in vitro will be an issue to be solved in the practical application process first in selective experiments some acidic amino acids have a strong fluorescence signal however in the complex lake water samples titration experiment of mc bdkz to mc lr indicated that the probe showed a strong fluorescence with the increasing mc lr such results further demonstrated that the detection of mc lr could not be affected by many factors in the complex lake water system second in cell imaging experiments the acidic regions of cells were mainly concentrated in lysosomal region shen et al 2018 therefore to exclude such interference it is crucial to eliminate the fluorescence signal of lysosomes before introducing mc lr into the cells for imaging studies of mc lr in cell imaging experiments we have discussed two schemes to eliminate interference with lysosomes and amino acids in the process of mc lr imaging the second scheme is the best one as follows adjusting the microscope parameters to weaken the intracellular fluorescence signals of cells untreated with mc lr under the same conditions imaging pictures of the cells treated with mc lr were obtained fluorescence signals of cells treated with mc lr mainly came from mc lr 4 3 practical application potential to the best of our knowledge the conventional methods of mc lr mainly are divided into two categories one is to use the hplc or lc ms technology to identify the microcystins in samples baliu rodriguez et al 2020 jin et al 2021 the another is use the specific binding between mc lr antibody aptamer and mc lr to detect the concentration of mc lr bostan et al 2018 xu et al 2018 in this report we firstly successfully constructed fluorescence probe mc bdkz to directly detect mc lr in aqueous solution thus compared with the conventional detection methods table s4 fluorescence probe technology greatly reduces distance from the practical application firstly for in vitro assays the fluorescent probe technology was much simpler for mc lr detection in the lake water system than conventional technology moreover it no longer relies on expensive equipment to achieve mc lr detection this kind of technology achieves the detection of mc lr mainly by using qualitative analysis of fluorescence it is different from the traditional elasa technology and could not present false positive results secondly for in vivo assays mc bdkz has excellent optical properties and can be used for biological imaging to detect exogenous mc lr in biological system however conventional methods could not image mc lr on the subcellular level we have already known that mc lr posed a huge threat to human health and caused some diseases therefore to study the relationship between mc lr and pathological mechanism a visual research tool must be developed this tool can not only achieve the detection of mc lr in vitro but it can also track the metabolic process of mc lr in biological system however the current report focuses on in vitro detection imaging based detection is limited to simple organisms 5 conclusion in summary we designed and synthesized the fluorescence probe mc bdkz for excluding interference and detecting mc lr in natural lakes and cells for the first time the novel probe possessed excellent properties such as large stokes shift high stability and sensitive to changes in acidity in terms of the properties mentioned above mc bdkz exhibited strong fluorescence response to mc lr in aqueous phase in view of the above mentioned excellent performances this fluorescent probe not only realized the detection of mc lr in the lake water system but also completed the imaging of exogenous mc lr in cells moreover it has successfully avoided the interference sourcing the complex lake water system and other intracellular factors the response mechanism of the probe to mc lr was further explored in the process of mc lr detection compared with the conventional technologies this unique detection method possesses better convenience and greatly reduces distance from the practical application in vitro and in vivo this novel technology could provide a design idea for the scientific community to construct a functional mc lr probe with practical application value declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest

15779,cyanobacteria blooms that cause the death of aquatic and terrestrial organisms have attracted considerable attention since the 19th century the most typical toxin in cyanobacteria blooms is cyanobacteria toxin particularly microcystin lr mc lr therefore a simple and highly efficient method for detecting mc lr plays a role in studying the ecological toxicology of mc lr however as mc lr itself is located in a complex environment traditional techniques present complex and false positive defects to address the above issues novel technologies should be explored and discovered herein we describe the development of mc bdkz as the first paradigm of probes that can concurrently report mc lr in natural lakes and cells this novel material shows large stokes shift and possesses good photostability and high sensitivity considering the properties mentioned above mc bdkz not only achieves the detection of mc lr in the lake water samples but also completes the imaging of exogenous mc lr in cells moreover the interference of many factors in the lake and cells is excluded completely in the process of mc lr detection we comprehensively analyzed the response principle and potential application of mc bdkz in the process of mc lr detection compared with the conventional mc lr detection technologies fluorescence probe technology shows better convenience and greatly reduces distance from the practical application in vitro and in vivo we envisioned that the development of this visual research tool could provide crucial clues for exploring the pathogenesis of mc lr in body

technologies chen et al 2020 opuni et al 2021 sassolas et al 2011 zheng and wang 2019 however conventional methods show many disadvantages including high cost false positive results susceptibility to interference and detection procedure complexity thus developing a simple method to detect mc lr in vitro and in vivo is necessary as a molecular tool fluorescence probe has been widely applied to the detection field based on fluorescence response principle table s1 liu et al 2018a liu et al 2017b wang et al 2021a b in particular small molecule fluorescent probes exhibit special advantages in the detection process of target such as simple ease to operation and sensitivity liu et al 2016a liu et al 2018b yuan et al 2012 however developing a fluorescent probe technology for mc lr detection has not been reported we believed that the specific reasons are as follows 1 due to the structural complexity of mc lr the recognition sites of mc lr are difficult to explore 2 in eutrophic lakes and organisms mc lr itself is located in a complex environment diez quijada et al 2019 therefore the current probe technologies could not achieve mc lr detection with high selectivity 3 mc lr is a circular structure composed of seven amino acids dawson 1998 zhang et al 2019 therefore interference of amino acids may affect mc lr detection in vitro and in vivo consequently constructing fluorescent probes for detecting and tracking mc lr exists great challenges to explore novel small molecule fluorescent probes that enable mc lr detection in vivo and in vitro we hope to make breakthroughs in the following aspects first the structure of mc lr may lead to the dissociation of hydrogen ions in water environment this structure feature determines the weak acidity of mc lr water solution thus exploring fluorescent probes with acidic recognition sites will be a key element for achieving mc lr detection second imaging studies of mc lr at the subcellular level are lacking internationally therefore it is crucial to construct fluorescent probes that could be applied to cell imaging numerous interference factors coexisting with mc lr are complex and numerous in organisms therefore excluding interference and achieving the detection of mc lr in vivo are important issues to address to realize the above goal in this work we constructed a novel fluorescence probe mc bdkz for mc lr in vitro and in vivo through acidity changes of the solution that are relevant with the mc lr concentration fig 1 this novel probe not only shows a large stokes shift but also possesses good photostability in terms of the properties mentioned above mc bdkz exhibited strong fluorescence response to mc lr after excluding other factors interference compared with the previous detection technologies mc bdkz shows unique advantages in the detection process of mc lr table 1 we also comprehensively analyzed the response principle and potential application of mc bdkz to mc lr this work will provide important references for real time tracing of exogenous mc lr in organisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 standard solutions preparation mc lr standard solution the 5 0 mg mc lr standards were dissolved in 10 ml of pure water the mc lr standard solution 500 μm was prepared at room temperature mc bdkz standard solution mc bdkz 3 7 mg was weighed and dissolved in 5 ml dmso the concentration of this standard solution was 1 55 mm pbs standard buffer solution a small bag of phosphate standard was added to 0 8 l pure water the solution was transferred to a volumetric flask and pure water was added to achieve a constant volume of 1 l amine acids standard solution the standard solution 500 μm of the amino acid analysis reagent was prepared by dissolving the various relevant amino acids and other polypeptides in pure water including tryptophan trp glycine gly valine val cysteine cys glutamic acid glu glutamine gln alanine ala tyrosine tyr aspartic acid asp threonine thr arginine arg leucine leu serine ser asparagine asn isoleucine ile methionine met proline pro lysine lys phenylalanine phe histidine his glutathione gsh and 2 aminoethanethiol aea all of the above standard solutions required cryopreservation 2 2 the mc lr titration experiment for fluorescence titration experiments of mc bdkz to mc lr in pure water the mc bdkz standard solution 1 55 mm needed to be used at a 10 fold dilution with dmso we successively added 0 1 2 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 and 80 μl mc lr standard solution to 200 μl pcr tubes then pure water was added to achieve 200 μl volume by this operation mc lr solutions with concentrations of 0 2 5 5 0 12 5 25 37 5 50 62 5 75 87 5 100 112 5 125 137 5 150 162 5 175 187 5 and 200 μm were obtained then 2 5 ul of 0 15 mm diluted probe solution was added to the pcr tubes by scanning the fluorescence spectra of all test samples and recording the peak fluorescence intensity at 565 nm a scatter plot was made against the corresponding mc lr concentration when testing the fluorescence titrations spectra in fbs and pbs buffer solutions we should add 120 μl pbs or fbs to pcr tubes first then 0 1 2 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 and 80 μl mc lr were added finally the fixed capacity of 200 μl was achieved with pure water the purpose of this operation was to ensure that pbs and fbs keep the same concentrations during the test when testing the fluorescence titration in fbs the excitation wavelength should be selected at 350 nm and the peak fluorescence intensity should be selected at 450 nm the other steps were the same as those used to measure the fluorescence spectrum in water 2 3 the mc lr selectivity and competitive experiments the amino acid and polypeptide analysis reagents need to keep the same concentrations with mc lr in the experiment in the selectivity experiment 80 μl mc lr standard solution and different kinds of amino acid solutions were absorbed and added into the 200 μl pcr tubes then 120 μl pure water was added to the pcr tubes at a constant volume of 200 μl finally 2 5 μl 0 15 mm mc bdkz solution was added to the pcr tubes we recorded the peak fluorescence intensity at 565 nm and made a bar graph with the corresponding amino acids in the competitive experiment 80 μl mc lr solution and 80 μl different amino acid aqueous solutions were added into the pcr tubes together then 40 μl pure water was added finally we added 2 5 μl 0 15 mm probe solution to determine the fluorescence spectrum 2 4 the ph response experiment we first adjusted the pbs buffer solution to different ph values by using dilute hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide solution the ph levels of pbs buffer solutions were 3 0 3 5 4 0 4 5 5 0 5 5 6 0 6 5 7 0 7 5 8 0 8 5 9 0 9 5 10 0 10 5 and 11 0 after adjusting the ph of pbs buffer solutions 5 ml pbs buffer solution with different ph was added into the 10 ml centrifuge tubes then we added 6 26 μl of 1 55 mm probe standard solution the uv absorption and fluorescence spectra were measured after uniform oscillation 2 5 the treatment and experiment of water samples to test the mc lr detection ability of fluorescent probe in a natural water environment we finally chose to take water samples from erhai lake for mc lr standard addition recovery experiment fig 2 in this experiment two kinds of water samples were tested the samples were collected from water without any treatment and the water was filtered with 0 45 gf c membrane these two water samples were tested by adding mc lr standard sample the 160 μl of raw water without any treatment and the water filtered with 0 45 gf c membrane were added to 200 μl pcr tubes then we added 40 μl of mc lr standard solution to achieve the 200 μl total volume finally we added 2 5 μl 0 15 mm of mc dbkz solution to the pcr tubes the fluorescence spectra were determined at 420 nm excitation 2 6 cell culture and imaging mcf 7 cells were grown in dmem medium containing 10 fbs the temperature of the incubator was set to 37 c and the concentration of co2 should be 5 when the cells grew to the logarithmic phase the cells were inoculated into a petri dish containing cover glass to allow the cells to continue grow after 24 h of growth the cell confluence reached 50 70 then staining and imaging experiments were performed in the co localization experiment mcf 7 cells and 2 μm mc bdkz were cultured in the medium for 30 min then the excess probes were washed with pbs thrice next the culture medium containing 200 nmol l lyso tracker deep red ltdr was added to the cells and then incubated for 10 min to completely remove the excess ltdr the culture medium still needed to be washed thrice with pbs finally the fluorescence images were obtained by using olympus confocal microscope the imaging experiment of mc bdkz to mc lr in cells proceeded as follows mcf 7 cells were inoculated into the imaging dish and treated after the cell density increased to more than 80 the cells were divided into two groups namely experimental group and control group their difference is that the experimental group will add mc lr aqueous solution during the culture process whereas the control group will add the corresponding volume of pure water first both groups of cells were cultured with 1 ml formalin fixed solution for 30 min then the formalin solution was removed and the cells were washed with pbs the group of fixed mcf 7 cells were obtained second the cells were incubated with pbs containing triton x 100 5 for 3 min the purpose of this step was to fenestrate the cells then we washed the cells with clean pbs the fixed and fenestrated mcf 7 cells were obtained third we added 30 μl mc lr aqueous solution to the imaging dishes of the experimental group and 30 μl of pure water was added to the imaging dishes of the control group this two groups of cells were shaken slowly and then kept still for 2 h prior to being treated with 2 μμ mc bdkz for 30 min and cleaning with pbs finally the fluorescence images of these two groups cells were obtained by using olympus confocal microscope 3 results 3 1 response of the probe mc bdkz to mc lr fuorescence titration we successfully synthesized the compound mc bdkz and passed the structure characterization by 1h nmr 13c nmr and hrms see supporting information the absorption and fluorescence spectra of compound mc bdkz in different solutions are shown in fig s1 the fluorescence intensity of mc bdkz in organic phase was much stronger than that in aqueous phase furthermore this kind of compound showed a large stokes shift and fluorescent quantum yield in organic phase φ table s2 in the study of solvation effects of fluorescent probes such compounds are often used for the detection of targets as a novel fluorescence enhancement probe liu et al 2014 wang et al 2018 the optical properties of the compound give the probe itself good application prospects such as the tracking of active molecules and biological imaging we discussed the design concept of the mc lr probe mc bdkz to verify the response ability of mc bdkz to mc lr we first investigated the titration experiments of probe to mc lr in pure water fig 3a the fluorescence intensity change at 565 nm was summarized in fig 3b the fluorescence intensity of compound mc bdkz was increased from 210 to 950 with increasing mc lr then we investigated the titration experiments of the probe to mc lr in pbs buffer solutions fig 3c the fluorescence intensity change of probe in pbs was weaker than in water fig 3d finally we conducted the fluorescence titration experiment of probe to mc lr in fetal bovine serum fbs mc bdkz showed higher fluorescence intensity in fbs than in aqueous phase indicating that mc bdkz could not accurately identify mc lr in blood figs 3e and f mc lr could generate reaction with mc bdkz in aqueous phase and further changed the conjugated system of mc bdkz thus fluorescence intensity of the probe mc bdkz was positively correlated with the mc lr concentration in aqueous phase furthermore the fluorescence intensity of compound mc bdkz increased almost 5 fold in pure water with the increasing of mc lr concentration similarly the fluorescence intensity of the compound mc bdkz also exhibited an increasing trend in the presence of mc lr in buffer solution indicating that mc bdkz had the potential to detect mc lr in cell environment the detection limit for mc bdkz was calculated to be 0 27 μμ fig s2 indicating that the probe is highly sensitive to mc lr in aqueous phase we also performed the fluorescence titration experiments of mc bdkz to mc rr the fluorescence intensity of probe was gradually increased with the mc rr concentration increased fig s3 it is the first report of using such small molecular probe to detect the ecological toxins in water samples we envisioned that the compound mc bdkz may act as a functional probe for detecting mc lr in the ecological environment and biological systems 3 2 response of mc bdkz to mc lr selectivity and competitive experiment to verify the response ability of mc bdkz to mc lr the selectivity and competitive experiments were conducted as we all know mc lr is a cyclic heptapeptide composed of seven amino acids the presence of other amino acids may affect the high selectivity of mc bdkz therefore in the selectivity experiment various relevant amino acids and other polypeptides including trp gly val cys glu gln ala tyr asp thr arg leu ser asn ile met pro lys phe his gsh and aea were further studied the fluorescence spectra of selectivity experiment demonstrated that the probe mc bdkz could emit strong fluorescence signal in the presence of mc lr fig 4a however among various relevant amino acids and other polypeptides three types of amino acids glu asp and gsh could exhibit strong fluorescence signals fig 4b therefore to achieve a high selective detection of mc lr it is very important to exclude background fluorescent interference produced by glu asp and gsh in the natural lakes and cells to investigated the practical application potential of mc bdkz in the complex environment samples we performed fluorescence titration experiment of mc bdkz to mc lr in dianchi water sample mc bdkz could still generate a stable and significant response with mc lr in the dianchi lake water sample the fluorescence intensity of probe was gradually increased with the mc lr concentration increased and the peak fluorescence intensity of mc bdkz remained at 565 nm fig s4a the fluorescence intensity of the probe at 565 nm was fitted with the concentration of mc lr and the fitting line y 5 3344 x 236 2028 r2 0 9635 was obtained fig s4b this result indicated that the probe had the potential to recognize mc lr in complex water samples we further selected 7 common cations zn2 mg2 cu2 mn2 k ba2 and na and 6 anions cl so4 2 oh so3 2 i and hso3 to prove the selectivity of mc bdkz to mc lr the fluorescence signal of mc bdkz to mc lr was higher than that to cations and anions fig s5 and fig s6 the results demonstrated that mc bdkz showed a good selectivity to mc lr in water samples the cells contain various amino acids and polypeptides the presence of these amino acids and polypeptides may affect or interfere the detection of mc bdkz to mc lr in cells to prove the selective detection of probe to mc lr in complex environments the competitive experiments of mc bdkz were also conducted we selected 5 amino acids containing 3 acidic amino acids to perform competitive experiments fig 4c experimental results indicated that the mc bdkz still exhibited a high fluorescence response to mc lr when trp and leu coexist with mc lr however the fluorescence intensities of mc bdkz to mc lr in the presence of glu asp and gsh are higher than mc bdkz to mc lr without amine acids fig 4d glu gsh and asp are belonging to acidic amino acids when these amino acids coexist with mc lr the system is more acidic than the amino acid itself therefore the amino acid interference will be an important factor in the detection process of mc lr how to exclude interference factors will be related to the practical application of the probe in the fluorescent imaging and ecological toxicology fields 3 3 exploration of the mc lr recognition site the structure of mc bdkz was a 2 7 carbazole based compound combined with pyridine the pyridine moiety was often chosen as the site for hydrogen ions as we all know mc lr could dissociate hydrogen ions in aqueous solution making the solution appear acidic thus we envision that probe response to mc lr may be due to the generation of hydrogen bonds between mc lr and the pyridine nitrogen atoms to prove the above conclusion we performed the response experiments of mc bdkz in different acid alkaline ranges 3 0 11 the absorption spectra of mc bdkz to acid alkaline was shown in fig 5a as the acidity gradually increased the uv absorption peak of probe mc bdkz was further red shifted from 350 nm to 425 nm as shown in fig 5b the absorbance of probe decreased with the increasing alkaline solution furthermore the fluorescence spectrum of mc bdkz was analyzed in different acid alkaline ranges the fluorescence peak with 560 nm further red shifted to 625 nm as the alkalinity gradually decreased fig 5c the results indicated that probe exhibited strong signal change in the weak acid range fig 5d we envisioned that the pyridine moiety could act as the mc lr recognition site in the fluorescence titration and selectivity experiments the response mechanism of probe to mc lr may be caused by the hydrogen bonds between pyridine nitrogen atoms and mc lr and further changed the conjugated system of mc bdkz the fluorescence intensity of the fluorescent probe did not change greatly from neutral to alkaline thus the properties of the probe itself would not be affected in neutral or alkaline solutions generally the ph range of natural lake water samples was approximately 7 9 so the acidity and alkalinity of water samples would not interfere with the photophysical properties of the probe itself 3 4 application of mc bdkz in erhai lake samples to test the mc lr detection capability of probe mc bdkz in natural water environment we selected 9 sampling points in erhai lake and further carried out the recovery percentage of standard samples experiments in water samples the sample names of raw water were eh ys1 eh ys2 eh ys3 eh ys4 eh ys5 eh ys6 eh ys7 eh ys8 and eh ys9 the samples of the filtration membrane were named eh gs1 eh gs2 eh gs3 eh gs4 eh gs5 eh gs6 eh gs7 eh gs8 and eh gs9 when measuring the fluorescence intensity of water samples adding mc lr standard substance the fluorescence titration experiment of mc bdkz to mc lr also needed to be conducted fig 6a then the fluorescence data at 565 nm were fitted and a fitting line y 3 3605 x 212 11 with r2 0 9914 was obtained fig 6b the fluorescence spectra of probe to mc lr in untreated and treated water samples are shown in figs 6c and d the fluorescence intensities of the probe in both water samples were weaker than that in pure water the fluorescence data of the labeled water sample at 565 nm were substituted into the fitting equation to calculate the concentration of mc lr figs 6e and f then the above concentration was compared with the actual concentration of the added mc lr to calculate the recovery rate table 2 the calculation results of recovery rate showed different values in the different water samples the reasons behind this phenomenon deserve our in depth consideration observing the water quality parameter data of the sampling point we can see that the water samples are weakly alkaline table s3 in the above ph fluorescence experiments the probe exhibited weak fluorescence signals in alkaline environment considering the above experiment results we inferred that the weak alkalinity of water samples may be the main reason for the occurrence of low standard recovery rate eliminating the ph interference of water sample itself is an important factor to affecting the improvement of detection efficiency 3 5 excluding interference and imaging mc lr in cells in the previous ph experiments the fluorescence intensity of mc bdkz was high and very sensitive in the ph range of 3 0 5 5 whereas the fluorescence intensity was low and fluctuated little in the ph range of 7 11 we envisioned that the acidity maybe interference mc lr detection in cells the acid range of the fluorescence signal is consistent with the weak acid of intracellular lysosomes liu et al 2017a liu et al 2016a yue et al 2017 we inferred that this probe could selectively imaging lysosomes in living cells to distinguish exogenous mc lr localization and lysosomal regions we must find lysosomal regions by co localization experiments with lysosomes firstly we incubated the mcf 7 cells with commercial lysosomal probe ltdr and then further stained the same cells with mc bdkz the confocal image of mc bdkz merged well with that of the ltdr figs 7a and b moreover the pearson s colocalization coefficient was determined as 0 82 figs 7c and d demonstrating that mc bdkz was predominantly located in the lysosomes in addition this probe showed good photostability in the aqueous phase and living cells figs s8 and s9 in the process of cell imaging of exogenous mc lr there are two methods could be performed to eliminate the interference of lysosome and other factors the first method was that excluding lysosomal regions from the exogenous mc lr imaging region in cells the other method was adjusting the microscope parameters to weaken the intracellular fluorescence signals of cells untreated with mc lr under the same conditions imaging pictures of the cells treated with mc lr were obtained fluorescence signals of cells treated with mc lr mainly came from mc lr in order to eliminate more interference factors in cells the second detection method was the best experimental scheme for imaging mc lr thus to prove that mc bdkz can be used for imaging the exogenous mc lr in cells we further conducted the imaging experiment of mc lr based on the second method the mcf 7 cells were divided into two groups experiment group and control group the experimental group s cells were treated with mc lr standard solution another group was selected to the control group the fluorescence imaging of both group cells was obtained by olympus confocal microscope the experimental group s cells showed stronger fluorescence signal than that in the control group figs 8a and b this experiment result demonstrated that the fluorescence signals of cells treated with mc lr mainly came from mc lr in order to more intuitively compare the fluorescence signals induced by mc lr the mean fluorescence intensity of the two group cells was obtained by comparing the mean fluorescence intensities the mean fluorescence intensity of the cells treated with mc lr was found to be 86 07 and the untreated cells fluorescence intensity was 45 99 fig 9 the above results suggested that probe mc bdkz could detect mc lr in complex cell environments whereas intracellular interference factors amino acids and lysosomes could be excluded in the process of mc lr detection 4 discussion 4 1 the design concept of probe mc bdkz for detecting mc lr before developing fluorescent probes to detect mc lr we firstly conducted sufficient literature research mc lr is a cyclic heptapeptide including 2s 3s 8s 9s 3 amino 9 methoxy 2 6 8 trimethyl 10 phenyldeca 4 6 dienoic acid adda glutamate d glu n methyldehydroalanine mdha alanine d ala arginine arg methylaspartate d masp and leucine leu harada et al 1990 namikoshi et al 1990 the d glu and d masp in the mc lr structure contain an ionizable carboxyl group the pka values of this two groups are reported to be 2 09 and 2 19 de maagd et al 1999 rivasseau et al 1998 rudolph böhner et al 1994 therefore mc lr could ionize hydrogen ions after being dissolved in water making mc lr aquatic solution acidic according to this characteristic we designed and synthesized the fluorescence probe mc bdkz the structure of mc bdkz was 2 7 carbazole based ionic salt combined with pyridine in previous reports the pyridine moiety was often chosen as the site for hydrogen ions due to its pka 5 0 liu et al 2016a miao et al 2013 we envisioned that this small molecule probe with special structure may respond to the mc lr next the response of the probe to mc lr was tested in both pure water and pbs mc bdkz had a good response to mc lr in pure water figs 3a and b whereas the response was weaker in pbs than in pure water figs 3c and d pbs buffer could resist the acid and alkali change caused by foreign substances within a range therefore we inferred that the acid base change of solution caused by mc lr concentration may be an important reason for the response of probe to mc lr to further verified the response mechanism of the probe mc bdkz to mc lr the new fluorescent probe bdkz r3 was designed the bdkz r3 was obtained by using the mc bdkz reaction with iodoethane and its structure was shown in fig s10a according to the structural characteristics of probe mc bdkz when the pyridine nitrogen of the probe was combined with iodoethane the new probe bdkz r3 could not bind to hydrogen protons liu et al 2016b to confirmed this mechanism the response of bdkz r3 to mc lr was tested the fluorescence intensity of bdkz r3 was almost the same in both mc lr solutions fig s10b indicating that bdkz r3 could not detect mc lr in water samples thus the pyridine moiety of mc bdkz was taken as a recognition site of mc lr based on the above experiments the response mechanism of mc bdkz to mc lr was investigated in detail as we all know mc lr could ionize hydrogen ions after dissolving in water fig 10a the pyridine nitrogen atoms of the mc bdkz could bind to the hydrogen protons dissociated by mc lr through the formation of hydrogen bond thereby producing efficient internal charge transfer ict effect at the end of pyridine group fig 10b ict effect often cause the fluorescence spectrum changes of the probe and in most cases these changes were likely due to the enhancement of fluorescence signals dong et al 2016 liu et al 2016a liu et al 2018b therefore the fluorescence intensity of probe would change with the increasing mc lr concentration however when using iodoethane to bind mc bdkz the hydrogen site was blocked and then the ict efficiency significantly decreased this is why bdkz r3 could not respond to mc lr in water samples fig 10c 4 2 excluding interference and detecting mc lr we proved that probe mc bdkz exhibits large stokes shift moreover it shows strong fluorescence signals in the presence of mc lr in buffer solution the experiment results demonstrated that mc bdkz should possess excellent imaging ability in biological system as we all know when mc lr enters the cell through the oatp system mc lr can inhibit the intracellular protein phosphatase pp1 2a activity and make cell hyperphosphorylate jasionek et al 2010 kull et al 2004 in addition the mc lr itself contains multiple amino acid structures the mc bdkz is a fluorescence probe for sensitively sensing acid base changes thus we envisioned that mc bdkz could have a good response to exogenous mc lr in cells how to eliminate the interference of other factors in vivo and in vitro will be an issue to be solved in the practical application process first in selective experiments some acidic amino acids have a strong fluorescence signal however in the complex lake water samples titration experiment of mc bdkz to mc lr indicated that the probe showed a strong fluorescence with the increasing mc lr such results further demonstrated that the detection of mc lr could not be affected by many factors in the complex lake water system second in cell imaging experiments the acidic regions of cells were mainly concentrated in lysosomal region shen et al 2018 therefore to exclude such interference it is crucial to eliminate the fluorescence signal of lysosomes before introducing mc lr into the cells for imaging studies of mc lr in cell imaging experiments we have discussed two schemes to eliminate interference with lysosomes and amino acids in the process of mc lr imaging the second scheme is the best one as follows adjusting the microscope parameters to weaken the intracellular fluorescence signals of cells untreated with mc lr under the same conditions imaging pictures of the cells treated with mc lr were obtained fluorescence signals of cells treated with mc lr mainly came from mc lr 4 3 practical application potential to the best of our knowledge the conventional methods of mc lr mainly are divided into two categories one is to use the hplc or lc ms technology to identify the microcystins in samples baliu rodriguez et al 2020 jin et al 2021 the another is use the specific binding between mc lr antibody aptamer and mc lr to detect the concentration of mc lr bostan et al 2018 xu et al 2018 in this report we firstly successfully constructed fluorescence probe mc bdkz to directly detect mc lr in aqueous solution thus compared with the conventional detection methods table s4 fluorescence probe technology greatly reduces distance from the practical application firstly for in vitro assays the fluorescent probe technology was much simpler for mc lr detection in the lake water system than conventional technology moreover it no longer relies on expensive equipment to achieve mc lr detection this kind of technology achieves the detection of mc lr mainly by using qualitative analysis of fluorescence it is different from the traditional elasa technology and could not present false positive results secondly for in vivo assays mc bdkz has excellent optical properties and can be used for biological imaging to detect exogenous mc lr in biological system however conventional methods could not image mc lr on the subcellular level we have already known that mc lr posed a huge threat to human health and caused some diseases therefore to study the relationship between mc lr and pathological mechanism a visual research tool must be developed this tool can not only achieve the detection of mc lr in vitro but it can also track the metabolic process of mc lr in biological system however the current report focuses on in vitro detection imaging based detection is limited to simple organisms 5 conclusion in summary we designed and synthesized the fluorescence probe mc bdkz for excluding interference and detecting mc lr in natural lakes and cells for the first time the novel probe possessed excellent properties such as large stokes shift high stability and sensitive to changes in acidity in terms of the properties mentioned above mc bdkz exhibited strong fluorescence response to mc lr in aqueous phase in view of the above mentioned excellent performances this fluorescent probe not only realized the detection of mc lr in the lake water system but also completed the imaging of exogenous mc lr in cells moreover it has successfully avoided the interference sourcing the complex lake water system and other intracellular factors the response mechanism of the probe to mc lr was further explored in the process of mc lr detection compared with the conventional technologies this unique detection method possesses better convenience and greatly reduces distance from the practical application in vitro and in vivo this novel technology could provide a design idea for the scientific community to construct a functional mc lr probe with practical application value declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest
