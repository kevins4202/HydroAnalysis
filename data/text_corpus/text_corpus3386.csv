16930,at present a large amount of landfill sludge ls has been accumulated all over the world for environmental and engineering purposes there is an urgent need for deep dewatering and volume reduction of ls the deep dewatering of ls mainly uses the method of chemical preconditioning and mechanical dewatering which is easy to cause environmental pollution and is not conducive to the subsequent resource treatment of ls to find a more environmentally friendly and efficient method for deep dewatering of ls an in situ treatment method combining freeze thaw and vacuum preloading was proposed in this paper based on the existing research through compression consolidation test and mip sem micro test the consolidation properties and microstructure of ls after freeze thaw and chemical preconditioning were studied and the vacuum consolidation principle of different preconditioning was explored the results show that both fecl3 and freeze thaw preconditioning can increase the permeability coefficient and consolidation coefficient by one to two orders of magnitude after freeze thaw preconditioning the void ratio of sludge decreases and the permeability coefficient increases under low consolidation pressure the mechanical properties of the two kinds of pretreated sludge changed significantly the original sludge is mainly composed of small pores after fecl3 conditioning the large pores and mesopores increased significantly while the small pores decreased after freeze thaw the large pores and mesopores increase greatly while the small pores decrease greatly the original sludge is in the form of a dispersive flocculent structure with many impurities after freeze thaw the intercluster pores increase showing a honeycomb structure after fecl3 conditioning the sludge structure is more compact and uniform the change of microstructure and consolidation characteristics of sludge after conditioning reflects the difference of two different preconditioning mechanisms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sludge s deep dewatering freeze thaw fecl3 reagent consolidation properties microstructure properties preconditioning mechanisms 1 introduction municipal sludge is an inevitable by product in the process of municipal wastewater treatment it has high water content high organic matter content complex composition and contains a large number of parasitic eggs pathogenic microorganisms and a certain amount of toxic heavy metals dong et al 2013 o kelly 2005 in recent years with the continuous improvement of the living standards of residents worldwide urban domestic water consumption has continued to increase and the amount of sewage treatment has also continued to increase and the output of municipal sludge has also been increasing at present the main treatment methods of municipal sludge include sanitary landfills agricultural utilization drying and incineration utilization of building materials etc due to its simple operation low cost and large disposal capacity sludge sanitary landfill is a major method of early sludge treatment in developed countries in the world however there are also obvious shortcomings in the treatment of sludge landfills such as occupying a large number of land resources long treatment cycle leaching of heavy metals pollution of soil and groundwater by leachate and greenhouse gas produced by sludge fermentation moreover sludge with high water content is prone to landslide which has serious safety risks at present the landfill treatment of sludge has been banned in many countries elalami et al 2019 however landfill treatment is still widely used in china and 12 european countries kelessidis and stasinakis 2012 yang et al 2015 it is estimated that by the end of this year the annual output of municipal sludge in china will reach 90 million tons dai 2012 currently china s landfill sludge disposal accounts for more than 65 of the total disposal lin et al 2014 which not only occupies a large number of land resources but also poses a great threat to the environmental security around the reservoir area with the acceleration of china s urbanization process landfills previously located in the outer suburbs are closer and closer to the urban areas the potential environmental pollution problems have brought huge safety risks to the residents in the ls reservoir area after decades of operation the storage capacity of landfills around the country is getting smaller and smaller and many landfills are nearly saturated and become nominal landfills at present major cities in china are facing a severe task of ls s treatment and disposal there are 120 sludge landfills in laogang shanghai each sludge landfill covers an area of about 3 600 m2 occupying a lot of land resources zhan et al 2015 the sludge landfill storage capacity of chang an in chengdu xiaping in shenzhen and tianziling in hangzhou is also seriously insufficient one of the main reasons is that the water content of ls is too high zhan et al 2014 in the early stage of china s sewage treatment plants sewage treatment was paid more attention than sludge treatment yang et al 2015 insufficient investment in technical funds resulted in high moisture content about 80 and poor mechanical properties of the ls which not only resulted in a serious shortage of landfill capacity but also brought about huge safety risks for example landslide accidents of sludge landfill sites occurred in xiaping of shenzhen and taiyuan of shanxi province feng et al 2013 since 2008 the water content requirement of ls in china has been reduced from 80 to 60 cj t249 2007 2007 the new water content requirement can save at least 50 of the sludge landfill capacity due to the large amount of ls accumulated in the world coupled with the scarcity of land resources and the increasing municipal sludge the deep dewatering and reduction of ls has become a hot spot in sludge disposal and land use wu et al 2019 deep dewatering of the ls can reduce the storage capacity by at least 50 prolong the service life of the landfill and reduce the occurrence of landslide and other disasters due to the high organic matter content high bound water content and strong hydrophilicity of sludge it is difficult to reduce the water content of sludge to less than 60 by single mechanical treatment it is necessary to crack the extracellular polymer substances eps of sludge with certain pretreatment methods release free water and then conduct dewatering and reduction treatment wu et al 2020b at present the common pretreatment methods include the chemical method physical method and biological method among which chemical method has become the most commonly used pretreatment method due to its low cost the commonly used chemicals for deep dewatering of sludge include fecl3 fenton fecl3 lime fenton lime and so on fecl3 has become the most widely used chemical agent because of its low cost and simple operation hu et al 2017 found that high acid fecl3 has the function of coagulation and pyrolysis which can destroy sludge flocs and microbial cells wu et al 2019 found that fecl3 destroyed the protein in mucus and lb eps due to coagulation and acidification weakened the internal structural strength and improved the dewatering performance of sludge at present the method of chemical conditioning and plate frame pressure filtration is often used for the deep dewatering of sludge in landfill storage in this method the sludge needs to be dug out from the landfill depot transported to the designated site for treatment and then backfilled into the sludge storage there are problems such as complex processes high cost and easy to cause secondary pollution to the environment wu et al 2018b therefore it is necessary to find a low cost in situ and efficient treatment method in recent years the method of chemical conditioning combined with vacuum preloading in geotechnical engineering has been proposed and has been applied in practical engineering and achieved good results zhang et al 2020a wu et al 2021 in this method chemical agents are injected into the sludge through high pressure rotary spraying and mechanical mixing after the sludge reacts fully with the chemical agents it is inserted into the plastic drainage board pvd and the geotextile and geomembrane are laid on the upper layer for sealing finally the water in the sludge is extracted by vacuum pressure and the sludge can be compressed and consolidated under vacuum pressure to realize in situ dewatering and reduction of ls wu et al 2020a zhan et al 2013 first applied vacuum preloading technology to sludge landfill site capacity reduction treatment through laboratory and field tests the effect of fecl3 agent combined with vacuum preloading on ls s treatment was explored it was found that the technology can reduce sludge volume by 40 but the water content of sludge after treatment is still very high zhan et al 2015 lin et al 2014 used fecl3 combined with vacuum preloading to carry out a pilot test on the chang an sludge landfill and found that the sludge after treatment had very low strength and uneven moisture content distribution and further treatment was required in combination with solidification wu et al 2020a used fecl3 to carry out a vacuum preloading model test on ls in the shanghai area and the water content of sludge was reduced from 73 to 66 but the distribution of water content and unconfined compressive strength was uneven after the test it can be seen that chemical conditioning combined with vacuum preloading has achieved certain results but through laboratory tests and field construction it is found that the method still has the following problems 1 chemical agents are the most commonly used method for cracking sludge at present widely used in engineering but chemicals have potential secondary environmental pollution problems that is it is easy to cause excessive metal elements in sludge it is not conducive to the disposal of sludge as a follow up resource 2 in the process of chemical treatment strong chemical reactions need to be carried out in the sludge reservoir area to produce uncontrollable poisonous and irritating gases which pollute the air to a certain extent and threaten human activities near the sludge reservoir area 3 for the large volume of sludge the chemical cost is high and the period time is long in the field operation it is difficult for a large amount of sludge to be fully mixed with the chemical so the construction is difficult and the final treatment effect is very poor freeze thaw preconditioning can make up for the above shortcomings previous studies have shown that ice crystals formed during freezing and thawing of sludge can destroy sludge cells gao et al 2009 the eps of sludge are cracked and a large amount of bound water is released and bound water in sludge is transformed into free water that can be removed mechanically parker and collins 1999 besides during the freezing process of sludge the growing ice crystals compress and destroy the floc structure of the sludge and the sludge forms a more compact floc structure and the sedimentation performance is significantly improved hung et al 1996 ormeci and vesilind 2001 driven by the ice peak the small sludge particles continue to gather and compaction which agglomerates into large particles and the sludge particle size increases which significantly improves its dewatering capacity carrasco and gao 2019 as a kind of clean energy cold energy is cleaner and safer in the environment compared with chemical agents freezing and thawing will not produce all kinds of harmful gases and will not cause metal ions residue which is conducive to the follow up resource treatment of sludge as a kind of natural energy cold energy can greatly reduce the cost of sludge treatment by using suitable seasonal construction therefore the research group proposed a method of freeze thaw pretreatment combined with vacuum preloading for ls s treatment and conducted a comparative test with chemical pretreatment wu et al 2021 wu et al 2020b the results showed that after vacuum preloading the volume reduction ratio of freeze thaw pretreated sludge was 57 1 and the water content was reduced from 73 to 53 7 which was better than that of fecl3 pretreatment after freeze thaw the floc structure of sludge is destroyed and the particle size increases which reduces the occurrence of clogging in the process of vacuum preloading which is conducive to the drainage and consolidation of sludge however this experiment only studied the macroscopic effects of the freeze thaw combined vacuum preloading but lacked of mechanical properties such as compression and consolidation of ls after different pretreatment and microstructure characteristics of sludge pore size before and after vacuum consolidation many scholars have conducted a lot of research on the physical and mechanical properties of various engineering bodies such as undisturbed clay saline soil remolded soil and soft soil under freezing and thawing zhang et al 2020b zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 studies have shown that the freezing and thawing process changes the original structure and particle composition of various soil bodies thereby changing the mechanical properties of the soil and has a great impact on the physical and mechanical properties of the engineering body however there are few studies on the mechanical properties of ls after freezing and thawing after pretreatment the changes in mechanical properties such as consolidation and permeability of ls will affect the effect of drainage consolidation during vacuum preloading mooyoung and zimmie 1996b studied the effect of freeze thaw cycles on the permeability characteristics of paper mill sludge used as covering materials the results showed that the permeability coefficient of sludge could be increased by one to two orders of magnitude after freezing and thawing but only the change of permeability coefficient was studied and the compression and consolidation characteristics of sludge after freeze thaw were not studied zhang et al 2020a studied the compression and consolidation characteristics of sludge conditioned by fecl3 and fenton and evaluated the vacuum consolidation effect by compression test which provided a reference for chemical pretreatment combined with vacuum preloading treatment of ls it is known that the deformation of soil under stress is the comprehensive result of structural connection particle and pore deformation and the change of pore is an important manifestation of structural deformation pore size is an important parameter for quantitative analysis of soil microstructure the change of pore size directly reflects the deformation of the soil and directly reflects the internal factors of soil compression and settlement in engineering zhang et al 2012 therefore studying the law of microscopic pore changes in the consolidation process of sludge after different pretreatments can not only explain the macro engineering phenomenon but also grasp the principle of compression and consolidation of different pretreatment sludges and provide theoretical guidance for the deep dewatering of ls this paper studies the compression and consolidation characteristics and microstructure changes of ls after freeze thaw pretreatment and chemical pretreatment through consolidation test mip and sem micro test by comparing the void ratio consolidation coefficient compression index permeability coefficient as well as microstructure characteristics of pore size distribution and sem images of different pretreated sludge the effects of different pretreatments on the compression consolidation and deep dewatering of ls were explored and the principle of vacuum consolidation deformation of ls after freeze thaw pretreatment and chemical pretreatment was revealed the research results have important guiding significance for in situ dewatering and reduction treatment of ls 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge samples and site description the experimental sludge was taken from the bailonggang sludge landfill reservoir area in shanghai located at 121 43 east longitude and 31 11 north latitude as shown in fig 1 a the sludge landfill is located on the bank of the yangtze river in pudong new area with a subtropical marine monsoon climate the annual average temperature is 16 2 c and the extreme minimum temperature is 10 c it can be seen from fig 1 b that the sludge landfill area began to be landfilled in 2008 and completed in 2011 and then the top was sealed with high strength pvc membrane or plain fill which has been landfilled for 12 years a single sludge landfill reservoir has a length of 180 m a width of 100 m and a depth of about 6 8 m the amount of sludge in the whole landfill reservoir is about 1 2 million tons which takes up a lot of land and underground space the sludge sampled in this test is covered with plain fill it can be seen from fig 1 c that the vegetation of the landfill is bare and the supernatant water in the upper part of the reservoir area is seriously accumulated the basic physical characteristics of ls are shown in table 1 compared with fresh sludge wu et al 2018a it can be seen that the water content and organic matter content of ls are relatively low while the specific gravity and density are relatively large compared with conventional silt the liquid plastic limit of sludge is very high due to the high content of hydrophilic substances and organic matter in sludge feng et al 2013 o kelly 2005 according to the plasticity chart d2487 17 2020 both ls and fresh sludge are high liquid limit silt with high organic matter mho the particle size distribution curves of landfill sludge and fresh sludge are shown in the fig 2 divide the sludge particle size into sand group 2 0 075mm silty group 0 075 0 005mm clay group 0 005 0 002mm and colloidal group 0 002mm to compare the composition of fresh sludge and ls particles zhang et al 2020a it can be seen that the overall particle size of the fresh sludge is significantly larger than that of ls the fresh sludge has a high content of sand particles while the ls has a high content of clay and colloidal particles this is because the ls is degraded to a certain extent due to the influence of landfill time and anaerobic digestion and the macromolecular organic matter is decomposed into small molecular matter and inorganic matter resulting in the decrease of particle size 2 2 experimental procedure the consolidator as shown in the above fig 3 is adopted the consolidator is composed of a cutting ring permeable stone retaining ring pressure upper cover dial indicator etc previous studies have shown that the optimal freezing temperature for ls used in this test is 11 c and the optimal addition amount of fecl3 is 20 wu et al 2020b zhang et al 2020a therefore the consolidation test uses three control groups freeze thaw at 11 c 20 fecl3 and original sludge two parallel samples were set for each experimental group due to the high water content of the sludge and the softer sludge after preparation a 4 cm high ring knife was used for the experiment according to the standard for soil test method china 1999 the primary load is selected as 3 125kpa and then loaded according to 6 25 kpa 12 5 kpa 25 kpa 50 kpa and 200 kpa successively and the settlement less than 0 01mm h is regarded as the settlement stability standard record the reading of the dial indicator according to the specified time as the sludge reaches stability for a long time each stage is loaded for 48h besides six samples of three different pre conditioned sludges before and after compression and consolidation namely undisturbed sludge 11 c freeze thaw sludge and fecl3 conditioned sludge were taken and the samples were cut into about 1 1 1 cm for testing after freeze drying the mip test and sem test were carried out to explore the changes of pore distribution and microstructure during the compression and consolidation process of sludge by different preconditioning 2 3 analysis methods through the compression and consolidation test the void ratio compression index consolidation coefficient and permeability coefficient of ls under different preconditioning were calculated and analyzed the principle of the compression and consolidation test is shown in fig 4 above the initial height of the sludge sample is h0 under the external load the water and air in the sludge are gradually squeezed out and the sludge particles are squeezed together due to the restriction of the steel ring the sludge only deforms longitudinally the height is reduced to hi and the volume of sludge is continuously reduced resulting in compression deformation the void ratio of sludge under each pressure is calculated by the formula 1 1 e i e 0 δ h i h 0 1 e 0 as shown in fig 3 b as water and air squeezed out under pressure the effective stress in the sludge is increasing the sludge particles are rearranged the distance between each other becomes closer the pore volume is reduced and the soil compressibility is also reduced terzaghi et al 1996 different soil samples in nature have different particle sizes and spatial distributions resulting in different compressibility the compressibility of sludge is extremely complicated due to its high content of organic matter the compressibility of soil can be measured by the compression index cc which is equal to the slope of the compression curve by using formula 2 the compressibility index cc of different pre conditioned sludge can be calculated according to the height of the sample measured during the test 2 cc e 1 e 2 lg p 2 lg p 1 p 2 is the additional stress of each stage p 1 is the additional stress of the previous stage e 1 and e 2 correspond to the void ratio after compression stabilization under p 1 and p 2 pressure respectively according to the consolidation curve obtained from the consolidation test time t90 when the degree of consolidation reaches 90 can be calculated by the time square root method for the permeability characteristics of sludge after different preconditioning the consolidation coefficient cv under the pressure is calculated according to formula 3 and the permeability coefficient k is obtained according to formula 4 3 cv 0 848 h 2 t 90 where h h1 h0 2 t90 is the time for degree of consolidation of 90 4 k cv ρ w a v 1 e 1 where ρ w is the specific gravity of water av is the compressibility between the previous stage pressure and the current stage pressure section 3 results and discussion 3 1 the consolidation properties 3 1 1 void ratio void ratio e is the ratio of pore volume to solid particle volume in soil and it is an index to explain the structural characteristics of the soil generally speaking the smaller the e is the denser the soil is and the larger the e is the looser the soil is the void ratio of fecl3 preconditioned sludge freeze thaw sludge and undisturbed sludge varies with load the e p curve is shown in the fig 5 a above which can be seen the initial void ratio of undisturbed sludge is 4 57 the initial void ratio of preconditioned sludge with fecl3 is 6 89 and that of freeze thawed sludge is 4 23 after pre conditioning with fecl3 the void ratio of sludge increases because fecl3 mainly acts as a coagulant to promote colloid flocculation through adsorption and bridging wu et al 2020b but also produces a large amount of gas which can not be discharged completely from the sludge and part of the gas volume remains in the sludge resulting in the increase of sludge void ratio however the void ratio of sludge decreases after freeze thaw because the growing ice crystals can destroy the eps of sludge during the freezing at the same time the particles in the sludge agglomerate under the promotion of ice crystal and the floc structure of sludge is destroyed and the structure of sludge becomes more compact jean et al 1999 so the pore volume and void ratio of sludge are reduced this is also corresponding to the previous experimental results wu et al 2020b the original sludge height was 21 2 cm after freeze thaw the sludge height decreased to 17 5 cm the sludge volume decreased by 17 5 while after fecl3 conditioning the sludge height increased to 25 1 cm and the sludge volume increased by 18 4 the change of sludge void ratio after different pre conditioning can be divided into two stages one is the rapid decline stage that is under the low load of 3 125 6 25 12 5 and 25kpa the sludge void ratio decreases rapidly with the increase of pressure while when the load is greater than 25 kpa it enters the second stage that is the stable decline stage and the void ratio decreases slowly with the increase of pressure this shows that the sludge after different conditioning methods is more sensitive under low stress and has a large change in the early stage of compression and consolidation there is no skeleton between the sludge particles and the strength is low under the action of low stress the pore water is discharged smoothly the compression capacity is large and the void ratio decreases greatly a typical e log p is drawn between the void ratio e and consolidation stress p of different pretreated sludge as shown in fig 5 b the compression index cc of the soil can be obtained by fitting the following formula the compression coefficient of the soil refers to the ratio of the decrease of void ratio and the increase of effective stress under the condition of lateral limit that is the slope of the e log p straight line section 5 e cclgp e 0 in which e 0 represents the initial void ratio and cc represents the compression index the larger the compressibility index the higher the compressibility generally the higher the value of cc is the higher the compressibility is it can be seen that after fitting the cc value of the sludge after fecl3 conditioning is 1 789 while the cc value of the sludge after freeze thaw is 0 902 which is lower than 1 365 of the original sludge but still greater than 0 4 which is still a highly compressible soil some studies have shown that freeze thaw can reduce the void ratio of loose soil and increase the compactness of loose soil while the opposite is true for compact soil the increase of compactness of loose soil after freeze thaw causes a decrease in compressibility wang et al 2009 the sludge has many flocculent structures showing obvious loose jelly like colloids besides due to the existence of pre consolidation pressure the general soil will be consolidated under self weight stress and its e log p curve will show a gentle parabola in the front section and a steep straight line in the back section however the e log p curve of sludge after different preconditioning shows an approximately linear relationship which shows that there is no pre consolidation pressure of sludge and it belongs to under consolidated soil 3 1 2 coefficient of consolidation the coefficient of consolidation cv is a scalar that characterizes the rate of dissipation of excess pore water pressure during the consolidation process and is also a scalar that reflects the consolidation speed of confined soil under load its size reflects the degree of soft soil consolidation the greater the consolidation coefficient is the faster the consolidation speed is and vice versa the time square root method can be used to obtain the curves of different pre conditioned sludge with the consolidation pressure as shown in fig 6 a as can be seen the consolidation coefficient of original sludge changes in the order of 10 5 cm2 s 1 after freezing and thawing the consolidation coefficient of sludge changes in the order of 10 4 cm2 s 1 and after fecl3 conditioning the consolidation coefficient of sludge changes in the order of 10 3 10 4 cm2 s 1 compared with the conventional silt of 10 4 cm2 s 1 the consolidation coefficient of the original sludge is very low however after freeze thaw treatment and fecl3 conditioning the sludge consolidation coefficient increased by one to two orders of magnitude this is due to the high content of organic matter in the sludge generally 40 60 resulting in a very complicated water form in the sludge in addition to pore water and surface bound water there is also a large amount of internal bound water vaxelaire and cezac 2004 due to the bonds and interactions between the hydrophilic groups and water molecules of the organic matter the water in the sludge is difficult to discharge quickly and the pore water pressure dissipates for a long time resulting in a low consolidation coefficient of the original sludge after freeze thaw and fecl3 conditioning eps in sludge is cracked and bound water is released which greatly shortens the consolidation time and improves the consolidation coefficient similar to the change law of void ratio the change of sludge consolidation coefficient can also be divided into two stages namely the rapid decline stage and the steady decline stage under the low load of 3 125 6 25 12 5 and 25 kpa the consolidation coefficient of sludge changed obviously in particular after fecl3 conditioning the sludge decreased from 1 73 10 4 cm2 s 1 to 9 31 10 4 cm2 s 1 and the change of sludge consolidation coefficient after freezing and thawing was relatively small from 4 10 10 4 cm2 s 1 to 2 54 10 4 cm2 s 1 this is because fecl3 mainly plays the role of acidification hydrolysis and coagulant hu et al 2017 and promotes colloidal flocculation through adsorption and bridging to increase the volume and void ratio of sludge resulting in an extremely sensitive change of sludge under low load and significant reduction of consolidation coefficient under small consolidation pressure however after freezing and thawing the flocculent structure of the sludge is destroyed the particle size of the sludge increases and the overall structure becomes denser jean et al 1999 tao et al 2006 the volume of the sludge decreases and the void ratio decreases the consolidation coefficient changes relatively small this also corresponds to the result of vacuum preloading wu et al 2020b the height of freeze thaw sludge is reduced by 8 4 cm and the height of fecl3 preconditioning sludge is reduced by 12 6 cm after vacuum preloading and drainage consolidation according to the void ratio e and the consolidation coefficient lg cv of the sludge under various pressures the variation curve of the consolidation coefficient lg k with the void ratio is obtained as shown in fig 6 b it can be seen that e and log cv are approximately linear the consolidation coefficient of sludge pretreated by freeze thaw and fecl3 decreases with the decrease of void ratio the consolidation coefficient of sludge decreases with pressure in the process of compression consolidation which is attributed to the decrease of void ratio during consolidation pressure feng et al 2013 however at the same void ratio the change of consolidation coefficient of sludge after freeze thaw is almost the same as that of sludge treated with fecl3 which indicates that the two kinds of preconditioning can effectively improve the consolidation rate of sludge 3 1 3 coefficient of permeability according to the consolidation coefficient the permeability coefficient k of ls under various consolidation pressures can be calculated as shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the variation law of the permeability coefficient is similar to that of the consolidation coefficient under the low consolidation pressure of 3 125 6 25 12 5 and 25 kpa the permeability coefficient of freeze thaw sludge and fecl3 conditioning sludge changes significantly which is because the macropores are compressed into small pores or closed pores and the rapid reduction of pore ratio leads to drainage difficulties and rapid reduction of permeability coefficient zhang et al 2020a when the load is greater than 25 kpa the void ratio decreases slowly with the increase of pressure and the sludge compressibility decreases which leads to the slow decrease of the permeability coefficient the permeability coefficient of original sludge changes in the order of 10 8 10 9 cm2 s 1 the permeability coefficient of sludge after fecl3 conditioning changes in the order of 10 6 10 8 cm2 s 1 and the permeability coefficient of sludge after freeze thaw changes in the order of 10 6 10 8 cm2 s 1 the original sludge due to its small particles high organic matter content and thick combined water film between the sludge particles blocks the pores between the sludge particles clogging the seepage channel in the sludge resulting in a low permeability coefficient feng et al 2013 both fecl3 preconditioning and freeze thaw preconditioning can increase the permeability coefficient of sludge by one to two orders of magnitude under the first level of load the permeability coefficient of fecl3 is 4 15 10 6 cm2 s 1 and the permeability coefficient of freeze thaw sludge is 1 64 10 6 cm2 s 1 and the permeability coefficient of the original sludge is 9 11 10 6 cm2 s 1 the permeability coefficient of sludge treated with fecl3 is higher than that of freeze thaw sludge which is due to the increase of pores and the larger void ratio in the sludge after fecl3 conditioning and the permeability coefficient depends on the effective stress and void ratio mooyoung and zimmie 1996a however freeze thaw makes the permeability coefficient of sludge increase and the void ratio decrease which is consistent with the research results of mooyoung and zimmie 1996b on freeze thaw sludge and is similar to the basic characteristics of clay edwin and anthony 1979 from the macroscopic point of view it is explained that shrinkage cracks occur during the freeze thaw process and large pores remain after the ice crystal melts benson and othman 1993 fig 7 b shows the relationship between permeability coefficient log k and void ratio e of different pretreated sludge it can be seen that with the decrease of the void ratio the permeability coefficient of sludge also decreases gradually on the contrary the permeability coefficient increases and the relationship between e and log k is approximately linear which is similar to the curve of e and log cv in the overlapped void ratio range the permeability coefficient of freeze thaw sludge is the highest and the dewatering performance is the best under the same void ratio in the range of coincident void ratio the permeability coefficient of frozen thawed sludge is the highest and the dewatering performance is the best under the same void ratio this is because after freezing and thawing the floc structure is destroyed the bound water content decreases the sludge particle size increases and the permeability coefficient increases significantly carrasco and gao 2019 it can also be seen from the total water discharge and drainage rate of vacuum preloading wu et al 2020b the final water discharge of freeze thaw is 1 2 times that of ls conditioned by fecl3 and the drainage rate of freeze thaw sludge is higher 3 2 the microstructure properties 3 2 1 pore size analysis as the floc structure of the sludge is destroyed during the freeze thaw process the eps is cracked the combined water content is reduced the particle composition and arrangement of the sludge are changed and the pore size distribution also changes according to the mip data the pore size distribution curves of freeze thaw sludge fecl3 conditioning sludge and original sludge before vacuum drainage consolidation are obtained as shown in fig 8 to facilitate the discussion the pore size is classified micropores 0 1μm mesoporous 0 1 1μm small pores 1 1μm mesopores 10 100μm large pores 100μm hu et al 2016 according to the classification method of shear et al 1993 micropores are mainly intraparticle pores mesoporous are interparticle pores small pores are intraggregation pores mesopores and large pores are intercluster pores as can be seen from the above figure the original sludge is mainly composed of small pores that is there are many intraggregation pores this is because when fecl3 acts on the sludge the sludge cells will be acidified and hydrolyzed the floc structure in the sludge will be destroyed a large number of colloidal particles will be produced and a large number of gases will also be produced these gases can not be completely discharged from the sludge and some gases will accumulate in the sludge resulting in the increase of sludge void ratio the increase of large and mesopores and the increase of intercluster pores at the same time fecl3 mainly acts as a coagulant and promotes colloidal particles flocculation through adsorption and bridging reducing the small pores in the sludge and increasing the permeability coefficient compared with the original sludge and the sludge pretreated with fecl3 the large and medium pores of the sludge after freeze thaw treatment increased significantly and the small pores decreased greatly that is the intercluster pores increased significantly this is because in the freezing process under the action of huge frost heaving force small pores are compressed and pore volume decreases and a large part of this compression is irreversible the free water in the sludge and the bound water in the sludge cells migrate to the ice front and redistribute to form an ice lens with the continuous growth of ice crystals the eps of sludge are cracked the flocculent structure is destroyed and sludge particles are extruded to form new aggregates and the particle size increases carrasco and gao 2019 at the same time the morphology of pores will be changed and small pores will be merged into mesopores and large pores when thawing the ice thaws into pore water although the frost heaving force disappears the larger pores formed during the freezing process remain therefore after freeze thaw the small pores decrease while the mesopores and large pores increase and the macroscopic phenomenon shows that although the void ratio decreases the permeability coefficient increases tang and yan 2019 in fine grained soil the characteristics of mesopores and large pores often reflect the change of permeability this also corresponds to that the total water discharge and drainage rate of the ls after freeze thaw are better than those after fecl3 conditioning wu et al 2020b by comparing the pore size distribution curves of three different preconditioning sludge after drainage and consolidation as shown in the fig 9 it can be seen that the content of large pores and mesopores in freeze thaw sludge and fecl3 conditioning sludge is still higher than that of the original sludge and the characteristics of large pores and mesopores often determine the changes in its permeability characteristics tang and yan 2019 this also shows that the seepage channels of the two different preconditioned sludges are smooth during consolidation and drainage after freeze thaw the distribution of large pores and mesopores of sludge is higher than that of fecl3 that is there are more intercluster pores which indicates that the seepage channel of sludge after freeze thaw is more smooth this is also corresponding to the law of drainage under vacuum preloading after freeze thaw the sludge has more water discharge greater compression better permeability and better drainage consolidation effect wu et al 2020b undisturbed sludge is mainly distributed in micropores mesoporous and small pores that is the intraggregation pores and intercluster pores are mainly distributed which is easy to cause the seepage channel clogging which is also the main reason why the original sludge is difficult to consolidate and drain 3 2 2 sem analysis for a more intuitive comparison the sem images magnified 400 times are selected for analysis of the sludge after different pretreatments as shown in fig 10 it can be seen from the figure that the original sludge has a loose structure many impurities dispersed floc structure and many interparticle pores after freeze thaw the large pores and mesopores of the sludge obviously increase the large particles increase the intercluster pores increase the surface is denser and uniform the integrity is better and the structure is the honeycomb this indicates that after freeze thaw the structure of sludge flocs was destroyed eps in sludge was cracked and bound water was released the small particles agglomerated into large particles under the promotion of ice crystal and the size of sludge particles increased and the large pores and mesopores increased which also corresponded to the results of mip after treatment with fecl3 the structure of sludge is more compact and uniform and the interparticle pores are increased the sludge particles are closely and regularly bonded and the pores are evenly distributed which is also corresponding to the increase of sludge void ratio permeability coefficient and large and mesopores after treatment with fecl3 from the sem images it can be seen that the two pretreatment methods have different effects on the microstructure of sludge reflecting the different mechanisms of the two pretreatment methods 4 conclusion 1 the initial void ratio of original sludge was 4 57 which increased to 6 89 after conditioning with fecl3 and decreased to 4 23 after freeze thaw the cc of sludge treated with fecl3 was 1 789 while that of freeze thawed sludge was 0 902 which was lower than 1 365 of the original sludge but still higher than 0 4 which belonged to high compressibility soil freeze thaw can reduce the pore ratio and increase the density of sludge different pretreated sludge has no pre consolidation pressure which belongs to under consolidated soil 2 the consolidation coefficient of original sludge changes in the order of 10 5 cm2 s 1 after freezing and thawing the consolidation coefficient of sludge changes in the order of 10 4 cm2 s 1 and after fecl3 conditioning the consolidation coefficient of sludge changes in the order of 10 3 10 4 cm2 s 1 after freeze thaw treatment and fecl3 conditioning the sludge consolidation coefficient increased by one to two orders of magnitude under the same void ratio the change of consolidation coefficient of sludge after freeze thaw is almost the same as that of sludge treated with fecl3 3 the permeability coefficient of original sludge changes in the order of 10 8 10 9 cm2 s 1 the permeability coefficient of sludge after fecl3 conditioning changes in the order of 10 6 10 8 cm2 s 1 and the permeability coefficient of sludge after freeze thaw changes in the order of 10 6 10 8 cm2 s 1 both fecl3 preconditioning and freeze thaw preconditioning can increase the permeability coefficient of sludge by one to two orders freeze thaw makes the permeability coefficient of sludge increase and the void ratio decrease from the macroscopic point of view 4 under the low load of less than 25 kpa the void ratio consolidation coefficient and permeability coefficient of sludge change obviously and the change of mechanical properties of sludge under low load is extremely sensitive 5 the original sludge is mainly composed of small pores after fecl3 conditioning the large pores and mesopores increase the small pores are reduced after freeze thaw the large and mesopores of sludge increase significantly while the small pores decrease greatly that is the intercluster pores increase significantly 6 sem images show that the original sludge has a loose structure many impurities dispersed floc structure and many interparticle pores after freeze thaw the large pores and mesopores of the sludge obviously increase the surface is denser and uniform the integrity is better and the structure is the honeycomb after treatment with fecl3 the structure of sludge is more compact and uniform and the interparticle pores are increased the sludge particles are closely and regularly bonded and the pores are evenly distributed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16930,at present a large amount of landfill sludge ls has been accumulated all over the world for environmental and engineering purposes there is an urgent need for deep dewatering and volume reduction of ls the deep dewatering of ls mainly uses the method of chemical preconditioning and mechanical dewatering which is easy to cause environmental pollution and is not conducive to the subsequent resource treatment of ls to find a more environmentally friendly and efficient method for deep dewatering of ls an in situ treatment method combining freeze thaw and vacuum preloading was proposed in this paper based on the existing research through compression consolidation test and mip sem micro test the consolidation properties and microstructure of ls after freeze thaw and chemical preconditioning were studied and the vacuum consolidation principle of different preconditioning was explored the results show that both fecl3 and freeze thaw preconditioning can increase the permeability coefficient and consolidation coefficient by one to two orders of magnitude after freeze thaw preconditioning the void ratio of sludge decreases and the permeability coefficient increases under low consolidation pressure the mechanical properties of the two kinds of pretreated sludge changed significantly the original sludge is mainly composed of small pores after fecl3 conditioning the large pores and mesopores increased significantly while the small pores decreased after freeze thaw the large pores and mesopores increase greatly while the small pores decrease greatly the original sludge is in the form of a dispersive flocculent structure with many impurities after freeze thaw the intercluster pores increase showing a honeycomb structure after fecl3 conditioning the sludge structure is more compact and uniform the change of microstructure and consolidation characteristics of sludge after conditioning reflects the difference of two different preconditioning mechanisms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sludge s deep dewatering freeze thaw fecl3 reagent consolidation properties microstructure properties preconditioning mechanisms 1 introduction municipal sludge is an inevitable by product in the process of municipal wastewater treatment it has high water content high organic matter content complex composition and contains a large number of parasitic eggs pathogenic microorganisms and a certain amount of toxic heavy metals dong et al 2013 o kelly 2005 in recent years with the continuous improvement of the living standards of residents worldwide urban domestic water consumption has continued to increase and the amount of sewage treatment has also continued to increase and the output of municipal sludge has also been increasing at present the main treatment methods of municipal sludge include sanitary landfills agricultural utilization drying and incineration utilization of building materials etc due to its simple operation low cost and large disposal capacity sludge sanitary landfill is a major method of early sludge treatment in developed countries in the world however there are also obvious shortcomings in the treatment of sludge landfills such as occupying a large number of land resources long treatment cycle leaching of heavy metals pollution of soil and groundwater by leachate and greenhouse gas produced by sludge fermentation moreover sludge with high water content is prone to landslide which has serious safety risks at present the landfill treatment of sludge has been banned in many countries elalami et al 2019 however landfill treatment is still widely used in china and 12 european countries kelessidis and stasinakis 2012 yang et al 2015 it is estimated that by the end of this year the annual output of municipal sludge in china will reach 90 million tons dai 2012 currently china s landfill sludge disposal accounts for more than 65 of the total disposal lin et al 2014 which not only occupies a large number of land resources but also poses a great threat to the environmental security around the reservoir area with the acceleration of china s urbanization process landfills previously located in the outer suburbs are closer and closer to the urban areas the potential environmental pollution problems have brought huge safety risks to the residents in the ls reservoir area after decades of operation the storage capacity of landfills around the country is getting smaller and smaller and many landfills are nearly saturated and become nominal landfills at present major cities in china are facing a severe task of ls s treatment and disposal there are 120 sludge landfills in laogang shanghai each sludge landfill covers an area of about 3 600 m2 occupying a lot of land resources zhan et al 2015 the sludge landfill storage capacity of chang an in chengdu xiaping in shenzhen and tianziling in hangzhou is also seriously insufficient one of the main reasons is that the water content of ls is too high zhan et al 2014 in the early stage of china s sewage treatment plants sewage treatment was paid more attention than sludge treatment yang et al 2015 insufficient investment in technical funds resulted in high moisture content about 80 and poor mechanical properties of the ls which not only resulted in a serious shortage of landfill capacity but also brought about huge safety risks for example landslide accidents of sludge landfill sites occurred in xiaping of shenzhen and taiyuan of shanxi province feng et al 2013 since 2008 the water content requirement of ls in china has been reduced from 80 to 60 cj t249 2007 2007 the new water content requirement can save at least 50 of the sludge landfill capacity due to the large amount of ls accumulated in the world coupled with the scarcity of land resources and the increasing municipal sludge the deep dewatering and reduction of ls has become a hot spot in sludge disposal and land use wu et al 2019 deep dewatering of the ls can reduce the storage capacity by at least 50 prolong the service life of the landfill and reduce the occurrence of landslide and other disasters due to the high organic matter content high bound water content and strong hydrophilicity of sludge it is difficult to reduce the water content of sludge to less than 60 by single mechanical treatment it is necessary to crack the extracellular polymer substances eps of sludge with certain pretreatment methods release free water and then conduct dewatering and reduction treatment wu et al 2020b at present the common pretreatment methods include the chemical method physical method and biological method among which chemical method has become the most commonly used pretreatment method due to its low cost the commonly used chemicals for deep dewatering of sludge include fecl3 fenton fecl3 lime fenton lime and so on fecl3 has become the most widely used chemical agent because of its low cost and simple operation hu et al 2017 found that high acid fecl3 has the function of coagulation and pyrolysis which can destroy sludge flocs and microbial cells wu et al 2019 found that fecl3 destroyed the protein in mucus and lb eps due to coagulation and acidification weakened the internal structural strength and improved the dewatering performance of sludge at present the method of chemical conditioning and plate frame pressure filtration is often used for the deep dewatering of sludge in landfill storage in this method the sludge needs to be dug out from the landfill depot transported to the designated site for treatment and then backfilled into the sludge storage there are problems such as complex processes high cost and easy to cause secondary pollution to the environment wu et al 2018b therefore it is necessary to find a low cost in situ and efficient treatment method in recent years the method of chemical conditioning combined with vacuum preloading in geotechnical engineering has been proposed and has been applied in practical engineering and achieved good results zhang et al 2020a wu et al 2021 in this method chemical agents are injected into the sludge through high pressure rotary spraying and mechanical mixing after the sludge reacts fully with the chemical agents it is inserted into the plastic drainage board pvd and the geotextile and geomembrane are laid on the upper layer for sealing finally the water in the sludge is extracted by vacuum pressure and the sludge can be compressed and consolidated under vacuum pressure to realize in situ dewatering and reduction of ls wu et al 2020a zhan et al 2013 first applied vacuum preloading technology to sludge landfill site capacity reduction treatment through laboratory and field tests the effect of fecl3 agent combined with vacuum preloading on ls s treatment was explored it was found that the technology can reduce sludge volume by 40 but the water content of sludge after treatment is still very high zhan et al 2015 lin et al 2014 used fecl3 combined with vacuum preloading to carry out a pilot test on the chang an sludge landfill and found that the sludge after treatment had very low strength and uneven moisture content distribution and further treatment was required in combination with solidification wu et al 2020a used fecl3 to carry out a vacuum preloading model test on ls in the shanghai area and the water content of sludge was reduced from 73 to 66 but the distribution of water content and unconfined compressive strength was uneven after the test it can be seen that chemical conditioning combined with vacuum preloading has achieved certain results but through laboratory tests and field construction it is found that the method still has the following problems 1 chemical agents are the most commonly used method for cracking sludge at present widely used in engineering but chemicals have potential secondary environmental pollution problems that is it is easy to cause excessive metal elements in sludge it is not conducive to the disposal of sludge as a follow up resource 2 in the process of chemical treatment strong chemical reactions need to be carried out in the sludge reservoir area to produce uncontrollable poisonous and irritating gases which pollute the air to a certain extent and threaten human activities near the sludge reservoir area 3 for the large volume of sludge the chemical cost is high and the period time is long in the field operation it is difficult for a large amount of sludge to be fully mixed with the chemical so the construction is difficult and the final treatment effect is very poor freeze thaw preconditioning can make up for the above shortcomings previous studies have shown that ice crystals formed during freezing and thawing of sludge can destroy sludge cells gao et al 2009 the eps of sludge are cracked and a large amount of bound water is released and bound water in sludge is transformed into free water that can be removed mechanically parker and collins 1999 besides during the freezing process of sludge the growing ice crystals compress and destroy the floc structure of the sludge and the sludge forms a more compact floc structure and the sedimentation performance is significantly improved hung et al 1996 ormeci and vesilind 2001 driven by the ice peak the small sludge particles continue to gather and compaction which agglomerates into large particles and the sludge particle size increases which significantly improves its dewatering capacity carrasco and gao 2019 as a kind of clean energy cold energy is cleaner and safer in the environment compared with chemical agents freezing and thawing will not produce all kinds of harmful gases and will not cause metal ions residue which is conducive to the follow up resource treatment of sludge as a kind of natural energy cold energy can greatly reduce the cost of sludge treatment by using suitable seasonal construction therefore the research group proposed a method of freeze thaw pretreatment combined with vacuum preloading for ls s treatment and conducted a comparative test with chemical pretreatment wu et al 2021 wu et al 2020b the results showed that after vacuum preloading the volume reduction ratio of freeze thaw pretreated sludge was 57 1 and the water content was reduced from 73 to 53 7 which was better than that of fecl3 pretreatment after freeze thaw the floc structure of sludge is destroyed and the particle size increases which reduces the occurrence of clogging in the process of vacuum preloading which is conducive to the drainage and consolidation of sludge however this experiment only studied the macroscopic effects of the freeze thaw combined vacuum preloading but lacked of mechanical properties such as compression and consolidation of ls after different pretreatment and microstructure characteristics of sludge pore size before and after vacuum consolidation many scholars have conducted a lot of research on the physical and mechanical properties of various engineering bodies such as undisturbed clay saline soil remolded soil and soft soil under freezing and thawing zhang et al 2020b zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 studies have shown that the freezing and thawing process changes the original structure and particle composition of various soil bodies thereby changing the mechanical properties of the soil and has a great impact on the physical and mechanical properties of the engineering body however there are few studies on the mechanical properties of ls after freezing and thawing after pretreatment the changes in mechanical properties such as consolidation and permeability of ls will affect the effect of drainage consolidation during vacuum preloading mooyoung and zimmie 1996b studied the effect of freeze thaw cycles on the permeability characteristics of paper mill sludge used as covering materials the results showed that the permeability coefficient of sludge could be increased by one to two orders of magnitude after freezing and thawing but only the change of permeability coefficient was studied and the compression and consolidation characteristics of sludge after freeze thaw were not studied zhang et al 2020a studied the compression and consolidation characteristics of sludge conditioned by fecl3 and fenton and evaluated the vacuum consolidation effect by compression test which provided a reference for chemical pretreatment combined with vacuum preloading treatment of ls it is known that the deformation of soil under stress is the comprehensive result of structural connection particle and pore deformation and the change of pore is an important manifestation of structural deformation pore size is an important parameter for quantitative analysis of soil microstructure the change of pore size directly reflects the deformation of the soil and directly reflects the internal factors of soil compression and settlement in engineering zhang et al 2012 therefore studying the law of microscopic pore changes in the consolidation process of sludge after different pretreatments can not only explain the macro engineering phenomenon but also grasp the principle of compression and consolidation of different pretreatment sludges and provide theoretical guidance for the deep dewatering of ls this paper studies the compression and consolidation characteristics and microstructure changes of ls after freeze thaw pretreatment and chemical pretreatment through consolidation test mip and sem micro test by comparing the void ratio consolidation coefficient compression index permeability coefficient as well as microstructure characteristics of pore size distribution and sem images of different pretreated sludge the effects of different pretreatments on the compression consolidation and deep dewatering of ls were explored and the principle of vacuum consolidation deformation of ls after freeze thaw pretreatment and chemical pretreatment was revealed the research results have important guiding significance for in situ dewatering and reduction treatment of ls 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge samples and site description the experimental sludge was taken from the bailonggang sludge landfill reservoir area in shanghai located at 121 43 east longitude and 31 11 north latitude as shown in fig 1 a the sludge landfill is located on the bank of the yangtze river in pudong new area with a subtropical marine monsoon climate the annual average temperature is 16 2 c and the extreme minimum temperature is 10 c it can be seen from fig 1 b that the sludge landfill area began to be landfilled in 2008 and completed in 2011 and then the top was sealed with high strength pvc membrane or plain fill which has been landfilled for 12 years a single sludge landfill reservoir has a length of 180 m a width of 100 m and a depth of about 6 8 m the amount of sludge in the whole landfill reservoir is about 1 2 million tons which takes up a lot of land and underground space the sludge sampled in this test is covered with plain fill it can be seen from fig 1 c that the vegetation of the landfill is bare and the supernatant water in the upper part of the reservoir area is seriously accumulated the basic physical characteristics of ls are shown in table 1 compared with fresh sludge wu et al 2018a it can be seen that the water content and organic matter content of ls are relatively low while the specific gravity and density are relatively large compared with conventional silt the liquid plastic limit of sludge is very high due to the high content of hydrophilic substances and organic matter in sludge feng et al 2013 o kelly 2005 according to the plasticity chart d2487 17 2020 both ls and fresh sludge are high liquid limit silt with high organic matter mho the particle size distribution curves of landfill sludge and fresh sludge are shown in the fig 2 divide the sludge particle size into sand group 2 0 075mm silty group 0 075 0 005mm clay group 0 005 0 002mm and colloidal group 0 002mm to compare the composition of fresh sludge and ls particles zhang et al 2020a it can be seen that the overall particle size of the fresh sludge is significantly larger than that of ls the fresh sludge has a high content of sand particles while the ls has a high content of clay and colloidal particles this is because the ls is degraded to a certain extent due to the influence of landfill time and anaerobic digestion and the macromolecular organic matter is decomposed into small molecular matter and inorganic matter resulting in the decrease of particle size 2 2 experimental procedure the consolidator as shown in the above fig 3 is adopted the consolidator is composed of a cutting ring permeable stone retaining ring pressure upper cover dial indicator etc previous studies have shown that the optimal freezing temperature for ls used in this test is 11 c and the optimal addition amount of fecl3 is 20 wu et al 2020b zhang et al 2020a therefore the consolidation test uses three control groups freeze thaw at 11 c 20 fecl3 and original sludge two parallel samples were set for each experimental group due to the high water content of the sludge and the softer sludge after preparation a 4 cm high ring knife was used for the experiment according to the standard for soil test method china 1999 the primary load is selected as 3 125kpa and then loaded according to 6 25 kpa 12 5 kpa 25 kpa 50 kpa and 200 kpa successively and the settlement less than 0 01mm h is regarded as the settlement stability standard record the reading of the dial indicator according to the specified time as the sludge reaches stability for a long time each stage is loaded for 48h besides six samples of three different pre conditioned sludges before and after compression and consolidation namely undisturbed sludge 11 c freeze thaw sludge and fecl3 conditioned sludge were taken and the samples were cut into about 1 1 1 cm for testing after freeze drying the mip test and sem test were carried out to explore the changes of pore distribution and microstructure during the compression and consolidation process of sludge by different preconditioning 2 3 analysis methods through the compression and consolidation test the void ratio compression index consolidation coefficient and permeability coefficient of ls under different preconditioning were calculated and analyzed the principle of the compression and consolidation test is shown in fig 4 above the initial height of the sludge sample is h0 under the external load the water and air in the sludge are gradually squeezed out and the sludge particles are squeezed together due to the restriction of the steel ring the sludge only deforms longitudinally the height is reduced to hi and the volume of sludge is continuously reduced resulting in compression deformation the void ratio of sludge under each pressure is calculated by the formula 1 1 e i e 0 δ h i h 0 1 e 0 as shown in fig 3 b as water and air squeezed out under pressure the effective stress in the sludge is increasing the sludge particles are rearranged the distance between each other becomes closer the pore volume is reduced and the soil compressibility is also reduced terzaghi et al 1996 different soil samples in nature have different particle sizes and spatial distributions resulting in different compressibility the compressibility of sludge is extremely complicated due to its high content of organic matter the compressibility of soil can be measured by the compression index cc which is equal to the slope of the compression curve by using formula 2 the compressibility index cc of different pre conditioned sludge can be calculated according to the height of the sample measured during the test 2 cc e 1 e 2 lg p 2 lg p 1 p 2 is the additional stress of each stage p 1 is the additional stress of the previous stage e 1 and e 2 correspond to the void ratio after compression stabilization under p 1 and p 2 pressure respectively according to the consolidation curve obtained from the consolidation test time t90 when the degree of consolidation reaches 90 can be calculated by the time square root method for the permeability characteristics of sludge after different preconditioning the consolidation coefficient cv under the pressure is calculated according to formula 3 and the permeability coefficient k is obtained according to formula 4 3 cv 0 848 h 2 t 90 where h h1 h0 2 t90 is the time for degree of consolidation of 90 4 k cv ρ w a v 1 e 1 where ρ w is the specific gravity of water av is the compressibility between the previous stage pressure and the current stage pressure section 3 results and discussion 3 1 the consolidation properties 3 1 1 void ratio void ratio e is the ratio of pore volume to solid particle volume in soil and it is an index to explain the structural characteristics of the soil generally speaking the smaller the e is the denser the soil is and the larger the e is the looser the soil is the void ratio of fecl3 preconditioned sludge freeze thaw sludge and undisturbed sludge varies with load the e p curve is shown in the fig 5 a above which can be seen the initial void ratio of undisturbed sludge is 4 57 the initial void ratio of preconditioned sludge with fecl3 is 6 89 and that of freeze thawed sludge is 4 23 after pre conditioning with fecl3 the void ratio of sludge increases because fecl3 mainly acts as a coagulant to promote colloid flocculation through adsorption and bridging wu et al 2020b but also produces a large amount of gas which can not be discharged completely from the sludge and part of the gas volume remains in the sludge resulting in the increase of sludge void ratio however the void ratio of sludge decreases after freeze thaw because the growing ice crystals can destroy the eps of sludge during the freezing at the same time the particles in the sludge agglomerate under the promotion of ice crystal and the floc structure of sludge is destroyed and the structure of sludge becomes more compact jean et al 1999 so the pore volume and void ratio of sludge are reduced this is also corresponding to the previous experimental results wu et al 2020b the original sludge height was 21 2 cm after freeze thaw the sludge height decreased to 17 5 cm the sludge volume decreased by 17 5 while after fecl3 conditioning the sludge height increased to 25 1 cm and the sludge volume increased by 18 4 the change of sludge void ratio after different pre conditioning can be divided into two stages one is the rapid decline stage that is under the low load of 3 125 6 25 12 5 and 25kpa the sludge void ratio decreases rapidly with the increase of pressure while when the load is greater than 25 kpa it enters the second stage that is the stable decline stage and the void ratio decreases slowly with the increase of pressure this shows that the sludge after different conditioning methods is more sensitive under low stress and has a large change in the early stage of compression and consolidation there is no skeleton between the sludge particles and the strength is low under the action of low stress the pore water is discharged smoothly the compression capacity is large and the void ratio decreases greatly a typical e log p is drawn between the void ratio e and consolidation stress p of different pretreated sludge as shown in fig 5 b the compression index cc of the soil can be obtained by fitting the following formula the compression coefficient of the soil refers to the ratio of the decrease of void ratio and the increase of effective stress under the condition of lateral limit that is the slope of the e log p straight line section 5 e cclgp e 0 in which e 0 represents the initial void ratio and cc represents the compression index the larger the compressibility index the higher the compressibility generally the higher the value of cc is the higher the compressibility is it can be seen that after fitting the cc value of the sludge after fecl3 conditioning is 1 789 while the cc value of the sludge after freeze thaw is 0 902 which is lower than 1 365 of the original sludge but still greater than 0 4 which is still a highly compressible soil some studies have shown that freeze thaw can reduce the void ratio of loose soil and increase the compactness of loose soil while the opposite is true for compact soil the increase of compactness of loose soil after freeze thaw causes a decrease in compressibility wang et al 2009 the sludge has many flocculent structures showing obvious loose jelly like colloids besides due to the existence of pre consolidation pressure the general soil will be consolidated under self weight stress and its e log p curve will show a gentle parabola in the front section and a steep straight line in the back section however the e log p curve of sludge after different preconditioning shows an approximately linear relationship which shows that there is no pre consolidation pressure of sludge and it belongs to under consolidated soil 3 1 2 coefficient of consolidation the coefficient of consolidation cv is a scalar that characterizes the rate of dissipation of excess pore water pressure during the consolidation process and is also a scalar that reflects the consolidation speed of confined soil under load its size reflects the degree of soft soil consolidation the greater the consolidation coefficient is the faster the consolidation speed is and vice versa the time square root method can be used to obtain the curves of different pre conditioned sludge with the consolidation pressure as shown in fig 6 a as can be seen the consolidation coefficient of original sludge changes in the order of 10 5 cm2 s 1 after freezing and thawing the consolidation coefficient of sludge changes in the order of 10 4 cm2 s 1 and after fecl3 conditioning the consolidation coefficient of sludge changes in the order of 10 3 10 4 cm2 s 1 compared with the conventional silt of 10 4 cm2 s 1 the consolidation coefficient of the original sludge is very low however after freeze thaw treatment and fecl3 conditioning the sludge consolidation coefficient increased by one to two orders of magnitude this is due to the high content of organic matter in the sludge generally 40 60 resulting in a very complicated water form in the sludge in addition to pore water and surface bound water there is also a large amount of internal bound water vaxelaire and cezac 2004 due to the bonds and interactions between the hydrophilic groups and water molecules of the organic matter the water in the sludge is difficult to discharge quickly and the pore water pressure dissipates for a long time resulting in a low consolidation coefficient of the original sludge after freeze thaw and fecl3 conditioning eps in sludge is cracked and bound water is released which greatly shortens the consolidation time and improves the consolidation coefficient similar to the change law of void ratio the change of sludge consolidation coefficient can also be divided into two stages namely the rapid decline stage and the steady decline stage under the low load of 3 125 6 25 12 5 and 25 kpa the consolidation coefficient of sludge changed obviously in particular after fecl3 conditioning the sludge decreased from 1 73 10 4 cm2 s 1 to 9 31 10 4 cm2 s 1 and the change of sludge consolidation coefficient after freezing and thawing was relatively small from 4 10 10 4 cm2 s 1 to 2 54 10 4 cm2 s 1 this is because fecl3 mainly plays the role of acidification hydrolysis and coagulant hu et al 2017 and promotes colloidal flocculation through adsorption and bridging to increase the volume and void ratio of sludge resulting in an extremely sensitive change of sludge under low load and significant reduction of consolidation coefficient under small consolidation pressure however after freezing and thawing the flocculent structure of the sludge is destroyed the particle size of the sludge increases and the overall structure becomes denser jean et al 1999 tao et al 2006 the volume of the sludge decreases and the void ratio decreases the consolidation coefficient changes relatively small this also corresponds to the result of vacuum preloading wu et al 2020b the height of freeze thaw sludge is reduced by 8 4 cm and the height of fecl3 preconditioning sludge is reduced by 12 6 cm after vacuum preloading and drainage consolidation according to the void ratio e and the consolidation coefficient lg cv of the sludge under various pressures the variation curve of the consolidation coefficient lg k with the void ratio is obtained as shown in fig 6 b it can be seen that e and log cv are approximately linear the consolidation coefficient of sludge pretreated by freeze thaw and fecl3 decreases with the decrease of void ratio the consolidation coefficient of sludge decreases with pressure in the process of compression consolidation which is attributed to the decrease of void ratio during consolidation pressure feng et al 2013 however at the same void ratio the change of consolidation coefficient of sludge after freeze thaw is almost the same as that of sludge treated with fecl3 which indicates that the two kinds of preconditioning can effectively improve the consolidation rate of sludge 3 1 3 coefficient of permeability according to the consolidation coefficient the permeability coefficient k of ls under various consolidation pressures can be calculated as shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the variation law of the permeability coefficient is similar to that of the consolidation coefficient under the low consolidation pressure of 3 125 6 25 12 5 and 25 kpa the permeability coefficient of freeze thaw sludge and fecl3 conditioning sludge changes significantly which is because the macropores are compressed into small pores or closed pores and the rapid reduction of pore ratio leads to drainage difficulties and rapid reduction of permeability coefficient zhang et al 2020a when the load is greater than 25 kpa the void ratio decreases slowly with the increase of pressure and the sludge compressibility decreases which leads to the slow decrease of the permeability coefficient the permeability coefficient of original sludge changes in the order of 10 8 10 9 cm2 s 1 the permeability coefficient of sludge after fecl3 conditioning changes in the order of 10 6 10 8 cm2 s 1 and the permeability coefficient of sludge after freeze thaw changes in the order of 10 6 10 8 cm2 s 1 the original sludge due to its small particles high organic matter content and thick combined water film between the sludge particles blocks the pores between the sludge particles clogging the seepage channel in the sludge resulting in a low permeability coefficient feng et al 2013 both fecl3 preconditioning and freeze thaw preconditioning can increase the permeability coefficient of sludge by one to two orders of magnitude under the first level of load the permeability coefficient of fecl3 is 4 15 10 6 cm2 s 1 and the permeability coefficient of freeze thaw sludge is 1 64 10 6 cm2 s 1 and the permeability coefficient of the original sludge is 9 11 10 6 cm2 s 1 the permeability coefficient of sludge treated with fecl3 is higher than that of freeze thaw sludge which is due to the increase of pores and the larger void ratio in the sludge after fecl3 conditioning and the permeability coefficient depends on the effective stress and void ratio mooyoung and zimmie 1996a however freeze thaw makes the permeability coefficient of sludge increase and the void ratio decrease which is consistent with the research results of mooyoung and zimmie 1996b on freeze thaw sludge and is similar to the basic characteristics of clay edwin and anthony 1979 from the macroscopic point of view it is explained that shrinkage cracks occur during the freeze thaw process and large pores remain after the ice crystal melts benson and othman 1993 fig 7 b shows the relationship between permeability coefficient log k and void ratio e of different pretreated sludge it can be seen that with the decrease of the void ratio the permeability coefficient of sludge also decreases gradually on the contrary the permeability coefficient increases and the relationship between e and log k is approximately linear which is similar to the curve of e and log cv in the overlapped void ratio range the permeability coefficient of freeze thaw sludge is the highest and the dewatering performance is the best under the same void ratio in the range of coincident void ratio the permeability coefficient of frozen thawed sludge is the highest and the dewatering performance is the best under the same void ratio this is because after freezing and thawing the floc structure is destroyed the bound water content decreases the sludge particle size increases and the permeability coefficient increases significantly carrasco and gao 2019 it can also be seen from the total water discharge and drainage rate of vacuum preloading wu et al 2020b the final water discharge of freeze thaw is 1 2 times that of ls conditioned by fecl3 and the drainage rate of freeze thaw sludge is higher 3 2 the microstructure properties 3 2 1 pore size analysis as the floc structure of the sludge is destroyed during the freeze thaw process the eps is cracked the combined water content is reduced the particle composition and arrangement of the sludge are changed and the pore size distribution also changes according to the mip data the pore size distribution curves of freeze thaw sludge fecl3 conditioning sludge and original sludge before vacuum drainage consolidation are obtained as shown in fig 8 to facilitate the discussion the pore size is classified micropores 0 1μm mesoporous 0 1 1μm small pores 1 1μm mesopores 10 100μm large pores 100μm hu et al 2016 according to the classification method of shear et al 1993 micropores are mainly intraparticle pores mesoporous are interparticle pores small pores are intraggregation pores mesopores and large pores are intercluster pores as can be seen from the above figure the original sludge is mainly composed of small pores that is there are many intraggregation pores this is because when fecl3 acts on the sludge the sludge cells will be acidified and hydrolyzed the floc structure in the sludge will be destroyed a large number of colloidal particles will be produced and a large number of gases will also be produced these gases can not be completely discharged from the sludge and some gases will accumulate in the sludge resulting in the increase of sludge void ratio the increase of large and mesopores and the increase of intercluster pores at the same time fecl3 mainly acts as a coagulant and promotes colloidal particles flocculation through adsorption and bridging reducing the small pores in the sludge and increasing the permeability coefficient compared with the original sludge and the sludge pretreated with fecl3 the large and medium pores of the sludge after freeze thaw treatment increased significantly and the small pores decreased greatly that is the intercluster pores increased significantly this is because in the freezing process under the action of huge frost heaving force small pores are compressed and pore volume decreases and a large part of this compression is irreversible the free water in the sludge and the bound water in the sludge cells migrate to the ice front and redistribute to form an ice lens with the continuous growth of ice crystals the eps of sludge are cracked the flocculent structure is destroyed and sludge particles are extruded to form new aggregates and the particle size increases carrasco and gao 2019 at the same time the morphology of pores will be changed and small pores will be merged into mesopores and large pores when thawing the ice thaws into pore water although the frost heaving force disappears the larger pores formed during the freezing process remain therefore after freeze thaw the small pores decrease while the mesopores and large pores increase and the macroscopic phenomenon shows that although the void ratio decreases the permeability coefficient increases tang and yan 2019 in fine grained soil the characteristics of mesopores and large pores often reflect the change of permeability this also corresponds to that the total water discharge and drainage rate of the ls after freeze thaw are better than those after fecl3 conditioning wu et al 2020b by comparing the pore size distribution curves of three different preconditioning sludge after drainage and consolidation as shown in the fig 9 it can be seen that the content of large pores and mesopores in freeze thaw sludge and fecl3 conditioning sludge is still higher than that of the original sludge and the characteristics of large pores and mesopores often determine the changes in its permeability characteristics tang and yan 2019 this also shows that the seepage channels of the two different preconditioned sludges are smooth during consolidation and drainage after freeze thaw the distribution of large pores and mesopores of sludge is higher than that of fecl3 that is there are more intercluster pores which indicates that the seepage channel of sludge after freeze thaw is more smooth this is also corresponding to the law of drainage under vacuum preloading after freeze thaw the sludge has more water discharge greater compression better permeability and better drainage consolidation effect wu et al 2020b undisturbed sludge is mainly distributed in micropores mesoporous and small pores that is the intraggregation pores and intercluster pores are mainly distributed which is easy to cause the seepage channel clogging which is also the main reason why the original sludge is difficult to consolidate and drain 3 2 2 sem analysis for a more intuitive comparison the sem images magnified 400 times are selected for analysis of the sludge after different pretreatments as shown in fig 10 it can be seen from the figure that the original sludge has a loose structure many impurities dispersed floc structure and many interparticle pores after freeze thaw the large pores and mesopores of the sludge obviously increase the large particles increase the intercluster pores increase the surface is denser and uniform the integrity is better and the structure is the honeycomb this indicates that after freeze thaw the structure of sludge flocs was destroyed eps in sludge was cracked and bound water was released the small particles agglomerated into large particles under the promotion of ice crystal and the size of sludge particles increased and the large pores and mesopores increased which also corresponded to the results of mip after treatment with fecl3 the structure of sludge is more compact and uniform and the interparticle pores are increased the sludge particles are closely and regularly bonded and the pores are evenly distributed which is also corresponding to the increase of sludge void ratio permeability coefficient and large and mesopores after treatment with fecl3 from the sem images it can be seen that the two pretreatment methods have different effects on the microstructure of sludge reflecting the different mechanisms of the two pretreatment methods 4 conclusion 1 the initial void ratio of original sludge was 4 57 which increased to 6 89 after conditioning with fecl3 and decreased to 4 23 after freeze thaw the cc of sludge treated with fecl3 was 1 789 while that of freeze thawed sludge was 0 902 which was lower than 1 365 of the original sludge but still higher than 0 4 which belonged to high compressibility soil freeze thaw can reduce the pore ratio and increase the density of sludge different pretreated sludge has no pre consolidation pressure which belongs to under consolidated soil 2 the consolidation coefficient of original sludge changes in the order of 10 5 cm2 s 1 after freezing and thawing the consolidation coefficient of sludge changes in the order of 10 4 cm2 s 1 and after fecl3 conditioning the consolidation coefficient of sludge changes in the order of 10 3 10 4 cm2 s 1 after freeze thaw treatment and fecl3 conditioning the sludge consolidation coefficient increased by one to two orders of magnitude under the same void ratio the change of consolidation coefficient of sludge after freeze thaw is almost the same as that of sludge treated with fecl3 3 the permeability coefficient of original sludge changes in the order of 10 8 10 9 cm2 s 1 the permeability coefficient of sludge after fecl3 conditioning changes in the order of 10 6 10 8 cm2 s 1 and the permeability coefficient of sludge after freeze thaw changes in the order of 10 6 10 8 cm2 s 1 both fecl3 preconditioning and freeze thaw preconditioning can increase the permeability coefficient of sludge by one to two orders freeze thaw makes the permeability coefficient of sludge increase and the void ratio decrease from the macroscopic point of view 4 under the low load of less than 25 kpa the void ratio consolidation coefficient and permeability coefficient of sludge change obviously and the change of mechanical properties of sludge under low load is extremely sensitive 5 the original sludge is mainly composed of small pores after fecl3 conditioning the large pores and mesopores increase the small pores are reduced after freeze thaw the large and mesopores of sludge increase significantly while the small pores decrease greatly that is the intercluster pores increase significantly 6 sem images show that the original sludge has a loose structure many impurities dispersed floc structure and many interparticle pores after freeze thaw the large pores and mesopores of the sludge obviously increase the surface is denser and uniform the integrity is better and the structure is the honeycomb after treatment with fecl3 the structure of sludge is more compact and uniform and the interparticle pores are

16931,sars cov 2 and the resulting covid 19 pandemic represents one of the greatest recent threats to human health wellbeing and economic growth wastewater based epidemiology wbe of human viruses can be a useful tool for population scale monitoring of sars cov 2 prevalence and epidemiology to help prevent further spread of the disease particularly within urban centres here we present a longitudinal analysis march july 2020 of sars cov 2 rna prevalence in sewage across six major urban centres in the uk total population equivalent 3 million by q rt pcr and viral genome sequencing our results demonstrate that levels of sars cov 2 rna generally correlated with the abundance of clinical cases recorded within the community in large urban centres with a marked decline in sars cov 2 rna abundance following the implementation of lockdown measures the strength of this association was weaker in areas with lower confirmed covid 19 case numbers further sequence analysis of sars cov 2 from wastewater suggested that multiple genetically distinct clusters were co circulating in the local populations covered by our sample sites and that the genetic variants observed in wastewater reflected similar snps observed in contemporaneous samples from cases tested in clinical diagnostic laboratories we demonstrate how wbe can be used for both community level detection and tracking of sars cov 2 and other virus prevalence and can inform public health policy decisions although greater understanding of the factors that affect sars cov 2 rna concentration in wastewater are needed for the full integration of wbe data into outbreak surveillance in conclusion our results lend support to the use of routine wbe for monitoring of sars cov 2 and other human pathogenic viruses circulating in the population and assessment of the effectiveness of disease control measures graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords coronavirus outbreak infection control municipal wastewater public health sewage surveillance 1 introduction the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 and the resulting global coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 pandemic has had disastrous socio economic and political consequences worldwide chakraborty and maity 2020 this led to the world health organisation who declaring the covid 19 pandemic a global health emergency who 2020 in response to this many countries implemented a range of mitigation strategies to reduce the spread of disease including social distancing restricted movement use of personal protective equipment contact tracing shielding of vulnerable populations local or national lockdowns and community mass testing cirrincione et al 2020 iacobucci 2020 these measures are of particular importance in urbanised areas where the spread of disease is most likely zhang and schwartz 2020 these measures proved to be largely effective at reducing the first wave of covid 19 albeit not completely eliminating infections goscé et al 2020 jarvis et al 2020 the occurrence of subsequent waves of covid 19 is of significant concern as countries seek to learn from the effectiveness of the mitigation measures used during the first wave of infection aleta et al 2020 a large proportion of sars cov 2 infections are asymptomatic or result in only a mild infection nishiura et al 2020 when symptoms do become apparent this typically occurs 3 7 days after infection arons et al 2020 and severity can vary widely across different sectors of society disproportionately affecting the elderly wang et al 2020 evidence points towards the fact that individuals can transmit the virus unknowingly prior to developing symptoms furthermore a and pre symptomatic individuals pose challenges to surveillance efforts to accurately estimate the presence and extent of infection in the community in a more practical sense both asymptomatic and pre symptomatic individuals also pose a major threat to public health as they can unknowingly spread the virus to more vulnerable groups he et al 2020 although mass community testing has been instigated in many countries to estimate the prevalence of covid 19 in the population this is costly and the demand for tests frequently exceeds the capacity of testing facilities barasa et al 2020 focussing testing solely on symptomatic cases may also fail to capture asymptomatic and pre symptomatic infections and may focus on populations such as those who are hospitalised meaning that surveillance is unavailable for the wider community in some cases it can also be difficult to obtain nasopharyngeal swabs from high risk parts of the community due to a range of physical logistical or cultural issues wastewater based epidemiology wbe detects genome fragments of sars cov 2 shed in faeces and urine and represents an alternative strategy to monitor the levels of virus circulating at population level scales farkas et al 2020 kitajima et al 2020 polo et al 2020 wbe approaches have previously been successful in evaluating the prevalence of other viral diseases e g polio norovirus and also for tracking the use of illicit substances pharmaceuticals and exposure to xenobiotics castiglioni et al 2014 ozawa et al 2019 zuccato et al 2008 monitoring viruses in wastewater also allows an evaluation of the potential risk posed by the discharge of treated and untreated wastewater into the wider environment overall wbe may represent a cost effective method for determining viral prevalence at the population level and has been used to monitor sars cov 2 in a range of countries supplementary table 1 despite the simplicity of the approach the quantitative recovery of viruses and viral nucleic acids from wastewater is notoriously difficult farkas et al 2018a for example virus concentrations in wastewater can be heavily influenced by i dilution by rainfall and industrial inputs ii the presence of compounds that may degrade the virus e g detergents ph salt iii the presence of substances that physically protect the virus e g faecal matter iv loss of viral rna during long transit times through the wastewater network due to decay and sorption v variable shedding rates in the community and vi inhibitory substances in the wastewater that may interfere with quantitative reverse transcription pcr q rt pcr reactions polo et al 2020 in addition to these factors the protocols used to concentrate and purify viral nucleic acids from wastewater samples can have substantial impacts on recovery leading to underestimation of the quantities of the virus present in the wastewater system consequently there is a need to better understand the factors that influence observable levels of sars cov 2 in wastewater to allow validation of the approach for surveillance purposes large scale efforts to monitor changes in the sars cov 2 genome and track its circulation at national and global scales have largely relied on the analysis of high throughput sequencing of the sars cov 2 genome in symptomatic individuals islam et al 2020 meredith et al 2020 plessis et al 2021 as retrospective screening of respiratory samples has detected asymptomatic cases of covid 19 meredith et al 2020 it suggests that lineages may appear in wastewater samples prior to observation in clinical cases because wastewater aggregates samples from across a community area sequencing of sars cov 2 rna recovered from wastewater is likely to contain multiple lineages and so analysis of this data also has the potential to assess the proportions of different lineages circulating in the wider population this potentially enables the identification of lineages that are known to be present and early warning of new lineages not previously observed in a catchment here we present a 3 5 month longitudinal analysis of sars cov 2 rna prevalence and genetic diversity across six different urban centres during the imposition and gradual lifting of the first national lockdown period in the uk march july 2020 the aims of this study were to i investigate the use of wbe for tracking sars cov 2 after the implementation of national lockdown measures at six urban centres of varying size within the uk ii determine the influence of environmental factors e g flow on levels of sars cov 2 rna and a human faecal marker dna virus crassphage in wastewater iii investigate the impact of wastewater treatment on the removal of sars cov 2 rna from wastewater and iv assess the utility of wbe in understanding sars cov 2 genetic variation through high throughput

we monitored the sars cov 2 rna concentration in influent wastewater at six wastewater treatment plants wwtps using q rt pcr over a period of 3 5 months during the imposition and gradual lifting of the first uk wide lockdown and compared these data to the numbers of positive clinical tests and deaths reported by the office for national statistics ons uk government and public health wales for lower tier local authority areas within which the wwtps were located hm government 2020 office for national statistics 2020 public health wales 2020 wwtps represent a range in size population equivalents from 40 thousand to 1 1 million and spatial distribution see supplementary fig 1 and all implemented combined stormwater domestic and trade wastewater collection influent wastewater grab samples were collected at the same time each week with the exception of the wirral wwtp which was sampled from a 24 h composite autosampler limits of detection lod and quantification loq were determined as described in farkas et al 2021 results for sars cov 2 rna concentrations from q rt pcr quantification are displayed as unadjusted mean genome copies gc 100 ml 1 of wastewater rather than normalised by crassphage concentrations as factors such as extraction efficiency can vary depending on the virus used medema et al 2020 although studies suggest that 24 h composite sampling is more representative than grab sampling it has been shown that grab samples are accurate to within an order of magnitude ahmed et al 2021a curtis et al 2020 further our previous work has shown limited diurnal variability particularly in large wastewater catchments where transit times can be up to 24 h and where large amounts of mixing occurs within the network farkas et al 2018b transit times may also influence observable virus quantities due to degradation of viral nucleic acids as they pass through the sewage system however sars cov 2 rna has been shown to be relatively stable in wastewater under environmental conditions with a t90 of 24 or 28 days at 15 or 4 c ahmed et al 2020b we compared mean sars cov 2 rna concentrations to daily flow and influent wastewater chemistry but found no statistically significant correlations see supplementary table 4 the highly abundant bacteriophage crassphage was used as a human faecal marker no correlation was found between crassphage and sars cov 2 nucleic acid concentrations spearman p 0 8341 no effect on crassphage concentration was observable from sampling week kruskal wallis p 0 9042 but a significant effect was found between crassphage concentration and wwtp site kruskal wallis p 0 01751 these data indicate that faecal loading was constant throughout the study period and that different wwtps have different balances of human waste and industrial other domestic wastewater sources 3 2 temporal trends in sars cov 2 rna concentration in wastewater and comparison to covid 19 epidemiology for each wwtp 64 6 8 q rt pcr tests mean standard error sem sites 6 n 90 detected sars cov 2 in influent wastewater above the lod with sars cov 2 rna concentrations in wastewater influent having quantities above the loq in 28 9 2 2 of samples see supplementary fig 2 no sites showed sars cov 2 concentrations in wwtp effluent above the loq and only one above the lod wrexham 19 05 20 n 22 see supplementary table 5 fig 1 a shows a drop in wastewater sars cov 2 rna concentration new positive clinical tests and covid 19 related deaths following the imposition of the uk wide lockdown beginning in late march 2020 a number of spikes in clinical cases can be observed without corresponding spikes in wastewater e g wrexham in late june these can occur due to surge testing following local workplace related outbreaks and changes in testing eligibility during the study highlighting the inherent difficulties in comparing wastewater loads to positive tests when testing is both limited and non random wwtps in manchester liverpool and the wirral showed strong correlations between sars cov 2 rna concentration and daily positive tests fig 1b and supplementary fig 3 negative correlations were also observed between viral concentrations in all sites and time following the implementation of national lockdown except cardiff indicating these measures lowered the prevalence of the virus in local populations the cardiff gwynedd and wrexham wwtps did not show the same trends between viral rna concentrations and tests deaths potentially due to several different factors such as water chemistry or lower broader peaks in sars cov 2 prevalence gwynedd is also a popular holiday destination and sees regular weekend influxes of holiday makers from other parts of the uk which could affect wwtp sars cov 2 concentrations either positively through visits from asymptomatic pre symptomatic individuals or negatively through people commuting from rural areas outside of the wwtp catchment area additional factors such as transit time within the sewage network catchment flow dynamics and differences between local authority reporting areas for positive tests and wwtp sewershed coverage could affect viral rna recovery in contrast to the gwynedd site the wirral site showed the strongest correlation between sars cov 2 rna concentrations and the number of positive clinical tests covid 19 related deaths and is of a size inbetween that of the wrexham and gwynedd wwtps see supplemental fig 1 suggesting that the use of 24 hour composite sampling may improve the correlation between sars cov 2 wastewater quantification and local clinical cases further exploration of site specific factors and improved access to higher resolution spatial distributions of positive test locations is required to improve the accuracy of wbe in predicting covid 19 prevalence amongst local populations as part of national monitoring programmes previous studies have corrected sars cov 2 rna concentration for wwtp flow gonzalez et al 2020 and adjusted cases or positive tests for differences between local authority populations and wwtp catchment areas medema et al 2020 statistically we found no benefit of correcting for these factors on spearman correlation coefficients between wwtp sars cov 2 rna concentration and positive tests covid 19 related deaths see supplemental fig 3 however due to differences between wwtp sites and sewersheds we would caution against making extensive quantitative comparisons between sites our data confirm that sars cov 2 rna is readily detectable in wastewater influent across a range of concentrations from 1 2 103 loq to the highest recorded concentration of 1 5 104 gc 100 ml 1 this highlights how site specific factors concentration and quantification protocols and sampling strategies can complicate quantitative comparisons between wwtps within the same study and when making comparisons to other international studies there is a need to standardise sars cov 2 wastewater quantification and take wwtp site identity into account when expanding wwtp monitoring programmes to national and international scales chik et al 2021 pecson et al 2021 nonetheless this study demonstrates the longitudinal benefit of using wbe to monitor viral prevalence and the impact of public health interventions particularly in the early stages of a novel disease outbreak 3 3 effect of window size offset on correlations due to shedding of sars cov 2 from asymptomatic and pre symptomatic individuals a key driver of wbe research is the potential to detect upcoming spikes in infection in wastewater before increase in positive clinical tests consequently several studies have used modelling approaches to assess if the wastewater concentration of sars cov 2 preceded new spikes in clinical cases of covid 19 ahmed et al 2021b d aoust et al 2021 however this is challenging due to variabilities in the point of an infection cycle at which a person gets tested the severity and duration of symptoms and the variability in viral shedding the effect of varying the difference between the number of days between wastewater sampling and testing date and the number of days over which to sum the number of positive tests on the correlation between wastewater sars cov 2 concentrations and cases was examined fig 2 if only considering daily clinical testing data the sars cov 2 wastewater rna concentration leads testing data by 2 4 days but this can be extended by approximately 1 day by using a rolling sum of positive clinical test cases over a series of days leading up to the clinical testing date being considered it should be noted that the overall effect of varying these parameters is not large in that the correlation coefficients stay between 0 8 and 0 9 over a range of permutations 3 4 sequencing detects mutations in the sars cov 2 genome comparable to those observable in clinical cases wbe can also be used to monitor the genetic diversity sars cov 2 circulating in the wider population to this end sars cov 2 rna was amplified using the artic protocol primers in both extraction duplicates where at least one of which showed q rt pcr amplification were sequenced in these samples between 25 and 75 of the sars cov 2 genome was recovered fig 3 a with coverage randomly distributed across the genome fig 3b this included samples that showed no amplification 8 3 or amplification below the lod 3 6 of the n1 q rt pcr assay n 84 suggesting that multi locus amplicon sequencing based monitoring of wastewater for wbe may be of significant use in the early stages of future viral outbreaks the proportion of the genome sequenced positively correlated with the amount of template spearman s ρ 0 376 p 0 0004 fig 3c in total 702 unique snp sites and 267 indels were detectable across the 84 samples after filtering to remove sites with less than 50 reads and a variant frequency within a sample of less than 10 the number of snps found correlated positively with the proportion of the genome that was sequenced spearman s ρ 0 581 p 0 0001 fig 3d preliminary modelling suggests that the rate of positive tests in the source population and sampling week did not affect the mean number of snps and indels controlled for genome coverage p 0 05 fig 4 a and b but a reduced model suggested that there was heterogeneity amongst sites x 2 11 57 df 5 p 0 041 fig 4c the index of snp plus indel frequency was not related to log population equivalent served by each wastewater treatment plant spearman s ρ 0 251 p 0 251 fig 4d this is explained by the presence of multiple viral lineages present within the sample corresponding to the diverse infections in the population represented in the wastewater sample a substantial fraction of the detected snps has previously been identified in clinical samples across the uk and has the potential to be informative for distinguishing viral lineages supplementary table 6 multiple sars cov 2 lineages can be present within a single wastewater sample samples have the potential to contain viruses from both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals within the community as sars cov 2 has been detected in the faeces of both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals jones et al 2020 tang et al 2020 previous studies have sequenced sars cov 2 genomes from wastewater ahmed et al 2020a izquierdo lara et al 2021 martin et al 2020 nemudryi et al 2020 we have shown not only that viral genome sequences can be recovered from wastewater samples but that they exhibit substantial diversity across dozens of samples sequencing the genomes therefore has the potential to assess the diversity of viral infections in the wastewater catchment population and to identify emerging genetic variants before they are seen in clinical samples in support of this preliminary analysis suggests that the detected snps were consistent with those detected previously in clinical samples see supplementary table 6 however because the snps from wastewater samples are not phased across the genome and because the genome coverage is imperfect assigning viral lineages to samples will require a bespoke statistical framework to be developed 3 5 use of wastewater based epidemiology in covid 19 and future pathogen surveillance attempting to quantitatively link observed viral rna concentrations to detectable cases is challenging medema et al 2020 many assumptions need to be made regarding the persistence of sars cov 2 in wastewater quantities of the virus shed in faeces and the influence of water chemistry ahmed et al 2020a sample processing methodology can also be a substantial source of variability concentration method qpcr assay design and inter lab variation can create variation in detectable sars cov 2 rna quantities pecson et al 2021 westhaus et al 2021 use of appropriate process controls is necessary to monitor the effects of these factors when making intra and inter laboratory comparisons choice of process control is complex as a closely related surrogate virus should be used where available and further global collaboration and co ordination is required to widen access to wbe technologies polo et al 2020 in addition to this the effects of sars cov 2 on global supply chains and the need to perform wbe at scale create additional pressures where sub optimal protocols may become necessary in the future to achieve testing scale desired for national monitoring programs despite the possible sources of variability mentioned above we have demonstrated that wbe is suitable for quantitatively tracking the course of the early stages of the sars cov 2 pandemic and the effects of public health interventions even in the early stages of a novel outbreak where lack of surge capacity prevents optimal sampling we highlight how tiled primer array sequencing complements q rt pcr based detection of sars cov 2 and enhances the sensitivity and usefulness of wbe in detecting the presence of novel mutations in the sars cov 2 genome early detection of viral pathogens by q rt pcr requires a suitable assay and routine monitoring of wwtps however alternative technologies such as viral metagenomics may be more suited to initial detection of emerging and unknown pathogens farkas et al 2020 our results suggest that viral amplicon sequencing could be more sensitive than q rt pcr for detection of known pathogens in future monitoring could be targeted towards ports of entry and major metropolitan centres to maximise the likelihood of detection medema et al 2020 4 conclusions our results demonstrate that levels of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater generally correlated well with the abundance of clinical covid 19 cases recorded within the community in large urban centres at the population level wastewater based epidemiology was used to confirm the success of lockdown measures i e restricted movement and human to human contact implemented at the national scale to control the transmission of sars cov 2 the genetic diversity of sars cov 2 from wastewater suggests that multiple genetically distinct clusters were co circulating in the local populations and that the genetic variants observed in wastewater reflect similar snps observed in samples from nasopharyngeal swabs taken contemporaneously at clinical testing centres a greater understanding of the factors that affect sars cov 2 rna quantification in wastewater is still required to enable the full integration of wastewater based epidemiology data into wider outbreak surveillance programmes our results lend support to the use of routine wastewater based epidemiology to monitor sars cov 2 and other human pathogenic viruses circulating in the population and to assess the effectiveness of disease control

16931,sars cov 2 and the resulting covid 19 pandemic represents one of the greatest recent threats to human health wellbeing and economic growth wastewater based epidemiology wbe of human viruses can be a useful tool for population scale monitoring of sars cov 2 prevalence and epidemiology to help prevent further spread of the disease particularly within urban centres here we present a longitudinal analysis march july 2020 of sars cov 2 rna prevalence in sewage across six major urban centres in the uk total population equivalent 3 million by q rt pcr and viral genome sequencing our results demonstrate that levels of sars cov 2 rna generally correlated with the abundance of clinical cases recorded within the community in large urban centres with a marked decline in sars cov 2 rna abundance following the implementation of lockdown measures the strength of this association was weaker in areas with lower confirmed covid 19 case numbers further sequence analysis of sars cov 2 from wastewater suggested that multiple genetically distinct clusters were co circulating in the local populations covered by our sample sites and that the genetic variants observed in wastewater reflected similar snps observed in contemporaneous samples from cases tested in clinical diagnostic laboratories we demonstrate how wbe can be used for both community level detection and tracking of sars cov 2 and other virus prevalence and can inform public health policy decisions although greater understanding of the factors that affect sars cov 2 rna concentration in wastewater are needed for the full integration of wbe data into outbreak surveillance in conclusion our results lend support to the use of routine wbe for monitoring of sars cov 2 and other human pathogenic viruses circulating in the population and assessment of the effectiveness of disease control measures graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords coronavirus outbreak infection control municipal wastewater public health sewage surveillance 1 introduction the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 and the resulting global coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 pandemic has had disastrous socio economic and political consequences worldwide chakraborty and maity 2020 this led to the world health organisation who declaring the covid 19 pandemic a global health emergency who 2020 in response to this many countries implemented a range of mitigation strategies to reduce the spread of disease including social distancing restricted movement use of personal protective equipment contact tracing shielding of vulnerable populations local or national lockdowns and community mass testing cirrincione et al 2020 iacobucci 2020 these measures are of particular importance in urbanised areas where the spread of disease is most likely zhang and schwartz 2020 these measures proved to be largely effective at reducing the first wave of covid 19 albeit not completely eliminating infections goscé et al 2020 jarvis et al 2020 the occurrence of subsequent waves of covid 19 is of significant concern as countries seek to learn from the effectiveness of the mitigation measures used during the first wave of infection aleta et al 2020 a large proportion of sars cov 2 infections are asymptomatic or result in only a mild infection nishiura et al 2020 when symptoms do become apparent this typically occurs 3 7 days after infection arons et al 2020 and severity can vary widely across different sectors of society disproportionately affecting the elderly wang et al 2020 evidence points towards the fact that individuals can transmit the virus unknowingly prior to developing symptoms furthermore a and pre symptomatic individuals pose challenges to surveillance efforts to accurately estimate the presence and extent of infection in the community in a more practical sense both asymptomatic and pre symptomatic individuals also pose a major threat to public health as they can unknowingly spread the virus to more vulnerable groups he et al 2020 although mass community testing has been instigated in many countries to estimate the prevalence of covid 19 in the population this is costly and the demand for tests frequently exceeds the capacity of testing facilities barasa et al 2020 focussing testing solely on symptomatic cases may also fail to capture asymptomatic and pre symptomatic infections and may focus on populations such as those who are hospitalised meaning that surveillance is unavailable for the wider community in some cases it can also be difficult to obtain nasopharyngeal swabs from high risk parts of the community due to a range of physical logistical or cultural issues wastewater based epidemiology wbe detects genome fragments of sars cov 2 shed in faeces and urine and represents an alternative strategy to monitor the levels of virus circulating at population level scales farkas et al 2020 kitajima et al 2020 polo et al 2020 wbe approaches have previously been successful in evaluating the prevalence of other viral diseases e g polio norovirus and also for tracking the use of illicit substances pharmaceuticals and exposure to xenobiotics castiglioni et al 2014 ozawa et al 2019 zuccato et al 2008 monitoring viruses in wastewater also allows an evaluation of the potential risk posed by the discharge of treated and untreated wastewater into the wider environment overall wbe may represent a cost effective method for determining viral prevalence at the population level and has been used to monitor sars cov 2 in a range of countries supplementary table 1 despite the simplicity of the approach the quantitative recovery of viruses and viral nucleic acids from wastewater is notoriously difficult farkas et al 2018a for example virus concentrations in wastewater can be heavily influenced by i dilution by rainfall and industrial inputs ii the presence of compounds that may degrade the virus e g detergents ph salt iii the presence of substances that physically protect the virus e g faecal matter iv loss of viral rna during long transit times through the wastewater network due to decay and sorption v variable shedding rates in the community and vi inhibitory substances in the wastewater that may interfere with quantitative reverse transcription pcr q rt pcr reactions polo et al 2020 in addition to these factors the protocols used to concentrate and purify viral nucleic acids from wastewater samples can have substantial impacts on recovery leading to underestimation of the quantities of the virus present in the wastewater system consequently there is a need to better understand the factors that influence observable levels of sars cov 2 in wastewater to allow validation of the approach for surveillance purposes large scale efforts to monitor changes in the sars cov 2 genome and track its circulation at national and global scales have largely relied on the analysis of high throughput sequencing of the sars cov 2 genome in symptomatic individuals islam et al 2020 meredith et al 2020 plessis et al 2021 as retrospective screening of respiratory samples has detected asymptomatic cases of covid 19 meredith et al 2020 it suggests that lineages may appear in wastewater samples prior to observation in clinical cases because wastewater aggregates samples from across a community area sequencing of sars cov 2 rna recovered from wastewater is likely to contain multiple lineages and so analysis of this data also has the potential to assess the proportions of different lineages circulating in the wider population this potentially enables the identification of lineages that are known to be present and early warning of new lineages not previously observed in a catchment here we present a 3 5 month longitudinal analysis of sars cov 2 rna prevalence and genetic diversity across six different urban centres during the imposition and gradual lifting of the first national lockdown period in the uk march july 2020 the aims of this study were to i investigate the use of wbe for tracking sars cov 2 after the implementation of national lockdown measures at six urban

we monitored the sars cov 2 rna concentration in influent wastewater at six wastewater treatment plants wwtps using q rt pcr over a period of 3 5 months during the imposition and gradual lifting of the first uk wide lockdown and compared these data to the numbers of positive clinical tests and deaths reported by the office for national statistics ons uk government and public health wales for lower tier local authority areas within which the wwtps were located hm government 2020 office for national statistics 2020 public health wales 2020 wwtps represent a range in size population equivalents from 40 thousand to 1 1 million and spatial distribution see supplementary fig 1 and all implemented combined stormwater domestic and trade wastewater collection influent wastewater grab samples were collected at the same time each week with the exception of the wirral wwtp which was sampled from a 24 h composite autosampler limits of detection lod and quantification loq were determined as described in farkas et al 2021 results for sars cov 2 rna concentrations from q rt pcr quantification are displayed as unadjusted mean genome copies gc 100 ml 1 of wastewater rather than normalised by crassphage concentrations as factors such as extraction efficiency can vary depending on the virus used medema et al 2020 although studies suggest that 24 h composite sampling is more representative than grab sampling it has been shown that grab samples are accurate to within an order of magnitude ahmed et al 2021a curtis et al 2020 further our previous work has shown limited diurnal variability particularly in large wastewater catchments where transit times can be up to 24 h and where large amounts of mixing occurs within the network farkas et al 2018b transit times may also influence observable virus quantities due to degradation of viral nucleic acids as they pass through the sewage system however sars cov 2 rna has been shown to be relatively stable in wastewater under environmental conditions with a t90 of 24 or 28 days at 15 or 4 c ahmed et al 2020b we compared mean sars cov 2 rna concentrations to daily flow and influent wastewater chemistry but found no statistically significant correlations see supplementary table 4 the highly abundant bacteriophage crassphage was used as a human faecal marker no correlation was found between crassphage and sars cov 2 nucleic acid concentrations spearman p 0 8341 no effect on crassphage concentration was observable from sampling week kruskal wallis p 0 9042 but a significant effect was found between crassphage concentration and wwtp site kruskal wallis p 0 01751 these data indicate that faecal loading was constant throughout the study period and that different wwtps have different balances of human waste and industrial other domestic wastewater sources 3 2 temporal trends in sars cov 2 rna concentration in wastewater and comparison to covid 19 epidemiology for each wwtp 64 6 8 q rt pcr tests mean standard error sem sites 6 n 90 detected sars cov 2 in influent wastewater above the lod with sars cov 2 rna concentrations in wastewater influent having quantities above the loq in 28 9 2 2 of samples see supplementary fig 2 no sites showed sars cov 2 concentrations in wwtp effluent above the loq and only one above the lod wrexham 19 05 20 n 22 see supplementary table 5 fig 1 a shows a drop in wastewater sars cov 2 rna concentration new positive clinical tests and covid 19 related deaths following the imposition of the uk wide lockdown beginning in late march 2020 a number of spikes in clinical cases can be observed without corresponding spikes in wastewater e g wrexham in late june these can occur due to surge testing following local workplace related outbreaks and changes in testing eligibility during the study highlighting the inherent difficulties in comparing wastewater loads to positive tests when testing is both limited and non random wwtps in manchester liverpool and the wirral showed strong correlations between sars cov 2 rna concentration and daily positive tests fig 1b and supplementary fig 3 negative correlations were also observed between viral concentrations in all sites and time following the implementation of national lockdown except cardiff indicating these measures lowered the prevalence of the virus in local populations the cardiff gwynedd and wrexham wwtps did not show the same trends between viral rna concentrations and tests deaths potentially due to several different factors such as water chemistry or lower broader peaks in sars cov 2 prevalence gwynedd is also a popular holiday destination and sees regular weekend influxes of holiday makers from other parts of the uk which could affect wwtp sars cov 2 concentrations either positively through visits from asymptomatic pre symptomatic individuals or negatively through people commuting from rural areas outside of the wwtp catchment area additional factors such as transit time within the sewage network catchment flow dynamics and differences between local authority reporting areas for positive tests and wwtp sewershed coverage could affect viral rna recovery in contrast to the gwynedd site the wirral site showed the strongest correlation between sars cov 2 rna concentrations and the number of positive clinical tests covid 19 related deaths and is of a size inbetween that of the wrexham and gwynedd wwtps see supplemental fig 1 suggesting that the use of 24 hour composite sampling may improve the correlation between sars cov 2 wastewater quantification and local clinical cases further exploration of site specific factors and improved access to higher resolution spatial distributions of positive test locations is required to improve the accuracy of wbe in predicting covid 19 prevalence amongst local populations as part of national monitoring programmes previous studies have corrected sars cov 2 rna concentration for wwtp flow gonzalez et al 2020 and adjusted cases or positive tests for differences between local authority populations and wwtp catchment areas medema et al 2020 statistically we found no benefit of correcting for these factors on spearman correlation coefficients between wwtp sars cov 2 rna concentration and positive tests covid 19 related deaths see supplemental fig 3 however due to differences between wwtp sites and sewersheds we would caution against making extensive quantitative comparisons between sites our data confirm that sars cov 2 rna is readily detectable in wastewater influent across a range of concentrations from 1 2 103 loq to the highest recorded concentration of 1 5 104 gc 100 ml 1 this highlights how site specific factors concentration and quantification protocols and sampling strategies can complicate quantitative comparisons between wwtps within the same study and when making comparisons to other international studies there is a need to standardise sars cov 2 wastewater quantification and take wwtp site identity into account when expanding wwtp monitoring programmes to national and international scales chik et al 2021 pecson et al 2021 nonetheless this study demonstrates the longitudinal benefit of using wbe to monitor viral prevalence and the impact of public health interventions particularly in the early stages of a novel disease outbreak 3 3 effect of window size offset on correlations due to shedding of sars cov 2 from asymptomatic and pre symptomatic individuals a key driver of wbe research is the potential to detect upcoming spikes in infection in wastewater before increase in positive clinical tests consequently several studies have used modelling approaches to assess if the wastewater concentration of sars cov 2 preceded new spikes in clinical cases of covid 19 ahmed et al 2021b d aoust et al 2021 however this is challenging due to variabilities in the point of an infection cycle at which a person gets tested the severity and duration of symptoms and the variability in viral shedding the effect of varying the difference between the number of days between wastewater sampling and testing date and the number of days over which to sum the number of positive tests on the correlation between wastewater sars cov 2 concentrations and cases was examined fig 2 if only considering daily clinical testing data the sars cov 2 wastewater rna concentration leads testing data by 2 4 days but this can be extended by approximately 1 day by using a rolling sum of positive clinical test cases over a series of days leading up to the clinical testing date being considered it should be noted that the overall effect of varying these parameters is not large in that the correlation coefficients stay between 0 8 and 0 9 over a range of permutations 3 4 sequencing detects mutations in the sars cov 2 genome comparable to those observable in clinical cases wbe can also be used to monitor the genetic diversity sars cov 2 circulating in the wider population to this end sars cov 2 rna was amplified using the artic protocol primers in both extraction duplicates where at least one of which showed q rt pcr amplification were sequenced in these samples between 25 and 75 of the sars cov 2 genome was recovered fig 3 a with coverage randomly distributed across the genome fig 3b this included samples that showed no amplification 8 3 or amplification below the lod 3 6 of the n1 q rt pcr assay n 84 suggesting that multi locus amplicon sequencing based monitoring of wastewater for wbe may be of significant use in the early stages of future viral outbreaks the proportion of the genome sequenced positively correlated with the amount of template spearman s ρ 0 376 p 0 0004 fig 3c in total 702 unique snp sites and 267 indels were detectable across the 84 samples after filtering to remove sites with less than 50 reads and a variant frequency within a sample of less than 10 the number of snps found correlated positively with the proportion of the genome that was sequenced spearman s ρ 0 581 p 0 0001 fig 3d preliminary modelling suggests that the rate of positive tests in the source population and sampling week did not affect the mean number of snps and indels controlled for genome coverage p 0 05 fig 4 a and b but a reduced model suggested that there was heterogeneity amongst sites x 2 11 57 df 5 p 0 041 fig 4c the index of snp plus indel frequency was not related to log population equivalent served by each wastewater treatment plant spearman s ρ 0 251 p 0 251 fig 4d this is explained by the presence of multiple viral lineages present within the sample corresponding to the diverse infections in the population represented in the wastewater sample a substantial fraction of the detected snps has previously been identified in clinical samples across the uk and has the potential to be informative for distinguishing viral lineages supplementary table 6 multiple sars cov 2 lineages can be present within a single wastewater sample samples have the potential to contain viruses from both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals within the community as sars cov 2 has been detected in the faeces of both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals jones et al 2020 tang et al 2020 previous studies have sequenced sars cov 2 genomes from wastewater ahmed et al 2020a izquierdo lara et al 2021 martin et al 2020 nemudryi et al 2020 we have shown not only that viral genome sequences can be recovered from wastewater samples but that they exhibit substantial diversity across dozens of samples sequencing the genomes therefore has the potential to assess the diversity of viral infections in the wastewater catchment population and to identify emerging genetic variants before they are seen in clinical samples in support of this preliminary analysis suggests that the detected snps were consistent with those detected previously in clinical samples see supplementary table 6 however because the snps from wastewater samples are not phased across the genome and because the genome coverage is imperfect assigning viral lineages to samples will require a bespoke statistical framework to be developed 3 5 use of wastewater based epidemiology in covid 19 and future pathogen surveillance attempting to quantitatively link observed viral rna concentrations to detectable cases is challenging medema et al 2020 many assumptions need to be made regarding the persistence of sars cov 2 in wastewater quantities of the virus shed in faeces and the influence of water chemistry ahmed et al 2020a sample processing methodology can also be a substantial source of variability concentration method qpcr assay design and inter lab variation can create variation in detectable sars cov 2 rna quantities pecson et al 2021 westhaus et al 2021 use of appropriate process controls is necessary to monitor the effects of these factors when making intra and inter laboratory comparisons choice of process control is complex as a closely related surrogate virus should be used where available and further global collaboration and co ordination is required to widen access to wbe technologies polo et al 2020 in addition to this the effects of sars cov 2 on global supply chains and the need to perform wbe at scale create additional pressures where sub optimal protocols may become necessary in the future to achieve testing scale desired for national monitoring programs despite the possible sources of variability mentioned above we have demonstrated that wbe is suitable for quantitatively tracking the course of the early stages of the sars cov 2 pandemic and the effects of public health interventions even in the early stages of a novel outbreak where lack of surge capacity prevents optimal sampling we highlight how tiled primer array sequencing complements q rt pcr based detection of sars cov 2 and enhances the sensitivity and usefulness of wbe in detecting the presence of novel mutations in the sars cov 2 genome early detection of viral pathogens by q rt pcr requires a suitable assay and routine monitoring of wwtps however alternative technologies such as viral metagenomics may be more suited to initial detection of emerging and unknown pathogens farkas et al 2020 our results suggest that viral amplicon sequencing could be more sensitive than q rt pcr for detection of known pathogens in future monitoring could be targeted towards ports of entry and major metropolitan centres to maximise the likelihood of detection medema et al 2020 4 conclusions our results demonstrate that levels of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater generally correlated well with the abundance of clinical covid 19 cases recorded within the community in large urban centres at the population level wastewater based epidemiology was used to confirm the success of lockdown measures i e restricted movement and human to human contact implemented at the national scale to control the transmission of sars cov 2 the genetic diversity of sars cov 2 from wastewater suggests that multiple genetically distinct clusters were co circulating in the local populations and that the genetic variants observed in wastewater reflect similar snps observed in samples from nasopharyngeal swabs taken contemporaneously at clinical testing centres a greater understanding of the factors that affect sars cov 2 rna quantification in wastewater is still required to enable the full integration of wastewater based epidemiology data into wider outbreak surveillance programmes our results lend support to the use of routine wastewater based epidemiology to monitor sars cov 2 and other human pathogenic viruses circulating in the population and to assess the effectiveness of disease control

16932,numerous geochemical approaches have been proposed to ascertain if methane concentrations in groundwater ch4 are anomalous i e migrated from hydrocarbon production wells rather than derived from natural sources we propose a machine learning model to consider alkalinity ca mg na ba fe mn cl sulfate tds specific conductance ph temperature and turbidity holistically together the model an ensemble of sub models targeting one parameter pair per sub model was trained with groundwater chemistry from pennsylvania n 19 086 and a set of 16 analyses from putatively contaminated groundwater for cases where ch4 10 mg l salinity and redox related parameters sometimes show that ch4 may have moved into the aquifer recently and separately from natural brine migration i e anomalous ch4 we applied the model to validation and hold out data for pennsylvania n 4 786 and groundwater data from three other gas producing states new york n 203 texas n 688 and colorado n 10 258 the applications show that 1 4 1 3 0 and 0 9 of tested samples in these four states respectively have high ch4 and are 50 likely to have been impacted by gas migrated from exploited reservoirs if our approach is indeed successful in flagging anomalous ch4 we conclude that i the frequency of anomalous ch4 flagged water samples total samples tested in the appalachian basin is similar in areas where gas wells target unconventional as compared to conventional reservoirs and ii the frequency of anomalous ch4 in pennsylvania is higher than in texas colorado we cannot however exclude the possibility that differences among regions might be affected by differences in data volumes machine learning models will become increasingly useful in informing decision making for shale gas development graphical

expected shale gas production will account for more than three quarters of this natural gas production u s energy information administration 2018 this development is largely driven by the combined usage of high volume hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling u s energy information administration 2018 other countries and regions e g china canada middle east are also ramping up their natural gas production from newly discovered technically recoverable shale reserves u s energy information administration 2017 in the meantime putative incidents of deterioration of water quality caused by shale gas development have been investigated throughout the us brantley et al 2014 darrah et al 2014 guo et al 2014 nicot and scanlon 2012 vidic et al 2013 wen et al 2019b 2019a woda et al 2018 yang et al 2013 where it is not rare to see that hydrocarbon wells show signs of compromised well integrity lackey et al 2021 proving that contamination was caused by shale gas development activities is always difficult and estimating the frequency of problems is even more problematic however for the public to make decisions about granting social license for shale gas development requires some information about the frequency of problems in this paper we explore the use of a machine learning model developed with large groundwater datasets from one region to see if such data driven models can be used in other regions to assess incidents of contamination we developed the model by application to data from pennsylvania pa the state in the us with the longest history of conventional oil gas og drilling and coal mining pa has become a leading area for shale gas production through use of horizontal drilling and high volume hydraulic fracturing to extract gas and liquids from the marcellus and utica shales the contaminant that has been identified as the most common problem in pa is methane ch4 the chief component of natural gas brantley et al 2014 many studies investigating groundwater quality in shale gas basins have focused on contamination by such anomalous ch4 hammond 2016 hammond et al 2020 li and carlson 2014 molofsky et al 2013 nicot et al 2017c osborn et al 2011 sherwood et al 2016 siegel et al 2015a b 2016 smith et al 2016 wen et al 2017 2016 here anomalous ch4 is used to denote dissolved or free phase ch4 found in groundwater that is putatively derived from the effects of recent human activities related to shale gas development in general naturally occurring ch4 may have long affected an aquifer whereas anomalous ch4 represents a relatively new source at the impacted site the identification of new anomalous ch4 is difficult at least partly because naturally occurring ch4 is common in many basins including in pa groundwater baldassare et al 2014 siegel et al 2015b wen et al 2019b in a limited number of areas the causes of elevated ch4 in groundwater have been attributed to og production activities conventional or unconventional darrah et al 2014 grieve et al 2018 hammond 2016 hammond et al 2020 jackson et al 2013 osborn et al 2011 u s environmental protection agency 2015 warner et al 2012 wen et al 2019b woda et al 2018 identification of anomalous versus natural ch4 in groundwater often relies on measurement of carbon isotopes in the gas e g baldassare et al 2014 jackson et al 2013 but this is somewhat expensive and seldomly definitive researchers have also sometimes used other hydrogeochemical patterns to identify anomalous ch4 for example the migration of natural ch4 from deeper formations into shallow groundwater in the appalachian basin is often accompanied by salt containing waters which leads to slightly elevated salt contents in the shallow aquifer and distinctive chemical signatures siegel et al 2015a 2015b warner et al 2012 wen et al 2019b therefore major and trace elements e g calcium sodium and bromide brantley et al 2014 cantlay et al 2020b grieve et al 2018 lu et al 2015 mcmahon et al 2017b schout et al 2018 warner et al 2012 wen et al 2019b woda et al 2018 have been proposed to distinguish varying sources of subsurface fluids in addition electron acceptors can be reduced e g so4 can be reduced to sulfide by bacteria that use ch4 as an electron donor mcmahon et al 2017b schout et al 2018 van stempvoort et al 2005 woda et al 2018 the concentration of sulfate in waters has sometimes been used to detect anomalous ch4 as it is easier to collect and analyze water samples for sulfate than sulfide other tracers were also proposed recently to detect anomalous ch4 in groundwater e g strontium isotopes warner et al 2012 woda et al 2018 lithium and boron isotopes warner et al 2014 and noble gas isotopes darrah et al 2015 2014 wen et al 2017 2016 woda et al 2018 these latter isotopic tools require a high level of expert knowledge and advanced and expensive analytical facilities to ensure proper data acquisition and interpretation such characteristics so far have prevented these tracers from being applied widely for monitoring of baseline water quality in the area of shale gas production among these hydrogeochemical tracers no single parameter is characteristic of a particular source for anomalous ch4 cantlay et al 2020b in past studies determining the attribution of anomalous ch4 bivariate plots were often used in which the variables are generally concentrations of hydrogeochemical parameters e g chloride and or concentration ratios e g ca na no single bivariate plot has been suggested that provides definitive answers about whether anomalous ch4 is present instead the source of elevated ch4 is more likely to be identified through a combination of parallel bivariate plots cantlay et al 2020b wen et al 2019b woda et al 2018 we wanted to test machine learning approaches to identifying anomalous ch4 in multiple shale gas plays logistic regression lr introduced in the late 1980s mccullagh and nelder 1989 is a type of machine learning algorithm used to make dichotomous prediction e g whether the dissolved ch4 concentration is higher or lower than a threshold value lr has been used in environmental science to predict the presence of certain redox sensitive contaminants in groundwater e g arsenic ayotte et al 2016 nitrate nolan et al 2002 and the redox state tesoriero et al 2015 lr was also used to predict the probability of ch4 occurrence in aquifers in alberta canada humez et al 2019 in these studies a lr model was built based on a few selected categorical or continuous variables no interactions between variables were explicitly considered for example humez et al 2019 used sulfate and total dissolved solids as input variables to predict the presence of ch4 but no concentration ratios of these variables were ever explicitly considered recognizing that the concentrations of chemical constituents in groundwater are prone to differences in the baseline effects of local geology topography and hydrology we suspected that the exclusion of concentration ratio variables in these previously used models largely hampered investigators ability to generalize the models and findings to other areas in addition in the above mentioned studies all variables were fed into a single lr model to generate the final dichotomous prediction and this made it difficult to completely understand how each variable contributed to the prediction in this study we developed an ensemble lr model trained with data shale network 2015 from the northern appalachian basin in pa each sub model focusses on a pair of hydrogeochemical parameters more complex classifiers like random forest or xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 were not used because their outputs are harder to explicitly interpret and visualize we considered predictor features themselves and their interactions we then explored use of the refined ensemble model on additional hold out hydrogeochemistry data from pa and other data from new york texas and colorado fig 1 to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to apply an ensemble lr model to predict whether ch4 in groundwater is anomalous or natural with the improved availability of hydrogeochemistry data such a prediction model could be potentially beneficial for other areas in the us and even for other countries regions with existing or planned og production although we do not have definitive evidence for which groundwater sample s in each basin are affected by anomalous methane we validated the model against a dataset of 13 sites with high ch4 presumed to be caused by gas development activity and 1 site with high ch4 thought to be unaffected by anthropogenic activities we also explored the model by testing it against the following hypotheses we derived from the literature i the frequency of detection of anomalous methane impacted water samples total water samples tested in the appalachian basin is greater where gas wells target unconventional as compared to conventional reservoirs brantley et al 2014 ingraffea et al 2014 and ii the frequency of detection of anomalous methane in groundwater in the marcellus utica shale play is higher than in western shale plays such as those in texas and colorado e g brantley et al 2014 hammond et al 2020 mcmahon et al 2017a sherwood et al 2016 woda et al 2018 2 methods and materials 2 1 groundwater quality data used in model development and application we collated groundwater chemistry analyses from basins that contain some of the largest shale plays in the u s and that also are associated with large groundwater datasets the appalachian basin within pennsylvania n 23 858 shale network 2015 the fort worth tx la ms salt and western gulf basins within texas n 688 darvari et al 2017 nicot et al 2017a 2017b 2017c and the denver julesburg raton san juan paradox uinta piceance greater green and north park basins within colorado n 10 258 https cogcc state co us we decided not to include some shale plays such as the fayetteville shale in arkansas in our study because 1 that play has shown little evidence for gas migration mcmahon et al 2017a warner et al 2013 2 we were unaware of a large dataset of groundwater chemistry for analysis and 3 this region is not one of the major shale gas production areas the samples we analyzed were compiled from a variety of data sources fig 1 table 1 a relatively small dataset of groundwater quality in the counties of new york n 203 christian et al 2016 that neighbor pennsylvania was also tested for comparison because it represents a region of long standing exploitation of conventional but not unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs more detailed descriptions of these datasets and sources are included in the supporting information all datasets discussed in this study will be released at https doi org 10 26208 qs4c ks39 we trained the model to a set of 19 102 groundwater sample analyses that included a small set of groundwater quality data compiled from sites that are presumed to have been impacted by anomalous ch4 we then used an additional subset of analyses from such putatively contaminated samples to validate the model performance samples are referred to here as putatively contaminated when they were reported to be contaminated in published journal articles or government reports based on field and laboratory investigations llewellyn et al 2015 u s environmental protection agency 2015 wen et al 2019b woda et al 2018 these data were divided into a set for training n 16 from granville road and paradise road bradford co and gregs run lycoming co and a set for validation n 13 from paradise road bradford co and sugar run lycoming co an additional sample of a well known brine spring that is naturally ch4 rich from northern pa was also used as part of the validation dataset sites were largely determined to be putatively contaminated based on temporal changes in methane concentration carbon isotope data in collected water samples and geological investigations 2 2 predictor features used in the model we strove to develop a machine learning based ensemble model that could use geochemical analyses to quantify the likelihood that a groundwater sample with high dissolved ch4 had been impacted by anomalous rather than natural ch4 a total of 118 geochemical parameters were considered as potential predictor features in the model in other words these features were tested for their ability to predict if ch4 in a given sample was anomalous or natural these predictor features are divided into three main sub categories as discussed in the next paragraphs detailed descriptions of these predictor features can also be found in the supporting information data for many of the concentrations were beneath detection i e censored for example many of the ch4 concentrations 31 1 were censored i e below reporting limits to maximize the number of measurements for each feature we chose the fifteen geochemical parameters for which the percent of non censored measurements was 31 1 these 15 features are referred to as single geochemical features or sgf in table 2 these 15 water quality parameters were reported in the training data from pa shale network 2015 with over 10 000 measurements each bicarbonate alkalinity alk calcium ca chloride cl magnesium mg sodium na sulfate or so4 2 so4 total dissolved solids tds barium ba iron fe manganese mn ph hydrogen ion h specific conductance sc temperature temp and turbidity specific conductance of a water solution is a measure of its ability to conduct electricity turbidity is a measure of the degree to which the water solution has lost transparency due to the presence of suspended particulates ph was considered in addition to hydrogen ion concentration because ph the more commonly reported term is a calculated parameter ph log hydrogen ion concentration that is not directly comparable to the other concentrations the second and third sub categories of predictor features are the reciprocals of the concentrations of all the sgf except for ph and water temperature n 13 reciprocal feature and the ratios of any two sgf ratio features ratio features were calculated for all features except for ph h sc water temperature turbidity n 90 the inclusion of features in the second and third categories was motivated by the observation that these two types of arithmetic combinations of geochemical parameters have been widely used by geoscientists in tracing the source of solutes in groundwater because they can represent stoichiometric coefficients in the governing geochemical reactions e g bau et al 2004 brantley et al 2014 cantlay et al 2020c 2020b 2020c tisherman and bain 2019 furthermore we reasoned that the stoichiometries of these geochemical reactions need not be restricted to one hydrocarbon basin alone and thus might be more predictive across basins subtraction and multiplication of sgf were not considered because unlike ratios there are no known fundamental reasons why such functions should be predictive a machine learning model using only geochemical predictor features allows us to focus on assessing the interplay of geochemical parameters as well as their relative importance in determining whether the elevated ch4 present in groundwater samples is likely to represent anomalous ch4 therefore no non geochemical features e g land use and bedrock geology were considered in this study 2 3 machine learning based ensemble model our workflow included three sequential phases ensemble model development which included training validation and application fig 2 taking two parameters from the 118 parameters at a time without repetition yields a total number of 6 903 pair combinations we started with these 6 903 possible geochemical pairs that were each tested in a sub model the process of model development described in the next paragraphs identified the subset of 6 903 predictor pairs that were most successful in determining the likelihood of a groundwater sample being impacted by anomalous ch4 the likelihood was calculated as the ratio of the number of sub models flagging the ch4 as not being naturally derived and therefore putatively anomalous divided by the total number of sub models considered the collection of sub models is termed here the ensemble model at the stage of ensemble model development green in fig 2 sub models using the full list of 118 geochemical features paired into 6 903 predictors were trained with 19 102 analyses referred to as training data table 1 fig 2 each of the 6 903 sub models fig 2 considers only one pair of predictor features in effect each sub model imitates the traditional procedure of using bivariate plots of geochemical variables to investigate the origin of dissolved ch4 in groundwater see for example figure s10 in woda et al 2018 the performance of each sub model was evaluated with respect to two tasks first it was evaluated for its ability to predict whether the ch4 is above or below the threshold identified as potentially problematic 10 mg l in the 19 086 water samples task 1 given that these samples were collected by professional consultants working for gas companies before drilling gas wells within a few kilometers of the water wells the waters could be contaminated or uncontaminated by ch4 from previous oil gas activity but we have no outside evidence of contamination we hypothesized that successful sub models would predict ch4 10 mg l for samples reported to have ch4 10 mg l we inferred these samples are impacted by anomalous ch4 this approach is implicitly built on the assumption that natural high ch4 waters are chemically distinct from anomalous high ch4 waters however we acknowledge that our method will not detect anomalous methane in waters with very low values of ch4 in task 2 each sub model was additionally evaluated to see if it successfully identified the ch4 in 16 of the putatively contaminated training samples as anomalous task 2 the concentration of 10 mg l was selected because it is a threshold above which immediate action is needed eltschlager et al 2001 wen et al 2019b during ensemble model development green in fig 2 a linear classifier logistic regression lr is used in the two tasks with 5 fold cross validation lr is generally used to solve binary classification problems with lr the relationship between predictor features and the prediction outcome can be described by a sigmoidal function as illustrated by equation 1 in which x represents predictor features and y is the binary model output of 0 ch4 10 mg l or 1 ch4 10 mg l 1 y e w x b 1 e w x b in the training the sub model allows optimization of w and b to best predict the training data once w and b are optimized each sub model can be used in task 1 to predict which groundwater samples are characterized by ch4 10 mg l for this task area under the curve auc is considered as the performance metric where a higher auc value indicates higher accuracy of prediction auc in particular was chosen as the accuracy measure as it holistically evaluates the model performance in predicting both positive i e high methane sample and negative i e low methane sample results in task 2 the sub model was applied to 16 putatively contaminated samples f1 score was calculated following equation 2 as the performance metric 2 f 1 s c o r e 2 r e c a l l 1 p r e c i s i o n 1 here recall is defined as the proportion of the 16 samples identified correctly while precision is the proportion of predicted anomalous ch4 samples that are actually contaminated f1 score was chosen to prioritize maximizing true positives i e known problematic samples correctly identified as it does not consider true negatives i e known natural samples correctly identified both tasks 1 and 2 were used to identify the best sub model to detect anomalous ch4 in impacted waters samples reported to have high ch4 that were incorrectly classified as low ch4 samples by sub models in task 1 were inferred to have been impacted by anomalous ch4 we chose sub models with higher accuracy of prediction in task 1 to yield a lower number of false positives to evaluate the performance of each sub model for both tasks 1 and 2 we defined a synthesized metric namely 0 7 x f1 score 0 3 x auc the selection of coefficients 0 7 and 0 3 is not entirely arbitrary we assigned the higher weight 0 7 to f1 as that task is more critical all sub models and the associated pair of features n 6 903 were ranked by the final synthesized score we also completed a sensitivity test of the coefficients table s1a and s1b and determined that feature members in the top feature list e g top 20 are mostly unchanged e g sc na cl so4 although the exact rank of features by frequency changes to a limited extent in the phases of model validation and application the prediction results for the best performing sub models were used to estimate the likelihood of impact of groundwater samples by anomalous ch4 fig 2 this likelihood was defined as the percentage of considered sub models that classified the sample as impacted by anomalous ch4 we calculated four types of likelihood for each water sample using the best n sub models where we explored n 100 200 500 as well as 1 000 we ultimately chose n 1 000 to be conservative the selection of n 1 000 is supported by the observation that 1 an ensemble model with fewer sub models would be more likely to be biased towards a few geochemical parameters e g the ensemble model for n 100 was observed to be highly biased towards sc as discussed in the text below and 2 an ensemble model with a larger number of sub models e g n 1 000 was expected to assess water chemistry more holistically improving model applicability and performance for new datasets with less likelihood of overfitting in this study the ensemble model was trained and validated with hydrogeochemistry data in pennsylvania i e marcellus shale and then was tested in other natural gas production regions in colorado texas and new york differences in bedrock geology regional hydrogeochemistry topography and land use between testing and training validation datasets might in some cases hamper the applicability of the developed ensemble model we strove to minimize this issue by considering interactions of ratios of concentrations of single geochemical features as these concentration ratios tend to yield less variability across different regions as more hydrogeochemical data become available in particular from presumably contaminated sites the ensemble model can be further validated and even re trained with new data 3 results and discussion 3 1 model development two statistical methods pearson correlation and spearman s rank correlation were adopted to assess the pairwise correlation of the 15 single geochemical features in predicting the target feature ch4 the pearson correlation is used to evaluate linear relationships between continuous variables that are assumed to obey normal distributions while the spearman s rank correlation is used to evaluate monotonic relationships between two continuous variables without the requirement that variables are normally distributed therefore the spearman s rank correlation identifies more pairs of features that report statistically significant correlations p 0 05 compared to the pearson correlation fig 3 the pairwise correlations led us to note three groups for the fifteen single geochemical features 1 salinity related alk ba ca cl mg na tds sc 2 redox sensitive fe mn and so4 and 3 others ph temp turbidity and h these groupings are used to categorize the best performing sub models in subsequent discussions 3 1 1 general observations the synthesized scores of all sub models n 6 903 are listed and ranked in table s1a the best performing sub model synthesized score 0 9579 f1 0 9677 auc 0 9350 corresponds to the pair 1 sc and ca ba table s1a from this observation we inferred that salinity is an effective tool to detect anomalous ch4 samples sc ca and ba are all salinity related features previous studies e g brantley et al 2014 cantlay et al 2020b tisherman and bain 2019 wen et al 2019b woda et al 2020 2018 have also identified other salinity related parameters cl ca na mg na ca mg and ba cl that are helpful in detecting anomalous ch4 in groundwater samples or distinguishing chemical signatures of produced waters from shale gas development from other types of contamination these same parameters i e cl ca na mg na ca mg and ba cl show up in sub models ranked as high as 8th 13th 19th 82nd and 191st table s1a respectively furthermore the frequency of inclusion of these features in the top 1000 sub models are 87 4 2 11 and 8 respectively table s1b and fig 4 in addition to the salinity related parameters mentioned by previous authors a few new ones were identified as important i e high frequency in the top 1 000 performance sub models e g ca tds 49 and ba alk 81 table s1b these salinity related features can effectively distinguish natural migration of thermogenic ch4 from anomalous ch4 presumably because ch4 often migrates naturally with salt containing appalachian basin brine into shallow groundwater e g warner et al 2012 wen et al 2019b woda et al 2018 alkalinity may appear because it increases during sulfate reduction one of the redox processes see next paragraph that sometimes couple to methane oxidation woda et al 2018 in addition to salinity redox sensitive features e g fe so4 so4 na are also frequently found in the top performing sub models table s1 and fig 4 for example so4 and fe concentrations have previously been used to detect anomalous ch4 in groundwater wen et al 2019b woda et al 2020 2018 and the frequency of so4 containing and fe containing features e g fe so4 appearing in the top 100 sub models are 17 and 10 respectively it is worth noting that many so4 or fe containing features also incorporate salinity related features e g so4 na and fe ba redox features are expected because the presence of ch4 creates an anoxic environment that in turn promotes reduction of redox sensitive species such as sulfate so4 2 to sulfide s2 and fe iii to fe ii the formation of sulfide leads to precipitation of metal sulfide and a decrease in so4 and fe concentrations over time woda et al 2020 2018 low concentrations of all of these redox sensitive parameters are expected when the source of ch4 is natural and the groundwater has had a relatively long time to reach thermodynamic equilibrium in contrast when anomalous ch4 migrates into shallow oxygenated groundwater months can pass before the water reaches chemical equilibrium allowing the co existence of transiently high methane sulfate and iron in the same water samples that can be detected during the transient wen et al 2019b woda et al 2020 2018 3 1 2 specific observations best performing features are summarized for the top 100 200 500 and 1 000 models in fig 4 and the likelihood of the presence of anomalous ch4 in groundwater is calculated for all of these four top lists in the following sections it is clear that in the first two lists i e top 100 200 the frequency of sc containing features sc and 1 sc dominate over the other top features so if the likelihood of groundwater samples being impacted by anomalous ch4 is calculated from an ensemble model considering only the top 100 or 200 features the calculated likelihood will be largely biased towards sc two more features na and cl are reported with high frequency in the top 500 list but the calculated likelihood of groundwater samples being impacted by anomalous ch4 still depends strongly on the salinity features sc na and cl to holistically assess groundwater chemistry and to be more conservative we focus the most extensive discussion mainly about the results based on the list for the top 1 000 the top 1 000 model fig 4 3 2 model validation after training with the use of putatively contaminated sample data n 16 the top 1 000 sub models were validated against another groundwater quality dataset of 14 high ch4 groundwater samples from northeastern or central pa all were reported with ch4 10 mg l of these 13 were reported for 4 sites putatively impacted by anomalous ch4 llewellyn et al 2015 wen et al 2019b woda et al 2018 the likelihood of contamination was 90 for each of these 13 validation samples tables 3 and s2 by the ensemble model using the top 1 000 sub models this suggests that the ensemble model has high sensitivity i e high recall rate i e the model is very effective in detecting anomalous ch4 in groundwater samples true positives the 14th sample that we used for validation was groundwater from salt spring state park in northern pa that spring sample is known to contain naturally occurring ch4 with ch4 10 mg l salt spring state park in table s2 the predicted likelihood that this groundwater sample is impacted by anomalous ch4 is 14 which means that the ensemble model predicts that this sample is likely not contaminated by anomalous ch4 i e a true negative thus the proposed ensemble model is also very effective in distinguishing whether high ch4 in groundwater is naturally occurring e g 20 likelihood or anomalous e g 90 likelihood 3 3 model application we now apply this ensemble model to the hold out pennsylvania data data not incorporated in the training dataset as well as groundwater data from other states fig 5 to seek to detect anomalous ch4 in other groundwater samples as a way to explore our two hypotheses and to compare to previous research christian et al 2016 darvari et al 2017 nicot et al 2017a 2017b 2017c sherwood et al 2016 wen et al 2019b 2018 3 3 1 pennsylvania hold out data a total of 4 772 groundwater samples from the shale network database are in the pennsylvania hold out dataset among these only 64 show both ch4 10 mg l as well as measurements for all the single predictor features these 64 groundwater samples are all located in northeastern pa figs 5 and 6 table s3 the top 1 000 model predicts that 29 of these 64 groundwater samples show a 50 likelihood and of these 13 show 80 likelihood of being impacted by anomalous ch4 figs 5 and 6 table s3 to assess the efficacy of the ensemble model for pennsylvania we compare the machine learning results to the results based on a more simplified and streamlined approach by wen et al 2019b based on six selected geochemical parameters ch4 cl ca na fe and sulfate concentration wen et al 2019b categorized groundwater samples into five geochemical types their type 4 and 5 waters were considered to the most likely to be impacted by anomalous ch4 their characteristics include ca na mass ratio 0 52 cl 30 mg l ch4 10 mg l and dis equilibrated fe concentrations 0 3 mg l and or dis equilibrated sulfate concentration 6 mg l using this simplified workflow from wen et al 2019b we identified a total of 17 samples of types 4 or 5 in the hold out pa dataset ten of these 17 samples were used to train the ensemble model and five were not considered by the ensemble model because they lacked values for all of the 15 single geochemical features the remaining two analyses sample ids are padep predrill chk 827 and padep predrill bradford burlington t 005 well table s3 were detected accurately true positives by the top 1 000 model as showing a high likelihood i e 50 of impact by anomalous ch4 in addition to the two samples detected by both the ensemble model in this study as well as by wen et al 2019b the ensemble model also identified 27 other samples with a predicted likelihood of 50 12 samples 80 of anomalous ch4 the workflow of wen et al 2019b did not detect these 27 samples as impacted by anomalous methane because cl 30 mg l or sulfate 6 mg l if the new ensemble model approach is correct these samples are impacted by anomalous methane and were false negatives in the previous study lending credence to the conclusion that these sites were impacted by anomalous methane is the observation that all but 11 of these 27 samples were from four areas that lie near locations with known contamination as reported in the literature llewellyn et al 2015 wen et al 2019b 2018 figs 5 and 6 table s3 the last eleven putatively false negatives are not close to any sites previously identified as problematic given that all the other 16 sites show some history of local contamination we conclude that all these putatively false negatives were impacted by recent intrusion of anomalous methane which might be caused by nearby shale gas drilling at the time of sampling and should have received in depth analysis to determine the source and mechanism of the elevated ch4 although the streamlined workflow from wen et al 2019b is easy to implement and effective in detecting anomalous methane samples it is limited in the number of geochemical parameters considered and it likely returned at least 27 false negatives for the pa hold out dataset in contrast our ensemble model evaluates a fuller set of groundwater chemistry data and can identify waters that are contaminated that were missed by the streamlined workflow of wen et al 2019b 3 3 2 new york although new york is almost geologically identical to pennsylvania in the counties considered here it is not producing shale gas because high volume hydraulic fracturing with horizontal drilling is banned instead conventional oil and gas drilling has long been important in the state brantley et al 2014 summarized reports from the pa regulator showing that the reporting rate of problems of anomalous ch4 from conventional oil and gas well development in pa was much smaller than that observed for shale gas development after 2004 we thus hypothesized that we would see a very low rate of anomalous ch4 in the small dataset of groundwater quality available for the region of oil and gas production in new york christian et al 2016 this hypothesis is especially compelling because geologically northern pa is very similar to ny but the laws are different and the use of high volume high pressure hydraulic fracturing in ny unconventional reservoirs is not allowed therefore unlike pa samples all of the new york samples were collected in advance of high volume hydraulic fracturing but might postdate some of the nearby conventional drilling in the new york dataset of 203 groundwater samples only five are reported with high ch4 10 mg l four of these five samples are predicted by the top 1 000 ensemble model as low likelihood i e 30 of containing anomalous methane tables 3 and s4 figs 5 and 6 however one st35b with a ch4 of 13 8 mg l yields a 71 likelihood of impact by anomalous ch4 table s4 and figs 5 and 6 sample st35b was identified in the ensemble model because it has a very low cl of 4 1 mg l but relatively high sulfate and fe of 8 99 and 0 42 mg l respectively it is thus also detected as a contaminated sample by the streamlined test of wen et al 2019b and is likely based on these tests to contain ch4 that has infiltrated the groundwater recently although this sample appears to have been infiltrated with ch4 recently other lines of evidence suggest that the migration was not caused by oil or gas development for example the distance between site st35b sampled in 2013 and the nearest oil or gas well drilled prior to 1980 is 6 km the large distance and long period of time between gas well drilling and water sample collection render the source of methane in water wells unlikely to have originated from the gas wells but this water well is drilled into the very gas rich canadaway formation near a large number of faults and lineaments and may nonetheless have been affected by recent migration of naturally occurring ch4 to the water well consistent with this conclusion christian et al 2016 pointed out that values of ch4 in the ny groundwater data including implicitly st35b do not statistically vary with proximity to gas wells or faults they argued that elevated ch4 in the ny samples is most likely of natural origin this conclusion was based on the observation that high ch4 is often associated with na rich waters in valleys in ny that are impacted by natural brines christian et al 2016 however while st35b had a high na 30 1 mg l it had very low cl 4 1 mg l therefore the high na in that sample did not derive from contamination by nacl rich brine and was not flagged as such by the ensemble model on the other hand water from st35b was reported to smell like rotten egg i e h2s and is locally associated with brownish red stains pers comm laura lautz perhaps pointing to ongoing sulfate reduction coupled with methane oxidation wen et al 2019b woda et al 2020 2018 our prediction that st35b contains anomalous methane might be a false positive in particular it could be water that was recently impacted by natural ch4 rather than ch4 migrated from hydrocarbon development activities in future predictions with the ensemble model a filter for proximity to oil gas wells should be included e g waters sampled within 5 km a fisher exact test was used to test our original hypothesis i e to test if the frequency of detection of ch4 impacted groundwater samples 50 likely to be impacted by anomalous methane differ between pa i e 42 2 983 and ny i e 1 78 whether we assume that st35b is an example of anomalous methane caused by oil gas development or not the fisher test results show no statistically significant difference between pa and ny at a confidence level of 95 p 0 05 thus we must reject the hypothesis in that the ensemble model reveals similar frequencies of putative contamination by anomalous methane in the part of the marcellus shale play utilizing horizontal drilling hydraulic fracturing as compared to the part with conventional resource development 3 3 3 texas and colorado we also compiled groundwater quality data from texas to test the hypothesis that the frequency of identification of anomalous methane in groundwater wells is higher in pa than in other shale plays states a total of 688 groundwater samples are included in the compiled texas data which cover three major shale gas plays in texas barnett shale eagle ford shale and haynesville shale among these samples ch4 is 10 mg l in 34 groundwater samples table s5 and figs 5 and 6 of these 34 samples none were identified to have a likelihood of anomalous ch4 50 this is consistent with the findings from previous investigations of the sources of ch4 in these three shale plays darvari et al 2017 nicot et al 2017a 2017b 2017c i e no ch4 in these shallow water wells is associated with recent development of nearby shale gas production the ensemble model was also applied to a large groundwater quality dataset of 10 258 water samples collected across colorado mainly within the denver julesburg raton san juan and uinta piceance basins fig 1 of these samples high ch4 10 mg l samples n 58 with complete measurements for all required single geochemical features exist only in the denver julesburg basin and raton basin fig 1 these 58 samples were collected from 29 sites table s6 of which only four samples from four sites i e 705739 755481 752672 750143 are associated by the ensemble model with a likelihood 50 for anomalous methane three of the sites are in the denver julesburg basin and one in the raton basin all other samples sites with high ch4 are calculated to be 50 likely to have been impacted by anomalous ch4 a detailed discussion of the results of model application to colorado dataset is included in the supporting information with these data we test our second hypothesis namely that the frequency of detection of anomalous methane in the marcellus shale play is higher than in texas colorado treating the colorado and texas measurements as one dataset the combined frequency of detection of groundwater samples showing 50 likelihood is 4 795 statistically lower than the rate in pennsylvania i e 42 2 983 at a confidence level of 95 p 0 04 using the fisher exact test this finding supports our second hypothesis that the frequency of detection in the marcellus shale play is higher than in texas and colorado to explain this result we point to hammond et al 2020 which suggested that most of the anomalous ch4 released from gas wells in the us occurs because primary cementation is not completed along the full lengths of production casings from the target shale to intermediate casings or to surface casings if intermediate casings are not used the higher frequency in the marcellus play could therefore derive from differences in casings and cementation or differences in gas contents at intermediate depths for boreholes in that play as compared to other plays 4 conclusion we presented a machine learning ensemble model that shows that salinity related and redox related measurements are effective geochemical features that can detect anomalous methane in groundwater one problem with the application of the model to date is that we cannot exclude the possibility that differences in sample sizes contributed to differences in detection frequencies clearly larger datasets for all shale gas plays could be used to eliminate this problem furthermore a machine learning model that incorporated additional geochemical measurements such as isotopes would presumably be even more adept at finding evidence of anomalous ch4 for the regions we studied pa tx co ny the frequency of reported water samples with ch4 10 mg l the level often considered to be dangerous was 2 1 5 8 7 4 and 3 4 in contrast the frequency of identification of anomalous methane by the ensemble machine learning model was 1 4 0 0 9 1 3 with st35b and 0 without st35b these values were determined by application of the ensemble model where we detected 42 2 983 0 338 4 457 and 1 78 or 0 77 of the water samples were 50 likely to be impacted by newly migrated natural gas in these states respectively one ny sample flagged as likely to have newly migrated methane was sampled 6 km from the nearest oil gas well and thus may be contaminated by new methane from a different source fisher exact tests show statistically significant differences between the results for pa versus tx co i e with evidence for a higher frequency of migrated methane sites in pa but show no statistically significant difference within the marcellus shale play between regions using versus not using high pressure high volume hydraulic fracturing the new machine learning tool appears to be useful in detecting anomalous methane in multiple shale plays future work should include additional training and validation of data driven models

16932,numerous geochemical approaches have been proposed to ascertain if methane concentrations in groundwater ch4 are anomalous i e migrated from hydrocarbon production wells rather than derived from natural sources we propose a machine learning model to consider alkalinity ca mg na ba fe mn cl sulfate tds specific conductance ph temperature and turbidity holistically together the model an ensemble of sub models targeting one parameter pair per sub model was trained with groundwater chemistry from pennsylvania n 19 086 and a set of 16 analyses from putatively contaminated groundwater for cases where ch4 10 mg l salinity and redox related parameters sometimes show that ch4 may have moved into the aquifer recently and separately from natural brine migration i e anomalous ch4 we applied the model to validation and hold out data for pennsylvania n 4 786 and groundwater data from three other gas producing states new york n 203 texas n 688 and colorado n 10 258 the applications show that 1 4 1 3 0 and 0 9 of tested samples in these four states respectively have high ch4 and are 50 likely to have been impacted by gas migrated from exploited reservoirs if our approach is indeed successful in flagging anomalous ch4 we conclude that i the frequency of anomalous ch4 flagged water samples total samples tested in the appalachian basin is similar in areas where gas wells target unconventional as compared to conventional reservoirs and ii the frequency of anomalous ch4 in pennsylvania is higher than in texas colorado we cannot however exclude the possibility that differences among regions might be affected by differences in data volumes machine learning models will become increasingly useful in informing decision making for shale gas development graphical

gas production from newly discovered technically recoverable shale reserves u s energy information administration 2017 in the meantime putative incidents of deterioration of water quality caused by shale gas development have been investigated throughout the us brantley et al 2014 darrah et al 2014 guo et al 2014 nicot and scanlon 2012 vidic et al 2013 wen et al 2019b 2019a woda et al 2018 yang et al 2013 where it is not rare to see that hydrocarbon wells show signs of compromised well integrity lackey et al 2021 proving that contamination was caused by shale gas development activities is always difficult and estimating the frequency of problems is even more problematic however for the public to make decisions about granting social license for shale gas development requires some information about the frequency of problems in this paper we explore the use of a machine learning model developed with large groundwater datasets from one region to see if such data driven models can be used in other regions to assess incidents of contamination we developed the model by application to data from pennsylvania pa the state in the us with the longest history of conventional oil gas og drilling and coal mining pa has become a leading area for shale gas production through use of horizontal drilling and high volume hydraulic fracturing to extract gas and liquids from the marcellus and utica shales the contaminant that has been identified as the most common problem in pa is methane ch4 the chief component of natural gas brantley et al 2014 many studies investigating groundwater quality in shale gas basins have focused on contamination by such anomalous ch4 hammond 2016 hammond et al 2020 li and carlson 2014 molofsky et al 2013 nicot et al 2017c osborn et al 2011 sherwood et al 2016 siegel et al 2015a b 2016 smith et al 2016 wen et al 2017 2016 here anomalous ch4 is used to denote dissolved or free phase ch4 found in groundwater that is putatively derived from the effects of recent human activities related to shale gas development in general naturally occurring ch4 may have long affected an aquifer whereas anomalous ch4 represents a relatively new source at the impacted site the identification of new anomalous ch4 is difficult at least partly because naturally occurring ch4 is common in many basins including in pa groundwater baldassare et al 2014 siegel et al 2015b wen et al 2019b in a limited number of areas the causes of elevated ch4 in groundwater have been attributed to og production activities conventional or unconventional darrah et al 2014 grieve et al 2018 hammond 2016 hammond et al 2020 jackson et al 2013 osborn et al 2011 u s environmental protection agency 2015 warner et al 2012 wen et al 2019b woda et al 2018 identification of anomalous versus natural ch4 in groundwater often relies on measurement of carbon isotopes in the gas e g baldassare et al 2014 jackson et al 2013 but this is somewhat expensive and seldomly definitive researchers have also sometimes used other hydrogeochemical patterns to identify anomalous ch4 for example the migration of natural ch4 from deeper formations into shallow groundwater in the appalachian basin is often accompanied by salt containing waters which leads to slightly elevated salt contents in the shallow aquifer and distinctive chemical signatures siegel et al 2015a 2015b warner et al 2012 wen et al 2019b therefore major and trace elements e g calcium sodium and bromide brantley et al 2014 cantlay et al 2020b grieve et al 2018 lu et al 2015 mcmahon et al 2017b schout et al 2018 warner et al 2012 wen et al 2019b woda et al 2018 have been proposed to distinguish varying sources of subsurface fluids in addition electron acceptors can be reduced e g so4 can be reduced to sulfide by bacteria that use ch4 as an electron donor mcmahon et al 2017b schout et al 2018 van stempvoort et al 2005 woda et al 2018 the concentration of sulfate in waters has sometimes been used to detect anomalous ch4 as it is easier to collect and analyze water samples for sulfate than sulfide other tracers were also proposed recently to detect anomalous ch4 in groundwater e g strontium isotopes warner et al 2012 woda et al 2018 lithium and boron isotopes warner et al 2014 and noble gas isotopes darrah et al 2015 2014 wen et al 2017 2016 woda et al 2018 these latter isotopic tools require a high level of expert knowledge and advanced and expensive analytical facilities to ensure proper data acquisition and interpretation such characteristics so far have prevented these tracers from being applied widely for monitoring of baseline water quality in the area of shale gas production among these hydrogeochemical tracers no single parameter is characteristic of a particular source for anomalous ch4 cantlay et al 2020b in past studies determining the attribution of anomalous ch4 bivariate plots were often used in which the variables are generally concentrations of hydrogeochemical parameters e g chloride and or concentration ratios e g ca na no single bivariate plot has been suggested that provides definitive answers about whether anomalous ch4 is present instead the source of elevated ch4 is more likely to be identified through a combination of parallel bivariate plots cantlay et al 2020b wen et al 2019b woda et al 2018 we wanted to test machine learning approaches to identifying anomalous ch4 in multiple shale gas plays logistic regression lr introduced in the late 1980s mccullagh and nelder 1989 is a type of machine learning algorithm used to make dichotomous prediction e g whether the dissolved ch4 concentration is higher or lower than a threshold value lr has been used in environmental science to predict the presence of certain redox sensitive contaminants in groundwater e g arsenic ayotte et al 2016 nitrate nolan et al 2002 and the redox state tesoriero et al 2015 lr was also used to predict the probability of ch4 occurrence in aquifers in alberta canada humez et al 2019 in these studies a lr model was built based on a few selected categorical or continuous variables no interactions between variables were explicitly considered for example humez et al 2019 used sulfate and total dissolved solids as input variables to predict the presence of ch4 but no concentration ratios of these variables were ever explicitly considered recognizing that the concentrations of chemical constituents in groundwater are prone to differences in the baseline effects of local geology topography and hydrology we suspected that the exclusion of concentration ratio variables in these previously used models largely hampered investigators ability to generalize the models and findings to other areas in addition in the above mentioned studies all variables were fed into a single lr model to generate the final dichotomous prediction and this made it difficult to completely understand how each variable contributed to the prediction in this study we developed an ensemble lr model trained with data shale network 2015 from the northern appalachian basin in pa each sub model focusses on a pair of hydrogeochemical parameters more complex classifiers like random forest or xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 were not used because their outputs are harder to explicitly interpret and visualize we considered predictor features themselves and their interactions we then explored use of the refined ensemble model on additional hold out hydrogeochemistry data from pa and other data from new york texas and colorado fig 1 to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to apply an ensemble lr model to predict whether ch4 in groundwater is anomalous or natural with the improved availability of hydrogeochemistry data such a prediction model could be potentially beneficial for other areas in the us and even for other countries regions with existing or planned og production although we do not have definitive evidence for which groundwater sample s in each basin are affected by anomalous methane we validated the model against a dataset of 13 sites with high ch4 presumed to be caused by gas development activity and 1 site with high ch4 thought to be unaffected by anthropogenic activities we also explored the model by testing it against the following hypotheses we derived from the literature i the frequency of detection of anomalous methane impacted water samples total water samples tested in the appalachian basin is greater where gas wells target unconventional as compared to conventional reservoirs brantley et al 2014 ingraffea et al 2014 and ii the frequency of detection of anomalous methane in groundwater in the marcellus utica shale play is higher than in western shale plays such as those in texas and colorado e g brantley et al 2014 hammond et al 2020 mcmahon et al 2017a sherwood et al 2016 woda et al 2018 2 methods and materials 2 1 groundwater quality data used in model development and application we collated groundwater chemistry analyses from basins that contain some of the largest shale plays in the u s and that also are associated with large groundwater datasets the appalachian basin within pennsylvania n 23 858 shale network 2015 the fort worth tx la ms salt and western gulf basins within texas n 688 darvari et al 2017 nicot et al 2017a 2017b 2017c and the denver julesburg raton san juan paradox uinta piceance greater green and north park basins within colorado n 10 258 https cogcc state co us we decided not to include some shale plays such as the fayetteville shale in arkansas in our study because 1 that play has shown little evidence for gas migration mcmahon et al 2017a warner et al 2013 2 we were unaware of a large dataset of groundwater chemistry for analysis and 3 this region is not one of the major shale gas production areas the samples we analyzed were compiled from a variety of data sources fig 1 table 1 a relatively small dataset of groundwater quality in the counties of new york n 203 christian et al 2016 that neighbor pennsylvania was also tested for comparison because it represents a region of long standing exploitation of conventional but not unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs more detailed descriptions of these datasets and sources are included in the supporting information all datasets discussed in this study will be released at https doi org 10 26208 qs4c ks39 we trained the model to a set of 19 102 groundwater sample analyses that included a small set of groundwater quality data compiled from sites that are presumed to have been impacted by anomalous ch4 we then used an additional subset of analyses from such putatively contaminated samples to validate the model performance samples are referred to here as putatively contaminated when they were reported to be contaminated in published journal articles or government reports based on field and laboratory investigations llewellyn et al 2015 u s environmental protection agency 2015 wen et al 2019b woda et al 2018 these data were divided into a set for training n 16 from granville road and paradise road bradford co and gregs run lycoming co and a set for validation n 13 from paradise road bradford co and sugar run lycoming co an additional sample of a well known brine spring that is naturally ch4 rich from northern pa was also used as part of the validation dataset sites were largely determined to be putatively contaminated based on temporal changes in methane concentration carbon isotope data in collected water samples and geological investigations 2 2 predictor features used in the model we strove to develop a machine learning based ensemble model that could use geochemical analyses to quantify the likelihood that a groundwater sample with high dissolved ch4 had been impacted by anomalous rather than natural ch4 a total of 118 geochemical parameters were considered as potential predictor features in the model in other words these features were tested for their ability to predict if ch4 in a given sample was anomalous or natural these predictor features are divided into three main sub categories as discussed in the next paragraphs detailed descriptions of these predictor features can also be found in the supporting information data for many of the concentrations were beneath detection i e censored for example many of the ch4 concentrations 31 1 were censored i e below reporting limits to maximize the number of measurements for each feature we chose the fifteen geochemical parameters for which the percent of non censored measurements was 31 1 these 15 features are referred to as single geochemical features or sgf in table 2 these 15 water quality parameters were reported in the training data from pa shale network 2015 with over 10 000 measurements each bicarbonate alkalinity alk calcium ca chloride cl magnesium mg sodium na sulfate or so4 2 so4 total dissolved solids tds barium ba iron fe manganese mn ph hydrogen ion h specific conductance sc temperature temp and turbidity specific conductance of a water solution is a measure of its ability to conduct electricity turbidity is a measure of the degree to which the water solution has lost transparency due to the presence of suspended particulates ph was considered in addition to hydrogen ion concentration because ph the more commonly reported term is a calculated parameter ph log hydrogen ion concentration that is not directly comparable to the other concentrations the second and third sub categories of predictor features are the reciprocals of the concentrations of all the sgf except for ph and water temperature n 13 reciprocal feature and the ratios of any two sgf ratio features ratio features were calculated for all features except for ph h sc water temperature turbidity n 90 the inclusion of features in the second and third categories was motivated by the observation that these two types of arithmetic combinations of geochemical parameters have been widely used by geoscientists in tracing the source of solutes in groundwater because they can represent stoichiometric coefficients in the governing geochemical reactions e g bau et al 2004 brantley et al 2014 cantlay et al 2020c 2020b 2020c tisherman and bain 2019 furthermore we reasoned that the stoichiometries of these geochemical reactions need not be restricted to one hydrocarbon basin alone and thus might be more predictive across basins subtraction and multiplication of sgf were not considered because unlike ratios there are no known fundamental reasons why such functions should be predictive a machine learning model using only geochemical predictor features allows us to focus on assessing the interplay of geochemical parameters as well as their relative importance in determining whether the elevated ch4 present in groundwater samples is likely to represent anomalous ch4 therefore no non geochemical features e g land use and bedrock geology were considered in this study 2 3 machine learning based ensemble model our workflow included three sequential phases ensemble model development which included training validation and application fig 2 taking two parameters from the 118 parameters at a time without repetition yields a total number of 6 903 pair combinations we started with these 6 903 possible geochemical pairs that were each tested in a sub model the process of model development described in the next paragraphs identified the subset of 6 903 predictor pairs that were most successful in determining the likelihood of a groundwater sample being impacted by anomalous ch4 the likelihood was calculated as the ratio of the number of sub models flagging the ch4 as not being naturally derived and therefore putatively anomalous divided by the total number of sub models considered the collection of sub models is termed here the ensemble model at the stage of ensemble model development green in fig 2 sub models using the full list of 118 geochemical features paired into 6 903 predictors were trained with 19 102 analyses referred to as training data table 1 fig 2 each of the 6 903 sub models fig 2 considers only one pair of predictor features in effect each sub model imitates the traditional procedure of using bivariate plots of geochemical variables to investigate the origin of dissolved ch4 in groundwater see for example figure s10 in woda et al 2018 the performance of each sub model was evaluated with respect to two tasks first it was evaluated for its ability to predict whether the ch4 is above or below the threshold identified as potentially problematic 10 mg l in the 19 086 water samples task 1 given that these samples were collected by professional consultants working for gas companies before drilling gas wells within a few kilometers of the water wells the waters could be contaminated or uncontaminated by ch4 from previous oil gas activity but we have no outside evidence of contamination we hypothesized that successful sub models would predict ch4 10 mg l for samples reported to have ch4 10 mg l we inferred these samples are impacted by anomalous ch4 this approach is implicitly built on the assumption that natural high ch4 waters are chemically distinct from anomalous high ch4 waters however we acknowledge that our method will not detect anomalous methane in waters with very low values of ch4 in task 2 each sub model was additionally evaluated to see if it successfully identified the ch4 in 16 of the putatively contaminated training samples as anomalous task 2 the concentration of 10 mg l was selected because it is a threshold above which immediate action is needed eltschlager et al 2001 wen et al 2019b during ensemble model development green in fig 2 a linear classifier logistic regression lr is used in the two tasks with 5 fold cross validation lr is generally used to solve binary classification problems with lr the relationship between predictor features and the prediction outcome can be described by a sigmoidal function as illustrated by equation 1 in which x represents predictor features and y is the binary model output of 0 ch4 10 mg l or 1 ch4 10 mg l 1 y e w x b 1 e w x b in the training the sub model allows optimization of w and b to best predict the training data once w and b are optimized each sub model can be used in task 1 to predict which groundwater samples are characterized by ch4 10 mg l for this task area under the curve auc is considered as the performance metric where a higher auc value indicates higher accuracy of prediction auc in particular was chosen as the accuracy measure as it holistically evaluates the model performance in predicting both positive i e high methane sample and negative i e low methane sample results in task 2 the sub model was applied to 16 putatively contaminated samples f1 score was calculated following equation 2 as the performance metric 2 f 1 s c o r e 2 r e c a l l 1 p r e c i s i o n 1 here recall is defined as the proportion of the 16 samples identified correctly while precision is the proportion of predicted anomalous ch4 samples that are actually contaminated f1 score was chosen to prioritize maximizing true positives i e known problematic samples correctly identified as it does not consider true negatives i e known natural samples correctly identified both tasks 1 and 2 were used to identify the best sub model to detect anomalous ch4 in impacted waters samples reported to have high ch4 that were incorrectly classified as low ch4 samples by sub models in task 1 were inferred to have been impacted by anomalous ch4 we chose sub models with higher accuracy of prediction in task 1 to yield a lower number of false positives to evaluate the performance of each sub model for both tasks 1 and 2 we defined a synthesized metric namely 0 7 x f1 score 0 3 x auc the selection of coefficients 0 7 and 0 3 is not entirely arbitrary we assigned the higher weight 0 7 to f1 as that task is more critical all sub models and the associated pair of features n 6 903 were ranked by the final synthesized score we also completed a sensitivity test of the coefficients table s1a and s1b and determined that feature members in the top feature list e g top 20 are mostly unchanged e g sc na cl so4 although the exact rank of features by frequency changes to a limited extent in the phases of model validation and application the prediction results for the best performing sub models were used to estimate the likelihood of impact of groundwater samples by anomalous ch4 fig 2 this likelihood was defined as the percentage of considered sub models that classified the sample as impacted by anomalous ch4 we calculated four types of likelihood for each water sample using the best n sub models where we explored n 100 200 500 as well as 1 000 we ultimately chose n 1 000 to be conservative the selection of n 1 000 is supported by the observation that 1 an ensemble model with fewer sub models would be more likely to be biased towards a few geochemical parameters e g the ensemble model for n 100 was observed to be highly biased towards sc as discussed in the text below and 2 an ensemble model with a larger number of sub models e g n 1 000 was expected to assess water chemistry more holistically improving model applicability and performance for new datasets with less likelihood of overfitting in this study the ensemble model was trained and validated with hydrogeochemistry data in pennsylvania i e marcellus shale and then was tested in other natural gas production regions in colorado texas and new york differences in bedrock geology regional hydrogeochemistry topography and land use between testing and training validation datasets might in some cases hamper the applicability of the developed ensemble model we strove to minimize this issue by considering interactions of ratios of concentrations of single geochemical features as these concentration ratios tend to yield less variability across different regions as more hydrogeochemical data become available in particular from presumably contaminated sites the ensemble model can be further validated and even re trained with new data 3 results and discussion 3 1 model development two statistical methods pearson correlation and spearman s rank correlation were adopted to assess the pairwise correlation of the 15 single geochemical features in predicting the target feature ch4 the pearson correlation is used to evaluate linear relationships between continuous variables that are assumed to obey normal distributions while the spearman s rank correlation is used to evaluate monotonic relationships between two continuous variables without the requirement that variables are normally distributed therefore the spearman s rank correlation identifies more pairs of features that report statistically significant correlations p 0 05 compared to the pearson correlation fig 3 the pairwise correlations led us to note three groups for the fifteen single geochemical features 1 salinity related alk ba ca cl mg na tds sc 2 redox sensitive fe mn and so4 and 3 others ph temp turbidity and h these groupings are used to categorize the best performing sub models in subsequent discussions 3 1 1 general observations the synthesized scores of all sub models n 6 903 are listed and ranked in table s1a the best performing sub model synthesized score 0 9579 f1 0 9677 auc 0 9350 corresponds to the pair 1 sc and ca ba table s1a from this observation we inferred that salinity is an effective tool to detect anomalous ch4 samples sc ca and ba are all salinity related features previous studies e g brantley et al 2014 cantlay et al 2020b tisherman and bain 2019 wen et al 2019b woda et al 2020 2018 have also identified other salinity related parameters cl ca na mg na ca mg and ba cl that are helpful in detecting anomalous ch4 in groundwater samples or distinguishing chemical signatures of produced waters from shale gas development from other types of contamination these same parameters i e cl ca na mg na ca mg and ba cl show up in sub models ranked as high as 8th 13th 19th 82nd and 191st table s1a respectively furthermore the frequency of inclusion of these features in the top 1000 sub models are 87 4 2 11 and 8 respectively table s1b and fig 4 in addition to the salinity related parameters mentioned by previous authors a few new ones were identified as important i e high frequency in the top 1 000 performance sub models e g ca tds 49 and ba alk 81 table s1b these salinity related features can effectively distinguish natural migration of thermogenic ch4 from anomalous ch4 presumably because ch4 often migrates naturally with salt containing appalachian basin brine into shallow groundwater e g warner et al 2012 wen et al 2019b woda et al 2018 alkalinity may appear because it increases during sulfate reduction one of the redox processes see next paragraph that sometimes couple to methane oxidation woda et al 2018 in addition to salinity redox sensitive features e g fe so4 so4 na are also frequently found in the top performing sub models table s1 and fig 4 for example so4 and fe concentrations have previously been used to detect anomalous ch4 in groundwater wen et al 2019b woda et al 2020 2018 and the frequency of so4 containing and fe containing features e g fe so4 appearing in the top 100 sub models are 17 and 10 respectively it is worth noting that many so4 or fe containing features also incorporate salinity related features e g so4 na and fe ba redox features are expected because the presence of ch4 creates an anoxic environment that in turn promotes reduction of redox sensitive species such as sulfate so4 2 to sulfide s2 and fe iii to fe ii the formation of sulfide leads to precipitation of metal sulfide and a decrease in so4 and fe concentrations over time woda et al 2020 2018 low concentrations of all of these redox sensitive parameters are expected when the source of ch4 is natural and the groundwater has had a relatively long time to reach thermodynamic equilibrium in contrast when anomalous ch4 migrates into shallow oxygenated groundwater months can pass before the water reaches chemical equilibrium allowing the co existence of transiently high methane sulfate and iron in the same water samples that can be detected during the transient wen et al 2019b woda et al 2020 2018 3 1 2 specific observations best performing features are summarized for the top 100 200 500 and 1 000 models in fig 4 and the likelihood of the presence of anomalous ch4 in groundwater is calculated for all of these four top lists in the following sections it is clear that in the first two lists i e top 100 200 the frequency of sc containing features sc and 1 sc dominate over the other top features so if the likelihood of groundwater samples being impacted by anomalous ch4 is calculated from an ensemble model considering only the top 100 or 200 features the calculated likelihood will be largely biased towards sc two more features na and cl are reported with high frequency in the top 500 list but the calculated likelihood of groundwater samples being impacted by anomalous ch4 still depends strongly on the salinity features sc na and cl to holistically assess groundwater chemistry and to be more conservative we focus the most extensive discussion mainly about the results based on the list for the top 1 000 the top 1 000 model fig 4 3 2 model validation after training with the use of putatively contaminated sample data n 16 the top 1 000 sub models were validated against another groundwater quality dataset of 14 high ch4 groundwater samples from northeastern or central pa all were reported with ch4 10 mg l of these 13 were reported for 4 sites putatively impacted by anomalous ch4 llewellyn et al 2015 wen et al 2019b woda et al 2018 the likelihood of contamination was 90 for each of these 13 validation samples tables 3 and s2 by the ensemble model using the top 1 000 sub models this suggests that the ensemble model has high sensitivity i e high recall rate i e the model is very effective in detecting anomalous ch4 in groundwater samples true positives the 14th sample that we used for validation was groundwater from salt spring state park in northern pa that spring sample is known to contain naturally occurring ch4 with ch4 10 mg l salt spring state park in table s2 the predicted likelihood that this groundwater sample is impacted by anomalous ch4 is 14 which means that the ensemble model predicts that this sample is likely not contaminated by anomalous ch4 i e a true negative thus the proposed ensemble model is also very effective in distinguishing whether high ch4 in groundwater is naturally occurring e g 20 likelihood or anomalous e g 90 likelihood 3 3 model application we now apply this ensemble model to the hold out pennsylvania data data not incorporated in the training dataset as well as groundwater data from other states fig 5 to seek to detect anomalous ch4 in other groundwater samples as a way to explore our two hypotheses and to compare to previous research christian et al 2016 darvari et al 2017 nicot et al 2017a 2017b 2017c sherwood et al 2016 wen et al 2019b 2018 3 3 1 pennsylvania hold out data a total of 4 772 groundwater samples from the shale network database are in the pennsylvania hold out dataset among these only 64 show both ch4 10 mg l as well as measurements for all the single predictor features these 64 groundwater samples are all located in northeastern pa figs 5 and 6 table s3 the top 1 000 model predicts that 29 of these 64 groundwater samples show a 50 likelihood and of these 13 show 80 likelihood of being impacted by anomalous ch4 figs 5 and 6 table s3 to assess the efficacy of the ensemble model for pennsylvania we compare the machine learning results to the results based on a more simplified and streamlined approach by wen et al 2019b based on six selected geochemical parameters ch4 cl ca na fe and sulfate concentration wen et al 2019b categorized groundwater samples into five geochemical types their type 4 and 5 waters were considered to the most likely to be impacted by anomalous ch4 their characteristics include ca na mass ratio 0 52 cl 30 mg l ch4 10 mg l and dis equilibrated fe concentrations 0 3 mg l and or dis equilibrated sulfate concentration 6 mg l using this simplified workflow from wen et al 2019b we identified a total of 17 samples of types 4 or 5 in the hold out pa dataset ten of these 17 samples were used to train the ensemble model and five were not considered by the ensemble model because they lacked values for all of the 15 single geochemical features the remaining two analyses sample ids are padep predrill chk 827 and padep predrill bradford burlington t 005 well table s3 were detected accurately true positives by the top 1 000 model as showing a high likelihood i e 50 of impact by anomalous ch4 in addition to the two samples detected by both the ensemble model in this study as well as by wen et al 2019b the ensemble model also identified 27 other samples with a predicted likelihood of 50 12 samples 80 of anomalous ch4 the workflow of wen et al 2019b did not detect these 27 samples as impacted by anomalous methane because cl 30 mg l or sulfate 6 mg l if the new ensemble model approach is correct these samples are impacted by anomalous methane and were false negatives in the previous study lending credence to the conclusion that these sites were impacted by anomalous methane is the observation that all but 11 of these 27 samples were from four areas that lie near locations with known contamination as reported in the literature llewellyn et al 2015 wen et al 2019b 2018 figs 5 and 6 table s3 the last eleven putatively false negatives are not close to any sites previously identified as problematic given that all the other 16 sites show some history of local contamination we conclude that all these putatively false negatives were impacted by recent intrusion of anomalous methane which might be caused by nearby shale gas drilling at the time of sampling and should have received in depth analysis to determine the source and mechanism of the elevated ch4 although the streamlined workflow from wen et al 2019b is easy to implement and effective in detecting anomalous methane samples it is limited in the number of geochemical parameters considered and it likely returned at least 27 false negatives for the pa hold out dataset in contrast our ensemble model evaluates a fuller set of groundwater chemistry data and can identify waters that are contaminated that were missed by the streamlined workflow of wen et al 2019b 3 3 2 new york although new york is almost geologically identical to pennsylvania in the counties considered here it is not producing shale gas because high volume hydraulic fracturing with horizontal drilling is banned instead conventional oil and gas drilling has long been important in the state brantley et al 2014 summarized reports from the pa regulator showing that the reporting rate of problems of anomalous ch4 from conventional oil and gas well development in pa was much smaller than that observed for shale gas development after 2004 we thus hypothesized that we would see a very low rate of anomalous ch4 in the small dataset of groundwater quality available for the region of oil and gas production in new york christian et al 2016 this hypothesis is especially compelling because geologically northern pa is very similar to ny but the laws are different and the use of high volume high pressure hydraulic fracturing in ny unconventional reservoirs is not allowed therefore unlike pa samples all of the new york samples were collected in advance of high volume hydraulic fracturing but might postdate some of the nearby conventional drilling in the new york dataset of 203 groundwater samples only five are reported with high ch4 10 mg l four of these five samples are predicted by the top 1 000 ensemble model as low likelihood i e 30 of containing anomalous methane tables 3 and s4 figs 5 and 6 however one st35b with a ch4 of 13 8 mg l yields a 71 likelihood of impact by anomalous ch4 table s4 and figs 5 and 6 sample st35b was identified in the ensemble model because it has a very low cl of 4 1 mg l but relatively high sulfate and fe of 8 99 and 0 42 mg l respectively it is thus also detected as a contaminated sample by the streamlined test of wen et al 2019b and is likely based on these tests to contain ch4 that has infiltrated the groundwater recently although this sample appears to have been infiltrated with ch4 recently other lines of evidence suggest that the migration was not caused by oil or gas development for example the distance between site st35b sampled in 2013 and the nearest oil or gas well drilled prior to 1980 is 6 km the large distance and long period of time between gas well drilling and water sample collection render the source of methane in water wells unlikely to have originated from the gas wells but this water well is drilled into the very gas rich canadaway formation near a large number of faults and lineaments and may nonetheless have been affected by recent migration of naturally occurring ch4 to the water well consistent with this conclusion christian et al 2016 pointed out that values of ch4 in the ny groundwater data including implicitly st35b do not statistically vary with proximity to gas wells or faults they argued that elevated ch4 in the ny samples is most likely of natural origin this conclusion was based on the observation that high ch4 is often associated with na rich waters in valleys in ny that are impacted by natural brines christian et al 2016 however while st35b had a high na 30 1 mg l it had very low cl 4 1 mg l therefore the high na in that sample did not derive from contamination by nacl rich brine and was not flagged as such by the ensemble model on the other hand water from st35b was reported to smell like rotten egg i e h2s and is locally associated with brownish red stains pers comm laura lautz perhaps pointing to ongoing sulfate reduction coupled with methane oxidation wen et al 2019b woda et al 2020 2018 our prediction that st35b contains anomalous methane might be a false positive in particular it could be water that was recently impacted by natural ch4 rather than ch4 migrated from hydrocarbon development activities in future predictions with the ensemble model a filter for proximity to oil gas wells should be included e g waters sampled within 5 km a fisher exact test was used to test our original hypothesis i e to test if the frequency of detection of ch4 impacted groundwater samples 50 likely to be impacted by anomalous methane differ between pa i e 42 2 983 and ny i e 1 78 whether we assume that st35b is an example of anomalous methane caused by oil gas development or not the fisher test results show no statistically significant difference between pa and ny at a confidence level of 95 p 0 05 thus we must reject the hypothesis in that the ensemble model reveals similar frequencies of putative contamination by anomalous methane in the part of the marcellus shale play utilizing horizontal drilling hydraulic fracturing as compared to the part with conventional resource development 3 3 3 texas and colorado we also compiled groundwater quality data from texas to test the hypothesis that the frequency of identification of anomalous methane in groundwater wells is higher in pa than in other shale plays states a total of 688 groundwater samples are included in the compiled texas data which cover three major shale gas plays in texas barnett shale eagle ford shale and haynesville shale among these samples ch4 is 10 mg l in 34 groundwater samples table s5 and figs 5 and 6 of these 34 samples none were identified to have a likelihood of anomalous ch4 50 this is consistent with the findings from previous investigations of the sources of ch4 in these three shale plays darvari et al 2017 nicot et al 2017a 2017b 2017c i e no ch4 in these shallow water wells is associated with recent development of nearby shale gas production the ensemble model was also applied to a large groundwater quality dataset of 10 258 water samples collected across colorado mainly within the denver julesburg raton san juan and uinta piceance basins fig 1 of these samples high ch4 10 mg l samples n 58 with complete measurements for all required single geochemical features exist only in the denver julesburg basin and raton basin fig 1 these 58 samples were collected from 29 sites table s6 of which only four samples from four sites i e 705739 755481 752672 750143 are associated by the ensemble model with a likelihood 50 for anomalous methane three of the sites are in the denver julesburg basin and one in the raton basin all other samples sites with high ch4 are calculated to be 50 likely to have been impacted by anomalous ch4 a detailed discussion of the results of model application to colorado dataset is included in the supporting information with these data we test our second hypothesis namely that the frequency of detection of anomalous methane in the marcellus shale play is higher than in texas colorado treating the colorado and texas measurements as one dataset the combined frequency of detection of groundwater samples showing 50 likelihood is 4 795 statistically lower than the rate in pennsylvania i e 42 2 983 at a confidence level of 95 p 0 04 using the fisher exact test this finding supports our second hypothesis that the frequency of detection in the marcellus shale play is higher than in texas and colorado to explain this result we point to hammond et al 2020 which suggested that most of the anomalous ch4 released from gas wells in the us occurs because primary cementation is not completed along the full lengths of production casings from the target shale to intermediate casings or to surface casings if intermediate casings are not used the higher frequency in the marcellus play could therefore derive from differences in casings and cementation or differences in gas contents at intermediate depths for boreholes in that play as compared to other plays 4 conclusion we presented a machine learning ensemble model that shows that salinity related and redox related measurements are effective geochemical features that can detect anomalous methane in groundwater one problem with the application of the model to date is that we cannot exclude the possibility that differences in sample sizes contributed to differences in detection frequencies clearly larger datasets for all shale gas plays could be used to eliminate this problem furthermore a machine learning model that incorporated additional geochemical measurements such as isotopes would presumably be even more adept at finding evidence of anomalous ch4 for the regions we studied pa tx co ny the frequency of reported water samples with ch4 10 mg l the level often considered to be dangerous was 2 1 5 8 7 4 and 3 4 in contrast the frequency of identification of anomalous methane by the ensemble machine learning model was 1 4 0 0 9 1 3 with st35b and 0 without st35b these values were determined by application of the ensemble model where we detected 42 2 983 0 338 4 457 and 1 78 or 0 77 of the water samples were 50 likely to be impacted by newly migrated natural gas in these states respectively one ny sample flagged as likely to have newly migrated methane was sampled 6 km from the nearest oil gas well and thus may be contaminated by new methane from a different source fisher exact tests show statistically significant differences between the results for pa versus tx co i e with evidence for a higher frequency of migrated methane sites in pa but show no statistically significant difference within the marcellus shale play between regions using versus not using high pressure high volume hydraulic fracturing the new machine learning tool appears to be useful in detecting anomalous methane in multiple shale plays future work should include additional training and validation of data driven models

16933,despite significant advances in the field applications of reserve electrodialysis red to produce salinity gradient power net energy production remains an issue owing to limitations such as high energy requirement for high flow rates of feed solutions and severe fouling and pressure build up when thin spacers are used therefore to maximize the performance and efficiency of energy harvesting in the red a cascaded red stack with multiple stages between the anode and cathode electrodes was investigated in cascaded stacks 100 cell paired stacks were divided into several stages so the feed water flowed into the first stage and the effluent from the first stage was then reused in the next stages this cascaded stack could overcome the typical drawbacks of red large amount of feed water required intensive pumping energy and low net energy production although 25 of the feed water volume was used in the 4 stage cascaded stack 100 cell pairs compared to the conventional stack 100 cell pairs with a parallel flow operation much more energy was produced with the 4 stage cascaded stack the net power density and net specific energy with the 4 stage cascaded stack were the highest at 0 5 cm s 0 48 w m2 and 0 25 cm s 0 06 kwh m3 respectively this is very promising for the practical application of red since feed water volumes can be greatly reduced which could reduce the burden on the feed water pretreatment step consequently we can build a compact red plant with smaller pretreatment processes and fewer red unit stacks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cascaded red stacks linear velocity net power density net specific energy pressure drop reverse electrodialysis 1 introduction sustainable energy generated from salt solutions of different concentrations is termed salinity gradient energy sge reverse electrodialysis red an electrochemical technology that uses ion exchange membranes iems gaskets spacers and electrodes logan and elimelech 2012 tedesco et al 2017 tufa et al 2020 is among the most investigated types of sge technologies in the process two different solutions high concentration solution hc and low concentration solution lc with different salinities are passed through a stack of alternating cation exchange membranes cems and anion exchange membranes aems the hc and lc compartments are created between the aem and the cem spacers between the membranes can also act against concentration polarization which increases ohmic resistance and pressure drop and creates channels for the passage of the solutions one cell pair is comprised of one aem one cem one hc compartment and one lc compartment multi cell pairs are then stacked between an anode and a cathode holes in spacers gaskets and membranes act as manifolds for distributing collecting the two solutions to from the compartments in separate hydraulic circuits nam et al 2019 ortiz imedio et al 2019 red has made noteworthy advances in fundamental studies experimental investigations and field demonstrations recent research advances have stepped up from lab scale units to pilot plants the first red pilot plant 125 cell pair red stack intermembrane distance 280 µm was installed in the netherlands to generate 50 kw of gross power using brines and brackish water resulting in a high salinity ratio tedesco et al 2016 a previous study reported that in the largest unit stack 1000 cell pair red stack intermembrane distance 100 µm seawater and wastewater effluent discharged from a local wastewater treatment plant were used as the hc and lc solutions with a lower salinity ratio than the first pilot scale test nam et al 2019 in these pilot tests a large number of pairs of cems and aems were stacked together to increase the total potential although those pilot scale tests were meaningful pressure buildup occurred specifically at the manifold of the wastewater effluent chamber and further research is required to increase net power yield and efficiency net power is a key performance index used to evaluate the performance of the red stacks and the net specific energy and net energy efficiencies are also important parameters that we need to consider to evaluate red performance kim et al 2021 pawlowski et al 2014a zhu et al 2015b in order to obtain high energy production an improvement in gross power should be obtained and this is normally achieved at higher flow rates because high flow rates are attributed to a decrease in diffusion boundary layer resistance resulting in high gross power ciofalo et al 2019 zhu et al 2015b however using high feed solution flow rates additionally impacts net energy production because the energy required to pump the feed solutions through the red stack increases for high flow rates kim et al 2021 zhu et al 2015b in particular most studies use a parallel flow mode to supply feed solutions to the red stack which requires a high pumping energy for the large amount of required feed solutions and high pressure drops that occur at high flow rates gurreri et al 2012 zhu et al 2015b reducing the flow rates allows lower pressure drops and reduces the feed solution requirements but it also decreases gross power generation a series flow mode could be an option to reduce the volumes of feed solutions but it has only been used in red with 5 10 cell pairs song et al 2021 zhu et al 2013 in this case feed solutions are directed to the first compartment of the stack and this compartment is alternately connected to the outlets and inlets of the next compartments in the stack the residence time of the feed solution in the serial mode could be increased but this also causes a much higher fluid resistance as practical red stacks are normally composed of 500 1000 cell pairs with 500 1000 hc and lc compartments nam et al 2019 tedesco et al 2017 tedesco et al 2016 veerman et al 2008 it was found that increasing the distance between the aem and cem using thicker spacers can reduce pressure drops in particular when using natural feed water 200 and 280 µm thick spacers are normally preferred although thinner spacers such as 100 µm thick spacers can improve fluid distribution in the compartments resulting in high gross power mehdizadeh et al 2019 tedesco et al 2016 however severe clogging and pressure build up are inevitable when using these thinner spacers and consequently this results in cleaning requirements for long term operation with natural feed waters jwa et al 2020 nam et al 2019 therefore attempts should be made to maximize the performance and efficiency of energy harvesting in the red with thick spacers by avoiding the high pumping powers and pressure drops in this study we investigated a new type of red stack in which feed solutions are internally cascaded in a red stack having multiple hydraulic stages electrodialysis stacks for desalination often have two hydraulic stages to enhance desalting efficiency but utilizing multiple hydraulic stages in a single stack has not been tested in red stacks bisselink et al 2016 chen et al 2020 xu et al 2018 therefore in this study the performance of the cascaded stacks 100 cell pairs was compared with that of a conventional red stack 100 cell pairs using the parallel flow mode 2 material and methods 2 1 red set up and operation the 100 cell pair red stack was constructed between two end plates that were manufactured using polycarbonate the shielding membrane was cems which are close to each electrode and a unit cell consists of one cem fujifilm type i netherlands and one aem fujifilm type i netherlands a hc compartment and a lc compartment including spacers in the compartments a woven type spacer thickness 270 µm ds mesh korea was used for the flow path of the feed solutions the ptfe gasket thickness of approximately 300 µm tommy hecco korea was used to prevent contact between the cem and aem and to seal the leaks between the feed solutions the active area of iem is 19 63 cm2 the electrodes were composed of pt ti mesh coating thickness 3 µm wesco electrode korea schematic drawings of the conventional and cascaded stacks are shown in fig 1 in a conventional stack equipped with 100 cell pairs 100 aems and 101 cems feed waters hc and lc solutions were equally distributed to each chamber formed between an aem and a cem at the same time which is a normal red operation method known as a parallel flow mode fig 1a as can be seen in figure s1 in cascaded stacks 100 cell pair stacks were divided into several stages so the feed water flowed into the first stage and the effluent from the first stage was then reused in the next stages fig 1b therefore this is a combination of series and parallel flow modes for a 2 stage cascaded stack the 100 cell pairs were divided into two groups with a ratio of 50 cell pairs 50 cell pairs we tested up to 6 stage cascaded stacks and the 100 cell pair stacks were divided with a ratio of 33 34 34 for 3 stage cascaded stacks 25 25 25 25 for 4 stage cascaded stacks 20 20 20 20 20 for 5 stage cascaded stacks and 16 16 17 17 17 17 for 6 stage cascaded stacks figure s1 further increasing the number of stack divisions was not necessary because stack leakage due to high pressure buildup in the manifold of the stack inlets and decreased red performance were observed from the 7 stage cascaded stack all experiments were performed in a co current mode artificial seawater conductivity 50 ms cm and river water conductivity 1 8 ms cm were used to drive salinity gradient power 0 5 m nacl daejeng korea solution was prepared as an hc solution and 0 017m nacl solution was prepared as an lc solution both hc and lc solutions were fed into the red stack by peristaltic pumps thermo scientific usa with different flow rates red performance was evaluated at different linear flow velocities of 0 25 0 50 0 75 1 00 and 1 50 cm s in different stacks having different flow schemes this corresponds to flow rates ranging from 210 to 1 260 ml min for the conventional stack 105 to 840 ml min for the 2 stage cascaded stack 70 to 420 ml min for the 3 stage cascaded stack 52 5 to 315 ml min for the 4 stage cascaded stack 42 to 252 ml min for the 5 stage cascaded stack and 35 to 210 ml min for the 6 stage cascaded stack figure s2 as can be seen the volume of feed waters was significantly reduced as the number of stack divisions increased up to 6 stages for the conventional stack stable operation at 1 5 cm s was impossible as it was difficult to supply feed solutions for a certain time due to huge pressure drops at the inlet manifold of the stack the electrode rinse solution recirculating between the anode and cathode chambers was a mixture of 100 mm k3fe cn 6 k4fe cn 6 combined with 0 1 m nacl 2 3 calculations and measurements the electrochemical performance of the red stack was measured with a potentiostat sp 150 biologic the netherlands the stacks were operated in open circuit voltage ocv conditions at each

discussion 3 1 comparison of conventional and cascaded stacks at different linear velocities 3 1 1 red power generation performance the performance of red stacks with different internal flow schemes was evaluated at different linear velocities or volumetric flow rates although cascaded red stacks require less feed water volumes hc and lc solutions compared to conventional stacks in which solutions are not recirculated in the stack fig 1 power densities at different current ranges were maintained throughout the red stacks fig 2 conventional stacks with a parallel flow mode show increased power and current generation from 0 51 w m2 at 18 37 a m2 to 0 76 w m2 at 24 53 a m2 for linear flow velocities up to 0 75 cm s and then exhibit no further enhancement of the maximum power density over 1 cm s 0 77 w m2 at 24 47 a m2 fig 2a this is in agreement with the previous results showing increasing flow rates or linear velocities positively influence the electrical potential of the red stacks as a consequence of reduced concentration polarization in the diffusion boundary layer adjacent to the membrane surface kim et al 2021 pawlowski et al 2014b at lower velocities all cascaded stacks showed slightly lower peak power density ranges fig 2b f the peak power densities of the cascaded stacks at 0 25 cm s ranged from 0 36 w m2 the lowest at the 6 stage cascaded stack to 0 50 w m2 the highest at the 4 stage cascaded stack at 0 5 cm s the peak power densities were maintained at 0 60 w m2 for the 2 3 and 4 stage stacks but decreased to 0 57 w m2 for the 5 stage stack and to 0 53 w m2 for the 6 stage stack at 0 75 cm s the peak power densities gradually decreased from 0 73 w m2 2 stage to 0 63 w m2 6 stage with the increased number of stages in the stack on the other hand from a linear velocity of 1 cm s the peak power densities of the cascaded stacks were comparable to that of the conventional stack 0 77 w m2 the power densities ranged from 0 74 w m2 to 0 78 w m2 at 1 cm s and 0 79 w m2 to 0 84 w m2 at 1 5 cm s the trends were also similar to the results of ocvs as shown in table 1 the ocvs of the cascaded stacks became similar to those obtained with the conventional stack at higher linear velocities although the required feed water volume was significantly reduced the power densities at relatively low linear velocities decreased as the number of stages increased and this is due to reduced salinity gradients at later stages as a certain amount of the feed waters is reused in several stages zhu et al 2015a the reduced salinity ratio of the effluents can be seen in fig 3 at 0 25 cm s the effluent conductivities of hc and lc are changed from 50 ms cm to 43 4 0 1 ms cm and from 1 8 ms cm to 3 7 0 1 ms cm salinity ratio of 11 8 respectively on the other hand in the case of the 6 stage cascaded stack in which fresh feed waters are reused 6 times in a unit stack the effluent conductivities of hc and lc changed to 36 4 0 1 ms cm for hc to 9 7 0 05 ms cm for lc salinity ratio of 3 8 resulting in a reduced salinity ratio at low linear velocities fig 3a therefore the ocvs of the 6 stage cascaded stack was the lowest at the lowest linear velocity 0 25 cm s increasing linear velocity prevented a reduction in the salinity ratio of the effluents by providing a shorter time for ions to move through the iems resulting in maintaining power output at the level of the conventional stack at 1 0 cm s a comparable power output was obtained in the cascaded stacks to that in the conventional stack the conductivities of effluents from the conventional stack at this condition were 44 0 0 1 ms cm for hc and 2 4 0 01 ms cm for lc but as the stack is divided up to 6 stages the conductivity of the effluents ranged from 44 1 0 05 ms cm 2 stages to 41 3 0 18 ms cm 6 stages for hc and from 3 0 0 03 ms cm 2 stages to 4 98 0 02 ms cm for lc 6 stages fig 4d power output comparable to the conventional power could also be produced by preventing current leakage by dividing the stacks inside thereby making a longer pathway for the solution to flow there are ionic shortcut currents that arise from the transport of ions through the feed and drain channels acting as salt bridges between the compartments mei and tang 2018 tanaka 2017 veerman et al 2008 at higher linear velocities it can be seen that the current densities achievable in the cascaded stacks increase fig 2 3 1 2 net power and energy efficiency there is a trade off between power output and hydraulic pumping loss gross power with different stacks varied according to the linear velocities which is in accordance with the power density curves fig 4a hydraulic pumping losses are larger when the required feed water volume is higher to match the target flow rates of different stacks for the conventional stack hydraulic loss became very large at high flow rates fig 4b on the other hand hydraulic losses with the cascaded stacks were maintained at a lower level and multiple stages were advantageous to maintain a low pumping energy the pressure drops are tabulated in table s1 at the lowest linear velocity pressure drops for the conventional 2 stage and 3 stage cascaded stacks are similar for both hc and lc solutions 0 058 bar 0 065 bar however the hydraulic loss for the conventional stack 0 043 w is higher than those of the 2 stage 0 022 w and 3 stage 0 015 w cascaded stacks as more solutions need to be supplied to the stack to generate the same linear velocity figure s2 although the low pressure drops were maintained in up to 3 stage stacks the pressure drops were increased from 0 076 bar for hc and 0 063 bar for lc at 4 stages to 0 196 bar for hc and 0 199 bar for lc at 6 stages table s1 resulting in hydraulic losses that increased from 0 012 w to 0 023 w at 0 25 cm s fig 4b additionally pressure drops for the conventional stack from 0 043 w at 0 25 cm s to 1 93 w at 1 0 cm s became more severe at all higher linear velocities than those of the cascaded stacks fig 4b multiple stages in a red unit stack also had high pressure drops higher feed water resistances were developed due to increased residence time of feed solutions in multiple stage stacks despite the fact that less volume was required for the feed waters veerman et al 2008 however despite the higher pressure drops hydraulic losses for the higher stages were lower than those of red with fewer stages and 9 58 of the pumping power needed for the conventional stack at different linear velocities up to 1cm s was required for the cascaded stacks fig 4b net power density was calculated using gross power considering hydraulic loss at different stacks fig 4c for the conventional stack the only positive net power density value 0 4 w m2 was obtained at 0 25 cm s at the other conditions net power densities were all negative for the conventional stack due to high hydraulic losses it is also known that when increasing linear flow velocity in red stacks having a parallel flow mode the power needed for pumping increases faster than the gross power density which eventually results in negative net power densities pawlowski et al 2014a vermaas et al 2011 with the 2 stage cascaded stack positive net power densities 0 38 w m2 at 0 25 cm s 0 41 w m2 at 0 5 cm s and 0 14 w m2 at 0 75 cm s were obtained up to a linear velocity of 0 75 cm s the 3 to 6 stage cascaded stacks all exhibited positive net power densities except at 1 5 cm s the highest net power density 0 48 w m2 at a net power of 190 mw was obtained in the 4 stage cascaded stack at 0 5 cm s in addition to high net power the cascaded stack also has another important feature a high power density at relatively low linear velocity yields a high energy efficiency the energy efficiency is the energy extracted in the experiments compared to the theoretical amount of energy eq 4 released during mixing of the same amount of water previous work demonstrated that the energy efficiency was maximized at relatively low flow rates and low current densities despite the increase in gross power seen with increasing flow rates kim et al 2021 vermaas et al 2011 fig 5 reveals that the maximum energy efficiencies for each stack were reached at low linear velocities although the efficiency decreased for higher linear velocities on the other hand as the stacks were divided into an increasing number of stages higher efficiencies were obtained the energy efficiencies for the 6 stage cascaded stack were the highest for varying linear velocities fig 5 and the maximum efficiency 17 2 was obtained at 0 25 cm s this is 4 2 times higher than the maximum value obtained in the conventional stack 4 1 at 0 25 cm s however there is a tradeoff between power density and energy efficiency the 4 stage cascaded stack with the highest net power density 0 48 w m2 at 0 5 cm s among the different stacks exhibited only a 9 6 efficiency which is much lower than its maximum energy efficiency 15 9 at 0 25 cm s the maximum net power density achieved with the cascade stacks was comparable to those reported previously table 2 with thinner spacers 155 and 200 µm the net power density of the cascaded stacks was lower than previous results but it was higher than that obtained with thicker spacers 500 µm simões et al 2020 veerman et al 2010 zhu et al 2015b there have been several studies that focused on improving energy efficiency by modifying red operational methods veerman 2020 vermaas et al 2013 multiple electrode segments and counter flow feed water modes can produce a high energy efficiency up to 95 assuming ideal membranes vermaas et al 2013 asymmetric feed water flow rates can also increase energy efficiency using 50 of the lc flow rate for hc increased the energy efficiency so that it was five times higher than that obtained with the same flow rates for both hc and lc zhu et al 2015b externally multi staged reds are a viable option to increase energy efficiency doornbusch et al 2020 hu et al 2019 tedesco et al 2015 tristán et al 2020 veerman 2020 the effluent used from the first stack can be reused in the following stack however in this externally multi staged red arrangement the power output of the following stack gradually decreases due to decreasing salinity gradients this effect was prevented in our study by using an internally cascaded red stack hu et al 2019 therefore we could expect that a serial arrangement of the cascaded red stacks suggested in this study would greatly increase energy efficiency by recycling the feed solutions both internally and externally 3 1 3 specific energy the net specific energy continuously increased with the increasing stages in the stack fig 6 as expected the conventional stack only exhibited positive net specific energy 0 012 kwh m3 at 0 25 cm s and negative values at all the other linear velocities the 2 stage cascaded stack showed positive values up to 0 5 cm s for the 3 stage cascaded stack the net specific energies showed all positive values at all conditions except for the highest linear velocity 1 5 cm s the highest net specific energy 0 058 kwh m3 was obtained with the 4 stage cascaded stack at 0 25 cm s which corresponded to an energy efficiency of 16 this value was almost identical to that of a previous study that used a 100 µm thick spacer with the same number of cell pairs and faster flow rates 100 ml min compared to this study 52 5 ml min kim et al 2021 it is generally known that thinner spacers i e smaller intermembrane distances produce more power but this is not preferable for long term operation with natural feed water for maintenance as spacers are commonly clogged by organic and inorganic foulants in feed water luque di salvo et al 2018 nam et al 2019 hence using thicker spacers would be a better choice for practical application of red as it could produce a high net specific energy and energy efficiency by optimizing stack designs and operation parameters the obtained maximum value was also comparable with the results reported with a 280 µm thick spacer and saline water with much higher conductivities 150 220 ms cm tedesco et al 2016 the specific energy ranged from 0 03 to 0 06 kwh m3 and in spite of their high salinity energy production was limited due to the high multivalent ion content in real solutions 3 2 comparison of conventional and cascaded stacks at the same flow rate 105 ml min the conventional stack was additionally tested at a flow rate of 105 ml min where the 4 stage cascaded stack showed the highest net power density at the same flow rate the gross power density of the 4 stage cascaded stack 0 60 w m2 was higher than that of the conventional stack 0 40 w m2 fig 7a at the same flow rate the linear velocity is much higher in the cascaded stack 0 5 cm s than in the conventional stack 0 13 cm s which is a merit for the cascaded stack to reduce concentration polarization kim et al 2021 the 4 stage cascaded stack had higher hydraulic losses 23 w than the conventional stack 3 w but still produced higher net power density energy efficiency and net specific energy 0 48 w m2 9 6 and 0 03 kwh m3 than the conventional stack 0 38 w m2 6 3 and 0 02 kwh m3 because they had the same initial concentration of the feed solutions and flow rates both configurations achieved the same exergyin 2 46 w fig 7b shows how the input energy to the stack is used for the different red stacks with the cascaded stack the gross power 9 6 of the input energy increases and the unused energy leaving from the stack decreases 56 9 of the input energy the dissipated exergy 33 5 in the cascaded stack was higher than in the conventional stack 27 0 a possible reason for the higher dissipated exergy is due to reduced salinity gradients at later stages in the cascaded stack the conductivities of the hc and lc solutions at outlets of the cascaded stack were 40 5 0 1 cm s and 5 9 0 1 cm s whereas the conductivities of the hc and lc solutions at outlets of the cascaded stack were 42 1 0 2 cm s and 4 8 0 1 cm s respectively the great benefit of applying several hydraulic stages in a single red stack was revealed as better performance than the conventional stack having a parallel flow mode in particular higher energy efficiency and net specific energy with the cascaded stacks are beneficial for up scaling red because the cost of feed water pretreatment to decrease pressure drops and fouling is a relevant fraction of the operating costs simões et al 2020 further research should be conducted to reduce hydraulic losses in cascaded stacks as their pressure drops are much higher at the same flow rates than the conventional stack and increase the energy efficiency without sacrificing net power density in addition a numerical model should be developed for new types of red stacks with multiple hydraulic stages 4 conclusions a new type of red stack was suggested to enhance net power density energy efficiency and net specific energy typical operation modes including both parallel and series flow modes cannot achieve high net energy production due to the requirement for high pumping energy a combination of a parallel and series flow modes in a unit stack equipped with 270 µm thick spacers greatly increased energy production among tested stacks the 4 stage cascaded stack showed the highest net specific energy 0 06 kwh m3 and net power density 0 48 w m2 corresponding to a 0 60 w m2 gross power density in the 4 stage cascaded stack only 25 of the feed waters are used to achieve the maximum power compared to the conventional stack at the same linear velocity the energy efficiency increases in stacks with more stages in a unit stack and at lower linear velocities and the highest efficiency value was 17 2 these results will provide benefits for red plants in real fields as plants can be compacted by reducing the volume of feed water pretreatment processes and the number of red

16933,despite significant advances in the field applications of reserve electrodialysis red to produce salinity gradient power net energy production remains an issue owing to limitations such as high energy requirement for high flow rates of feed solutions and severe fouling and pressure build up when thin spacers are used therefore to maximize the performance and efficiency of energy harvesting in the red a cascaded red stack with multiple stages between the anode and cathode electrodes was investigated in cascaded stacks 100 cell paired stacks were divided into several stages so the feed water flowed into the first stage and the effluent from the first stage was then reused in the next stages this cascaded stack could overcome the typical drawbacks of red large amount of feed water required intensive pumping energy and low net energy production although 25 of the feed water volume was used in the 4 stage cascaded stack 100 cell pairs compared to the conventional stack 100 cell pairs with a parallel flow operation much more energy was produced with the 4 stage cascaded stack the net power density and net specific energy with the 4 stage cascaded stack were the highest at 0 5 cm s 0 48 w m2 and 0 25 cm s 0 06 kwh m3 respectively this is very promising for the practical application of red since feed water volumes can be greatly reduced which could reduce the burden on the feed water pretreatment step consequently we can build a compact red plant with smaller pretreatment processes and fewer red unit stacks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cascaded red stacks linear velocity net power density net specific energy pressure drop reverse electrodialysis 1 introduction sustainable energy generated from salt solutions of different concentrations is termed salinity gradient energy sge reverse electrodialysis red an electrochemical technology that uses ion exchange membranes iems gaskets spacers and electrodes logan and elimelech 2012 tedesco et al 2017 tufa et al 2020 is among the most investigated types of sge technologies in the process two different solutions high concentration solution hc and low concentration solution lc with different salinities are passed through a stack of alternating cation exchange membranes cems and anion exchange membranes aems the hc and lc compartments are created between the aem and the cem spacers between the membranes can also act against concentration polarization which increases ohmic resistance and pressure drop and creates channels for the passage of the solutions one cell pair is comprised of one aem one cem one hc compartment and one lc compartment multi cell pairs are then stacked between an anode and a cathode holes in spacers gaskets and membranes act as manifolds for distributing collecting the two solutions to from the compartments in separate hydraulic circuits nam et al 2019 ortiz imedio et al 2019 red has made noteworthy advances in fundamental studies experimental investigations and field demonstrations recent research advances have stepped up from lab scale units to pilot plants the first red pilot plant 125 cell pair red stack intermembrane distance 280 µm was installed in the netherlands to generate 50 kw of gross power using brines and brackish water resulting in a high salinity ratio tedesco et al 2016 a previous study reported that in the largest unit stack 1000 cell pair red stack intermembrane distance 100 µm seawater and wastewater effluent discharged from a local wastewater treatment plant were used as the hc and lc solutions with a lower salinity ratio than the first pilot scale test nam et al 2019 in these pilot tests a large number of pairs of cems and aems were stacked together to increase the total potential although those pilot scale tests were meaningful pressure buildup occurred specifically at the manifold of the wastewater effluent chamber and further research is required to increase net power yield and efficiency net power is a key performance index used to evaluate the performance of the red stacks and the net specific energy and net energy efficiencies are also important parameters that we need to consider to evaluate red performance kim et al 2021 pawlowski et al 2014a zhu et al 2015b in order to obtain high energy production an improvement in gross power should be obtained and this is normally achieved at higher flow rates because high flow rates are attributed to a decrease in diffusion boundary layer resistance resulting in high gross power ciofalo et al 2019 zhu et al 2015b however using high feed solution flow rates additionally impacts net energy production because the energy required to pump the feed solutions through the red stack increases for high flow rates kim et al 2021 zhu et al 2015b in particular most studies use a parallel flow mode to supply feed solutions to the red stack which requires a high pumping energy for the large amount of required feed solutions and high pressure drops that occur at high flow rates gurreri et al 2012 zhu et al 2015b reducing the flow rates allows lower pressure drops and reduces the feed solution requirements but it also decreases gross power generation a series flow mode could be an option to reduce the volumes of feed solutions but it has only been used in red with 5 10 cell pairs song et al 2021 zhu et al 2013 in this case feed solutions are directed to the first compartment of the stack and this compartment is alternately connected to the outlets and inlets of the next compartments in the stack the residence time of the feed solution in the serial mode could be increased but this also causes a much higher fluid resistance as practical red stacks are normally composed of 500 1000 cell pairs with 500 1000 hc and lc compartments nam et al 2019 tedesco et al 2017 tedesco et al 2016 veerman et al 2008 it was found that increasing the distance between the aem and cem using thicker spacers can reduce pressure drops in particular when using natural feed water 200 and 280 µm thick spacers are normally preferred although thinner spacers such as 100 µm thick spacers can improve fluid distribution in the compartments resulting in high gross power mehdizadeh et al 2019 tedesco et al 2016 however severe clogging and pressure build up are inevitable when using these thinner spacers and consequently this results in cleaning requirements for long term operation with natural feed waters jwa et al 2020 nam et al 2019 therefore attempts should be made to maximize the performance and efficiency of energy harvesting in the red with thick spacers by avoiding the high pumping powers and pressure drops in this study we investigated a new type of red stack in which feed solutions are internally cascaded in a red stack having multiple hydraulic stages electrodialysis stacks for desalination often have two hydraulic stages to enhance desalting efficiency but utilizing multiple hydraulic stages in a single stack has not been tested in red stacks bisselink et al 2016 chen et al 2020 xu et al 2018 therefore in this study the performance of the cascaded stacks 100 cell pairs was compared with that of a conventional red stack 100 cell pairs using the parallel flow mode 2 material and methods 2 1 red set up and operation the 100 cell pair red stack was constructed between two end plates that were manufactured using polycarbonate the shielding membrane was cems which are close to each electrode and a unit cell consists of one cem fujifilm type i netherlands and one aem fujifilm type i netherlands a hc compartment and a lc compartment including spacers in the compartments a woven type spacer thickness 270 µm ds mesh korea was used for the flow path of the feed solutions the ptfe gasket thickness of approximately 300 µm tommy hecco korea was used to prevent contact between the cem and aem and to seal the leaks between the feed solutions the active area of iem is 19 63 cm2 the electrodes were composed of pt ti mesh coating thickness 3 µm wesco electrode korea schematic drawings of the conventional and cascaded stacks are shown in fig 1 in a conventional stack equipped with 100 cell pairs 100 aems and 101 cems feed waters hc and lc solutions were equally distributed to each chamber formed between an aem and a cem at the same time which is a normal red operation method known as a parallel flow mode fig 1a as can be seen in figure s1 in cascaded stacks 100 cell pair stacks were divided into several stages so the feed water flowed into the first stage and the effluent from the first stage was then reused in the next stages fig 1b therefore this is a combination of series and parallel flow modes for a 2 stage cascaded stack the 100 cell pairs were divided into two groups with a ratio of 50 cell pairs 50 cell pairs we tested up to 6 stage cascaded stacks and the 100 cell pair stacks were divided with a ratio of 33 34 34 for 3 stage cascaded stacks 25 25 25 25 for 4 stage cascaded stacks 20 20 20 20 20 for 5 stage cascaded stacks and 16 16 17 17 17 17 for 6 stage cascaded stacks figure s1 further increasing the number of stack divisions was not necessary because stack leakage due to high pressure buildup in the manifold of the stack inlets and decreased red performance were observed from the 7 stage cascaded stack all experiments were performed in a co current mode artificial seawater conductivity 50 ms cm and river water conductivity 1 8 ms cm were used to drive salinity gradient power 0 5 m nacl daejeng korea solution was prepared as an hc

performance was evaluated at different linear flow velocities of 0 25 0 50 0 75 1 00 and 1 50 cm s in different stacks having different flow schemes this corresponds to flow rates ranging from 210 to 1 260 ml min for the conventional stack 105 to 840 ml min for the 2 stage cascaded stack 70 to 420 ml min for the 3 stage cascaded stack 52 5 to 315 ml min for the 4 stage cascaded stack 42 to 252 ml min for the 5 stage cascaded stack and 35 to 210 ml min for the 6 stage cascaded stack figure s2 as can be seen the volume of feed waters was significantly reduced as the number of stack divisions increased up to 6 stages for the conventional stack stable operation at 1 5 cm s was impossible as it was difficult to supply feed solutions for a certain time due to huge pressure drops at the inlet manifold of the stack the electrode rinse solution recirculating between the anode and cathode chambers was a mixture of 100 mm k3fe cn 6 k4fe cn 6 combined with 0 1 m nacl 2 3 calculations and

discussion 3 1 comparison of conventional and cascaded stacks at different linear velocities 3 1 1 red power generation performance the performance of red stacks with different internal flow schemes was evaluated at different linear velocities or volumetric flow rates although cascaded red stacks require less feed water volumes hc and lc solutions compared to conventional stacks in which solutions are not recirculated in the stack fig 1 power densities at different current ranges were maintained throughout the red stacks fig 2 conventional stacks with a parallel flow mode show increased power and current generation from 0 51 w m2 at 18 37 a m2 to 0 76 w m2 at 24 53 a m2 for linear flow velocities up to 0 75 cm s and then exhibit no further enhancement of the maximum power density over 1 cm s 0 77 w m2 at 24 47 a m2 fig 2a this is in agreement with the previous results showing increasing flow rates or linear velocities positively influence the electrical potential of the red stacks as a consequence of reduced concentration polarization in the diffusion boundary layer adjacent to the membrane surface kim et al 2021 pawlowski et al 2014b at lower velocities all cascaded stacks showed slightly lower peak power density ranges fig 2b f the peak power densities of the cascaded stacks at 0 25 cm s ranged from 0 36 w m2 the lowest at the 6 stage cascaded stack to 0 50 w m2 the highest at the 4 stage cascaded stack at 0 5 cm s the peak power densities were maintained at 0 60 w m2 for the 2 3 and 4 stage stacks but decreased to 0 57 w m2 for the 5 stage stack and to 0 53 w m2 for the 6 stage stack at 0 75 cm s the peak power densities gradually decreased from 0 73 w m2 2 stage to 0 63 w m2 6 stage with the increased number of stages in the stack on the other hand from a linear velocity of 1 cm s the peak power densities of the cascaded stacks were comparable to that of the conventional stack 0 77 w m2 the power densities ranged from 0 74 w m2 to 0 78 w m2 at 1 cm s and 0 79 w m2 to 0 84 w m2 at 1 5 cm s the trends were also similar to the results of ocvs as shown in table 1 the ocvs of the cascaded stacks became similar to those obtained with the conventional stack at higher linear velocities although the required feed water volume was significantly reduced the power densities at relatively low linear velocities decreased as the number of stages increased and this is due to reduced salinity gradients at later stages as a certain amount of the feed waters is reused in several stages zhu et al 2015a the reduced salinity ratio of the effluents can be seen in fig 3 at 0 25 cm s the effluent conductivities of hc and lc are changed from 50 ms cm to 43 4 0 1 ms cm and from 1 8 ms cm to 3 7 0 1 ms cm salinity ratio of 11 8 respectively on the other hand in the case of the 6 stage cascaded stack in which fresh feed waters are reused 6 times in a unit stack the effluent conductivities of hc and lc changed to 36 4 0 1 ms cm for hc to 9 7 0 05 ms cm for lc salinity ratio of 3 8 resulting in a reduced salinity ratio at low linear velocities fig 3a therefore the ocvs of the 6 stage cascaded stack was the lowest at the lowest linear velocity 0 25 cm s increasing linear velocity prevented a reduction in the salinity ratio of the effluents by providing a shorter time for ions to move through the iems resulting in maintaining power output at the level of the conventional stack at 1 0 cm s a comparable power output was obtained in the cascaded stacks to that in the conventional stack the conductivities of effluents from the conventional stack at this condition were 44 0 0 1 ms cm for hc and 2 4 0 01 ms cm for lc but as the stack is divided up to 6 stages the conductivity of the effluents ranged from 44 1 0 05 ms cm 2 stages to 41 3 0 18 ms cm 6 stages for hc and from 3 0 0 03 ms cm 2 stages to 4 98 0 02 ms cm for lc 6 stages fig 4d power output comparable to the conventional power could also be produced by preventing current leakage by dividing the stacks inside thereby making a longer pathway for the solution to flow there are ionic shortcut currents that arise from the transport of ions through the feed and drain channels acting as salt bridges between the compartments mei and tang 2018 tanaka 2017 veerman et al 2008 at higher linear velocities it can be seen that the current densities achievable in the cascaded stacks increase fig 2 3 1 2 net power and energy efficiency there is a trade off between power output and hydraulic pumping loss gross power with different stacks varied according to the linear velocities which is in accordance with the power density curves fig 4a hydraulic pumping losses are larger when the required feed water volume is higher to match the target flow rates of different stacks for the conventional stack hydraulic loss became very large at high flow rates fig 4b on the other hand hydraulic losses with the cascaded stacks were maintained at a lower level and multiple stages were advantageous to maintain a low pumping energy the pressure drops are tabulated in table s1 at the lowest linear velocity pressure drops for the conventional 2 stage and 3 stage cascaded stacks are similar for both hc and lc solutions 0 058 bar 0 065 bar however the hydraulic loss for the conventional stack 0 043 w is higher than those of the 2 stage 0 022 w and 3 stage 0 015 w cascaded stacks as more solutions need to be supplied to the stack to generate the same linear velocity figure s2 although the low pressure drops were maintained in up to 3 stage stacks the pressure drops were increased from 0 076 bar for hc and 0 063 bar for lc at 4 stages to 0 196 bar for hc and 0 199 bar for lc at 6 stages table s1 resulting in hydraulic losses that increased from 0 012 w to 0 023 w at 0 25 cm s fig 4b additionally pressure drops for the conventional stack from 0 043 w at 0 25 cm s to 1 93 w at 1 0 cm s became more severe at all higher linear velocities than those of the cascaded stacks fig 4b multiple stages in a red unit stack also had high pressure drops higher feed water resistances were developed due to increased residence time of feed solutions in multiple stage stacks despite the fact that less volume was required for the feed waters veerman et al 2008 however despite the higher pressure drops hydraulic losses for the higher stages were lower than those of red with fewer stages and 9 58 of the pumping power needed for the conventional stack at different linear velocities up to 1cm s was required for the cascaded stacks fig 4b net power density was calculated using gross power considering hydraulic loss at different stacks fig 4c for the conventional stack the only positive net power density value 0 4 w m2 was obtained at 0 25 cm s at the other conditions net power densities were all negative for the conventional stack due to high hydraulic losses it is also known that when increasing linear flow velocity in red stacks having a parallel flow mode the power needed for pumping increases faster than the gross power density which eventually results in negative net power densities pawlowski et al 2014a vermaas et al 2011 with the 2 stage cascaded stack positive net power densities 0 38 w m2 at 0 25 cm s 0 41 w m2 at 0 5 cm s and 0 14 w m2 at 0 75 cm s were obtained up to a linear velocity of 0 75 cm s the 3 to 6 stage cascaded stacks all exhibited positive net power densities except at 1 5 cm s the highest net power density 0 48 w m2 at a net power of 190 mw was obtained in the 4 stage cascaded stack at 0 5 cm s in addition to high net power the cascaded stack also has another important feature a high power density at relatively low linear velocity yields a high energy efficiency the energy efficiency is the energy extracted in the experiments compared to the theoretical amount of energy eq 4 released during mixing of the same amount of water previous work demonstrated that the energy efficiency was maximized at relatively low flow rates and low current densities despite the increase in gross power seen with increasing flow rates kim et al 2021 vermaas et al 2011 fig 5 reveals that the maximum energy efficiencies for each stack were reached at low linear velocities although the efficiency decreased for higher linear velocities on the other hand as the stacks were divided into an increasing number of stages higher efficiencies were obtained the energy efficiencies for the 6 stage cascaded stack were the highest for varying linear velocities fig 5 and the maximum efficiency 17 2 was obtained at 0 25 cm s this is 4 2 times higher than the maximum value obtained in the conventional stack 4 1 at 0 25 cm s however there is a tradeoff between power density and energy efficiency the 4 stage cascaded stack with the highest net power density 0 48 w m2 at 0 5 cm s among the different stacks exhibited only a 9 6 efficiency which is much lower than its maximum energy efficiency 15 9 at 0 25 cm s the maximum net power density achieved with the cascade stacks was comparable to those reported previously table 2 with thinner spacers 155 and 200 µm the net power density of the cascaded stacks was lower than previous results but it was higher than that obtained with thicker spacers 500 µm simões et al 2020 veerman et al 2010 zhu et al 2015b there have been several studies that focused on improving energy efficiency by modifying red operational methods veerman 2020 vermaas et al 2013 multiple electrode segments and counter flow feed water modes can produce a high energy efficiency up to 95 assuming ideal membranes vermaas et al 2013 asymmetric feed water flow rates can also increase energy efficiency using 50 of the lc flow rate for hc increased the energy efficiency so that it was five times higher than that obtained with the same flow rates for both hc and lc zhu et al 2015b externally multi staged reds are a viable option to increase energy efficiency doornbusch et al 2020 hu et al 2019 tedesco et al 2015 tristán et al 2020 veerman 2020 the effluent used from the first stack can be reused in the following stack however in this externally multi staged red arrangement the power output of the following stack gradually decreases due to decreasing salinity gradients this effect was prevented in our study by using an internally cascaded red stack hu et al 2019 therefore we could expect that a serial arrangement of the cascaded red stacks suggested in this study would greatly increase energy efficiency by recycling the feed solutions both internally and externally 3 1 3 specific energy the net specific energy continuously increased with the increasing stages in the stack fig 6 as expected the conventional stack only exhibited positive net specific energy 0 012 kwh m3 at 0 25 cm s and negative values at all the other linear velocities the 2 stage cascaded stack showed positive values up to 0 5 cm s for the 3 stage cascaded stack the net specific energies showed all positive values at all conditions except for the highest linear velocity 1 5 cm s the highest net specific energy 0 058 kwh m3 was obtained with the 4 stage cascaded stack at 0 25 cm s which corresponded to an energy efficiency of 16 this value was almost identical to that of a previous study that used a 100 µm thick spacer with the same number of cell pairs and faster flow rates 100 ml min compared to this study 52 5 ml min kim et al 2021 it is generally known that thinner spacers i e smaller intermembrane distances produce more power but this is not preferable for long term operation with natural feed water for maintenance as spacers are commonly clogged by organic and inorganic foulants in feed water luque di salvo et al 2018 nam et al 2019 hence using thicker spacers would be a better choice for practical application of red as it could produce a high net specific energy and energy efficiency by optimizing stack designs and operation parameters the obtained maximum value was also comparable with the results reported with a 280 µm thick spacer and saline water with much higher conductivities 150 220 ms cm tedesco et al 2016 the specific energy ranged from 0 03 to 0 06 kwh m3 and in spite of their high salinity energy production was limited due to the high multivalent ion content in real solutions 3 2 comparison of conventional and cascaded stacks at the same flow rate 105 ml min the conventional stack was additionally tested at a flow rate of 105 ml min where the 4 stage cascaded stack showed the highest net power density at the same flow rate the gross power density of the 4 stage cascaded stack 0 60 w m2 was higher than that of the conventional stack 0 40 w m2 fig 7a at the same flow rate the linear velocity is much higher in the cascaded stack 0 5 cm s than in the conventional stack 0 13 cm s which is a merit for the cascaded stack to reduce concentration polarization kim et al 2021 the 4 stage cascaded stack had higher hydraulic losses 23 w than the conventional stack 3 w but still produced higher net power density energy efficiency and net specific energy 0 48 w m2 9 6 and 0 03 kwh m3 than the conventional stack 0 38 w m2 6 3 and 0 02 kwh m3 because they had the same initial concentration of the feed solutions and flow rates both configurations achieved the same exergyin 2 46 w fig 7b shows how the input energy to the stack is used for the different red stacks with the cascaded stack the gross power 9 6 of the input energy increases and the unused energy leaving from the stack decreases 56 9 of the input energy the dissipated exergy 33 5 in the cascaded stack was higher than in the conventional stack 27 0 a possible reason for the higher dissipated exergy is due to reduced salinity gradients at later stages in the cascaded stack the conductivities of the hc and lc solutions at outlets of the cascaded stack were 40 5 0 1 cm s and 5 9 0 1 cm s whereas the conductivities of the hc and lc solutions at outlets of the cascaded stack were 42 1 0 2 cm s and 4 8 0 1 cm s respectively the great benefit of applying several hydraulic stages in a single red stack was revealed as better performance than the conventional stack having a parallel flow mode in particular higher energy efficiency and net specific energy with the cascaded stacks are beneficial for up scaling red because the cost of feed water pretreatment to decrease pressure drops and fouling is a relevant fraction of the operating costs simões et al 2020 further research should be conducted to reduce hydraulic losses in cascaded stacks as their pressure drops are much higher at the same flow rates than the conventional stack and increase the energy efficiency without sacrificing net power density in addition a numerical model should be developed for new types of red stacks with multiple hydraulic stages 4 conclusions a new type of red stack was suggested to enhance net power density energy efficiency and net specific energy typical operation modes including both parallel and series flow modes cannot achieve high net energy production due to the requirement for high pumping energy a combination of a parallel and series flow modes in a unit stack equipped with 270 µm thick spacers greatly increased energy production among tested stacks the 4 stage cascaded stack showed the highest net specific energy 0 06 kwh m3 and net power density 0 48 w m2 corresponding to a 0 60 w m2 gross power density in the 4 stage cascaded stack only 25 of the feed waters are used to achieve the maximum power compared to the conventional stack at the same linear velocity the energy efficiency increases in stacks with more stages in a unit stack and at lower linear velocities and the highest efficiency value was 17 2 these results will provide benefits for red plants in real fields as plants can be compacted by reducing the volume of feed water pretreatment processes and the number of red stacks needed to achieve a plant s target power output declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

16934,uv nh2cl process is becoming increasingly important for water treatment while its impact on iodine containing water remains unknown in this study the structure transformation of dissolved organic matters doms generation of iodinated trihalomethanes i thms and variation of acute toxicity were evaulated during the uv nh2cl treatment of iodine containing water the combination of exciation emission matrix parallel factor analysis and two dimensional correlation spectroscopy integrated with synchronous fluorescence and infrared absorption spectroscopy showed that fulvic like fraction of dom was more susceptible to uv nh2cl process and particularly iodo and polysaccharide groups gave the fastest resopnses consequently uv fluence lower than 60 mj cm2 promoted the production of i thms while excessive uv exhausted nh2cl and reactive iodine species and subsequently reduced i thm generation moreover dom concentration and source nh2cl dosage and i concentration had significant impacts on i thm formation in the uv nh2cl process additionally a positive correlation was found between acute toxicity variation and i thm formation when treating iodine containing waters with uv nh2cl these results together provide a comprehensive understanding on uv nh2cl treatment of iodine containing water graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords iodinated trihalomethanes i thms uv nh2cl dom toxicity 1 introduction arid conditions climate change and rapid population growth exacterbate global water deficit an increasing number of utilities have incorporated the potable reuse of municipal wastewater highly purified wastewater is increasingly recognized as a reliable drinking water supply chuang et al 2017 council 2012 gerrity et al 2013 full advanced treatment trains including microfiltration mf reverse osmosis ro and ultraviolet based advanced oxidation processes uv aops such as uv h2o2 and uv free chlorine are frequently employed in portable reuse facilities gerrity et al 2013 monochloramine nh2cl which is usually deliberately applied upstream due to its small molecular size can permeate ro membranes and subsequently result in the uv nh2cl process on the other hand the coexposure of uv and nh2cl can also occur when uv free chlorine is applied in ammonia containing water patton et al 2017 in addition the uv nh2cl process also occurs when treating chlorinated swimming pool water with uv chen et al 2021 therefore the uv nh2cl process is widely applied in many practical water treatment scenarios recent studies have also demonstrated that uv nh2cl could be effective in degradation of emerging micropollutants in water patton et al 2017 sun et al 2019 wu et al 2019 the great efficacy of the uv nh2cl process has been proven in the abatement of pharmaceuticals and personal care products from water bu et al 2018 li et al 2020 chuang et al 2017 compared uv nh2cl process with the uv h2o2 one and found that they performed similarly when degrading dioxane benzoate and carbamazepine in a range of ph 5 5 8 3 it was also demonstrated that the uv nh2cl process was highly effective for the removal of antibiotics from water cai et al 2020 however it was recently observed that the disinfection byproducts dbps which adverse health outcomes have been proved in human epidemiologic studies freeman et al 2017 hrudey et al 2015 wright et al 2017 could be generated during the degradation of micropollutants with uv nh2cl treatment for instance bu et al 2018 found that uv nh2cl treatment could enhance formation of carbonaceous dbps but reduce the formation emerging nitrosamine dbps during degradation of carbamazepine a recent study reported that the uv nh2cl treatment of tetracycline tended to form emerging nitrosamine dbps cai et al 2020 in recent years iodinated dbps i dbps generated from disinfection of iodine containing water have raised great concern since they have been proven to be more cytotoxic genotoxic and developmentally toxic than their regulated brominated and chlorinated analogs plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2008 among the i dbps reported to date iodinated trihalomethanes i thms as the most recognized i dbps have attracted more attention krasner et al 2006 richardson et al 2008 although the uv is a physical treatment process without dbp formation bichsel and von gunten 1999 has demonstrated that chloramination of iodine containing water could produce significant amount of i dbps this is because the reaction of nh2cl oxidizing hoi to iodate io3 a desired nontoxic sink of iodine containing water is very solw and hoi can remain longer to react with dissolved organic matters doms in water and thus promoting the generation of i dbps during chloramination liu et al 2019 in addition although io3 is nontoxic to human previous studies have shown that io3 could undergo photolysis under uv irradiation and result in the formation of i thms during subsequent chloramination tang et al 2021 tian et al 2017 as a consequence there is a high possibility that toxic i thms could be produced in the treatment of iodine containing water with the uv nh2cl process and therefore we may need revisit the application of uv nh2cl treatment for different water treatment scenarios however to the best of our knowledge the formation process and mechanisms of i thms during uv nh2cl treatment of iodine containing water are still unknown for instance how was dom changed in the uv nh2cl process how could the different radical species be involved in the variation of dom as well as the formation of i thms clear clarifications of these questions may be very important for the applications of the uv nh2cl process in water treatment on the other hand due to the possibility of producing more toxic substances the risk assessment of water treated by the uv nh2cl process would be important toxicity test can help assess on whether the reclaimed water can be safely reused cai et al 2020 reported an increase in toxicity of the reacted solution after uv nh2cl treatment compared with uv photolysis alone in tetracycline containing water zhu et al 2020 found a first increasing and then decreasing trend of toxicity of reacted solution with the prolonged uv irradiation time during uv nh2cl treatment of pollutant n n diethyl 3 methylbenzamide so far there is limited information about the impact of uv nh2cl treatment on the toxicity of iodine containing water and hence an in depth study which can provide guidelines for uv nh2cl treatment on reclaimed water deserves more attentions this study aimed to elucidate the influence of uv nh2cl treatment on iodine containing water including structure transformation of dom formation of i thms and variation of acute toxicity the transition of dom was tracked by three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem coupled with parallel factor analysis parafac and two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos combined with infrared absorption spectra and synchronous fluorescence participation of radical species including oh reactive chlorine species rcs and reactive iodine species ris in the variation of dom as well as the formation of i thms was explored following the impacts of five parameters including uv fluence dom concentration nh2cl dosage i concentration and the presence of io3 were also investigated additionally four different dom sources including humic acid ha fulvic acid fa raw water rw from a water treatment plant and its filtration water fw after coagulation and filtration were used to study the influence of different water matrices on the uv nh2cl process finally chlorella pyrenoidosa freshwater alga an efficient inexpensive and rapid model to indicate ecological health guo et al 2020b wang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 was selected to quantitatively analyze and compare the potential risks of iodine containing water after uv nh2cl treatment as chlorella pyrenoidosa has been successfully applied to characterize toxicity of both pure dbps roberts et al 2010 and disinfected effluent luo et al 2020 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents five i thms including chcl2i 95 chbrcli 95 chbr2i 90 95 chcli2 95 and chbri2 90 95 were purchased from cansyn chem co canada chi3 99 fa and ha were obtained from sigma aldrich usa a sodium hypochlorite solution effective chlorine content is 6 14 sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china was used to prepare nh2cl solutions and nh2cl was freshly prepared and measured as previously described liu et al 2019 other chemicals

plant in hefei china and the characteristics of water samples can be found in table s1 of supproting information si ha fa rw and fw were filtered through 0 45 μm membranes anpel co ltd china first and then stored in dark at 4 c before use 2 2 uv nh2cl treatment of i containing water batch uv nh2cl experiments were performed under a collimated beam apparatus composed of a low pressure lp mercury lamp figure s1 showed the experimental setup the uv intensity was monitored with a zdz 1 uv radiometer purchased from tianwei co suzhou china and maintained at 1 mw cm2 throughout the whole experiments uv fluence ranging from 0 to 900 mj cm2 was acquired by changing uv irradiation time a quartz beaker with 20 ml dom containing solution and desired concentration of i was adopted solution ph was adjust to 7 5 with h2so4 or naoh initially and then buffered with 1 mm phosphate reaction was initiated by injecting a small volume of nh2cl into the solution and then the beaker was immediately put on the agitator under the mercury lamp to ensure homogeneous reaction the temperature change of reaction solution was monitored during uv irradiation as shown in fig s2 the solution temperature only increased from 19 3 0 1 c to 20 4 0 1 c after 15 min of uv irradiation with 1 mw cm2 the beaker was taken out and the solution was transferred in a 20 ml glass screw headspace free vial with teflon lined septa at preset irradiation time subsequently samples were stored at 20 2 c in the dark for 24 hours and were quenched immediately by sodium thiosulfate for residual disinfectant 2 3 characterization of dom variations with spectra the eem data of samples were collected by a fluorescence spectrophotometer aqualog horiba scientific usa eem spectra combined with parafac can identify independent fluorescent components and track their behaviors cory and mcknight 2005 the eem spectra of ha were divided into three independent components according to parafac which was conducted with matlab r2020b and domfluor toolbox following tutorial stedmon and bro 2008 a luminescence spectrometer f 4600 hirachi japan was applied to collect the synchronous fluorescence spectra of ha samples and each data was an average of three scans following the method introduced by noda and ozaki 2004 the synchronous fluorescence spectra was further analyzed with 2dcos 2d shige software kwansei gakuin university japan was used to transform synchronous fluorescence data into a spectral matrix fitting 2dcos maps ha samples treated with different uv fluence under uv nh2cl process were freeze dried and then mixed with a certain amount of potassium bromide to grind and press under an infrared lamp then the transmission infrared spectra of ha samples were measured by a nicolet 8700 spectrometer 2 4 toxicity assessment the acute toxicity of treated water samples were investigated by monitoring the inhibition of alga growth luo et al 2020 in which all experiments were conducted in triplicate briefly a certain amount of algal suspension and treated water samples were added into a transparent flask and then the solution was amended with bg 11 medium which provided nutrients for algae qiu et al 2019 an lluminating incubactor light intensity of 6000 lx was used to incubate the algal suspension and the incubation was conducted under a 14 10 light dark cycle at 23 c for 96 hours after incubation the algal suspension was withdrew and measured at 695 nm wavelength od695 then od695 was used to determine algal cell number the calculation of the inhibition of algal growth is described in text s2 2 5 analysis all of chemical analyses were conducted at least twice and the average data was presented detailed processing of i thms and chcl3 analysis is described in text s3 dissolved organic carbon doc was determined by a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan chloramine was measured according to the n n diethylp phenylenediamine dpd method apha 1998 the electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiments were conducted with a emx premium x spectrometer bruker germany using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolinr n oxide dmpo to trap the radical signals since both hoi and i2 react with phenol quickly bichsel and von gunten 2000 they were quenched with phenols and then analyzed as iodophenol p iodophenol and o iodophenol by a hplc system 1260 agilent usa equipped with an eclipse plus c18 column agilent usa the mobile phase was 0 1 acetic acid and methanol v v 35 65 retention time 5 7 min and 6 8 min for o iodophenol and p iodophenol respectively the uv detection wavelength was 231 nm according to an early study reported by ye et al 2012 i 3 and uv254 were determined using a spectrophotometer uv 1800bp mapada at absorbance wavelength of 351 and 254 nm respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of ha structure in uv nh2cl process 3 1 1 parafac components and their behaviors as presented in fig 1 three different fluorescent components c1 c2 and c3 of ha were identified according to residual analysis fig s3 a and split half validation fig s3 b component 1 c1 had excitation emission wavelengths ex em maxima at 250 490 nm c2 exhibited a peak at 250 420 nm ex em while c3 presented two peaks at 285 522 nm and 470 522 nm ex em according to previously reported eem peak locations table s2 c1 and c2 were assigned as humic like components while c3 was identified as a fulvic acid like component noticeably c1 and c3 presented their peaks at longer wavelengths em than c2 which could be associated with larger molecular weight dom lee et al 2015 and c3 showed relatively longer ex em wavelengths which might contain more structural condensed and polymerized dom jie et al 2003 therefore the three components can be sorted into c3 c1 c2 according to their molecular weight the fluorescence maximum fmax of each component has been applied to characterize the relative amount of parafac components in previous studies stedmon et al 2003 xia et al 2018 and table s3 shows the relative mean abundance of three components with different uv fluence during uv nh2cl treatment c1 46 0 46 8 and c2 35 1 32 3 were the domiant components in ha synthetic water solution and both of them were assigned as humic like components the ratios of fluorescent components were applied by previous studies to characterize the variations of dom lee and hur 2016 stedmon et al 2003 xia et al 2018 in this work we used three parafac ratios in fmax values c1 c2 c1 c3 and c2 c3 to further monitor correlations between ha variations and uv fluence during uv nh2cl process and the results are presented in fig 1 d the c1 c2 ratio kept decreasing as uv fluence increased while both c1 c3 and c2 c3 reduced slightly initially and then improved further suggesting that larger humic like component c1 was preferentially decomposited over smaller component c2 this correlated with a previous study xia et al 2018 and confirmed that uv nh2cl treatment contributed to the shift of higher molecular weight to lower ones aftab and hur 2017 increasing the production of dbps precursors which might promote i thm formation the increasing trend of c1 c3 and c2 c3 ratios with uv fluence exceeded 60 mj cm2 indicated the enhanced degree of decomposition of fulvic acid like component c3 at a higher uv fluence futher correlations between the changes of fluorescent components and i thm formation are elaborated in section 3 2 3 1 2 general spectroscopic observations and correlation analysis figure s4 displays the changes of synchronous fluorescence of ha samples with increasing uv fluence there are three fluorescence regions in the spectra according to a previous study hur et al 2011 they could be separated into humic like fulvic like and protein like sections corresponding to the wavelength ranging of 380 550 300 380 and 250 300 nm respectively as shown in fig s4 the ha mainly contained humic like and fulvic like fractions while almost no protein like fractions the intensity of the two fluorescence substance detected in the ha changed significantly during uv nh2cl treatment quenching of fractions might represent the degradation or transformation of ha fractions with the increase in the fluence of uv moreover the fourier transform infrared ftir spectra was applied to characterize the changes of functional groups of ha under uv nh2cl process and the results are shown in fig s4 the detailed peak assignments are shown in table s4 the ftir spectrum of ha majorly changed in the range of 550 1750 cm 1 with uv nh2cl treatment in particular the enhancement of alkyl and carbonyl peaks indicated the transition of samples from higher molecular weight components to lower molecular weight ones which also was confirmed by the decrease of the stretching and bending peak signal of molecular frame however the signals of some functional groups overlapped strongly fig s5 and it was difficult to distinguish them 2dcos was applied to spread the spectrum in a second dimension to better clarify the conformational changes of ha the 2dcos map of synchronous fluorescence spectra of ha sample fig 2 a displayed two predominant autopeaks peaked at 360 and 450 nm respectively the intensity of the peak at 360 nm decreased more siginificantly than that at 450 nm indicating that fulvic acid like fractions were more vulnerable to uv nh2cl process compared to the humic like fraction which is consistent with the parafac results in section 3 1 1 moreover both the two autopeaks were positive implying that the direction of their spectral changes was the same when the uv dose increased the asynchronous map could provide information about the change order of two fractions under uv nh2cl process as shown in the asynchronous map fig 2b and table s5 the cross peaks in the upper left corner exhibited negative sign which indicated that the change followed the order of 450 360 nm according to noda s rule this indicated that the reaction sequence of uv nh2cl with different fractions of the ha was humic like fraction fulvic like one the uv nh2cl induced 2d ir cos of ha samples is shown in fig 3 in which ten predominant autopeaks centered at 1650 1450 1400 1250 1025 933 850 675 610 and 500 cm 1 in the synchronous map fig 3a respectively the band at 1400 cm 1 presented the highest variation while the band at 1650 cm 1 had the smallest change signs of all cross peaks were positive indicating that conformational variations were in the same direction table s6 shows assignments of bands and signs of cross peaks in asynchronous map fig 3b according to noda s rule structural variations sequence of ha functional groups by increasing uv irradiation followed the order of iodo polysaccharides carboxyl amide phenolic aliphatic aryl groups 3 2 i thms generation in uv nh2cl process three types of i thm chi3 chcli2 and chcl2i were detected during uv nh2cl treatment of iodine containing ha solutions as shown in fig 4 a as the uv fluence increased from 0 to 60 mj cm2 the generation of total i thms rose from 64 4 3 3 to 77 0 1 8 nm and then decreased over uv influence reaching a minimum level of 11 9 0 9 nm in addition the yields of each i thm species also increased initially and then decreased according to previous studies chuang et al 2017 sun et al 2019 tian et al 2020 the main radicals involved in the uv nh2cl process could be oh cl cl2 nh2 and nhcl as indicated in table s7 of the supporting information therefore we conducted the epr analysis and found that only a 4 fold characteristic peak with 1 2 2 1 intensity was observed during uv irradiation of nh2cl solution fig 4 b indicating the production of oh in the uv nh2cl process zhang et al 2018b moreover the generation of oh was enhanced with increasing uv irradiation fluence fig 4 b on the other hand we did not observe the 7 fold peaks for reactive chlorine species rcs in the epr spectrum which is consistent with a previous study li et al 2020 suggesting the uv nh2cl process has weaker rcs compared to oh production additionally although the generation of reactive nitrogen species rns was found in the uv nh2cl process wu et al 2019 it is reported that the rate constant of rns for organic degradation was two orders of magnitude lower than that of oh and rcs wang et al 2021 strongly implying the insignificant contribution of rns for i thm formation during uv nh2cl process as a consequence these radical species generated would react with dom and i to produce dbp precursors and reactive iodine species ris respectively leading to the formation of i thms on one hand higher uv fluence would result in enhanced generation of radical species especially non selective oh which can react with ha to produce more dbp precursors leading to higher i thm formation as shown in fig 4 a which was also confirmed by our findings in section 3 1 1 fig 1 d that dom was converted into low molecular weight organic precursors thus promoting i thm formation xia et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 moreover we applied the ratios of three components c1 c2 c2 c3 and c1 c3 to track the correlation between i thm production and dom variations during uv nh2cl process and the results are elaborated in fig 4 c the changes of c1 c2 c2 c3 and c1 c3 ratios were correlated well with i thm formation r 2 0 915 for c1 c2 ratio 0 995 for c2 c3 ratio and 0 872 for c1 c3 ratio respectively further indicating that the structure of doms would be one of crucial factors for determining i thm formation during uv nh2cl treatment of iodine containing water however when uv fluence exceeded 60 mj cm2 although more radical species including oh was formed with the further increase in uv fluence more reactive iodine species ris could be also generated as shown in eqs 21 25 in table s7 on one hand ris is selective oxidant with lower oxidation capacity compared to oh and rcs and thus would react with dom more slowly zhang et al 2018a resulting in less i thm formation on the other hand we performed experiments to explore the impact of ris on the transformation of ha in the uv nh2cl process fig s6 and table s8 and found that the mineralization of ha as well as the reduction of its uv254 and fluorescent components was slower down due to the formation of ris further reducing the generation of i thms fig 4 a in addition as shown in fig s7 the decay of nh2cl was significantly promoted by uv irradiation compared to the dark condition which might also restrict the production of i thms as shown in fig s7 the decay of nh2cl was significantly promoted by uv irradiation compared to the dark condition according to a previous study the photoproducts included nitrite nitrate nitrous oxide and ammonium all of which were stable and could not form i dbps li and blatchley 2009 therefore the concentration of hoi declined rapidly with the increase in uv fluence fig 4 d which limited the possibility of reactions with dom and thus causing a reduction of i thms formation when uv fluence exceeded 60 mj cm2 in addition when uv fluence was higher than 100 mj cm2 the ha solution with uv nh2cl treatment generated less i thms compared with chloramination alone in particular the total concentration of i thms with uv nh2cl treatment was only 18 4 of that treated with chloramine when uv fluence was 900 mj cm2 implying that uv nh2cl treatment might be more effective in controling the production of i thms compared to the chloramination alone 3 3 impacts of key parameters on i thm formation in uv nh2cl process 3 3 1 ha concentration as ha concentration increased from 1 to 5 mg c l the production of i thms decreased from 120 6 9 7 to 33 8 1 9 nm fig 5 a this rapid decrease in the formation of i thms is likely due to that excessive ha was able to exhaust nh2cl in the solution xia et al 2018 as a result the concentration of nh2cl which can react with i to form hoi decreased thus reducing the generation of i thms however the generation of i thms reduced slightly as ha concentration further increased from 5 to 10 mg c l despite more ha was able to consume more nh2cl in the solution higher ha concentration could absorb more uv irradiation to promote the formation of dbp precursors these two contrary functions may result in a slight change of i thm formation in addition compared with chcl2i and chcli2 the production of chi3 decreased more remarkably with increasing ha concentration when ha concentration was increased from 1 to 10 mg c l the production of chi3 reduced by 96 while only 20 for chcli2 this was in agreement with previous studies liu et al 2017 xia et al 2018 and was probobaly due to the low probability of forming triiodo dbps when excess reaction sites of ha were available 3 3 2 nh2cl dosage i was oxidized to hoi by nh2cl thus affecting i thm formation in order to gain more insight into the impact of nh2cl dosage the variations of chcl3 chcl2i chcli2 and chi3 concentrations were monitored during experiments as shown in fig 5 b the chcl3 yield exhibited an increase trend as nh2cl dosage was improved from 10 to 40 mg l despite its low thm formation potential excessive nh2cl can still promote i thm formation and the similar trend has been reported by qian et al 2021 the concentration of total i thms increased from 21 0 1 6 to 50 2 5 8 nm as nh2cl level improved from 10 to 40 mg l an increase in nh2cl concentration would promote the reaction i nh2cl hoi and in turn accelerating the reaction dom hoi i dbps as a result the formation of i thms was enhanced this result was in consistent with an early report that the formation of aliphatic dbp was enhanced with the increase of disinfectant dose during chloramination liu et al 2017 on the other hand the production of both chcl2i and chcli2 improved among those i thms while the generation of chi3 had a reduction when nh2cl dosage was higher than 20 mg l it was reported that the dbp species produced would be more likely to change from more iodinated to more chlorinated ones chcl2i and chcli2 with high nh2cl concentration hua and reckhow 2008 thus decreasing the production of triiodo dbps such as chi3 in addition a previous research also found that high levels of nh2cl 24 mg l as cl2 could react with some formed i dbps and thus chi3 might undergo transformation and decomposition gong and zhang 2015 3 3 3 initial i concentration the effect of initial i concentration on the formation of i thms under the uv nh2cl treatment is shown in fig 5 c the improvement of iodine concentration led to a remarkable promotion on the production of three i thms since increasing i concentration would enhance the production of reactive iodine species and thus raising dom approachability for iodination as a consequence the total concentration of i thms leapt in concentration from 31 8 1 9 to 1031 4 35 44 nm as intial i concentration increased from 1 to 10 μm similar trend was also reported in a previous study pantelaki and voutsa 2018 especially the contribution of chi3 to total i thms increased siginificantly from 22 4 to 87 1 with i concentration increasing from 1 to 10 μm similar results were also reported that high intial i concentration could promote the transition of dominant species from less iodinated dbps to more iodinated ones liu et al 2017 wang et al 2020 as intial i concentration increased the production of hoi was promoted and consequently resulting in the enhanced conversion of chcl2i to chcli2 and chi3 3 3 4 in the presence of io3 since iodide and iodate would be likely present simultaneously in the water the impact of io3 on the formation of i thms was also investigated in this study as shown in fig 5 d total i thms formed in single io3 system was only 12 69 0 61 nm which was consistent with a previous report tang et al 2021 interestingly more i thms were formed in the mixed iodine i io3 system compared to the sum of that of the two single systems when i io3 molar ratio was 0 2 the yields of i thms of the mixed system was 71 96 2 85 nm while the sum of two single systems was only 44 46 2 48 nm and this gap gradually increased with the increase of i concentration and reached a maximum value of 66 05 nm with the i io3 ratio of 2 the increment of i thms may be ascribed to the transformation of reactive iodine species in the mixed system during uv nh2cl treatment after absorbing uv light io3 is only photolyzed into io2 io and i in the absence of i eqs 1 3 in table s9 however in the presence of i in addition to the direct photolysis of io3 under uv irradiation io3 will react with eaq generated by i photolysis induced by uv irradiation eq 4 in table s9 to produce io i2 and i3 eqs 5 9 in table s9 overall the mixed i io3 system turned more io3 into reactive iodine species resulting the promotion in i thm formation eq 10 in table s9 tang et al 2021 xia et al 2018 3 3 5 different dom sources the formation of i thms in the uv nh2cl process with ha and fa solutions as well as two real waters rw and fw was comparatively evaluated fig 6 besides for chi3 chcli2 and chcl2i the generation of chbri2 chbr2i chclbri was also considered since bromide br existed in natural waters guo et al 2020a and was also detectable in real water samples the total amount of produced i thms reached a peak value at uv fluence of 60 mj cm2 and then reduced with the further increase of uv fluence during the uv nh2cl treatment of four different solutions on the other hand the higher i thm yield was obtained for the fa compared to ha in the uv nh2cl process fig 6 this result was correlated well with our finding in section 3 2 that fulvic acid like component would be more likely to react during uv nh2cl process moreover it was also found that fa was more easily to react with iodine thus increasing i thm yields jones et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 it is noteworthy that real water samples presented higher i thm formation compared to the simulated water samples especially for the generation of chi3 for example the concentrations of total i thms of ha fa rw and fw were 139 2 7 5 202 0 4 2 304 1 9 5 and 387 7 12 2 nm when uv fluence was 60 mj cm2 respectively the formed chi3 in the fw was 10 4 38 8 times higher than that in the ha solution at tested uv fluence range previous studies also reported the enhanced i thm production during chlorination chloramination of rw and fw samples compared with the synthetic ha fa solution wang et al 2020 xia et al 2018 which might be due to the complexity of doms in real water samples 3 4 acute toxicity variations for different water samples treated with uv nh2cl the inhibition rate of alga chlorella pyrenoidosa growth was investigated in order to monitor the acute toxicity variation of iodine containing water by the uv nh2cl treatment a higher inhition rate means a higher acute toxicity of water samples as shown in fig 7 a the acute toxicity increased initially as the uv fluence increased from 0 to 60 mj cm2 and then decreased with further increasing the uv fluence to 900 mj cm2 for each sample with uv nh2cl treatment compared with chloramination alone uv fluence 0 mj cm2 the acute toxicity of rw and fw with uv nh2cl treatment uv fluence 900 mj cm2 reduced by 47 8 and 28 5 respectively moreover after treated with 900 mj cm2 uv irradiation water samples exhibited lower or comparable toxicity compared to solutions without treatment the inhibitory values of the ha fa rw and fw solution after 900 mj cm2 uv irradiation were found to be 15 5 12 4 28 8 and 38 9 respectively which were lower than those of initial solutions 23 4 for ha 29 7 for fa 40 8 for rw and 41 5 for fw respectively these results implied that the high uv fluence might be an effective method to control the acute toxicity for uv nh2cl treatment of iodine containing water additionally the acute toxicity of ha and fa increased slightly with uv fluence increased from 0 to 60 mj cm2 while had a remarakable improvement for rw and fw the positive correlations between i thm formation and inhibition rate of four waters shown in fig 7 b also supported this point especially for rw and fw the correlation was rather strong r 2 0 99 for rw and r 2 0 97 for fw respectively these results suggested that i thms might be the main toxicity driver during uv nh2cl process of iodine containing water since it is well known that iodinated dbps are significantly more toxic than other chlorinated and brominated analogs yang and zhang 2013 on the other hand it is worth noting that the two actual water samples fw rw were far more toxic compared to the simulated water samples ha fa after uv nh2cl treatment when the uv dosage was 60 mj cm2 chlorella pyrenoidosa could hardly grow in the fw while the inhibition rate was only 23 in the ha this could be attributed to the production of large amounts of i thms especially chi3 fig 6 which has been proven to be among the most cytoyoxic i thms by a previous study richardson et al 2008 4 conclusion the structure transformation of doms generation of i thms and variation of acute toxicity were revealed during the uv nh2cl treatment of iodide containing water in this study it was found that fulvic acid like fraction of ha was more susceptible to uv nh2cl treatment while humic like fraction reacted faster the preferential reaction of iodo group over other groups was observed during uv nh2cl process leading to organic precursors being more susceptible to form i thms moreover the generated radical species such as oh and reactive chlorine species could promote the transformation of ha consequently uv fluence lower than 60 mj cm2 improved the production of i thms however excessive uv fluence not only led to the formation of more reactive iodine species which slowed down the generation of dbp precursors but also exhausted nh2cl and reactive iodine species and subsequently reduced i thms generation higher concentration of ha reduced i thm production while increasing nh2cl dosage and intial i concentration promoted i thm production the strong positive correlations between acute toxicity and i thm yields among four water matrices suggested that i thms would be the main toxicity contributor to iodine containing waters treated by uv nh2cl process this study provides us a better understanding on uv nh2cl treatment of iodine containing water declaration of competing

16934,uv nh2cl process is becoming increasingly important for water treatment while its impact on iodine containing water remains unknown in this study the structure transformation of dissolved organic matters doms generation of iodinated trihalomethanes i thms and variation of acute toxicity were evaulated during the uv nh2cl treatment of iodine containing water the combination of exciation emission matrix parallel factor analysis and two dimensional correlation spectroscopy integrated with synchronous fluorescence and infrared absorption spectroscopy showed that fulvic like fraction of dom was more susceptible to uv nh2cl process and particularly iodo and polysaccharide groups gave the fastest resopnses consequently uv fluence lower than 60 mj cm2 promoted the production of i thms while excessive uv exhausted nh2cl and reactive iodine species and subsequently reduced i thm generation moreover dom concentration and source nh2cl dosage and i concentration had significant impacts on i thm formation in the uv nh2cl process additionally a positive correlation was found between acute toxicity variation and i thm formation when treating iodine containing waters with uv nh2cl these results together provide a comprehensive understanding on uv nh2cl treatment of iodine containing water graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords iodinated trihalomethanes i thms uv nh2cl dom toxicity 1 introduction arid conditions climate change and rapid population growth exacterbate global water deficit an increasing number of utilities have incorporated the potable reuse of municipal wastewater highly purified wastewater is increasingly recognized as a reliable drinking water supply chuang et al 2017 council 2012 gerrity et al 2013 full advanced treatment trains including microfiltration mf reverse osmosis ro and ultraviolet based advanced oxidation processes uv aops such as uv h2o2 and uv free chlorine are frequently employed in portable reuse facilities gerrity et al 2013 monochloramine nh2cl which is usually deliberately applied upstream due to its small molecular size can permeate ro membranes and subsequently result in the uv nh2cl process on the other hand the coexposure of uv and nh2cl can also occur when uv free chlorine is applied in ammonia containing water patton et al 2017 in addition the uv nh2cl process also occurs when treating chlorinated swimming pool water with uv chen et al 2021 therefore the uv nh2cl process is widely applied in many practical water treatment scenarios recent studies have also demonstrated that uv nh2cl could be effective in degradation of emerging micropollutants in water patton et al 2017 sun et al 2019 wu et al 2019 the great efficacy of the uv nh2cl process has been proven in the abatement of pharmaceuticals and personal care products from water bu et al 2018 li et al 2020 chuang et al 2017 compared uv nh2cl process with the uv h2o2 one and found that they performed similarly when degrading dioxane benzoate and carbamazepine in a range of ph 5 5 8 3 it was also demonstrated that the uv nh2cl process was highly effective for the removal of antibiotics from water cai et al 2020 however it was recently observed that the disinfection byproducts dbps which adverse health outcomes have been proved in human epidemiologic studies freeman et al 2017 hrudey et al 2015 wright et al 2017 could be generated during the degradation of micropollutants with uv nh2cl treatment for instance bu et al 2018 found that uv nh2cl treatment could enhance formation of carbonaceous dbps but reduce the formation emerging nitrosamine dbps during degradation of carbamazepine a recent study reported that the uv nh2cl treatment of tetracycline tended to form emerging nitrosamine dbps cai et al 2020 in recent years iodinated dbps i dbps generated from disinfection of iodine containing water have raised great concern since they have been proven to be more cytotoxic genotoxic and developmentally toxic than their regulated brominated and chlorinated analogs plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2008 among the i dbps reported to date iodinated trihalomethanes i thms as the most recognized i dbps have attracted more attention krasner et al 2006 richardson et al 2008 although the uv is a physical treatment process without dbp formation bichsel and von gunten 1999 has demonstrated that chloramination of iodine containing water could produce significant amount of i dbps this is because the reaction of nh2cl oxidizing hoi to iodate io3 a desired nontoxic sink of iodine containing water is very solw and hoi can remain longer to react with dissolved organic matters doms in water and thus promoting the generation of i dbps during chloramination liu et al 2019 in addition although io3 is nontoxic to human previous studies have shown that io3 could undergo photolysis under uv irradiation and result in the formation of i thms during subsequent chloramination tang et al 2021 tian et al 2017 as a consequence there is a high possibility that toxic i thms could be produced in the treatment of iodine containing water with the uv nh2cl process and therefore we may need revisit the application of uv nh2cl treatment for different water treatment scenarios however to the best of our knowledge the formation process and mechanisms of i thms during uv nh2cl treatment of iodine containing water are still unknown for instance how was dom changed in the uv nh2cl process how could the different radical species be involved in the variation of dom as well as the formation of i thms clear clarifications of these questions may be very important for the applications of the uv nh2cl process in water treatment on the other hand due to the possibility of producing more toxic substances the risk assessment of water treated by the uv nh2cl process would be important toxicity test can help assess on whether the reclaimed water can be safely reused cai et al 2020 reported an increase in toxicity of the reacted solution after uv nh2cl treatment compared with uv photolysis alone in tetracycline containing water zhu et al 2020 found a first increasing and then decreasing trend of toxicity of reacted solution with the prolonged uv irradiation time during uv nh2cl treatment of pollutant n n diethyl 3 methylbenzamide so far there is limited information about the impact of uv nh2cl treatment on the toxicity of iodine containing water and hence an in depth study which can provide guidelines for uv nh2cl treatment on reclaimed water deserves more attentions this study aimed to elucidate the influence of uv nh2cl treatment on iodine containing water including structure transformation of dom formation of i thms and variation of acute toxicity the transition of dom was tracked by three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem coupled with parallel factor analysis parafac and two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos combined with infrared absorption spectra and synchronous fluorescence participation of radical species including oh reactive chlorine species rcs and reactive iodine species ris in the variation of dom as well as the formation of i thms was explored following the impacts of five parameters including uv fluence dom concentration nh2cl dosage i concentration and the presence of io3 were also investigated additionally four different dom sources including humic acid ha fulvic acid fa raw water rw from a water treatment plant and its filtration water fw after coagulation and filtration were used to study the influence of different water matrices on the uv nh2cl process finally chlorella pyrenoidosa freshwater alga an efficient inexpensive and rapid model to indicate ecological health guo et al 2020b wang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 was selected to quantitatively analyze and compare the potential risks of iodine containing water after uv nh2cl treatment as chlorella pyrenoidosa has been successfully applied to characterize toxicity of both pure dbps roberts et al 2010 and disinfected effluent luo et al 2020 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents five i thms including chcl2i 95 chbrcli 95 chbr2i 90 95 chcli2 95 and chbri2 90 95 were purchased from cansyn chem co canada chi3 99 fa and ha were obtained from sigma aldrich usa a sodium hypochlorite solution effective chlorine content is 6 14 sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china was used to prepare nh2cl solutions and nh2cl was freshly prepared and measured as previously described liu et al 2019 other chemicals

plant in hefei china and the characteristics of water samples can be found in table s1 of supproting information si ha fa rw and fw were filtered through 0 45 μm membranes anpel co ltd china first and then stored in dark at 4 c before use 2 2 uv nh2cl treatment of i containing water batch uv nh2cl experiments were performed under a collimated beam apparatus composed of a low pressure lp mercury lamp figure s1 showed the experimental setup the uv intensity was monitored with a zdz 1 uv radiometer purchased from tianwei co suzhou china and maintained at 1 mw cm2 throughout the whole experiments uv fluence ranging from 0 to 900 mj cm2 was acquired by changing uv irradiation time a quartz beaker with 20 ml dom containing solution and desired concentration of i was adopted solution ph was adjust to 7 5 with h2so4 or naoh initially and then buffered with 1 mm phosphate reaction was initiated by injecting a small volume of nh2cl into the solution and then the beaker was immediately put on the agitator under the mercury lamp to ensure homogeneous reaction the temperature change of reaction solution was monitored during uv irradiation as shown in fig s2 the solution temperature only increased from 19 3 0 1 c to 20 4 0 1 c after 15 min of uv irradiation with 1 mw cm2 the beaker was taken out and the solution was transferred in a 20 ml glass screw headspace free vial with teflon lined septa at preset irradiation time subsequently samples were stored at 20 2 c in the dark for 24 hours and were quenched immediately by sodium thiosulfate for residual disinfectant 2 3 characterization of dom variations with spectra the eem data of samples were collected by a fluorescence spectrophotometer aqualog horiba scientific usa eem spectra combined with parafac can identify independent fluorescent components and track their behaviors cory and mcknight 2005 the eem spectra of ha were divided into three independent components according to parafac which was conducted with matlab r2020b and domfluor toolbox following tutorial stedmon and bro 2008 a luminescence spectrometer f 4600 hirachi japan was applied to collect the synchronous fluorescence spectra of ha samples and each data was an average of three scans following the method introduced by noda and ozaki 2004 the synchronous fluorescence spectra was further analyzed with 2dcos 2d shige software kwansei gakuin university japan was used to transform synchronous fluorescence data into a spectral matrix fitting 2dcos maps ha samples treated with different uv fluence under uv nh2cl process were freeze dried and then mixed with a certain amount of potassium bromide to grind and press under an infrared lamp then the transmission infrared spectra of ha samples were measured by a nicolet 8700 spectrometer 2 4 toxicity assessment the acute toxicity of treated water samples were investigated by monitoring the inhibition of alga growth luo et al 2020 in which all experiments were conducted in triplicate briefly a certain amount of algal suspension and treated water samples were added into a transparent flask and then the solution was amended with bg 11 medium which provided nutrients for algae qiu et al 2019 an lluminating incubactor light intensity of 6000 lx was used to incubate the algal suspension and the incubation was conducted under a 14 10 light dark cycle at 23 c for 96 hours after incubation the algal suspension was withdrew and measured at 695 nm wavelength od695 then od695 was used to determine algal cell number the calculation of the inhibition of algal growth is described in text s2 2 5 analysis all of chemical analyses were conducted at least twice and the average data was presented detailed processing of i thms and chcl3 analysis is described in text s3 dissolved organic carbon doc was determined by a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan chloramine was measured according to the n n diethylp phenylenediamine dpd method apha 1998 the electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiments were conducted with a emx premium x spectrometer bruker germany using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolinr n oxide dmpo to trap the radical signals since both hoi and i2 react with phenol quickly bichsel and von gunten 2000 they were quenched with phenols and then analyzed as iodophenol p iodophenol and o iodophenol by a hplc system 1260 agilent usa equipped with an eclipse plus c18 column agilent usa the mobile phase was 0 1 acetic acid and methanol v v 35 65 retention time 5 7 min and 6 8 min for o iodophenol and p iodophenol respectively the uv detection wavelength was 231 nm according to an early study reported by ye et al 2012 i 3 and uv254 were determined using a spectrophotometer uv 1800bp mapada at absorbance wavelength of 351 and 254 nm respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of ha structure in uv nh2cl process 3 1 1 parafac components and their behaviors as presented in fig 1 three different fluorescent components c1 c2 and c3 of ha were identified according to residual analysis fig s3 a and split half validation fig s3 b component 1 c1 had excitation emission wavelengths ex em maxima at 250 490 nm c2 exhibited a peak at 250 420 nm ex em while c3 presented two peaks at 285 522 nm and 470 522 nm ex em according to previously reported eem peak locations table s2 c1 and c2 were assigned as humic like components while c3 was identified as a fulvic acid like component noticeably c1 and c3 presented their peaks at longer wavelengths em than c2 which could be associated with larger molecular weight dom lee et al 2015 and c3 showed relatively longer ex em wavelengths which might contain more structural condensed and polymerized dom jie et al 2003 therefore the three components can be sorted into c3 c1 c2 according to their molecular weight the fluorescence maximum fmax of each component has been applied to characterize the relative amount of parafac components in previous studies stedmon et al 2003 xia et al 2018 and table s3 shows the relative mean abundance of three components with different uv fluence during uv nh2cl treatment c1 46 0 46 8 and c2 35 1 32 3 were the domiant components in ha synthetic water solution and both of them were assigned as humic like components the ratios of fluorescent components were applied by previous studies to characterize the variations of dom lee and hur 2016 stedmon et al 2003 xia et al 2018 in this work we used three parafac ratios in fmax values c1 c2 c1 c3 and c2 c3 to further monitor correlations between ha variations and uv fluence during uv nh2cl process and the results are presented in fig 1 d the c1 c2 ratio kept decreasing as uv fluence increased while both c1 c3 and c2 c3 reduced slightly initially and then improved further suggesting that larger humic like component c1 was preferentially decomposited over smaller component c2 this correlated with a previous study xia et al 2018 and confirmed that uv nh2cl treatment contributed to the shift of higher molecular weight to lower ones aftab and hur 2017 increasing the production of dbps precursors which might promote i thm formation the increasing trend of c1 c3 and c2 c3 ratios with uv fluence exceeded 60 mj cm2 indicated the enhanced degree of decomposition of fulvic acid like component c3 at a higher uv fluence futher correlations between the changes of fluorescent components and i thm formation are elaborated in section 3 2 3 1 2 general spectroscopic observations and correlation analysis figure s4 displays the changes of synchronous fluorescence of ha samples with increasing uv fluence there are three fluorescence regions in the spectra according to a previous study hur et al 2011 they could be separated into humic like fulvic like and protein like sections corresponding to the wavelength ranging of 380 550 300 380 and 250 300 nm respectively as shown in fig s4 the ha mainly contained humic like and fulvic like fractions while almost no protein like fractions the intensity of the two fluorescence substance detected in the ha changed significantly during uv nh2cl treatment quenching of fractions might represent the degradation or transformation of ha fractions with the increase in the fluence of uv moreover the fourier transform infrared ftir spectra was applied to characterize the changes of functional groups of ha under uv nh2cl process and the results are shown in fig s4 the detailed peak assignments are shown in table s4 the ftir spectrum of ha majorly changed in the range of 550 1750 cm 1 with uv nh2cl treatment in particular the enhancement of alkyl and carbonyl peaks indicated the transition of samples from higher molecular weight components to lower molecular weight ones which also was confirmed by the decrease of the stretching and bending peak signal of molecular frame however the signals of some functional groups overlapped strongly fig s5 and it was difficult to distinguish them 2dcos was applied to spread the spectrum in a second dimension to better clarify the conformational changes of ha the 2dcos map of synchronous fluorescence spectra of ha sample fig 2 a displayed two predominant autopeaks peaked at 360 and 450 nm respectively the intensity of the peak at 360 nm decreased more siginificantly than that at 450 nm indicating that fulvic acid like fractions were more vulnerable to uv nh2cl process compared to the humic like fraction which is consistent with the parafac results in section 3 1 1 moreover both the two autopeaks were positive implying that the direction of their spectral changes was the same when the uv dose increased the asynchronous map could provide information about the change order of two fractions under uv nh2cl process as shown in the asynchronous map fig 2b and table s5 the cross peaks in the upper left corner exhibited negative sign which indicated that the change followed the order of 450 360 nm according to noda s rule this indicated that the reaction sequence of uv nh2cl with different fractions of the ha was humic like fraction fulvic like one the uv nh2cl induced 2d ir cos of ha samples is shown in fig 3 in which ten predominant autopeaks centered at 1650 1450 1400 1250 1025 933 850 675 610 and 500 cm 1 in the synchronous map fig 3a respectively the band at 1400 cm 1 presented the highest variation while the band at 1650 cm 1 had the smallest change signs of all cross peaks were positive indicating that conformational variations were in the same direction table s6 shows assignments of bands and signs of cross peaks in asynchronous map fig 3b according to noda s rule structural variations sequence of ha functional groups by increasing uv irradiation followed the order of iodo polysaccharides carboxyl amide phenolic aliphatic aryl groups 3 2 i thms generation in uv nh2cl process three types of i thm chi3 chcli2 and chcl2i were detected during uv nh2cl treatment of iodine containing ha solutions as shown in fig 4 a as the uv fluence increased from 0 to 60 mj cm2 the generation of total i thms rose from 64 4 3 3 to 77 0 1 8 nm and then decreased over uv influence reaching a minimum level of 11 9 0 9 nm in addition the yields of each i thm species also increased initially and then decreased according to previous studies chuang et al 2017 sun et al 2019 tian et al 2020 the main radicals involved in the uv nh2cl process could be oh cl cl2 nh2 and nhcl as indicated in table s7 of the supporting information therefore we conducted the epr analysis and found that only a 4 fold characteristic peak with 1 2 2 1 intensity was observed during uv irradiation of nh2cl solution fig 4 b indicating the production of oh in the uv nh2cl process zhang et al 2018b moreover the generation of oh was enhanced with increasing uv irradiation fluence fig 4 b on the other hand we did not observe the 7 fold peaks for reactive chlorine species rcs in the epr spectrum which is consistent with a previous study li et al 2020 suggesting the uv nh2cl process has weaker rcs compared to oh production additionally although the generation of reactive nitrogen species rns was found in the uv nh2cl process wu et al 2019 it is reported that the rate constant of rns for organic degradation was two orders of magnitude lower than that of oh and rcs wang et al 2021 strongly implying the insignificant contribution of rns for i thm formation during uv nh2cl process as a consequence these radical species generated would react with dom and i to produce dbp precursors and reactive iodine species ris respectively leading to the formation of i thms on one hand higher uv fluence would result in enhanced generation of radical species especially non selective oh which can react with ha to produce more dbp precursors leading to higher i thm formation as shown in fig 4 a which was also confirmed by our findings in section 3 1 1 fig 1 d that dom was converted into low molecular weight organic precursors thus promoting i thm formation xia et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 moreover we applied the ratios of three components c1 c2 c2 c3 and c1 c3 to track the correlation between i thm production and dom variations during uv nh2cl process and the results are elaborated in fig 4 c the changes of c1 c2 c2 c3 and c1 c3 ratios were correlated well with i thm formation r 2 0 915 for c1 c2 ratio 0 995 for c2 c3 ratio and 0 872 for c1 c3 ratio respectively further indicating that the structure of doms would be one of crucial factors for determining i thm formation during uv nh2cl treatment of iodine containing water however when uv fluence exceeded 60 mj cm2 although more radical species including oh was formed with the further increase in uv fluence more reactive iodine species ris could be also generated as shown in eqs 21 25 in table s7 on one hand ris is selective oxidant with lower oxidation capacity compared to oh and rcs and thus would react with dom more slowly zhang et al 2018a resulting in less i thm formation on the other hand we performed experiments to explore the impact of ris on the transformation of ha in the uv nh2cl process fig s6 and table s8 and found that the mineralization of ha as well as the reduction of its uv254 and fluorescent components was slower down due to the formation of ris further reducing the generation of i thms fig 4 a in addition as shown in fig s7 the decay of nh2cl was significantly promoted by uv irradiation compared to the dark condition which might also restrict the production of i thms as shown in fig s7 the decay of nh2cl was significantly promoted by uv irradiation compared to the dark condition according to a previous study the photoproducts included nitrite nitrate nitrous oxide and ammonium all of which were stable and could not form i dbps li and blatchley 2009 therefore the concentration of hoi declined rapidly with the increase in uv fluence fig 4 d which limited the possibility of reactions with dom and thus causing a reduction of i thms formation when uv fluence exceeded 60 mj cm2 in addition when uv fluence was higher than 100 mj cm2 the ha solution with uv nh2cl treatment generated less i thms compared with chloramination alone in particular the total concentration of i thms with uv nh2cl treatment was only 18 4 of that treated with chloramine when uv fluence was 900 mj cm2 implying that uv nh2cl treatment might be more effective in controling the production of i thms compared to the chloramination alone 3 3 impacts of key parameters on i thm formation in uv nh2cl process 3 3 1 ha concentration as ha concentration increased from 1 to 5 mg c l the production of i thms decreased from 120 6 9 7 to 33 8 1 9 nm fig 5 a this rapid decrease in the formation of i thms is likely due to that excessive ha was able to exhaust nh2cl in the solution xia et al 2018 as a result the concentration of nh2cl which can react with i to form hoi decreased thus reducing the generation of i thms however the generation of i thms reduced slightly as ha concentration further increased from 5 to 10 mg c l despite more ha was able to consume more nh2cl in the solution higher ha concentration could absorb more uv irradiation to promote the formation of dbp precursors these two contrary functions may result in a slight change of i thm formation in addition compared with chcl2i and chcli2 the production of chi3 decreased more remarkably with increasing ha concentration when ha concentration was increased from 1 to 10 mg c l the production of chi3 reduced by 96 while only 20 for chcli2 this was in agreement with previous studies liu et al 2017 xia et al 2018 and was probobaly due to the low probability of forming triiodo dbps when excess reaction sites of ha were available 3 3 2 nh2cl dosage i was oxidized to hoi by nh2cl thus affecting i thm formation in order to gain more insight into the impact of nh2cl dosage the variations of chcl3 chcl2i chcli2 and chi3 concentrations were monitored during experiments as shown in fig 5 b the chcl3 yield exhibited an increase trend as nh2cl dosage was improved from 10 to 40 mg l despite its low thm formation potential excessive nh2cl can still promote i thm formation and the similar trend has been reported by qian et al 2021 the concentration of total i thms increased from 21 0 1 6 to 50 2 5 8 nm as nh2cl level improved from 10 to 40 mg l an increase in nh2cl concentration would promote the reaction i nh2cl hoi and in turn accelerating the reaction dom hoi i dbps as a result the formation of i thms was enhanced this result was in consistent with an early report that the formation of aliphatic dbp was enhanced with the increase of disinfectant dose during chloramination liu et al 2017 on the other hand the production of both chcl2i and chcli2 improved among those i thms while the generation of chi3 had a reduction when nh2cl dosage was higher than 20 mg l it was reported that the dbp species produced would be more likely to change from more iodinated to more chlorinated ones chcl2i and chcli2 with high nh2cl concentration hua and reckhow 2008 thus decreasing the production of triiodo dbps such as chi3 in addition a previous research also found that high levels of nh2cl 24 mg l as cl2 could react with some formed i dbps and thus chi3 might undergo transformation and decomposition gong and zhang 2015 3 3 3 initial i concentration the effect of initial i concentration on the formation of i thms under the uv nh2cl treatment is shown in fig 5 c the improvement of iodine concentration led to a remarkable promotion on the production of three i thms since increasing i concentration would enhance the production of reactive iodine species and thus raising dom approachability for iodination as a consequence the total concentration of i thms leapt in concentration from 31 8 1 9 to 1031 4 35 44 nm as intial i concentration increased from 1 to 10 μm similar trend was also reported in a previous study pantelaki and voutsa 2018 especially the contribution of chi3 to total i thms increased siginificantly from 22 4 to 87 1 with i concentration increasing from 1 to 10 μm similar results were also reported that high intial i concentration could promote the transition of dominant species from less iodinated dbps to more iodinated ones liu et al 2017 wang et al 2020 as intial i concentration increased the production of hoi was promoted and consequently resulting in the enhanced conversion of chcl2i to chcli2 and chi3 3 3 4 in the presence of io3 since iodide and iodate would be likely present simultaneously in the water the impact of io3 on the formation of i thms was also investigated in this study as shown in fig 5 d total i thms formed in single io3 system was only 12 69 0 61 nm which was consistent with a previous report tang et al 2021 interestingly more i thms were formed in the mixed iodine i io3 system compared to the sum of that of the two single systems when i io3 molar ratio was 0 2 the yields of i thms of the mixed system was 71 96 2 85 nm while the sum of two single systems was only 44 46 2 48 nm and this gap gradually increased with the increase of i concentration and reached a maximum value of 66 05 nm with the i io3 ratio of 2 the increment of i thms may be ascribed to the transformation of reactive iodine species in the mixed system during uv nh2cl treatment after absorbing uv light io3 is only photolyzed into io2 io and i in the absence of i eqs 1 3 in table s9 however in the presence of i in addition to the direct photolysis of io3 under uv irradiation io3 will react with eaq generated by i photolysis induced by uv irradiation eq 4 in table s9 to produce io i2 and i3 eqs 5 9 in table s9 overall the mixed i io3 system turned more io3 into reactive iodine species resulting the promotion in i thm formation eq 10 in table s9 tang et al 2021 xia et al 2018 3 3 5 different dom sources the formation of i thms in the uv nh2cl process with ha and fa solutions as well as two real waters rw and fw was comparatively evaluated fig 6 besides for chi3 chcli2 and chcl2i the generation of chbri2 chbr2i chclbri was also considered since bromide br existed in natural waters guo et al 2020a and was also detectable in real water samples the total amount of produced i thms reached a peak value at uv fluence of 60 mj cm2 and then reduced with the further increase of uv fluence during the uv nh2cl treatment of four different solutions on the other hand the higher i thm yield was obtained for the fa compared to ha in the uv nh2cl process fig 6 this result was correlated well with our finding in section 3 2 that fulvic acid like component would be more likely to react during uv nh2cl process moreover it was also found that fa was more easily to react with iodine thus increasing i thm yields jones et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 it is noteworthy that real water samples presented higher i thm formation compared to the simulated water samples especially for the generation of chi3 for example the concentrations of total i thms of ha fa rw and fw were 139 2 7 5 202 0 4 2 304 1 9 5 and 387 7 12 2 nm when uv fluence was 60 mj cm2 respectively the formed chi3 in the fw was 10 4 38 8 times higher than that in the ha solution at tested uv fluence range previous studies also reported the enhanced i thm production during chlorination chloramination of rw and fw samples compared with the synthetic ha fa solution wang et al 2020 xia et al 2018 which might be due to the complexity of doms in real water samples 3 4 acute toxicity variations for different water samples treated with uv nh2cl the inhibition rate of alga chlorella pyrenoidosa growth was investigated in order to monitor the acute toxicity variation of iodine containing water by the uv nh2cl treatment a higher inhition rate means a higher acute toxicity of water samples as shown in fig 7 a the acute toxicity increased initially as the uv fluence increased from 0 to 60 mj cm2 and then decreased with further increasing the uv fluence to 900 mj cm2 for each sample with uv nh2cl treatment compared with chloramination alone uv fluence 0 mj cm2 the acute toxicity of rw and fw with uv nh2cl treatment uv fluence 900 mj cm2 reduced by 47 8 and 28 5 respectively moreover after treated with 900 mj cm2 uv irradiation water samples exhibited lower or comparable toxicity compared to solutions without treatment the inhibitory values of the ha fa rw and fw solution after 900 mj cm2 uv irradiation were found to be 15 5 12 4 28 8 and 38 9 respectively which were lower than those of initial solutions 23 4 for ha 29 7 for fa 40 8 for rw and 41 5 for fw respectively these results implied that the high uv fluence might be an effective method to control the acute toxicity for uv nh2cl treatment of iodine containing water additionally the acute toxicity of ha and fa increased slightly with uv fluence increased from 0 to 60 mj cm2 while had a remarakable improvement for rw and fw the positive correlations between i thm formation and inhibition rate of four waters shown in fig 7 b also supported this point especially for rw and fw the correlation was rather strong r 2 0 99 for rw and r 2 0 97 for fw respectively these results suggested that i thms might be the main toxicity driver during uv nh2cl process of iodine containing water since it is well known that iodinated dbps are significantly more toxic than other chlorinated and brominated analogs yang and zhang 2013 on the other hand it is worth noting that the two actual water samples fw rw were far more toxic compared to the simulated water samples ha fa after uv nh2cl treatment when the uv dosage was 60 mj cm2 chlorella pyrenoidosa could hardly grow in the fw while the inhibition rate was only 23 in the ha this could be attributed to the production of large amounts of i thms especially chi3 fig 6 which has been proven to be among the most cytoyoxic i thms by a previous study richardson et al 2008 4 conclusion the structure transformation of doms generation of i thms and variation of acute toxicity were revealed during the uv nh2cl treatment of iodide containing water in this study it was found that fulvic acid like fraction of ha was more susceptible to uv nh2cl treatment while humic like fraction reacted faster the preferential reaction of iodo group over other groups was observed during uv nh2cl process leading to organic precursors being more susceptible to form i thms moreover the generated radical species such as oh and reactive chlorine species could promote the transformation of ha consequently uv fluence lower than 60 mj cm2 improved the production of i thms however excessive uv fluence not only led to the formation of more reactive iodine species which slowed down the generation of dbp precursors but also exhausted nh2cl and reactive iodine species and subsequently reduced i thms generation higher concentration of ha reduced i thm production while increasing nh2cl dosage and intial i concentration promoted i thm production the strong positive correlations between acute toxicity and i thm yields among four water matrices suggested that i thms would be the main toxicity contributor to iodine containing waters treated by uv nh2cl process this study provides us a better understanding on uv nh2cl treatment of iodine containing water declaration of competing
