24190,as the ecological problems deteriorated through the progress of modernization exploring the optimization strategy from the ecological perspective is of great significance ecosystem services ess bridge the ecological and social systems and planning geographical spatial patterns with consideration of reliable ecosystem service value esv assessment can improve land use efficiency and harmonize the human environment relationship this study aims to explore the spatial layout optimization strategy under the production living ecological ple space perspective taking wuhan as the study area we constructed ecological scenarios according to the synergies and trade offs mechanism among different ecosystem services and further combined the scenario restraints with economy population traffic and environment factors to simulate the future geographical spatial layout of wuhan the methods of ecosystem service value esv assessment future land use simulation flus model gis technologies and scenario analysis were applied in this study in this study we evaluated the esv of wuhan and then established a natural growth scenario and two ecological scenarios to simulate the spatial layout of wuhan in 2035 meanwhile we evaluated the carbon emissions to further examine the contributions of our ecological scenarios the results showed that 1 from 2010 to 2018 the spatial layout transformation of wuhan was primarily from ecological to production space and the high esv area was mainly in the east lake district 2 without effective consideration for ecological constraints the living and production space in wuhan will expand excessively in 2035 3 the regulation provision scenario had the highest ecosystem service value and the smallest carbon emissions in conclusion introducing ecosystem services into the flus model impact factor system is conducive to improving the ecological benefits of china s spatial pattern under scenario simulations keywords ecosystem services flus model production living ecological space data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction unreasonable human activities have caused environmental degradation and rapid urbanization adds to the tension in a human environment relationship causing problems like global warming food security and air pollution grimm et al 2008 to coordinate socioeconomic development with eco environmental protection the 18th national congress of the communist party of china proposed the optimization of territorial space development patterns as the primary initiative to achieve ecological progress hansen et al 2018 as a result the production living ecological ple space as the main body of spatial pattern optimization lin et al 2022 has become increasingly prominent for the efficient use of land resources and sustainable regional development fu et al 2021 in the context of land use optimization with ecological priority perspective current studies either incorporate ecological indicators into land use cover change lucc simulation model to mitigate the adverse effects of urbanization processes cao et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 li et al 2021 or focus exclusively on the important ecological area such as ecological sources and corridors conservation area to ensure ecological security pattern fu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 however the optimization process typically treats ecological factors as constraints rather than drivers the complex dynamics in the ecosystem need to be further integrated into land use strategies for making nuanced and informed decisions ecosystem services ess as a bridge in the social ecological system are the direct and indirect contributions of ecosystems to the welfare of human beings costanza et al 1997 millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 ecosystem services provide a broad and inclusive concept that stimulates reflection upon landscape multifunctionality turkelboom et al 2018 and facilitates methodically assessing human environmental impacts torres et al 2021 several studies have adopted es for land use optimization li et al 2021 liu et al 2021 by quantifying the impact of lucc on ess but the complex interactions within different types of ecosystems known as es synergies trade offs mechanism are often neglected since in real world situations land use management to increase the delivery of certain ecosystem services generally leads to a reduction of other services therefore knowledge and application of es synergies trade offs are necessary in this study we utilized es to support ple space layout optimization for two reasons 1 the assessment of ecosystem service value esv quantifies the various ecological benefits of land system and 2 knowledge of the es synergies trade offs relationship helps mitigate the confliction of multiple es benefits land use cover change lucc has a significant influence on the types patterns and ecological processes of an ecosystem jin et al 2017 therefore different land use management choices can result in varying supplies of multiple ecosystem services from the land system bryan et al 2015 under this premise we construct and simulate three scenarios a natural growth scenario without ecological drivers and two ecological scenarios inspired by es synergies trade offs mechanism we expect the overall ecological benefits to increase when es dynamics are scrupulously incorporated into future land use simulation processes meanwhile as lucc is a crucial source of carbon emissions and accounts for approximately one third of the carbon emissions caused by human activities eggleston et al 2006 houghton et al 2012 our ecological scenarios can be further evaluated on their contribution to carbon emission reduction targets china the largest developing country and the largest carbon emitter in the world has solemnly announced the carbon peak and carbon neutralization goals to mitigate global climate change zheng et al 2019 if the policies implemented to reach that goal are appropriate for china they will transit china s development pattern into green growth and low carbon he 2014 thus the primary goal of our scenario analysis is to scrutinize the impacts of land use optimization strategies on the ecological benefits of ensuring es supply and mitigating carbon emissions more specifically we conducted a land use cover change simulation model from ple perspective that involved ecosystem services value assessment synergies trade offs law and scenario analysis as the largest inland megacity in central china wuhan has witnessed intense urban and industrial activities since the implementation of the strategy of central china rising meanwhile the city is abundant in ecological resources which is not common in chinses big cities thus we chose the city as the case study area for its intensifying conflict between urbanization and environmental protection this model enables the quantitative spatial allocation of land use types and intuitive expression of the optimization results of land use patterns in spatial locations the findings of this study have important theoretical and practical significance for urban planning and management of land resources 2 study area and data 2 1 study area wuhan city is an inland megacity in china and the capital city of hubei province fig 1 the total area of wuhan is 8569 15 km2 and a resident population of 13 648 900 as of the end of 2021 1 1 the data is from wuhan statistical yearbook 2022 wuhan is the core city of the yangtze river economic belt an important national comprehensive transportation hub as well as a strategic pivot point for the rise of central china fig 2 shows the land use in wuhan from 2010 to 2018 with construction land in the center woodland and grassland in the north rivers and lakes widely distributed across the city and water bodies covered a quarter of the entire territory jiao and liu 2010 however as the population and economy grow rapidly in wuhan the city is facing multiple challenges of ecological sustainability industrial transformation and economic development making it crucial to determine the land use optimization strategy 2 2 data sources and processing the data used in the study include boundary information land use data socioeconomic data geographic information data environmental resource data and planning results data the specific information about data time ranges sources and usage are shown in table 1 in this study multi source spatial data and non spatial statistics were used and we converted them into a uniform manner before employment specifically the land use data and spatial driver datasets in the study were set to the same coordinate system and processed as raster data with 30m 30m spatial resolution in addition the numbers of rows and columns were ensured to be consistent 3 methodologies 3 1 ecosystem service value esv assessment currently there is no unified classification scheme for ecosystem services li et al 2013 while the most used is the millennium ecosystem assessment ma system millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 which includes four major categories provision regulation support and cultural services provision services are the products that natural ecosystems provide to humans such as freshwater timber food etc mainly food and raw materials regulation services are the benefits derived from the regulation of the ecosystem such as water conservation sand control and carbon and oxygen sequestration cultural services are the non material benefits humans receive from the ecosystem through recreation aesthetics development and so on finally support services support the above three such as soil conservation and biodiversity maintenance we used the equivalent factor method developed by xie et al 2015 xie et al 2015 to measure ecosystem service value esv and spatial explicitly mapped the different types of service values with the help of arcgis software within wuhan city a 2km 2 km grid was used to divide the basic analysis unit of ecosystem services specifically we corresponded the land use land cover types to ecosystems with the closest nature to obtain the equivalent factor table the formulas measuring esv are eqs 1 and 2 and eq 2 1 e s v h k 1 k v c h k a k 2 e s v h 1 h e s v h where e s v h is the value of ecosystem services of category h yuan v c h k is the value coefficient of ecosystem services of category h for land use type k a k is the area of land use type k hm2 e s v is the total value of ecosystem services yuan table 2 is the equivalent factor coefficient table used in the study according to xie et al 2003 xie et al 2003 the equivalent factor of esv in china was defined as one in seven of the economic value of food yield per unit area of farmland and when applied to a certain region the equivalent factor value needed to be corrected using data of local major food crop types and prices eq 3 illustrates the calculation of equivalent factor of esv 3 e a 1 7 i 1 n m i p i q i m where e a is the economic value of food production provided by farmland ecosystem per unit area yuan hm2 i represents the crop species p i is the average value of crop i in a given year yuan t q i is the per unit area yield of crop i t hm2 m i is the cultivated area of crop i hm2 m is the total sum of cultivated area hm2 3 2 constraints on the construction of scenarios for synergies trade offs mechanism for es land system is the spatial carrier of ecosystems providing multiple ecosystem services due to its multifunctionality es synergies and trade offs mechanism depicts the complex interrelation dynamics between different ecosystem services a trade off refers to an antagonistic relationship and a synergy describes a mutual improvement of multiple ess cord et al 2017 the equivalent factor method we employed in the esv assessment ignores the heterogeneity of ecosystem composition in each grid unit we then expect the incorporation of es synergies trade offs mechanism to unveil the overlooked complex ecological processes in a certain grid lee et al 2016 lee and lautenbach 2016 systematically analyzed 476 pairwise es combinations in 67 case studies and concluded that the es relationship patterns and they found that causality could not be universally assumed therefore we identified and characterized the es co occurrences in wuhan through gis mapping to gain insight into the es synergies and trade offs relationships as es relationships can result from common drivers that simultaneously affect multiple services bennett et al 2009 and wuhan is abundant in natural resources we expect a synergistic relationship between regulating services and provisioning services it is mainly because they are jointly carried by ecosystems such as forests rivers and wetlands for example forests can effectively sequester carbon regulate the climate and clean the environment while providing human beings with timber materials and forestry products meanwhile we expect another synergy between support services and cultural services which is supported by the fact that important biological conservation areas provide esthetic values while protecting the regional soil environment and maintaining biodiversity therefore we constructed simulation input based on es synergies trade offs mechanism to inform future land use optimization strategies specifically a conscious setting of dominant ecosystem services objectives in land use simulation process can result in different land use allocations leading to spatial and quantitative differences in ecosystem services value outcomes 3 3 spatial patterns of future land use simulation flus the future land use simulation flus model is one of the improved models based on the principle of meta cellular automata meta ca which is able to explicitly simulate the long term spatial trajectories of multiple land use and land cover change with high accuracy liu et al 2017 the model consists of two core modules ann based probability of occurrence estimation and self adaptive inertia and competition mechanism cellular automata the flus model uses an artificial neural network ann algorithm to obtain the probability of suitability for each land type within the study area from both previous land use data and multiple drivers eq 4 illustrates the estimation process 4 p p k t j w j k s i g m o i d n e t j p t where p p k t denotes the probability of occurrence of land use type k on grid cell p at training time t w j k is an adaptive weight between the hidden layer and the output layer n e t j p t is the signal received by neuron j in the hidden layer the lucc drivers were selected from natural economic and social aspects regarding existing studies ouyang et al 2020 xiao et al 2022 we utilized the following indicators in our study dem slope average annual temperature and average annual rainfall for the natural aspect distance to major roads highways and railway tracks for the transportation aspect population density poi density metro stations bus stations public facilities companies scientific and educational facilities commercial facilities government institutions and the gdp level of the administrative district on the economic side the spatial distributions of driving factors are shown in fig 3 then the probability of occurrence was incorporated with neighborhood condition self adaptive inertia and conversion cost to estimate the combined probability eq 5 5 tp s p k t p p k t ω p k t iner ti a k t 1 s c c k where t p s p k t denotes the joint probability of grid cell p at time t to transform into target land type k p p k t denotes the probability of occurrence of land type k on grid cell p ω p k t is the neighborhood effect of land use type k i n e r t i a k t denotes the self adaptive inertia coefficient for land type k at time t 1 s c c k denotes the conversion cost from original land type c to target type k further a roulette selection mechanism was developed to determine final land use allocation in consideration of non dominant land use types converting opportunities the above design makes the simulation accuracy of the flus model higher than that of the traditional ca model moreover with the help of intelligent computation it has obvious advantages in handling multiple source data types therefore it is more suitable for simulating complex and long term future land use changes liu et al 2017 data from 2010 to 2015 were used to train our model and data from 2018 validated the accuracy of the simulation results comparing the predicted and actual values we got a kappa coefficient value of 0 93 for 10 random sampling and an overall accuracy of 0 96 thus our model performs better in simulating wuhan land use land change the model parameters i e cost matrix weight of neighborhood were determined based on local environmental conditions and expert opinions 3 4 analysis of carbon emissions from land accounting as land use cover change profoundly affects carbon emission houghton 1999 the total carbon emissions can be obtained by multiplying the carbon emission factors for each land use type with the corresponding land area and then summing up see eq 6 6 e k s i p i where ek denotes total carbon emissions the s i and p i represent the area and carbon emission coefficient of each land use type respectively a table of coefficients for land use carbon emissions absorption was obtained by referring to the relevant literature table 3 table 4 shows the changes in carbon emissions in wuhan from 2010 to 2018 it can be seen that cultivated land woodland grassland water and unused land are the main types of carbon absorption in contrast construction land is the primary source of carbon emission and the total amount of carbon emission continues to increase 3 5 scenario simulation based on the esv flus coupled model the esv model can quantitatively measure the value of ecosystem services in the study area and reflect the synergies and trade offs between different service values in spatial mapping on the other hand the flus model can obtain information from multi source data at different scales and exquisitely simulate the quantity and structure of future land use scenarios in a bottom up way we coupled an esv flus model by constructing and integrating ecological drivers into the land use simulation process thus bridging the technical flow between ecosystem services and territorial spatial patterns the entire framework of this study is illustrated in fig 4 in this study we conducted three scenarios natural growth scenario regulation provision synergy scenario and support cultural synergy scenario table 5 the natural growth scenario is the baseline scenario and the remainings are ecological optimization scenarios the scenario design aims to find the spatial solution for future urban development that maximizes ecological benefits the most significant contribution of the esv flus model is its reflection upon the interaction among production living ecological spaces which is vital for sustainable land use management with socioeconomic driving factors the impact of human production and living activities on land use changes can be effectively simulated meanwhile a more macro level ecological value distribution is considered with the esv assessment atlas when both the socioeconomic factors and ecological factors are incorporated into the land use simulation process the results thus can reflect the impact of production space and living space on ecological space explicitly 4 discussions 4 1 evolution of wuhan s territorial spatial pattern increase in production and living space decrease in ecological space to identify production living ecological space in wuhan we refer to the functional space method li and fang 2016 cheng et al 2018 that assigns each land use type with a ple classification in our study the production living ecological spaces are classified based on table 6 based on the statistical yearbook of land resources and the land use land cover data of 2010 2015 and 2018 we analyzed land use type changes in wuhan city from 2010 to 2018 in order to gain knowledge of spatial pattern evolvement during this period from table 7 the production space comprised around 42 to 45 of the whole area the living space occupied 13 to 14 and the ecological space accounted for roughly 41 to 44 wuhan city has many rivers and lakes and the water space takes up a large proportion as for the overall ple space structure change the proportion of production space area gradually increased the living space stood stable and the ecological space decreased respectively utilizing the spatial overlay method we inspected the transformation mode of ples production living ecological space in wuhan city in further detail generally ecological space was well preserved throughout wuhan city from 2010 to 2018 as shown in fig 5 the city was abundant in ecosystem resources thanks to mountain system in the northern area and many rivers and lakes over the space with a special interest in the transfer out of ecological space production and living spaces have mostly encroached on a small scale at the edge of the ecological space however two obvious sites with large areas of ecosystem transformation can be spotted one is the land reclamation in the tazi lake basin on the west side of the yangtze river and the other is the construction of a large area of paddy fields in the beihu basin south of the yangtze river table 8 illustrates the land use type changes in wuhan city over 2010 2015 and 2018 it is clearly shown that from 2010 to 2015 cultivated land woodland grassland and water all showed different degrees of decrease while the urban village industrial and mining land transport land and unused land witnessed an obvious increase the area of transport land went up the most by 9683 13hm2 an increase of 48 the area of urban village industrial and mining land rose by 20 051 8hm2 an increase of 15 the area of unused land grew by 81 92hm2 an increase of only 1 on the other hand grassland dropped the most by 13 with an area decrease of 503 87hm2 cultivated land woodland and water area changed less with an area decrease of 15 510 15hm2 1990 61hm2 and 8128 23hm2 respectively with a fall of 5 2 and 3 in general the land use changes in wuhan city during this period were characterized by the vigorous development of transportation construction and the gradual decrease of ecological land such as grassland the primary reason is that wuhan speeded up the construction of micro circulation roads and secondary road networks docked to expressways during this period zhang et al 2018 meanwhile rapid economic development increasing population and accelerated urbanization required a certain amount of land as a carrier which leads to a large amount of cultivated land woodland grassland and water being developed as roads and residential land the land use changes in 2015 2018 are similar to 2010 2015 the areas of urban village industrial and mining land and transportation land showed an upward trend whereas cultivated land woodland grassland and water showed different degrees of decrease the area of unused land did not change the increase in transportation land declined significantly compared to the previous period with an increase of only 8 and an area increase of 2383 hectares the area of urban village industrial and mining land increased by 9261 71 hm2 or 6 grassland cultivated land woodland and water area all decreased slightly with the area decreasing by 63 92 hm2 7348 57 hm2 1199 63 hm2 and 3100 59 hm2 respectively or 2 2 1 and 1 respectively generally speaking the characteristics of land use changes in wuhan during this period were still the vigorous development of transportation construction and the gradual decrease of ecological land such as grassland mainly because the layout of the transportation network in wuhan has basically taken shape during this period so the increase of transportation land has slowed down but the external expansion of urbanization was still the dominant trend which was shown in the continuous growth of transportation industrial and mining land in towns and villages and the proportion of ecological land area constantly decreased 4 2 value of ecosystem services in wuhan slightly above the national average wuhan city is located in the mid latitude plain monsoonal paddy agricultural area the planting industry is dominated by rice from the wuhan statistical yearbook 2020 the crop sown area kg hm2 and crop unit area yield kg hm2 of wuhan city from 2015 to 2019 were obtained year by year the average selling price of crops yuan 50 kg was obtained according to the national compilation of information on costs and benefits of agricultural products the standard value of ecosystem services in wuhan city in 2018 was 2627 766 yuan hm2 compared with the national average the ecosystem biomass factor in hubei province is 1 27 after correction the final economic value amount was 3337 263 yuan hm2 in order to identify and characterize the es co occurrences in wuhan city we spatially mapped the value of first level ecosystem services respectively to gain insight into which ess were available at the same location the mapping results showed that provision and regulation services shared a similar spatial distribution pattern with higher values in water woodland and grassland fig 6 while support and cultural services were more similarly distributed with higher values on the han river and yangtze river ecotones that cross the city horizontally fig 7 the hotspot tool was used to analyze the spatial aggregation of high values of ecosystem service values in wuhan fig 8 the hotspot area with a large contiguous distribution was the east lake area on the east side of the city the area is also a key eco tourism scenic area the results of ecosystem service value assessment coincide with luo and zhang 2014 and zhang et al 2018 luo and zhang 2014 luo and zhang 2014 used the markov model to predict future ecosystem service value changes of land use in wuhan they found an increase in esv attributed to water and cultivated land in wuhan in our study the hotspot areas of esv also concentrated in water and cultivated land zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 adopted various models and multi source data to estimate ecosystem services in wuhan based on their results the spatial distribution of es showed an uneven pattern high values in the south and low values in the north with the urban fringe higher than the central city their findings are the same as our results 4 3 multi scenario simulation of territorial spatial pattern in wuhan city to contrast with the ecological scenarios a natural growth scenario of the future territorial spatial pattern of wuhan city was designed to be the baseline in the natural growth scenario the permanent basic farmland nature reserves and other statutory planning reserves were set to be constraints the basic driving factors promoting urban expansion were also included as seen in fig 9 the natural growth scenario in 2035 showed a severe expansion of production and living space rural settlements are scattered in large patches in contiguous cultivated land areas transportation and industrial and mining land occupy more ecological space in the city and the ples is out of balance comparing the ecological scenarios with the baseline scenario the differences in spatial characteristics were reflected in the effective restraint of the production and living space the reduction of the number of settlements around the urban center near the main traffic routes and in the agricultural space and the ecological space was better protected using spatial overlay to analyze the areas where the ecological scenarios were inconsistent with the baseline scenario it can be found that the inconsistent areas were mainly around the town space and the edges of the traffic routes fig 10 the projected areas of each land type in 2035 under the three scenarios are counted separately table 9 under the three scenarios the areas of grassland unused land and rural settlements are basically the same in contrast the ecological scenario has significantly more cultivated land woodland and water areas and smaller areas of urban construction land industrial and mining land and transportation land the regulation provision synergy scenario has a smaller area of cultivated land and a larger area of water reflecting the differences in the types of ecosystem services carried by different land types further accounting for the value of primary ecosystem services under the two scenarios table 10 we find that the total value of ecosystem services under the regulation provision synergy scenario was higher than those of the support cultural synergy scenario consistent with the objective of the scenario setting table 11 shows the carbon emissions of each land use type under the two ecological scenarios and the predicted total carbon emissions under the regulation provision synergy scenario are lower mainly because woodlands and watersheds absorb more co2 than other land use types in conclusion the ecological benefits are higher in wuhan under the regulation provision synergy scenario 5 conclusions this study constructed a conducive framework to release potential ecosystem benefits in optimizing the territorial spatial layout based on the characteristics of the regional natural environment we measured the value of ecosystem services and exploited the synergies and trade offs between different service types into future land use simulation furthermore we adopted production living ecological perspective to recognize space functions and analyzed the applied result in wuhan city which endowed our esv flus model with implication and value in practical management the main conclusions are as follows 1 from 2010 to 2018 the ples ratio in wuhan city remains basically stable the transformation mode is mainly from ecological space to production space the total value of ecosystem services in wuhan city in 2018 reached approximately 114 847 4 billion yuan using the equivalent factor accounting method the high value area of ecosystem service is in the eastern part of the city 2 without effective consideration of ecological constraints the urban living and production space of wuhan city in 2035 will be expanded in a transitional manner when provision and regulation services dominate the total value of ecosystem services is higher and the total carbon emission is smaller in the whole area it indicates that introducing ecosystem services into the flus model is conducive to improving the ecological benefits furthermore the optimization of the spatial pattern of land in the future can be achieved by strictly protecting ecological high value areas and releasing ecological low value areas in an orderly manner 3 based on our findings we provide four optimization paths path 1 is to protect key ecological space strictly path 2 is to orderly release low efficiency ecological space path 3 is to concentrate the layout of rural living space and path 4 is to concede agricultural production space appropriately our proposed esv flus model provides an effective tool to support sustainable land resource management and urban planning the value assessment and spatial mapping of ecosystem services explicitly demonstrate the characteristics of ecological resources in a specific region thus informing context specific ecological scenario settings the scenario simulation is then conducted to compare optimization alternatives under different ecological objective orientations in pursuit of the most significant ecological benefits simultaneously considering the socioeconomic and ecological drivers for wuhan city our results indicated the importance of cultivated land and water area for regional ecosystem management which has larger ecological benefits besides the production living ecological space simulation result in 2035 can derive recommendations for the comprehensive planning in wuhan which adopted the ples framework as the fundamental spatial guidance our future work will focus on a set of aspects firstly the es synergies and trade offs relationships could explore using a statistical method to construct more accurate scenario simulation constraints secondly we will further modify our settings of scenarios in order to provide more accurate results thirdly we will collect more data to refine our model finally we will explore other simulation models such as cellular automata and agent based models to gain more insights funding sources this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 42201471 beijing social science funds

resolution in addition the numbers of rows and columns were ensured to be consistent 3 methodologies 3 1 ecosystem service value esv assessment currently there is no unified classification scheme for ecosystem services li et al 2013 while the most used is the millennium ecosystem assessment ma system millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 which includes four major categories provision regulation support and cultural services provision services are the products that natural ecosystems provide to humans such as freshwater timber food etc mainly food and raw materials regulation services are the benefits derived from the regulation of the ecosystem such as water conservation sand control and carbon and oxygen sequestration cultural services are the non material benefits humans receive from the ecosystem through recreation aesthetics development and so on finally support services support the above three such as soil conservation and biodiversity maintenance we used the equivalent factor method developed by xie et al 2015 xie et al 2015 to measure ecosystem service value esv and spatial explicitly mapped the different types of service values with the help of arcgis software within wuhan city a 2km 2 km grid was used to divide the basic analysis unit of ecosystem services specifically we corresponded the land use land cover types to ecosystems with the closest nature to obtain the equivalent factor table the formulas measuring esv are eqs 1 and 2 and eq 2 1 e s v h k 1 k v c h k a k 2 e s v h 1 h e s v h where e s v h is the value of ecosystem services of category h yuan v c h k is the value coefficient of ecosystem services of category h for land use type k a k is the area of land use type k hm2 e s v is the total value of ecosystem services yuan table 2 is the equivalent factor coefficient table used in the study according to xie et al 2003 xie et al 2003 the equivalent factor of esv in china was defined as one in seven of the economic value of food yield per unit area of farmland and when applied to a certain region the equivalent factor value needed to be corrected using data of local major food crop types and prices eq 3 illustrates the calculation of equivalent factor of esv 3 e a 1 7 i 1 n m i p i q i m where e a is the economic value of food production provided by farmland ecosystem per unit area yuan hm2 i represents the crop species p i is the average value of crop i in a given year yuan t q i is the per unit area yield of crop i t hm2 m i is the cultivated area of crop i hm2 m is the total sum of cultivated area hm2 3 2 constraints on the construction of scenarios for synergies trade offs mechanism for es land system is the spatial carrier of ecosystems providing multiple ecosystem services due to its multifunctionality es synergies and trade offs mechanism depicts the complex interrelation dynamics between different ecosystem services a trade off refers to an antagonistic relationship and a synergy describes a mutual improvement of multiple ess cord et al 2017 the equivalent factor method we employed in the esv assessment ignores the heterogeneity of ecosystem composition in each grid unit we then expect the incorporation of es synergies trade offs mechanism to unveil the overlooked complex ecological processes in a certain grid lee et al 2016 lee and lautenbach 2016 systematically analyzed 476 pairwise es combinations in 67 case studies and concluded that the es relationship patterns and they found that causality could not be universally assumed therefore we identified and characterized the es co occurrences in wuhan through gis mapping to gain insight into the es synergies and trade offs relationships as es relationships can result from common drivers that simultaneously affect multiple services bennett et al 2009 and wuhan is abundant in natural resources we expect a synergistic relationship between regulating services and provisioning services it is mainly because they are jointly carried by ecosystems such as forests rivers and wetlands for example forests can effectively sequester carbon regulate the climate and clean the environment while providing human beings with timber materials and forestry products meanwhile we expect another synergy between support services and cultural services which is supported by the fact that important biological conservation areas provide esthetic values while protecting the regional soil environment and maintaining biodiversity therefore we constructed simulation input based on es synergies trade offs mechanism to inform future land use optimization strategies specifically a conscious setting of dominant ecosystem services objectives in land use simulation process can result in different land use allocations leading to spatial and quantitative differences in ecosystem services value outcomes 3 3 spatial patterns of future land use simulation flus the future land use simulation flus model is one of the improved models based on the principle of meta cellular automata meta ca which is able to explicitly simulate the long term spatial trajectories of multiple land use and land cover change with high accuracy liu et al 2017 the model consists of two core modules ann based probability of occurrence estimation and self adaptive inertia and competition mechanism cellular automata the flus model uses an artificial neural network ann algorithm to obtain the probability of suitability for each land type within the study area from both previous land use data and multiple drivers eq 4 illustrates the estimation process 4 p p k t j w j k s i g m o i d n e t j p t where p p k t denotes the probability of occurrence of land use type k on grid cell p at training time t w j k is an adaptive weight between the hidden layer and the output layer n e t j p t is the signal received by neuron j in the hidden layer the lucc drivers were selected from natural economic and social aspects regarding existing studies ouyang et al 2020 xiao et al 2022 we utilized the following indicators in our study dem slope average annual temperature and average annual rainfall for the natural aspect distance to major roads highways and railway tracks for the transportation aspect population density poi density metro stations bus stations public facilities companies scientific and educational facilities commercial facilities government institutions and the gdp level of the administrative district on the economic side the spatial distributions of driving factors are shown in fig 3 then the probability of occurrence was incorporated with neighborhood condition self adaptive inertia and conversion cost to estimate the combined probability eq 5 5 tp s p k t p p k t ω p k t iner ti a k t 1 s c c k where t p s p k t denotes the joint probability of grid cell p at time t to transform into target land type k p p k t denotes the probability of occurrence of land type k on grid cell p ω p k t is the neighborhood effect of land use type k i n e r t i a k t denotes the self adaptive inertia coefficient for land type k at time t 1 s c c k denotes the conversion cost from original land type c to target type k further a roulette selection mechanism was developed to determine final land use allocation in consideration of non dominant land use types converting opportunities the above design makes the simulation accuracy of the flus model higher than that of the traditional ca model moreover with the help of intelligent computation it has obvious advantages in handling multiple source data types therefore it is more suitable for simulating complex and long term future land use changes liu et al 2017 data from 2010 to 2015 were used to train our model and data from 2018 validated the accuracy of the simulation results comparing the predicted and actual values we got a kappa coefficient value of 0 93 for 10 random sampling and an overall accuracy of 0 96 thus our model performs better in simulating wuhan land use land change the model parameters i e cost matrix weight of neighborhood were determined based on local environmental conditions and expert opinions 3 4 analysis of carbon emissions from land accounting as land use cover change profoundly affects carbon emission houghton 1999 the total carbon emissions can be obtained by multiplying the carbon emission factors for each land use type with the corresponding land area and then summing up see eq 6 6 e k s i p i where ek denotes total carbon emissions the s i and p i represent the area and carbon emission coefficient of each land use type respectively a table of coefficients for land use carbon emissions absorption was obtained by referring to the relevant literature table 3 table 4 shows the changes in carbon emissions in wuhan from 2010 to 2018 it can be seen that cultivated land woodland grassland water and unused land are the main types of carbon absorption in contrast construction land is the primary source of carbon emission and the total amount of carbon emission continues to increase 3 5 scenario simulation based on the esv flus coupled model the esv model can quantitatively measure the value of ecosystem services in the study area and reflect the synergies and trade offs between different service values in spatial mapping on the other hand the flus model can obtain information from multi source data at different scales and exquisitely simulate the quantity and structure of future land use scenarios in a bottom up way we coupled an esv flus model by constructing and integrating ecological drivers into the land use simulation process thus bridging the technical flow between ecosystem services and territorial spatial patterns the entire framework of this study is illustrated in fig 4 in this study we conducted three scenarios natural growth scenario regulation provision synergy scenario and support cultural synergy scenario table 5 the natural growth scenario is the baseline scenario and the remainings are ecological optimization scenarios the scenario design aims to find the spatial solution for future urban development that maximizes ecological benefits the most significant contribution of the esv flus model is its reflection upon the interaction among production living ecological spaces which is vital for sustainable land use management with socioeconomic driving factors the impact of human production and living activities on land use changes can be effectively simulated meanwhile a more macro level ecological value distribution is considered with the esv assessment atlas when both the socioeconomic factors and ecological factors are incorporated into the land use simulation process the results thus can reflect the impact of production space and living space on ecological space explicitly 4 discussions 4 1 evolution of wuhan s territorial spatial pattern increase in production and living space decrease in ecological space to identify production living ecological space in wuhan we refer to the functional space method li and fang 2016 cheng et al 2018 that assigns each land use type with a ple classification in our study the production living ecological spaces are classified based on table 6 based on the statistical yearbook of land resources and the land use land cover data of 2010 2015 and 2018 we analyzed land use type changes in wuhan city from 2010 to 2018 in order to gain knowledge of spatial pattern evolvement during this period from table 7 the production space comprised around 42 to 45 of the whole area the living space occupied 13 to 14 and the ecological space accounted for roughly 41 to 44 wuhan city has many rivers and lakes and the water space takes up a large proportion as for the overall ple space structure change the proportion of production space area gradually increased the living space stood stable and the ecological space decreased respectively utilizing the spatial overlay method we inspected the transformation mode of ples production living ecological space in wuhan city in further detail generally ecological space was well preserved throughout wuhan city from 2010 to 2018 as shown in fig 5 the city was abundant in ecosystem resources thanks to mountain system in the northern area and many rivers and lakes over the space with a special interest in the transfer out of ecological space production and living spaces have mostly encroached on a small scale at the edge of the ecological space however two obvious sites with large areas of ecosystem transformation can be spotted one is the land reclamation in the tazi lake basin on the west side of the yangtze river and the other is the construction of a large area of paddy fields in the beihu basin south of the yangtze river table 8 illustrates the land use type changes in wuhan city over 2010 2015 and 2018 it is clearly shown that from 2010 to 2015 cultivated land woodland grassland and water all showed different degrees of decrease while the urban village industrial and mining land transport land and unused land witnessed an obvious increase the area of transport land went up the most by 9683 13hm2 an increase of 48 the area of urban village industrial and mining land rose by 20 051 8hm2 an increase of 15 the area of unused land grew by 81 92hm2 an increase of only 1 on the other hand grassland dropped the most by 13 with an area decrease of 503 87hm2 cultivated land woodland and water area changed less with an area decrease of 15 510 15hm2 1990 61hm2 and 8128 23hm2 respectively with a fall of 5 2 and 3 in general the land use changes in wuhan city during this period were characterized by the vigorous development of transportation construction and the gradual decrease of ecological land such as grassland the primary reason is that wuhan speeded up the construction of micro circulation roads and secondary road networks docked to expressways during this period zhang et al 2018 meanwhile rapid economic development increasing population and accelerated urbanization required a certain amount of land as a carrier which leads to a large amount of cultivated land woodland grassland and water being developed as roads and residential land the land use changes in 2015 2018 are similar to 2010 2015 the areas of urban village industrial and mining land and transportation land showed an upward trend whereas cultivated land woodland grassland and water showed different degrees of decrease the area of unused land did not change the increase in transportation land declined significantly compared to the previous period with an increase of only 8 and an area increase of 2383 hectares the area of urban village industrial and mining land increased by 9261 71 hm2 or 6 grassland cultivated land woodland and water area all decreased slightly with the area decreasing by 63 92 hm2 7348 57 hm2 1199 63 hm2 and 3100 59 hm2 respectively or 2 2 1 and 1 respectively generally speaking the characteristics of land use changes in wuhan during this period were still the vigorous development of transportation construction and the gradual decrease of ecological land such as grassland mainly because the layout of the transportation network in wuhan has basically taken shape during this period so the increase of transportation land has slowed down but the external expansion of urbanization was still the dominant trend which was shown in the continuous growth of transportation industrial and mining land in towns and villages and the proportion of ecological land area constantly decreased 4 2 value of ecosystem services in wuhan slightly above the national average wuhan city is located in the mid latitude plain monsoonal paddy agricultural area the planting industry is dominated by rice from the wuhan statistical yearbook 2020 the crop sown area kg hm2 and crop unit area yield kg hm2 of wuhan city from 2015 to 2019 were obtained year by year the average selling price of crops yuan 50 kg was obtained according to the national compilation of information on costs and benefits of agricultural products the standard value of ecosystem services in wuhan city in 2018 was 2627 766 yuan hm2 compared with the national average the ecosystem biomass factor in hubei province is 1 27 after correction the final economic value amount was 3337 263 yuan hm2 in order to identify and characterize the es co occurrences in wuhan city we spatially mapped the value of first level ecosystem services respectively to gain insight into which ess were available at the same location the mapping results showed that provision and regulation services shared a similar spatial distribution pattern with higher values in water woodland and grassland fig 6 while support and cultural services were more similarly distributed with higher values on the han river and yangtze river ecotones that cross the city horizontally fig 7 the hotspot tool was used to analyze the spatial aggregation of high values of ecosystem service values in wuhan fig 8 the hotspot area with a large contiguous distribution was the east lake area on the east side of the city the area is also a key eco tourism scenic area the results of ecosystem service value assessment coincide with luo and zhang 2014 and zhang et al 2018 luo and zhang 2014 luo and zhang 2014 used the markov model to predict future ecosystem service value changes of land use in wuhan they found an increase in esv attributed to water and cultivated land in wuhan in our study the hotspot areas of esv also concentrated in water and cultivated land zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 adopted various models and multi source data to estimate ecosystem services in wuhan based on their results the spatial distribution of es showed an uneven pattern high values in the south and low values in the north with the urban fringe higher than the central city their findings are the same as our results 4 3 multi scenario simulation of territorial spatial pattern in wuhan city to contrast with the ecological scenarios a natural growth scenario of the future territorial spatial pattern of wuhan city was designed to be the baseline in the natural growth scenario the permanent basic farmland nature reserves and other statutory planning reserves were set to be constraints the basic driving factors promoting urban expansion were also included as seen in fig 9 the natural growth scenario in 2035 showed a severe expansion of production and living space rural settlements are scattered in large patches in contiguous cultivated land areas transportation and industrial and mining land occupy more ecological space in the city and the ples is out of balance comparing the ecological scenarios with the baseline scenario the differences in spatial characteristics were reflected in the effective restraint of the production and living space the reduction of the number of settlements around the urban center near the main traffic routes and in the agricultural space and the ecological space was better protected using spatial overlay to analyze the areas where the ecological scenarios were inconsistent with the baseline scenario it can be found that the inconsistent areas were mainly around the town space and the edges of the traffic routes fig 10 the projected areas of each land type in 2035 under the three scenarios are counted separately table 9 under the three scenarios the areas of grassland unused land and rural settlements are basically the same in contrast the ecological scenario has significantly more cultivated land woodland and water areas and smaller areas of urban construction land industrial and mining land and transportation land the regulation provision synergy scenario has a smaller area of cultivated land and a larger area of water reflecting the differences in the types of ecosystem services carried by different land types further accounting for the value of primary ecosystem services under the two scenarios table 10 we find that the total value of ecosystem services under the regulation provision synergy scenario was higher than those of the support cultural synergy scenario consistent with the objective of the scenario setting table 11 shows the carbon emissions of each land use type under the two ecological scenarios and the predicted total carbon emissions under the regulation provision synergy scenario are lower mainly because woodlands and watersheds absorb more co2 than other land use types in conclusion the ecological benefits are higher in wuhan under the regulation provision synergy scenario 5 conclusions this study constructed a conducive framework to release potential ecosystem benefits in optimizing the territorial spatial layout based on the characteristics of the regional natural environment we measured the value of ecosystem services and exploited the synergies and trade offs between different service types into future land use simulation furthermore we adopted production living ecological perspective to recognize space functions and analyzed the applied result in wuhan city which endowed our esv flus model with implication and value in practical management the main conclusions are as follows 1 from 2010 to 2018 the ples ratio in wuhan city remains basically stable the transformation mode is mainly from ecological space to production space the total value of ecosystem services in wuhan city in 2018 reached approximately 114 847 4 billion yuan using the equivalent factor accounting method the high value area of ecosystem service is in the eastern part of the city 2 without effective consideration of ecological constraints the urban living and production space of wuhan city in 2035 will be expanded in a transitional manner when provision and regulation services dominate the total value of ecosystem services is higher and the total carbon emission is smaller in the whole area it indicates that introducing ecosystem services into the flus model is conducive to improving the ecological benefits furthermore the optimization of the spatial pattern of land in the future can be achieved by strictly protecting ecological high value areas and releasing ecological low value areas in an orderly manner 3 based on our findings we provide four optimization paths path 1 is to protect key ecological space strictly path 2 is to orderly release low efficiency ecological space path 3 is to concentrate the layout of rural living space and path 4 is to concede agricultural production space appropriately our proposed esv flus model provides an effective tool to support sustainable land resource management and urban planning the value assessment and spatial mapping of ecosystem services explicitly demonstrate the characteristics of ecological resources in a specific region thus informing context specific ecological scenario settings the scenario simulation is then conducted to compare optimization alternatives under different ecological objective orientations in pursuit of the most significant ecological benefits simultaneously considering the socioeconomic and ecological drivers for wuhan city our results indicated the importance of cultivated land and water area for regional ecosystem management which has larger ecological benefits besides the production living ecological space simulation result in 2035 can derive recommendations for the comprehensive planning in wuhan which adopted the ples framework as the fundamental spatial guidance our future work will focus on a set of aspects firstly the es synergies and trade offs relationships could explore using a statistical method to construct more accurate scenario simulation constraints secondly we will further modify our settings of scenarios in order to provide more accurate results thirdly we will collect more data to refine our model finally we will explore other simulation models such as cellular automata and agent based models to gain more insights funding sources this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 42201471 beijing social science funds

24191,a modified version of the npzd ecosystem model is used to analytically examine the effects of predation avoidance a possible mechanism for triggering harmful algal blooms hab to resolve hab development caused by predation avoidance an additional phytoplankton functional group is considered one that has slower nutrient uptake and better predation avoidance characteristics than the non harmful phytoplankton group used in traditional npzd models because the two phytoplankton groups one non harmful and one hab compete for only one resource within the same system steady state equilibrium conditions cannot occur without the presence of zooplankton only the non harmful phytoplankton group which defeats the hab group in the resource competition can survive in the equilibrium the presence of sufficient zooplankton effectively acts to replenish the nutrient pool by consuming the non harmful phytoplankton when this occurs two equilibrium states are found one with both phytoplankton groups coexisting and one that only includes the hab group the condition required for equilibrium is that the total nitrogen within the system should be larger than a threshold determined by model coefficients the threshold and feasibility of the equilibrium are sensitive to the relative hab predation avoidance coefficient if the coefficient is larger than the ratio of net growth rates between the hab and non harmful phytoplankton group the threshold becomes infinite and an equilibrium is not feasible the time scale for the system to reach an equilibrium state that includes a hab group is determined asymptotically the dependence of a threshold condition as a controlling factor may explain the regime shift of dominant species causing habs the ecosystem model is fully implemented into the regional ocean modeling system and applied to an idealized coastal embayment with depths and geometry taken from san francisco bay to show numerically the dominance of prey avoidance dynamics in a natural shallow water environment that includes advection and diffusion the analytical results improve strategies for hab modeling and provide guidance for setting model coefficients necessary to resolve a hab event data availability the modified npzd ecosystem model fully coupled with roms in this study is available at https github com jang geun roms nppzd psi 1 introduction harmful algal blooms habs usually referred to as red tides are excessive blooms of mono phytoplanktonic species that can significantly increase fish mortality and cause large economic loss to fisheries aquaculture industries and touristic activities by assimilating toxins and consuming all dissolved oxygen jin et al 2008 park et al 2013 recently habs have occurred more frequently due to trends in global warming and increased anthropogenic nutrient input to aquatic systems padmakumar et al 2012 lee et al 2013 griffith and gobler 2020 although many research directions have been pursued to better understand their dynamics collectively they show that habs are one of the most complex coastal ecosystem processes that links biogeochemical and hydrodynamical characteristics of the ambient environment he et al 2008 lee 2008 li et al 2009 kim et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 baek et al 2020 modeling approaches are frequently used as powerful tools to resolve the complexity of habs in many laboratory culturing experiments single equation models are simply regressed against measured culturing results lee et al 2001 cho and cho 2014 lim et al 2014 shankar et al 2014 adding to the complexity interactions between hab groups and other phytoplankton groups including diatoms are common and can result in a wide variety of outcomes kwon et al 2014 lim et al 2014 oh et al 2015 several studies experimentally show that the presence of other phytoplankton groups e g typical non harmful diatoms inhibits the growth of several hab groups mitra and flynn 2006 lim et al 2014 furthermore nutrient uptake ability by the hab group estimated by laboratory experiments implies that the hab group is defeated by the diatoms in the resource competition eppley et al 1969 lee et al 2001 kudela et al 2010 cho and cho 2014 oh et al 2015 and thus plays a primal role in suppressing growth of one phytoplankton group relative to the other tilman 1977 various mechanisms have been suggested to explain how the hab group can bloom including mixotrophic behavior jeong et al 1999 2004 swimming ability lim et al 2014 jeong et al 2017 allelopathy effects fistarol et al 2004 tang and gobler 2010 lim et al 2014 multi resource competition glibert and burkholder 2011 zhou et al 2017 and prey avoidance solé et al 2006 mitra and flynn 2006 flynn 2008 harvey and menden deuer 2011 and 2012 the key mechanism triggering a hab differs by species but here we focus on details of population dynamics in prey avoidance mitra and flynn 2006 developed a simple ecosystem model that consists of two phytoplankton groups one hab and one non hab one nutrient and one zooplankton species their model considered allelopathy prey switching and prey rejection of the hab group and through sensitivity experiments concluded that prey rejection plays the most important role in the formation of habs however mitra and flynn 2006 did not discuss population dynamics of the prey avoidance in addition models designed to reconstruct laboratory experiments are difficult to extrapolate to the field although previous studies including mitra and flynn 2006 explicitly consider the interactions between habs and the ambient system using models most analyses are focused on how well numerical solutions reproduce the observations analytical studies for the system of governing equations are generally not considered even though the ecosystem dynamics are determined by the equations it would be expected that turbulence and the margalef framework would play an important structuring role in the ecosystem model for pelagic environments margalef 1978 cullen et al 2002 however the purpose of this study is to examine the dynamics of prey avoidance that are not resolved by the margalef framework and applicable to well mixed shallow coastal environments where the water depths are similar in scale to or shallower than pelagic mixed layer depths and the euphotic layer based on the margalef framework coastal environments with high turbulence due to tidal mixing and high nutrient concentration are expected to favor diatom dominance yet many observations show that non diatom habs occur in these shallow eutrophic environments wilkerson et al 2006 anderson 2009 lee et al 2013 kang et al 2015 this implies the presence of dynamics not resolved by the margalef framework with prey avoidance as a likely candidate mitra and flynn 2006 harvey and menden deuer 2012 kang et al 2015 our initial model development without consideration of prey avoidance mechanisms not shown herein simulated dominant diatoms consistent with not only the margalef framework but also with the tilman framework tilman 1977 diatoms having better nutrient uptake ability to defeat hab groups in resource competition in the work presented here we focus on the population dynamics caused by prey avoidance rather than the interaction between phytoplankton growth and turbulence in this work we conduct an analytical analysis of a modified nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton detritus npzd model that includes a harmful phytoplankton group to study population dynamics of prey avoidance it should be noted that the model in this study describes the hab group as a phytoplankton functional group having better predation avoidance in the ecosystem limited by one resource nitrogen and thus is designed to highlight the prey avoidance mechanism of the hab group in its present form the model does not consider habs triggered by unresolved mechanisms e g multi resource competition or mixotrophic behavior so cannot be globally applied to habs problems to discuss the dynamics governed by prey predation interaction between components of the ecosystem no physical transport is considered and steady state is assumed in the analytical development the steady state solutions equilibriums of the modified npzd model under these assumptions are found and stability conditions for each equilibrium state are discussed to determine when the hab group can be sustained in the ecosystem without extinction details of the resource competition between two different phytoplankton groups and top down control mechanisms through prey avoidance are examined and discussed in addition the modified npzd system is fully coupled with a numerical hydrodynamic model where all terms in the general ecological physical coupled model are retained without the assumptions in the analytical development and thus temporal rate of change and all transport processes advection mixing and sinking of detritus for ecological variables are considered using the fully coupled model idealized experiments describing hab development in an idealized coastal embayment with depths and geometry taken from san francisco bay are compared with equilibrium states predicted by the theory 2 method 2 1 ecosystem models in the following the npzd system is used as the basis of the marine ecosystem model the npzd model consists of four variables nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton and detritus and describes the basic cycle of mass nitrogen in the marine ecosystem nutrient is taken up by phytoplankton phytoplankton are grazed by zooplankton the plankton become detritus through mortality and detritus is remineralized although there are more sophisticated models the simple and widely used npzd model contains sufficient complexity to describe many realistic marine ecosystems onitsuka et al 2007 xu et al 2008 perruche et al 2010 priester et al 2017 cruz rico and rivas 2018 furthermore the npzd system has been theoretically scrutinized busenberg et al 1990 edwards 2001 heinle and slawig 2013a and 2013b which are revisited and further discussed in section 3 1 and can be easily modified and expanded to resolve additional ecological dynamics newberger et al 2003 lima and doney 2004 koné et al 2005 fennel et al 2006 kishi et al 2007 fiechter et al 2009 governing equations for the npzd system are slightly different in each study equations suggested by powell et al 2006 are used in this study because their model is coupled with the publicly available regional ocean modeling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 and easily accessible to resolve the resource competition and different predation pressure between two specific phytoplankton groups we include one additional phytoplankton group representing the harmful phytoplankton hab group the purpose is to analytically examine population dynamics of the prey avoidance in the npzd system by developing an optimal model with enough complexity to resolve prey avoidance in the npzd system but simple enough to be studied by analytical approaches the governing equations of our modified npzd system including a hab group are given by 1 d n d t δ d γ g z u 1 p 1 u 2 p 2 d p 1 d t u 1 p 1 1 π g z σ 1 p 1 d p 2 d t u 2 p 2 π g z σ 2 p 2 d z d t 1 γ g z ξ z d d d t w d d z σ 1 p 1 σ 2 p 2 ξ z δ d where t is time and n p 1 p 2 z and d indicate nutrient normal non harmful phytoplankton hab group zooplankton and detritus concentrations respectively u 1 u 2 g and π are growth rates of each phytoplankton group the zooplankton grazing and predation probability function respectively and defined as u n n v n n n k n α n i v n 2 α n i 2 g p 1 p 2 r m 1 e λ p 1 ψ p 2 π p 1 p 2 ψ p 2 p 1 ψ p 2 where subscript n takes on values of 1 or 2 the concept of a predation probability function and grazing term is described in fennel and neumann 2004 but modified here to consider the different predation pressure induced by each phytoplankton group post et al 2000 koné et al 2005 oguz et al 2016 the other variables are constant model coefficients with values given in table 1 the coefficients shared with traditional npzd models are the default values powell et al 2006 fiechter et al 2009 key differences between the traditional npzd model and the modified npzd model in this study include the ability to resolve two different phytoplankton groups and the effects of different predation avoidance ability in the modified npzd model two phytoplankton functional groups are considered the hab group is defined as the phytoplankton having worse nutrient uptake ability and better predation avoidance ability than the other non harmful phytoplankton group the model is designed to elucidate the dynamics of top down control of specific habs triggered by predation avoidance the maximum growth rate of p 2 is chosen as a reasonable value that describes slower nutrient uptake kinetics than that for p 1 v 2 v 1 table 1 in this study the mass transfer between each state variable is defined by nitrogen and thus the model describes the nitrogen cycle of the ecosystem with the units of the variables and half saturation coefficients given in moles of nitrogen μ m n the parameter ψ is a non dimensional number that defines the p 2 predation avoidance ability relative to that of p 1 when ψ 1 the zooplankton group prefers to consume p 1 better predation avoidance of p 2 than p 1 whereas ψ 1 indicates more p 2 preference than p 1 for ψ 1 the zooplankton group has no preference for either phytoplankton group because both groups have identical predation avoidance the sensitivity of the system on given ψ values is discussed in section 3 2 2 fig 1 depicts a schematic of the modified npzd ecosystem model showing the various nitrogen cycling processes including uptake of nutrients by phytoplankton grazing by zooplankton excretion of nutrients from phytoplankton mortality of phytoplankton and zooplankton and remineralization of detritus this model can be considered as a nppzd type having two different phytoplankton functional groups p 1 and p 2 characteristics of each phytoplankton group are identical to those used by mitra and flynn 2006 where p 1 has better nutrient uptake ability represented by v 2 v 1 but p 2 has better predation avoidance ψ 1 2 2 equilibrium points steady state solutions ignoring left hand side terms of system 1 are frequently used to analyze characteristics and dynamics of ecosystem models tilman 1977 newberger et al 2003 perruche et al 2010 heinle and slawig 2013a and b although the system 1 is nonlinear steady state solutions are easily obtained negative or imaginary solutions are non physical and not discussed further because system 1 is closed and conserves mass the five equations in 1 with steady state are undetermined the last equation needed to reach a solution can be obtained by summing all equations in 1 that yields d n p 1 p 2 z d d t 0 and can be written as n p 1 p 2 z d n t where n t indicates the total nitrogen concentration determined by the sum of all the state variable in initial conditions the steady state solutions are expressed as a function of model coefficients table 1 and n t to represent the state of the system state variables are denoted as a vector e m n m p 1 m p 2 m z m d m similar to heinle and slawig 2013a where superscript m represents the index of each steady state solution the stability condition for each steady state solution can also be found for any given initial condition that progresses toward a stable solution the stability condition will determine the feasibility of that stable solution the stability condition can be determined by linearization of the ordinary differential equation system heinle and slawig 2013a here we focus on the ecological consequences of the stability condition similar to busenberg et al 1990 it must be noted that system 1 does not always converge toward a steady state solution when total nitrogen in the system is sufficiently high the steady state solution changes from a stable focal point towards a neutral stability point where the state of the system oscillates around the steady state solution busenberg et al 1990 however the steady state solution for a neutral stability point attracts the system away from other unstable solutions and remains close to the center of oscillation in this study the steady state solution for a neutral stability point is not discussed further and the focus is on the transition of stable steady states from one solution to another useful for determining the conditions that result in the presence or absence of a phytoplankton functional group 2 3 numerical experiments 2 3 1 cross verification using ordinary differential equation solvers the equilibriums of the system 1 are cross verified by numerical solutions based on ordinary differential equation solvers provided by matlab the temporal change terms on the left hand side of 1 are retained in the numerical solutions system 1 with different ψ and n t is solved and compared to the theoretical equilibrium it is worth noting that careful choice of the solver numerical scheme and accurate error tolerances are required to obtain a proper numerical solution for highly eutrophic conditions high n t which result in stiff nonlinear oscillations otherwise the solvers blow up or reach an equilibrium that disagrees with the theoretical equilibrium appendix a herein we use the ode45 solver with both relative and absolute error tolerances set to 10 10 the ode23t not shown herein generates identical results with ode45 2 3 2 idealized experiments using ecosystem model fully coupled with hydrodynamics model to test the theory in a more realistic ecosystem influenced by transport mechanisms we fully couple system 1 with roms and then conduct idealized numerical experiments physical transport of ecological variables and detritus sinking are considered in the numerical experiments so both advection and diffusion terms are also considered in the fully coupled model the model domain for the idealized experiments is chosen based on heterosigma akashiwo blooms in san francisco bay that are expected to be triggered by a prey avoidance mechanism harvey and menden deuer 2011 however it must be noted that the purpose of the idealized experiments is not to accurately simulate habs of san francisco bay but instead to test dominance of the dynamics elucidated by the equilibriums of system 1 in a more realistic coastal environment that includes physical transport and sinking detritus the model is designed based on topography from the etopo2 dataset fig 2 with 10 vertical sigma levels and 500 m lateral spatial resolution for simplicity the predominant tide is assumed in the shallow coastal environment and thus the model is forced only by tides obtained from the tpxo9 atlas tidal dataset available at https www tpxo net global tpxo9 atlas without consideration of wind stress and river discharge for the mixing vertical diffusion is resolved by the mellor yamada turbulence closure scheme without lateral diffusion mellor and yamada 1982 the high order spatial interpolation at the middle temporal level hsimt wu and zhu 2010 scheme is chosen to handle advection of tracers although this simple model configuration is not expected to simulate the circulation of the real ocean we presume that it is sufficiently complex to resolve plausible effects of circulation and mixing of general tide dominated shallow coastal environments on ecological variables for the ecological model configuration the modified npzd model is initiated by constant concentration of state variables inside of the bay fig 2 all ecological variables are set to 0 1 μ m n except for nutrient concentrations that are set to 1 4 and 16 μ m n to assess sensitivity to n t the concentration of all variables in the offshore region is set to 0 μ m n for simplicity the ecological model coefficients listed in table 1 are used and the light intensity is fixed to 158 w m 2 identical with powell et al 2006 in roms the biological sediment option is turned on which describes sediment remineralization processes and returns nitrogen from the detritus reaching the bottom boundary to the nutrient pool without loss e g denitrification and permanent sedimentation to examine the role of physical transport passive tracers are distributed with identical initial conditions as the ecological tracers the concentration of the passive tracers on the inner shelf is defined as one 3 theory 3 1 shared solutions with npzd system p 2 0 because system 1 converges to the general npzd model when p 2 0 steady state solutions of the general npzd model are also considered as one of the possible solutions in this section equilibriums of the general npzd model are revisited to highlight the transition of stable solutions given as total nitrogen levels and the role of zooplankton in the eutrophic range the first solution of the general npzd system requires that all nitrogen in the system exists in nutrient form and all the other state variables are zero so e 1 n 1 0 0 0 0 where n 1 n t this solution occurs when the initial concentration of phytoplankton groups is zero or when nutrient concentrations are not enough to sustain the phytoplankton group u 1 n t σ 1 which can be written as 2 n t u 1 1 σ 1 σ 1 k 1 v 1 σ 1 where u n 1 σ n indicates the nutrient concentration that makes the growth rate of the phytoplankton balanced by the mortality rate in other words the minimum nutrient concentration needed for the phytoplankton group to be sustained a second solution occurs when the zooplankton group does not exist such that e 2 n 2 p 1 2 0 0 d 2 the components of the second equilibrium e 2 are given as n 2 u 1 1 σ 1 p 1 2 δ δ σ 1 n t u 1 1 σ 1 d 2 σ 1 δ σ 1 n t u 1 1 σ 1 this solution is feasible both when zooplankton initially do not exist or when nutrient concentrations are high enough to sustain the phytoplankton but the phytoplankton concentration itself is not enough to maintain a viable zooplankton population such that σ 1 u 1 n t and 1 γ g p 1 2 0 ξ this condition can be written as 3 u 1 1 σ 1 n t u 1 1 σ 1 δ σ 1 δ p 1 3 where p 1 3 indicates the minimum phytoplankton concentration needed to sustain zooplankton and corresponds to the phytoplankton concentration that results in a balance between growth and mortality of the zooplankton and is defined as p 1 3 g 1 ξ 1 γ 1 λ ln 1 ξ r m 1 γ 1 when the steady state phytoplankton concentration is enough to sustain zooplankton or equivalently the total nitrogen concentration is high enough to sustain both phytoplankton and zooplankton a third steady state solution e 3 n 3 p 1 3 0 z 3 d 3 exists with all non zero state variables except for p 2 components of e 3 are determined by n 3 2 k 1 v 1 p 1 3 1 γ 1 ξ 1 δ p 1 3 1 σ 1 ξ 1 γ σ 1 δ γ n t n 3 p 1 3 1 σ 1 ξ 1 γ σ 1 δ γ n t k 1 0 z 3 1 γ ξ u 1 n 3 σ 1 p 1 3 d 3 1 δ 1 γ u 1 n 3 γ σ 1 p 1 3 it is worth noting that the quadratic equation for n 3 has two solutions but one is negative and non physical p 1 3 is independent of n t and determined by coefficients related to the zooplankton all other state variables are dependent on n t the condition that allows the zooplankton group to be present is 1 γ g p 1 2 0 ξ and can be written as 4 u 1 1 σ 1 δ δ σ 1 p 1 3 n t fig 3 shows components of the steady state solution to the general npzd system varying with n t that is feasible steady state solutions are transited from e 1 to e 2 and e 2 to e 3 whenever n t becomes higher than the threshold conditions 3 and 4 for e 3 all state variables except for phytoplankton increase with increasing n t when n t is sufficiently high nutrient concentration n 3 linearly increases whereas z 3 and d 3 are saturated and converge to constant values fig 3 the solutions z 3 and d 3 are monod functions with non zero intercept the slope of n 3 and saturated concentration of z 3 and d 3 can be analytically determined as n t gets large and are given in the limit by lim n t n 3 n t 1 lim n t z 3 1 γ ξ v m σ p 1 3 lim n t d 3 1 δ 1 γ v m γ σ p 1 3 consequently in the eutrophic limit nutrient concentration converges to a linear polynomial function with slope one and all the other state variables become constant this implies that once the system is sufficiently eutrophic additional nitrogen will not influence the steady state values of phytoplankton zooplankton and detritus any additional nitrogen is stored in nutrient pools the steady state solutions of the general npzd system with only one functional phytoplankton group were well discussed by heinle and slawig 2013a the governing equations of npzd system used by heinle and slawig 2013a were different than those used in this study in their model mortality of zooplankton increased nutrient concentration and the inefficiency of zooplankton grazing increased detritus the opposite occurs in our work where zooplankton mortality increases detritus and the inefficiency of grazing increases nutrient concentration regardless qualitative characteristics of steady state solutions are the same because detritus acts as an intermediate state between mortality and remineralization in the closed system and the presence of a zooplankton group intrinsically plays a role in pumping nitrogen from the phytoplankton pool to the nutrient pool 3 2 hab group presence solutions p 2 0 3 2 1 resource competition between two phytoplankton groups without zooplankton z 0 the presence of a hab group p 2 0 induces additional steady state solutions however it is worth noting first that steady state solutions do not exist for situations where p 1 and p 2 coexist without zooplankton z 0 this is because system 1 represents two different phytoplankton groups that compete for only one resource tilman 1977 that is when p 1 0 p 2 0 and z 0 each governing equation for the phytoplankton groups drives two different steady state nutrient concentrations u 1 1 σ 1 and u 2 1 σ 2 and thus has no solution as a result the phytoplankton group that can survive under conditions with lower nutrient concentration i e lower u n 1 σ n defeats the other phytoplankton group the winner of the resource competition is p 1 because of its higher maximum growth rate that contributes to u 1 1 σ 1 u 2 1 σ 2 there does exist a steady state solution e 4 n 4 0 p 2 4 0 d 4 for which components are given by n 4 u 2 1 σ 2 p 2 4 δ δ σ 2 n t u 2 1 σ 2 d 4 σ 1 δ σ 2 n t u 2 1 σ 2 however e 4 is sustained by the defeated functional group and represents an unstable saddle point van opheusden et al 2015 the presence of p 1 rapidly moves the state of the system from solution e 4 to e 2 as the state of the system approaches solution e 2 p 2 converges to zero because the growth rate of p 2 around e 2 is less than the mortality u 2 n 2 σ 2 equivalent to u 1 1 σ 1 u 2 1 σ 2 in other words for the solution e 4 to become viable the initial concentration of p 1 must be strictly zero otherwise the presence of a minute amount of p 1 moves the state of the system from solution e 4 to e 2 this result is in agreement with many laboratory experiments mitra and flynn 2006 lim et al 2014 oh et al 2015 sukenik and kaplan 2021 and indicates that the model system 1 in this study incorporates resource competition dynamics between normal phytoplankton and a hab group however this resource competition does not explain how a hab group can bloom in the system because p 1 represents non harmful phytoplankton that are ubiquitous and not likely to be absent in the natural ocean 3 2 2 equilibrium with p 2 0 as mentioned above p 2 cannot exist when zooplankton do not exist because nutrient concentration in the stable steady state solution contributes to negative net growth rate of the hab group however the presence of zooplankton increases the nutrient concentration as total nitrogen level in the system increases fig 3 once nutrient concentration increased by zooplankton is sufficient to cause larger growth rates than the sum of sink terms including mortality and predation rate a steady state solution with non zero p 2 e 5 n 5 p 1 5 p 2 5 z 5 d 5 is feasible the components of solution e 5 are determined by u 2 n 5 σ 2 ψ u 1 n 5 σ 1 z 5 1 γ ξ u 1 n 5 σ 1 p 1 3 p 1 5 ψ δ n t n 5 z 5 ξ z 5 σ 2 δ p 1 3 ψ σ 1 δ σ 2 δ p 2 5 δ n t n 5 z 5 ξ z 5 σ 2 δ p 1 3 σ 1 δ ψ σ 2 δ d 5 n t n 5 p 1 5 p 2 5 z 5 it is worth noting that the first equation above for nutrient concentration can be rewritten in quadratic form with one of the two solutions non physical similar to e 3 the condition necessary for e 5 is u 2 n 3 σ 2 ψ p 1 3 g z 3 which can be rewritten as u 2 n 3 σ 2 ψ u 1 n 3 σ 1 and n 3 n 5 the second form of the condition shows that net growth of p 2 should be larger than that of p 1 weighted by ψ when p 2 cannot gain sufficient advantage from prey avoidance sufficiently small ψ e 5 is unconditionally not possible therefore the coefficient ψ should be sufficiently small for the model to trigger habs the maximum ψ which can reach equilibrium with p 2 is also analytically determinable the former form for the stable condition becomes v 2 σ 2 ψ v 1 σ 1 in the eutrophic limit where n t and n 3 so v 2 σ 2 v 1 σ 1 ψ is required because n 3 is a function of n t and n 5 is a constant determined by coefficients v n k n and ψ the condition necessary for e 5 n 3 n 5 can be rewritten again as 5 n 3 1 n 5 n t showing that n t must be larger than a threshold determined by coefficients explicit form of the thresholds is given in appendix b if ψ v 2 σ 2 v 1 σ 1 conditions for e 5 can never be satisfied even if n t when ψ 0 indicating that p 2 is not subject to predation the complexity of the governing equations 1 is significantly reduced because π becomes zero and the steady state solution e 5 is also simplified fig 4 shows the steady state concentration of each state variable expressed as a function of n t with ψ 0 and ψ 0 075 v 2 σ 2 v 1 σ 1 it is worth noting that solutions of the general npzd system occur when n t is less than n 3 1 n 5 once ψ 0 and n t is larger than n 3 1 n 5 p 2 and d linearly increase with n t and the other state variables become independent of n t upper panel of fig 4 in this case the dynamics described by the system are straightforward p 2 that are not consumed by zooplankton take up surplus nutrients converted from p 1 by the zooplankton when ψ is sufficiently small and positive so that condition 5 is satisfied p 2 increases as n t increases similar to the case where ψ 0 however at the same time p 1 slowly decreases lower panel of fig 4 eventually once n t is high enough a steady state solution occurs without p 1 e 6 n 6 0 p 2 6 z 6 d 6 the components of e 6 are given as p 2 6 1 ψ λ ln 1 ξ r m 1 γ 1 n 6 2 k 2 v 2 p 2 6 1 γ 1 ξ 1 δ p 2 6 1 σ 2 ξ 1 γ σ 2 δ γ n t n 6 p 2 6 1 σ 2 ξ 1 γ σ 2 δ γ n t k 2 0 z 6 1 γ ξ u 2 n 6 σ 2 p 2 6 d 6 1 δ 1 γ u 2 n 6 γ σ 2 p 2 6 e 6 has identical mathematical characteristics as e 3 z 6 and d 6 depend on n t but are saturated and converge to constant values in the eutrophic limit on the other hand n 6 linearly increases with n t in the limit the condition necessary for e 6 is the absence of p 1 which occurs when the growth rate of p 1 is less than the sum of sink terms u 1 n 6 σ 1 1 p 1 3 g z 6 where ψ p 2 6 p 1 3 this condition similar to condition 5 is given by ψ u 1 n 6 σ 1 u 2 n 6 σ 2 and n 5 n 6 which can be written as 6 n 6 1 n 5 n t this steady state solution shows that p 1 cannot survive in environments where p 2 sustains a large enough zooplankton group it is interesting that both p 1 and p 2 coexist in the eutrophic limit if p 2 is not subject to predation conversely p 1 is not sustained when predation for p 2 is allowed this implies that the niche of a functional group must be provided and present within the functional group when p 2 is not consumed by zooplankton p 1 has a unique niche that sustains a zooplankton group that is required by p 2 however once p 2 is available as prey for the zooplankton group p 2 itself can sustain a zooplankton group even without p 1 as a consequence the role of p 1 in sustaining a zooplankton group is replaced by p 2 in the eutrophic limit the predation avoidance coefficient ψ plays a crucial role in the behavior of the equilibrium when p 2 0 fig 4 fig 5 shows the sensitivity of analytically determining thresholds of e 5 and e 6 expressed as function of ψ if p 2 is not subject to predation ψ 0 the threshold of e 5 given by n 3 1 n 5 becomes minimum on the other hand the threshold of e 6 given by n 6 1 n 5 increases infinitely as ψ 0 and thus e 6 cannot be feasible if ψ 0 as before p 1 is necessary to sustain the zooplankton group that is required by p 2 when ψ 0 as ψ increases n 3 1 n 5 increases and the steady state concentration of p 2 decreases because the predation for p 2 is allowed and acts as a sink of p 2 at the same time n 6 1 n 5 decreases because p 2 itself can efficiently sustain zooplankton irrespective of p 1 there is another singularity at ψ v 2 σ 2 v 1 σ 1 where both n 3 1 n 5 and n 6 1 n 5 become infinite in this situation predation for p 2 is too intense and p 2 cannot gain an advantage as the functional group with better predation avoidance as a result p 2 does not exist and only e 3 becomes feasible 4 discussion 4 1 numerical solutions using ordinary differential equation solver and time scale for p 2 bloom fig 6 shows numerical solutions obtained by matlab s ordinary differential equation solver ode45 for different ψ and n t the title in each subplot shows the analytically determined condition of the system when n t is less than n 3 1 n 5 numerical solutions show that p 2 cannot be sustained in the system and converges to zero whereas p 2 converges to a non zero constant when condition 5 is satisfied fig 6 similarly p 1 exponentially decreases and converges to zero when condition 6 is satisfied fig 6 when ψ 0 p 2 always coexists with p 1 on the other hand p 2 is never sustained by the system when v 2 σ 2 v 1 σ 2 ψ regardless of n t the sensitivity of the numerical solution on ψ and n t matches the theoretical stability condition for equilibriums discussed in section 3 the numerical solutions also show several features that are not resolved by the equilibrium theory biogeochemical oscillations and temporal transitions between equilibriums as mentioned above equilibriums change from a stable focal point to a neutral stability point when the system is sufficiently eutrophic the oscillations become stiffer as n t increases which cause the system to adjust to the wrong equilibrium that disagrees with the steady state solution appendix a several experiments clearly show that the system is initially attracted by e 3 and then slowly moves to equilibriums that include a hab group e 5 or e 6 during the initial phase of transition from e 3 to the other equilibriums that include p 2 with concentration negligible at this stage the growth rate of p 2 is asymptotically given as 7 p 2 t u 2 n 3 ψ p 1 3 g z 3 σ 2 p 2 which indicates exponential growth of p 2 and the net growth rate of u 2 n 3 ψ p 1 3 g z 3 σ 2 the reciprocal of the rate given in 7 yields a time scale for the p 2 bloom as mentioned in section 3 2 2 the growth rate should be positive for the system to be attracted by e 5 and the positivity condition for the growth rate can be written as n 3 1 n 5 n t therefore the growth rate converges to zero as n t approaches the threshold so the transition from e 3 to the equilibriums including p 2 can be slow when n t is close to the threshold fig 7 shows good correlation between the numerical and theoretical time scales of the p 2 bloom the numerical time scales are subjectively defined from fig 6 and marked as dashed lines the theoretical time scales are defined as the reciprocal of the growth rate of p 2 in eq 7 4 2 sensitivity experiments using fully coupled ecosystem model with hydrodynamics model fig 8 shows results from the idealized experiments that use the fully coupled ecosystem model with roms initiated from nutrient concentration n 1 4 and 16 μ m n the theoretical stability condition for equilibrium predicts that the experiment using n 1 μ m n upper panels of fig 8 simulates e 3 where p 1 wins n 4 μ m n middle panels of fig 8 simulates e 5 where both p 1 and p 2 coexist and n 16 μ m n lower panels of fig 8 simulates e 6 where p 2 wins these results match the numerical simulation results even though the theory does not consider temporal changes of ecological variables physical transport and sinking detritus fig 9 shows that the concentration of each simulated phytoplankton group is in good agreement with the analytically predicted phytoplankton concentration red lines in fig 9 based on the simulated total nitrogen and the steady state solutions found in previous sections fig 10 shows the surface passive tracer and total nitrogen concentration which have different initial values of each simulation after 90 days the distribution of total nitrogen concentration is almost identical to that of a passive tracer that is transported by purely ocean currents and mixed without influence from the biogeochemical processes considered in the ecosystem model this suggests that total nitrogen is predominantly determined by the physical transport in the coastal and bay regions which in this case is determined by the tides the passive tracer concentration in the shallow marginal region of the inner bay is almost identical to the initial condition of the tracer implying a long residence time on the other hand the tracer concentration away from the margins of the inner bay is considerably reduced and transported to the offshore region indicating a much shorter residence time there similarly total nitrogen concentration is nearly the same as the initial condition in the shallow margins of the bay yellowish markers in fig 9 but reduced in regions toward the inlet and coast owing to rapid transport seaward blueish markers in fig 9 therefore the shallow margins maintain enough total nitrogen to exceed the thresholds for hab group presence but the other regions away from the margin cannot figs 8 and 9 this behavior of the fully coupled model matches well with the conceptual model proposed by smayda 2008 consequently physical transport in the shallow tide dominated coastal bay plays a strong role in determining total nitrogen concentration fig 8 after which the response of the ecosystem in terms of phytoplankton concentration of each group fig 9 follows the dynamics described by the equilibriums of the model it is worth noting that the idealized experiments are simplified and several physical dynamics that occur in real coastal systems are not resolved e g temporal changes of light intensity subtidal forcing wind driven circulations river discharges however the experiments imply that the dynamics described by the equilibriums can be dominant in complex semi closed coastal regions with predominant tidal currents and can be valid when the time scale of the p 2 bloom is shorter than the other unresolved processes recently the importance of resource competition and prey avoidance in hab dynamics has been suggested by many studies in particular prey avoidance is pointed out as a key hab mechanism for heterosigma akashiwo blooms and also for other cases such as isochrysis galbana mitra and flynn 2006 and aureoumbra lagunensis kang et al 2015 blooms where the dynamics discussed in this study and the fully coupled model are applicable the systematic mathematical population dynamics of resource competition was analytically examined by tilman 1977 and is providing surprising insight to problems involving resource competition and coexistence although previous field and laboratory studies suggested that prey avoidance can be key mechanism in many habs cases mitra and flynn 2006 harvey and menden deuer 2011 and 2012 kang et al 2015 the population dynamics of prey avoidance was not analytically resolved here the analytical development suggests that the system must be sufficiently eutrophic enough total nitrogen in the system to exceed a threshold for habs to be triggered by prey avoidance this finding supports modern conceptual models for habs that show a positive relation between eutrophication and habs smayda 2008 gilbert and burkholder 2011 and 2018 griffith and gobler 2020 the numerical experiments using the fully coupled model demonstrate that the dynamics discussed by the equilibriums is predominant for a realistic coastal environment governed by strong tides the relationship between residence time and habs resolved here matches well with conceptual models for habs smayda 2008 the feasible steady state solutions are transitioned from one to another whenever total nitrogen level n t in the system is higher than the thresholds determined by model coefficients figs 4 and 6 if the ecosystem is not sufficiently eutrophic to sustain enough zooplankton n t n 3 1 n 5 the predation of zooplankton is not considerable and steady state solutions shared with the traditional npzd model without a hab group i e p 2 0 appear as a consequence of resource competition with the non harmful phytoplankton defeating the hab group when the ecosystem is sufficiently eutrophic to sustain a large enough zooplankton group n 3 1 n 5 n t n 6 1 n 3 zooplankton can sufficiently pump nitrogen from the non harmful phytoplankton to the nutrient pool and an equilibrium condition is satisfied resulting in two coexisting phytoplankton groups e 5 when the ecosystem is excessively eutrophic and a large zooplankton group can be sustained by the hab group n 6 1 n 3 n t the hab group itself can sustain the zooplankton group without p 1 and the predation pressure for p 1 becomes too intense resulting in a steady state solution without normal phytoplankton e 6 the feasibility of steady state solutions resulting in habs is sensitive to the relative hab group predation avoidance parameter ψ fig 5 when ψ 0 a steady state solution in which the hab group outperforms the non harmful phytoplankton group is not feasible because the hab group cannot sustain the zooplankton group as ψ increases the threshold for the solution without non harmful phytoplankton decreases because the hab group efficiently sustains the zooplankton yet the steady state concentration of the hab group also decreases with increasing predation when ψ v 2 σ 2 v 1 σ 1 both equilibrium conditions supporting hab growth are not feasible because the hab group cannot gain an advantage through better predation avoidance the time scale for the system to move from equilibrium without p 2 to that with p 1 is asymptotically determined and is in good agreement with numerical solutions 5 conclusion in this study a modified npzd system that highlights different predation pressure for two phytoplankton functional groups one harmful and one non harmful is described and the possible steady state solutions are discussed analytical solutions show theoretically that increased nitrogen levels from anthropogenic nutrient loading can alter the coastal ecosystem from conditions that cannot trigger habs to conditions that can that is steady state solutions move from one equilibrium state to another the thresholds may explain the dynamics of regime shift which alter the dominant species in an ecosystem by favoring the hab group steady state solutions to the coupled ecosystem model reveal details of the top down control dynamics results show that 1 habs can be suppressed because of resource competition with non harmful phytoplankton and 2 habs having better predation avoidance can be triggered when total nitrogen exceeds a threshold by using nutrients pumped by zooplankton from non harmful phytoplankton pools we expect that the population dynamics of the prey avoidance elucidated by this study e g presence of total nitrogen thresholds for hab groups having better prey avoidance to overcome defeat in resource competition can provide insight to better understand field observations laboratory experiments and numerical models the analytical study describes population dynamics between two primal producers that compete for one resource and are influenced by different predation pressure from one zooplankton group the dynamics are applicable to not only the habs problem but also any other system with top down control the structure of the model different phytoplankton groups influenced by different predation pressure from one zooplankton group has frequently been included in various complex ecosystem models however the role of the dynamics in the ecosystem and the sensitivity of the parameters controlling relative predation pressure were not considered this study shows how the different predation pressures on each phytoplankton group change the population of each group what conditions are required for the plankton group impacted less by predation to be sustained in the ecosystem and how the ecosystem is influenced by changes to parameters controlling relative predation pressure credit authorship

the numerical solution using n t 32 4 μ m n and ψ 0 15 satisfies condition 6 where p 1 cannot survive in this case equilibrium is not a stable focal point but rather a neutral stability point which causes a stiff biogeochemical oscillation centered on e 6 where there is no p 1 however numerical solutions show different results which depend on the choice of solvers and error tolerances fig a1 we presumed that the solutions that do not sustain p 1 are correct results because theoretically the system must be attracted by e 6 where there is no p 1 and solutions having better accuracy smaller error tolerance simulate oscillations without p 2 this result shows that the wrong equilibrium can be reached by the numerical solutions when using low accuracy the modified npzd model fully coupled with roms uses a scheme consistent with other ecosystem models already implemented in roms a first order explicit euler scheme for the processes that increase concentration of state variables and an implicit euler scheme for the processes that decrease the concentration however it must be noted that this scheme may not be sufficiently accurate to properly simulate highly eutrophic environments

24191,a modified version of the npzd ecosystem model is used to analytically examine the effects of predation avoidance a possible mechanism for triggering harmful algal blooms hab to resolve hab development caused by predation avoidance an additional phytoplankton functional group is considered one that has slower nutrient uptake and better predation avoidance characteristics than the non harmful phytoplankton group used in traditional npzd models because the two phytoplankton groups one non harmful and one hab compete for only one resource within the same system steady state equilibrium conditions cannot occur without the presence of zooplankton only the non harmful phytoplankton group which defeats the hab group in the resource competition can survive in the equilibrium the presence of sufficient zooplankton effectively acts to replenish the nutrient pool by consuming the non harmful phytoplankton when this occurs two equilibrium states are found one with both phytoplankton groups coexisting and one that only includes the hab group the condition required for equilibrium is that the total nitrogen within the system should be larger than a threshold determined by model coefficients the threshold and feasibility of the equilibrium are sensitive to the relative hab predation avoidance coefficient if the coefficient is larger than the ratio of net growth rates between the hab and non harmful phytoplankton group the threshold becomes infinite and an equilibrium is not feasible the time scale for the system to reach an equilibrium state that includes a hab group is determined asymptotically the dependence of a threshold condition as a controlling factor may explain the regime shift of dominant species causing habs the ecosystem model is fully implemented into the regional ocean modeling system and applied to an idealized coastal embayment with depths and geometry taken from san francisco bay to show numerically the dominance of prey avoidance dynamics in a natural shallow water environment that includes advection and diffusion the analytical results improve strategies for hab modeling and provide guidance for setting model coefficients necessary to resolve a hab event data availability the modified npzd ecosystem model fully coupled with roms in this study is available at https github com jang geun roms nppzd psi 1 introduction harmful algal blooms habs usually referred to as red tides are excessive blooms of mono phytoplanktonic species that can significantly increase fish mortality and cause large economic loss to fisheries aquaculture industries and touristic activities by assimilating toxins and consuming all dissolved oxygen jin et al 2008 park et al 2013 recently habs have occurred more frequently due to trends in global warming and increased anthropogenic nutrient input to aquatic systems padmakumar et al 2012 lee et al 2013 griffith and gobler 2020 although many research directions have been pursued to better understand their dynamics collectively they show that habs are one of the most complex coastal ecosystem processes that links biogeochemical and hydrodynamical characteristics of the ambient environment he et al 2008 lee 2008 li et al 2009 kim et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 baek et al 2020 modeling approaches are frequently used as powerful tools to resolve the complexity of habs in many laboratory culturing experiments single equation models are simply regressed against measured culturing results lee et al 2001 cho and cho 2014 lim et al 2014 shankar et al 2014 adding to the complexity interactions between hab groups and other phytoplankton groups including diatoms are common and can result in a wide variety of outcomes kwon et al 2014 lim et al 2014 oh et al 2015 several studies experimentally show that the presence of other phytoplankton groups e g typical non harmful diatoms inhibits the growth of several hab groups mitra and flynn 2006 lim et al 2014 furthermore nutrient uptake ability by the hab group estimated by laboratory experiments implies that the hab group is defeated by the diatoms in the resource competition eppley et al 1969 lee et al 2001 kudela et al 2010 cho and cho 2014 oh et al 2015 and thus plays a primal role in suppressing growth of one phytoplankton group relative to the other tilman 1977 various mechanisms have been suggested to explain how the hab group can bloom including mixotrophic behavior jeong et al 1999 2004 swimming ability lim et al 2014 jeong et al 2017 allelopathy effects fistarol et al 2004 tang and gobler 2010 lim et al 2014 multi resource competition glibert and burkholder 2011 zhou et al 2017 and prey avoidance solé et al 2006 mitra and flynn 2006 flynn 2008 harvey and menden deuer 2011 and 2012 the key mechanism triggering a hab differs by species but here we focus on details of population dynamics in prey avoidance mitra and flynn 2006 developed a simple ecosystem model that consists of two phytoplankton groups one hab and one non hab one nutrient and one zooplankton species their model considered allelopathy prey switching and prey rejection of the hab group and through sensitivity experiments concluded that prey rejection plays the most important role in the formation of habs however mitra and flynn 2006 did not discuss population dynamics of the prey avoidance in addition models designed to reconstruct laboratory experiments are difficult to extrapolate to the field although previous studies including mitra and flynn 2006 explicitly consider the interactions between habs and the ambient system using models most analyses are focused on how well numerical solutions reproduce the observations analytical studies for the system of governing equations are generally not considered even though the ecosystem dynamics are determined by the equations it would be expected that turbulence and the margalef framework would play an important structuring role in the ecosystem model for pelagic environments margalef 1978 cullen et al 2002 however the purpose of this study is to examine the dynamics of prey avoidance that are not resolved by the margalef framework and applicable to well mixed shallow coastal environments where the water depths are similar in scale to or shallower than pelagic mixed layer depths and the euphotic layer based on the margalef framework coastal environments with high turbulence due to tidal mixing and high nutrient concentration are expected to favor diatom dominance yet many observations show that non diatom habs occur in these shallow eutrophic environments wilkerson et al 2006 anderson 2009 lee et al 2013 kang et al 2015 this implies the presence of dynamics not resolved by the margalef framework with prey avoidance as a likely candidate mitra and flynn 2006 harvey and menden deuer 2012 kang et al 2015 our initial model development without consideration of prey avoidance mechanisms not shown herein simulated dominant diatoms consistent with not only the margalef framework but also with the tilman framework tilman 1977 diatoms having better nutrient uptake ability to defeat hab groups in resource competition in the work presented here we focus on the population dynamics caused by prey avoidance rather than the interaction between phytoplankton growth and turbulence in this work we conduct an analytical analysis of a modified nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton detritus npzd model that includes a harmful phytoplankton group to study population dynamics of prey avoidance it should be noted that the model in this study describes the hab group as a phytoplankton functional group having better predation avoidance in the ecosystem limited by one resource nitrogen and thus is designed to highlight the prey avoidance mechanism of the hab group in its present form the model does not consider habs triggered by unresolved mechanisms e g multi resource competition or mixotrophic behavior so cannot be globally applied to habs problems to discuss the dynamics governed by prey predation interaction between components of the ecosystem no physical transport is considered and steady state is assumed in the analytical development the steady state solutions equilibriums of the modified npzd model under these assumptions are found and stability conditions for each equilibrium state are discussed to determine when the hab group can be sustained in the ecosystem without extinction details of the resource competition between two different phytoplankton groups and top down control mechanisms through prey avoidance are examined and discussed in addition the modified npzd system is fully coupled with a numerical hydrodynamic model where all terms in the general ecological physical coupled model are retained without the assumptions in the analytical development and thus temporal rate of change and all transport processes advection mixing and sinking of detritus for ecological variables are considered using the fully coupled model idealized experiments describing hab development in an idealized coastal embayment with depths and geometry taken from san francisco bay are compared with equilibrium states predicted by the theory 2 method 2 1 ecosystem models in the following the npzd system is used as the basis of the marine ecosystem model the npzd model consists of four variables nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton and detritus and describes the basic cycle of mass nitrogen in the marine ecosystem nutrient is taken up by phytoplankton phytoplankton are grazed by zooplankton the plankton become detritus through mortality and detritus is remineralized although there are more sophisticated models the simple and widely used npzd model contains sufficient complexity to describe many realistic marine ecosystems onitsuka et al 2007 xu et al 2008 perruche et al 2010 priester et al 2017 cruz rico and rivas 2018 furthermore the npzd system has been theoretically scrutinized busenberg et al 1990 edwards 2001 heinle and slawig 2013a and 2013b which are revisited and further discussed in section 3 1 and can be easily modified and expanded to resolve additional ecological dynamics newberger et al 2003 lima and doney 2004 koné et al 2005 fennel et al 2006 kishi et al 2007 fiechter et al 2009 governing equations for the npzd system are slightly different in each study equations suggested by powell et al 2006 are used in this study because their model is coupled with the publicly available regional ocean modeling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 and easily accessible to resolve the resource competition and different predation pressure between two specific phytoplankton groups we include one additional phytoplankton group representing the harmful phytoplankton hab group the purpose is to analytically examine population dynamics of the prey avoidance in the npzd system by developing an optimal model with enough complexity to resolve prey avoidance in the npzd system but simple enough to be studied by analytical approaches the governing equations of our modified npzd system including a hab group are given by 1 d n d t δ d γ g z u 1 p 1 u 2 p 2 d p 1 d t u 1 p 1 1 π g z σ 1 p 1 d p 2 d t u 2 p 2 π g z σ 2 p 2 d z d t 1 γ g z ξ z d d d t w d d z σ 1 p 1 σ 2 p 2 ξ z δ d where t is time and n p 1 p 2 z and d indicate nutrient normal non harmful phytoplankton hab group zooplankton and detritus concentrations respectively u 1 u 2 g and π are growth rates of each phytoplankton group the zooplankton grazing and predation probability function respectively and defined as u n n v n n n k n α n i v n 2 α n i 2 g p 1 p 2 r m 1 e λ p 1 ψ p 2 π p 1 p 2 ψ p 2 p 1 ψ p 2 where subscript n takes on values of 1 or 2 the concept of a predation probability function and grazing term is described in fennel and neumann 2004 but modified here to consider the different predation pressure induced by each phytoplankton group post et al 2000 koné et al 2005 oguz et al 2016 the other variables are constant model coefficients with values given in table 1 the coefficients shared with traditional npzd models are the default values powell et al 2006 fiechter et al 2009 key differences between the traditional npzd model and the modified npzd model in this study include the ability to resolve two different phytoplankton groups and the effects of different predation avoidance ability in the modified npzd model two phytoplankton functional groups are considered the hab group is defined as the phytoplankton having worse nutrient uptake ability and better predation avoidance ability than the other non harmful phytoplankton group the model is designed to elucidate the dynamics of top down control of specific habs triggered by predation avoidance the maximum growth rate of p 2 is chosen as a reasonable value that describes slower nutrient uptake kinetics than that for p 1 v 2 v 1 table 1 in this study the mass transfer between each state variable is defined by nitrogen and thus the model describes the nitrogen cycle of the ecosystem with the units of the variables and half saturation coefficients given in moles of nitrogen μ m n the parameter ψ is a non dimensional number that defines the p 2 predation avoidance ability relative to that of p 1 when ψ 1 the zooplankton group prefers to consume p 1 better predation avoidance of p 2 than p 1 whereas ψ 1 indicates more p 2 preference than p 1 for ψ 1 the zooplankton group has no preference for either phytoplankton group because both groups have identical predation avoidance the sensitivity of the system on given ψ values is discussed in section 3 2 2 fig 1 depicts a schematic of the modified npzd ecosystem model showing the various nitrogen cycling processes including uptake of nutrients by phytoplankton grazing by zooplankton excretion of nutrients from phytoplankton mortality of phytoplankton and zooplankton and remineralization of detritus this model can be considered as a nppzd type having two different phytoplankton functional groups p 1 and p 2 characteristics of each phytoplankton group are identical to those used by mitra and flynn 2006 where p 1 has better nutrient uptake ability represented by v 2 v 1 but p 2 has better predation avoidance ψ 1 2 2 equilibrium points steady state solutions ignoring left hand side terms of system 1 are frequently used to analyze characteristics and dynamics of ecosystem models tilman 1977 newberger et al 2003 perruche et al 2010 heinle and slawig 2013a and b although the system 1 is nonlinear steady state solutions are easily obtained negative or imaginary solutions are non physical and not discussed further because system 1 is closed and conserves mass the five equations in 1 with steady state are undetermined the last equation needed to reach a solution can be obtained by summing all equations in 1 that yields d n p 1 p 2 z d d t 0 and can be written as n p 1 p 2 z d n t where n t indicates the total nitrogen concentration determined by the sum of all the state variable in initial conditions the steady state solutions are expressed as a function of model coefficients table 1 and n t to represent the state of the system state variables are denoted as a vector e m n m p 1 m p 2 m z m d m similar to heinle and slawig 2013a where superscript m represents the index of each steady state solution the stability condition for each steady state solution can also be found for any given initial condition that progresses toward a stable solution the stability condition will determine the feasibility of that stable solution the stability condition can be determined by linearization of the ordinary differential equation system heinle and slawig 2013a here we focus on the ecological consequences of the stability condition similar to busenberg et al 1990 it must be noted that system 1 does not always converge toward a steady state solution when total nitrogen in the system is sufficiently high the steady state solution changes from a stable focal point towards a neutral stability point where the state of the system oscillates around the steady state solution busenberg et al 1990 however the steady state solution for a neutral stability point attracts the system away from other unstable solutions and remains close to the center of oscillation in this study the steady state solution for a neutral stability point is not discussed further and the focus is on the transition of stable steady states from one solution to another useful for determining the conditions that result in the presence or absence of a phytoplankton functional group 2 3 numerical experiments 2 3 1 cross verification using ordinary differential equation solvers the equilibriums of the system 1 are cross verified by numerical solutions based on ordinary differential equation solvers provided by matlab the temporal change terms on the left hand side of 1 are retained in the numerical solutions system 1 with different ψ and n t is solved and compared to the theoretical equilibrium it is worth noting that careful choice of the solver numerical scheme and accurate error tolerances are required to obtain a proper numerical solution for highly eutrophic conditions high n t which result in stiff nonlinear oscillations otherwise the solvers blow up or reach an equilibrium that disagrees with the theoretical equilibrium appendix a herein we use the ode45 solver with both relative and absolute error tolerances set to 10 10 the ode23t not shown herein generates identical results with ode45 2 3 2 idealized experiments using ecosystem model fully coupled with hydrodynamics model to test the theory in a more realistic ecosystem influenced by transport mechanisms we fully couple system 1 with roms and then conduct idealized numerical experiments physical transport of ecological variables and detritus sinking are considered in the numerical experiments so both advection and diffusion terms are also considered in the fully coupled model the model domain for the idealized experiments is chosen based on heterosigma akashiwo blooms in san francisco bay that are expected to be triggered by a prey avoidance mechanism harvey and menden deuer 2011 however it must be noted that the purpose of the idealized experiments is not to accurately simulate habs of san francisco bay but instead to test dominance of the dynamics elucidated by the equilibriums of system 1 in a more realistic coastal environment that includes physical transport and sinking detritus the model is designed based on topography from the etopo2 dataset fig 2 with 10 vertical sigma levels and 500 m lateral spatial resolution for simplicity the predominant tide is assumed in the shallow coastal environment and thus the model is forced only by tides obtained from the tpxo9 atlas tidal dataset available at https www tpxo net global tpxo9 atlas without consideration of wind stress and river discharge for the mixing vertical diffusion is resolved by the mellor yamada turbulence closure scheme without lateral diffusion mellor and yamada 1982 the high order spatial interpolation at the middle temporal level hsimt wu and zhu 2010 scheme is chosen to handle advection of tracers although this simple model configuration is not expected to simulate the circulation of the real ocean we presume that it is sufficiently complex to resolve plausible effects of circulation and mixing of general tide dominated shallow coastal environments on ecological variables for the ecological model configuration the modified npzd model is initiated by constant concentration of state variables inside of the bay fig 2 all ecological variables are set to 0 1 μ m n except for nutrient concentrations that are set to 1 4 and 16 μ m n to assess sensitivity to n t the concentration of all variables in the offshore region is set to 0 μ m n for simplicity the ecological model coefficients listed in table 1 are used and the light intensity is fixed to 158 w m 2 identical with powell et al 2006 in roms the biological sediment option is turned on which describes sediment remineralization processes and returns nitrogen from the detritus reaching the bottom boundary to the nutrient pool without loss e g denitrification and permanent sedimentation to examine the role of physical transport passive tracers are distributed with identical initial conditions as the ecological tracers the concentration of the passive tracers on the inner shelf is defined as one 3 theory 3 1 shared solutions with npzd system p 2 0 because system 1 converges to the general npzd model when p 2 0 steady state solutions of the general npzd model are also considered as one of the possible solutions in this section equilibriums of the general npzd model are revisited to highlight the transition of stable solutions given as total nitrogen levels and the role of zooplankton in the eutrophic range the first solution of the general npzd system requires that all nitrogen in the system exists in nutrient form and all the other state variables are zero so e 1 n 1 0 0 0 0 where n 1 n t this solution occurs when the initial concentration of phytoplankton groups is zero or when nutrient concentrations are not enough to sustain the phytoplankton group u 1 n t σ 1 which can be written as 2 n t u 1 1 σ 1 σ 1 k 1 v 1 σ 1 where u n 1 σ n indicates the nutrient concentration that makes the growth rate of the phytoplankton balanced by the mortality rate in other words the minimum nutrient concentration needed for the phytoplankton group to be sustained a second solution occurs when the zooplankton group does not exist such that e 2 n 2 p 1 2 0 0 d 2 the components of the second equilibrium e 2 are given as n 2 u 1 1 σ 1 p 1 2 δ δ σ 1 n t u 1 1 σ 1 d 2 σ 1 δ σ 1 n t u 1 1 σ 1 this solution is feasible both when zooplankton initially do not exist or when nutrient concentrations are high enough to sustain the phytoplankton but the phytoplankton concentration itself is not enough to maintain a viable zooplankton population such that σ 1 u 1 n t and 1 γ g p 1 2 0 ξ this condition can be written as 3 u 1 1 σ 1 n t u 1 1 σ 1 δ σ 1 δ p 1 3 where p 1 3 indicates the minimum phytoplankton concentration needed to sustain zooplankton and corresponds to the phytoplankton concentration that results in a balance between growth and mortality of the zooplankton and is defined as p 1 3 g 1 ξ 1 γ 1 λ ln 1 ξ r m 1 γ 1 when the steady state phytoplankton concentration is enough to sustain zooplankton or equivalently the total nitrogen concentration is high enough to sustain both phytoplankton and zooplankton a third steady state solution e 3 n 3 p 1 3 0 z 3 d 3 exists with all non zero state variables except for p 2 components of e 3 are determined by n 3 2 k 1 v 1 p 1 3 1 γ 1 ξ 1 δ p 1 3 1 σ 1 ξ 1 γ σ 1 δ γ n t n 3 p 1 3 1 σ 1 ξ 1 γ σ 1 δ γ n t k 1 0 z 3 1 γ ξ u 1 n 3 σ 1 p 1 3 d 3 1 δ 1 γ u 1 n 3 γ σ 1 p 1 3 it is worth noting that the quadratic equation for n 3 has two solutions but one is negative and non physical p 1 3 is independent of n t and determined by coefficients related to the zooplankton all other state variables are dependent on n t the condition that allows the zooplankton group to be present is 1 γ g p 1 2 0 ξ and can be written as 4 u 1 1 σ 1 δ δ σ 1 p 1 3 n t fig 3 shows components of the steady state solution to the general npzd system varying with n t that is feasible steady state solutions are transited from e 1 to e 2 and e 2 to e 3 whenever n t becomes higher than the threshold conditions 3 and 4 for e 3 all state variables except for phytoplankton increase with increasing n t when n t is sufficiently high nutrient concentration n 3 linearly increases whereas z 3 and d 3 are saturated and converge to constant values fig 3 the solutions z 3 and d 3 are monod functions with non zero intercept the slope of n 3 and saturated concentration of z 3 and d 3 can be analytically determined as n t gets large and are given in the limit by lim n t n 3 n t 1 lim n t z 3 1 γ ξ v m σ p 1 3 lim n t d 3 1 δ 1 γ v m γ σ p 1 3 consequently in the eutrophic limit nutrient concentration converges to a linear polynomial function with slope one and all the other state variables become constant this implies that once the system is sufficiently eutrophic additional nitrogen will not influence the steady state values of phytoplankton zooplankton and detritus any additional nitrogen is stored in nutrient pools the steady state solutions of the general npzd system with only one functional phytoplankton group were well discussed by heinle and slawig 2013a the governing equations of npzd system used by heinle and slawig 2013a were different than those used in this study in their model mortality of zooplankton increased nutrient concentration and the inefficiency of zooplankton grazing increased detritus the opposite occurs in our work where zooplankton mortality increases detritus and the inefficiency of grazing increases nutrient concentration regardless qualitative characteristics of steady state solutions are the same because detritus acts as an intermediate state between mortality and remineralization in the closed system and the presence of a zooplankton group intrinsically plays a role in pumping nitrogen from the phytoplankton pool to the nutrient pool 3 2 hab group presence solutions p 2 0 3 2 1 resource competition between two phytoplankton groups without zooplankton z 0 the presence of a hab group p 2 0 induces additional steady state solutions however it is worth noting first that steady state solutions do not exist for situations where p 1 and p 2 coexist without zooplankton z 0 this is because system 1 represents two different phytoplankton groups that compete for only one resource tilman 1977 that is when p 1 0 p 2 0 and z 0 each governing equation for the phytoplankton groups drives two different steady state nutrient concentrations u 1 1 σ 1 and u 2 1 σ 2 and thus has no solution as a result the phytoplankton group that can survive under conditions with lower nutrient concentration i e lower u n 1 σ n defeats the other phytoplankton group the winner of the resource competition is p 1 because of its higher maximum growth rate that contributes to u 1 1 σ 1 u 2 1 σ 2 there does exist a steady state solution e 4 n 4 0 p 2 4 0 d 4 for which components are given by n 4 u 2 1 σ 2 p 2 4 δ δ σ 2 n t u 2 1 σ 2 d 4 σ 1 δ σ 2 n t u 2 1 σ 2 however e 4 is sustained by the defeated functional group and represents an unstable saddle point van opheusden et al 2015 the presence of p 1 rapidly moves the state of the system from solution e 4 to e 2 as the state of the system approaches solution e 2 p 2 converges to zero because the growth rate of p 2 around e 2 is less than the mortality u 2 n 2 σ 2 equivalent to u 1 1 σ 1 u 2 1 σ 2 in other words for the solution e 4 to become viable the initial concentration of p 1 must be strictly zero otherwise the presence of a minute amount of p 1 moves the state of the system from solution e 4 to e 2 this result is in agreement with many laboratory experiments mitra and flynn 2006 lim et al 2014 oh et al 2015 sukenik and kaplan 2021 and indicates that the model system 1 in this study incorporates resource competition dynamics between normal phytoplankton and a hab group however this resource competition does not explain how a hab group can bloom in the system because p 1 represents non harmful phytoplankton that are ubiquitous and not likely to be absent in the natural ocean 3 2 2 equilibrium with p 2 0 as mentioned above p 2 cannot exist when zooplankton do not exist because nutrient concentration in the stable steady state solution contributes to negative net growth rate of the hab group however the presence of zooplankton increases the nutrient concentration as total nitrogen level in the system increases fig 3 once nutrient concentration increased by zooplankton is sufficient to cause larger growth rates than the sum of sink terms including mortality and predation rate a steady state solution with non zero p 2 e 5 n 5 p 1 5 p 2 5 z 5 d 5 is feasible the components of solution e 5 are determined by u 2 n 5 σ 2 ψ u 1 n 5 σ 1 z 5 1 γ ξ u 1 n 5 σ 1 p 1 3 p 1 5 ψ δ n t n 5 z 5 ξ z 5 σ 2 δ p 1 3 ψ σ 1 δ σ 2 δ p 2 5 δ n t n 5 z 5 ξ z 5 σ 2 δ p 1 3 σ 1 δ ψ σ 2 δ d 5 n t n 5 p 1 5 p 2 5 z 5 it is worth noting that the first equation above for nutrient concentration can be rewritten in quadratic form with one of the two solutions non physical similar to e 3 the condition necessary for e 5 is u 2 n 3 σ 2 ψ p 1 3 g z 3 which can be rewritten as u 2 n 3 σ 2 ψ u 1 n 3 σ 1 and n 3 n 5 the second form of the condition shows that net growth of p 2 should be larger than that of p 1 weighted by ψ when p 2 cannot gain sufficient advantage from prey avoidance sufficiently small ψ e 5 is unconditionally not possible therefore the coefficient ψ should be sufficiently small for the model to trigger habs the maximum ψ which can reach equilibrium with p 2 is also analytically determinable the former form for the stable condition becomes v 2 σ 2 ψ v 1 σ 1 in the eutrophic limit where n t and n 3 so v 2 σ 2 v 1 σ 1 ψ is required because n 3 is a function of n t and n 5 is a constant determined by coefficients v n k n and ψ the condition necessary for e 5 n 3 n 5 can be rewritten again as 5 n 3 1 n 5 n t showing that n t must be larger than a threshold determined by coefficients explicit form of the thresholds is given in appendix b if ψ v 2 σ 2 v 1 σ 1 conditions for e 5 can never be satisfied even if n t when ψ 0 indicating that p 2 is not subject to predation the complexity of the governing equations 1 is significantly reduced because π becomes zero and the steady state solution e 5 is also simplified fig 4 shows the steady state concentration of each state variable expressed as a function of n t with ψ 0 and ψ 0 075 v 2 σ 2 v 1 σ 1 it is worth noting that solutions of the general npzd system occur when n t is less than n 3 1 n 5 once ψ 0 and n t is larger than n 3 1 n 5 p 2 and d linearly increase with n t and the other state variables become independent of n t upper panel of fig 4 in this case the dynamics described by the system are straightforward p 2 that are not consumed by zooplankton take up surplus nutrients converted from p 1 by the zooplankton when ψ is sufficiently small and positive so that condition 5 is satisfied p 2 increases as n t increases similar to the case where ψ 0 however at the same time p 1 slowly decreases lower panel of fig 4 eventually once n t is high enough a steady state solution occurs without p 1 e 6 n 6 0 p 2 6 z 6 d 6 the components of e 6 are given as p 2 6 1 ψ λ ln 1 ξ r m 1 γ 1 n 6 2 k 2 v 2 p 2 6 1 γ 1 ξ 1 δ p 2 6 1 σ 2 ξ 1 γ σ 2 δ γ n t n 6 p 2 6 1 σ 2 ξ 1 γ σ 2 δ γ n t k 2 0 z 6 1 γ ξ u 2 n 6 σ 2 p 2 6 d 6 1 δ 1 γ u 2 n 6 γ σ 2 p 2 6 e 6 has identical mathematical characteristics as e 3 z 6 and d 6 depend on n t but are saturated and converge to constant values in the eutrophic limit on the other hand n 6 linearly increases with n t in the limit the condition necessary for e 6 is the absence of p 1 which occurs when the growth rate of p 1 is less than the sum of sink terms u 1 n 6 σ 1 1 p 1 3 g z 6 where ψ p 2 6 p 1 3 this condition similar to condition 5 is given by ψ u 1 n 6 σ 1 u 2 n 6 σ 2 and n 5 n 6 which can be written as 6 n 6 1 n 5 n t this steady state solution shows that p 1 cannot survive in environments where p 2 sustains a large enough zooplankton group it is interesting that both p 1 and p 2 coexist in the eutrophic limit if p 2 is not subject to predation conversely p 1 is not sustained when predation for p 2 is allowed this implies that the niche of a functional group must be provided and present within the functional group when p 2 is not consumed by zooplankton p 1 has a unique niche that sustains a zooplankton group that is required by p 2 however once p 2 is available as prey for the zooplankton group p 2 itself can sustain a zooplankton group even without p 1 as a consequence the role of p 1 in sustaining a zooplankton group is replaced by p 2 in the eutrophic limit the predation avoidance coefficient ψ plays a crucial role in the behavior of the equilibrium when p 2 0 fig 4 fig 5 shows the sensitivity of analytically determining thresholds of e 5 and e 6 expressed as function of ψ if p 2 is not subject to predation ψ 0 the threshold of e 5 given by n 3 1 n 5 becomes minimum on the other hand the threshold of e 6 given by n 6 1 n 5 increases infinitely as ψ 0 and thus e 6 cannot be feasible if ψ 0 as before p 1 is necessary to sustain the zooplankton group that is required by p 2 when ψ 0 as ψ increases n 3 1 n 5 increases and the steady state concentration of p 2 decreases because the predation for p 2 is allowed and acts as a sink of p 2 at the same time n 6 1 n 5 decreases because p 2 itself can efficiently sustain zooplankton irrespective of p 1 there is another singularity at ψ v 2 σ 2 v 1 σ 1 where both n 3 1 n 5 and n 6 1 n 5 become infinite in this situation predation for p 2 is too intense and p 2 cannot gain an advantage as the functional group with better predation avoidance as a result p 2 does not exist and only e 3 becomes feasible 4 discussion 4 1 numerical solutions using ordinary differential equation solver and time scale for p 2 bloom fig 6 shows numerical solutions obtained by matlab s ordinary differential equation solver ode45 for different ψ and n t the title in each subplot shows the analytically determined condition of the system when n t is less than n 3 1 n 5 numerical solutions show that p 2 cannot be sustained in the system and converges to zero whereas p 2 converges to a non zero constant when condition 5 is satisfied fig 6 similarly p 1 exponentially decreases and converges to zero when condition 6 is satisfied fig 6 when ψ 0 p 2 always coexists with p 1 on the other hand p 2 is never sustained by the system when v 2 σ 2 v 1 σ 2 ψ regardless of n t the sensitivity of the numerical solution on ψ and n t matches the theoretical stability condition for equilibriums discussed in section 3 the numerical solutions also show several features that are not resolved by the equilibrium theory biogeochemical oscillations and temporal transitions between equilibriums as mentioned above equilibriums change from a stable focal point to a neutral stability point when the system is sufficiently eutrophic the oscillations become stiffer as n t increases which cause the system to adjust to the wrong equilibrium that disagrees with the steady state solution appendix a several experiments clearly show that the system is initially attracted by e 3 and then slowly moves to equilibriums that include a hab group e 5 or e 6 during the initial phase of transition from e 3 to the other equilibriums that include p 2 with concentration negligible at this stage the growth rate of p 2 is asymptotically given as 7 p 2 t u 2 n 3 ψ p 1 3 g z 3 σ 2 p 2 which indicates exponential growth of p 2 and the net growth rate of u 2 n 3 ψ p 1 3 g z 3 σ 2 the reciprocal of the rate given in 7 yields a time scale for the p 2 bloom as mentioned in section 3 2 2 the growth rate should be positive for the system to be attracted by e 5 and the positivity condition for the growth rate can be written as n 3 1 n 5 n t therefore the growth rate converges to zero as n t approaches the threshold so the transition from e 3 to the equilibriums including p 2 can be slow when n t is close to the threshold fig 7 shows good correlation between the numerical and theoretical time scales of the p 2 bloom the numerical time scales are subjectively defined from fig 6 and marked as dashed lines the theoretical time scales are defined as the reciprocal of the growth rate of p 2 in eq 7 4 2 sensitivity experiments using fully coupled ecosystem model with hydrodynamics model fig 8 shows results from the idealized experiments that use the fully coupled ecosystem model with roms initiated from nutrient concentration n 1 4 and 16 μ m n the theoretical stability condition for equilibrium predicts that the experiment using n 1 μ m n upper panels of fig 8 simulates e 3 where p 1 wins n 4 μ m n middle panels of fig 8 simulates e 5 where both p 1 and p 2 coexist and n 16 μ m n lower panels of fig 8 simulates e 6 where p 2 wins these results match the numerical simulation results even though the theory does not consider temporal changes of ecological variables physical transport and sinking detritus fig 9 shows that the concentration of each simulated phytoplankton group is in good agreement with the analytically predicted phytoplankton concentration red lines in fig 9 based on the simulated total nitrogen and the steady state solutions found in previous sections fig 10 shows the surface passive tracer and total nitrogen concentration which have different initial values of each simulation after 90 days the distribution of total nitrogen concentration is almost identical to that of a passive tracer that is transported by purely ocean currents and mixed without influence from the biogeochemical processes considered in the ecosystem model this suggests that total nitrogen is predominantly determined by the physical transport in the coastal and bay regions which in this case is determined by the tides the passive tracer concentration in the shallow marginal region of the inner bay is almost identical to the initial condition of the tracer implying a long residence time on the other hand the tracer concentration away from the margins of the inner bay is considerably reduced and transported to the offshore region indicating a much shorter residence time there similarly total nitrogen concentration is nearly the same as the initial condition in the shallow margins of the bay yellowish markers in fig 9 but reduced in regions toward the inlet and coast owing to rapid transport seaward blueish markers in fig 9 therefore the shallow margins maintain enough total nitrogen to exceed the thresholds for hab group presence but the other regions away from the margin cannot figs 8 and 9 this behavior of the fully coupled model matches well with the conceptual model proposed by smayda 2008 consequently physical transport in the shallow tide dominated coastal bay plays a strong role in determining total nitrogen concentration fig 8 after which the response of the ecosystem in terms of phytoplankton concentration of each group fig 9 follows the dynamics described by the equilibriums of the model it is worth noting that the idealized experiments are simplified and several physical dynamics that occur in real coastal systems are not resolved e g temporal changes of light intensity subtidal forcing wind driven circulations river discharges however the experiments imply that the dynamics described by the equilibriums can be dominant in complex semi closed coastal regions with predominant tidal currents and can be valid when the time scale of the p 2 bloom is shorter than the other unresolved processes recently the importance of resource competition and prey avoidance in hab dynamics has been suggested by many studies in particular prey avoidance is pointed out as a key hab mechanism for heterosigma akashiwo blooms and also for other cases such as isochrysis galbana mitra and flynn 2006 and aureoumbra lagunensis kang et al 2015 blooms where the dynamics discussed in this study and the fully coupled model are applicable the systematic mathematical population dynamics of resource competition was analytically examined by tilman 1977 and is providing surprising insight to problems involving resource competition and coexistence although previous field and laboratory studies suggested that prey avoidance can be key mechanism in many habs cases mitra and flynn 2006 harvey and menden deuer 2011 and 2012 kang et al 2015 the population dynamics of prey avoidance was not analytically resolved here the analytical development suggests that the system must be sufficiently eutrophic enough total nitrogen in the system to exceed a threshold for habs to be triggered by prey avoidance this finding supports modern conceptual models for habs that show a positive relation between eutrophication and habs smayda 2008 gilbert and burkholder 2011 and 2018 griffith and gobler 2020 the numerical experiments using the fully coupled model demonstrate that the dynamics discussed by the equilibriums is predominant for a realistic coastal environment governed by strong tides the relationship between residence time and habs resolved here matches well with conceptual models for habs smayda 2008 the feasible steady state solutions are transitioned from one to another whenever total nitrogen level n t in the system is higher than the thresholds determined by model coefficients figs 4 and 6 if the ecosystem is not sufficiently eutrophic to sustain enough zooplankton n t n 3 1 n 5 the predation of zooplankton is not considerable and steady state solutions shared with the traditional npzd model without a hab group i e p 2 0 appear as a consequence of resource competition with the non harmful phytoplankton defeating the hab group when the ecosystem is sufficiently eutrophic to sustain a large enough zooplankton group n 3 1 n 5 n t n 6 1 n 3 zooplankton can sufficiently pump nitrogen from the non harmful phytoplankton to the nutrient pool and an equilibrium condition is satisfied resulting in two coexisting phytoplankton groups e 5 when the ecosystem is excessively eutrophic and a large zooplankton group can be sustained by the hab group n 6 1 n 3 n t the hab group itself can sustain the zooplankton group without p 1 and the predation pressure for p 1 becomes too intense resulting in a steady state solution without normal phytoplankton e 6 the feasibility of steady state solutions resulting in habs is sensitive to the relative hab group predation avoidance parameter ψ fig 5 when ψ 0 a steady state solution in which the hab group outperforms the non harmful phytoplankton group is not feasible because the hab group cannot sustain the zooplankton group as ψ increases the threshold for the solution without non harmful phytoplankton decreases because the hab group efficiently sustains the zooplankton yet the steady state concentration of the hab group also decreases with increasing predation when ψ v 2 σ 2 v 1 σ 1 both equilibrium conditions supporting hab growth are not feasible because the hab group cannot gain an advantage through better predation avoidance the time scale for the system to move from equilibrium without p 2 to that with p 1 is asymptotically determined and is in good agreement with numerical solutions 5 conclusion in this study a modified npzd system that highlights different predation pressure for two phytoplankton functional groups one harmful and one non harmful is described and the possible steady state solutions are discussed analytical solutions show theoretically that increased nitrogen levels from anthropogenic nutrient loading can alter the coastal ecosystem from conditions that cannot trigger habs to conditions that can that is steady state solutions move from one equilibrium state to another the thresholds may explain the dynamics of regime shift which alter the dominant species in an ecosystem by favoring the hab group steady state solutions to the coupled ecosystem model reveal details of the top down control dynamics results show that 1 habs can be suppressed because of resource competition with non harmful phytoplankton and 2 habs having better predation avoidance can be triggered when total nitrogen exceeds a threshold by using nutrients pumped by zooplankton from non harmful phytoplankton pools we expect that the population dynamics of the prey avoidance elucidated by this study e g presence of total nitrogen thresholds for hab groups having better prey avoidance to overcome defeat in resource competition can provide insight to better understand field observations laboratory experiments and numerical models the analytical study describes population dynamics between two primal producers that compete for one resource and are influenced by different predation pressure from one zooplankton group the dynamics are applicable to not only the habs problem but also any other system with top down control the structure of the model different phytoplankton groups influenced by different predation pressure from one zooplankton group has frequently been included in various complex ecosystem models however the role of the dynamics in the ecosystem and the sensitivity of the parameters controlling relative predation pressure were not considered this study shows how the different predation pressures on each phytoplankton group change the population of each group what conditions are required for the plankton group impacted less by predation to be sustained in the ecosystem and how the ecosystem is influenced by changes to parameters controlling relative predation pressure credit authorship

the numerical solution using n t 32 4 μ m n and ψ 0 15 satisfies condition 6 where p 1 cannot survive in this case equilibrium is not a stable focal point but rather a neutral stability point which causes a stiff biogeochemical oscillation centered on e 6 where there is no p 1 however numerical solutions show different results which depend on the choice of solvers and error tolerances fig a1 we presumed that the solutions that do not sustain p 1 are correct results because theoretically the system must be attracted by e 6 where there is no p 1 and solutions having better accuracy smaller error tolerance simulate oscillations without p 2 this result shows that the wrong equilibrium can be reached by the numerical solutions when using low accuracy the modified npzd model fully coupled

24192,in recent years biodiversity offsetting has been adopted as a conservation strategy in many different countries biodiversity offsets are mechanisms used to compensate for ecological impacts resulting from development projects especially those on non built land uses they usually rely on an equivalence principle based on achieving strict equality between the area that is developed and that which is offset this approach still remains very controversial this article explores an alternative offset design method where we look at biodiversity from a functional perspective and conceive public policies that aim to conserve biodiversity by maintaining important structural features of the landscape not limited to the proportion occupied by each land use we develop a spatially explicit land use change model to implement our geometric based compensation method and we define three different versions of the public compensation policy we apply the model to real case studies in two french municipalities and we compare the cost and feasibility of compensation under the different public policies we find that offsetting is easier and cheaper when public policies aim to conserve no more than the targeted semi natural land area but this approach has major ecological limits when considering more complex geometric properties of the landscape and therefore higher ecological expectations compensation becomes on average more difficult and more expensive our work shows how new approaches to ecological compensation could be defined and how models could help select the best options in the field keywords biodiversity offsetting landscape spatial model ecological compensation landscape metrics genetic algorithm data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction to mitigate the ecological crisis one public policy strategy consists of requiring ecological compensation when implementing development projects weissgerbera et al 2019 this kind of policy has been applied in different countries such as the usa mckenney and kiesecker 2010 germany rundcrantz and skärbäck 2013 and france quetier et al 2013 wende et al 2018 this principle is affirmed in most of the european union s environmental legislation in france the mitigation hierarchy was incorporated into environmental law in 1976 but the offsets policy was strengthened only forty years later with law n 2016 1087 of 8 august 2016 in france this public policy is built on three successive steps also called mitigation hierarchy levrel et al 2018 bigard et al 2020 first project managers must avoid ecological impacts as far as possible second they must reduce residual impacts third the remaining residual impacts must be compensated for the compensation relies on an equivalence principle quétier et al 2012 the loss of biodiversity in one place has to be compensated for in a different place the overall aim of this three step procedure is to achieve no net loss nnl of biodiversity weissgerbera et al 2019 however the efficiency of biodiversity offsetting also called ecological compensation remains controversial the first limit of this method is the difficulty of unambiguously quantifying biodiversity moreno mateos et al 2015 marshall et al 2020 grimm 2021 since the choice of metrics is critical in determining the success of offsetting but evaluating biodiversity is not easy and many different indicators could be used zu ermgassen et al 2019 simpson et al 2022 marshall et al 2021 indeed biodiversity is a complex concept involving dynamics and spatial patterns moilanena and kotiahoc 2018 as well as different levels of characterisation gene species population ecosystem in such a context evaluating biodiversity loss becomes a difficult process the second limit relates to endemic or emblematic ecosystems or species which might be difficult to compensate for jones and bull 2020 the third limit concerns the time horizon of the compensation while it has been shown that urban development has long term effects and delayed consequences the impact of restoration usually only has a mid or even short term perspective weissgerbera et al 2019 finally if the loss of biodiversity is too great the no net loss objective might be unrealistic making ecological offsetting inappropriate bezombes et al 2019 weissgerbera et al 2019 other criticisms relate to the practical conditions under which offsetting is implemented indeed there is a lack of control protocols covering the efficiency of compensation measures calvet et al 2015 quetier et al 2013 bezombes et al 2019 theis et al 2019 in this context the design of offsetting measures remains a sensitive issue in public policy debate current offsetting strategies are often based on restricted targets one species or habitat area and a common measure of offsetting benefits is simply the ratio between the damaged and compensatory areas which is based on an equivalence principle of extremely limited ecological value quétier et al 2012 ban et al 2022 in this article we investigate an alternative method for defining equivalence based on a more functional approach the objective is to maintain overall ecosystem function rather than similar land use composition it is now well known that landscape structure plays a major role in ecosystem functioning r k and moore 2004 grafius et al 2018 gustafson 2019 and landscape properties appear as a sound although insufficiently studied alternative to land use proportions in ecological compensation processes in this article we therefore explore offsetting design through the maintenance of landscape structure providing a simple but very adaptable tool for researchers and landscape managers technically this structure can be assessed using geometric properties and indicators these indicators can be related to different biodiversity features such as species diversity largest patch index patch density bailey et al 2007 tasser et al 2008 or landscape fragmentation mesh size division index jaeger 2000 landscape metrics regarding fragmentation or connectivity have been widely used to analyse ecosystem services walz 2011 frank et al 2012 the interest of these geometric properties is to capture some of the structural characteristics of the landscape that might guarantee sustainable long term biodiversity dynamics the objective of the paper is methodological we develop a spatially explicit land use change model to implement our geometric based offsetting method in response to development we use a genetic algorithm hamblin 2013 witing et al 2022 ban et al 2022 to look for compensation landscapes that maintain the chosen geometric properties by shifting the land uses of some of the parcels based on this model we explore different public policies regulating ecological compensation following the nnl objective built on different geometric properties of the landscape to be maintained or improved the model is applied to real case studies with six land uses corresponding to urban areas different cropping areas and different woodland and grassland areas we explore the maps of two french municipalities displaying different geometric architecture in order to illustrate the type of results generated by the model one of the main advantages of our modelling framework is its relative simplicity which as a consequence offers strong potential for generalisation from this viewpoint our modelling framework can be applied in different contexts including different geographical areas and land use change issues 2 the landscapes studied 2 1 municipalities we choose to work at the scale of the municipality the smallest french administrative division making public decisions that is still meaningful for landscape development plans and is also consistent with the organisational level of the ecosystem this scale is still large enough to observe the effects of the development compensation process but still computationally tractable at this early development stage of our modelling framework in fact when the geographical area to be analysed is increased the computing time required by the genetic algorithm to look for compensation increases exponentially note however that changing the scale of the study does not imply any methodological difficulty we studied two french municipalities in the loiret department in the centre val de loire region we selected these two municipalities due to their different sizes and very different landscape configurations as detailed in the next section the first chevilly 45093 covers 41 76 km 2 with balanced proportions of cropland and woodland the second ligny le ribault 45182 covers 59 21 km 2 mainly occupied by broad leaved woodland henceforth we refer to them respectively as m 1 chevilly and m 2 ligny le ribault 2 2 land uses we obtained land use maps of these two municipalities to serve as the basis of our model we defined a small number of general land uses which are considered as proxies for habitats and thus as indicators of the biodiversity level we used the land cover data provided by the cesbio center for the study of the biosphere from space we worked with the 2017 map of france in raster layer format with a spatial resolution of 20 metres and 17 classes or land uses data are available in shape file format in open source at government cadastral website we merged the 17 classes of the cesbio database into six land uses table 1 the remaining cesbio classes natural mineral surfaces beaches water and glaciers were not considered since they are minor land uses in the landscapes involved and they are little impacted by either development or the compensation process the two municipalities we studied have different land use compositions table 2 in m 1 fig 1 a the main land use is seasonal crops l u 5 representing 57 of the total area followed by broad leaved woodland l u 1 35 of the total area m 2 fig 1 b is mainly covered in broad leaved woodland l u 1 68 of the total area followed by coniferous woodland l u 2 18 of the total area and a very small area 1 5 of seasonal crops l u 5 we also observe that the two municipalities have different spatial distribution of their land uses fig 1 in m 1 the two main land uses are organised into two distinct zones while in m 2 l u 5 areas are very small and scattered among l u 1 areas the units to be developed and compensated for are parcels m 1 contains a total of 3024 parcels while m 2 contains 4040 by choosing these two different municipalities m 1 and m 2 we want to evaluate the impact of the original landscape s geometric properties on the performance in terms of compensation 3 public policies and landscape metrics 3 1 general purpose of public policies when a parcel of land in a landscape is developed the proportion of land uses and other landscape structure properties are modified public policy should regulate ecological compensation in order to recreate a new landscape achieving the nnl objective in our model this corresponds to the maintenance of certain specific landscape properties which we quantify through a number of meaningful landscape metrics 3 2 landscape metrics landscape metrics are an important tool in quantifying those elements of a landscape s spatial structure that have an impact on the ecological processes operating within it haines young and chopping 1996 many different numerical indices have been defined with this scope ranging from area to diversity metrics which allow the monitoring of different aspects of biodiversity since we are adopting an ecosystem approach rather than focusing on particular species we consider here three general simple intuitive metrics these can be easily measured using the fragstats program and interpreted in relation to landscape properties walz 2011 by capturing these structural and functional properties of the landscape we can evaluate and compare the compensation options by considering landscape metrics as indicators of biodiversity our goal is not to unambiguously quantify biodiversity and address emblematic species and ecosystem problems but to capture some properties of the landscape that can be important in the maintenance of biodiversity we choose a few intuitive metrics to test our model but in our method the landscape metrics under consideration can very easily be changed in order to address specific issues this is important when designing biodiversity offset programs gelcich et al 2017 percentage of landscape p l a n d the percentage of the total area occupied by a class for a given l u i it is defined as p l a n d i j 1 n a i j a 100 where a i j is the area in m 2 of patch j in class i and a is the total area in m 2 of the landscape largest patch index l p i the percentage of land occupied by the largest patch of a given class it is often considered as a predictor of species diversity walz 2011 for l u i it is defined as l p i i max j 1 n a i j a 100 where a i j is the area of patch j of l u i and a is the total area of the landscape division index d i v an indicator of landscape fragmentation walz 2011 it is defined as the probability that two randomly chosen places in the landscape are not situated in the same undivided patch for l u i it is defined as d i v i 1 j 1 n a i j a 2 given that 0 d i v 1 d i v equals zero if the entire landscape consists of one single patch and it increases the more the landscape is broken into separate patches notice that although this article focuses on a few specific metrics a strong point of our approach is that it remains robust to a change of metrics in the case where one metric or another would be more appropriate to a given case 3 3 public policy objectives we specify a public policy s objective by a set of constraints of these landscape metrics measured in the original landscape and in the compensated one let x i be a landscape metric index measured for land use i and let x i c and x i o be respectively the index value measured in the compensated landscape and in the original one we first define 1 δ x i x c i x o i where δ x i measures the variation of the landscape metric index from the original landscape to the compensated one public policy objectives then consist of a set of constraints in the form δ x i 0 where the sign depends on the ecological quality behaviour with respect to the targeted index if the ecological value of the measured property is increasing with respect to index x then δ x is considered otherwise if the ecological quality decreases with the index then in the policy objectives explained below we consider δ x we define three different public policy objectives two of which correspond to maintaining only biodiversity and the third to maintaining both biodiversity and agricultural production notice that it is impossible to maintain the area of each type of land since we assume that developed parcels cannot be changed back into undeveloped ones this trivial result illustrates a major structural failure in the classical area equivalence compensation policies since it is not possible to strictly maintain the area of all habitats once development occurs biodiversity objective b o the objective of these two policies is to maintain or to increase biodiversity alone by conserving or improving certain geometric properties of selected land uses hosting biodiversity bo in the first case bo a the geometric property of the selected land uses to be conserved is the area the aim of the public policy is translated in terms of constraints on the landscape metrics as follows 2 bo a δ p l a n d i 0 i 1 2 3 in the second scenario bo g the objective consists of preserving more complex geometric properties of the same land uses namely largest patch index l p i and division index d i v it is defined as follows 3 bo g δ l p i i 0 i 1 2 3 δ d i v i 0 δ d i v i 0 i 1 2 3 biodiversity and agricultural production objective b a o we define one more policy whose objective is to maintain in addition to biodiversity conservation agricultural food production achieved by conserving agricultural land area in this case thus bao targets the area p l a n d of agricultural land uses and other geometric properties of woodlands and grasslands namely l p i and d i v this corresponds to the following set of constraints 4 bao δ l p i i 0 i 1 2 3 δ d i v i 0 δ d i v i 0 i 1 2 3 δ p l a n d i 0 i 4 5 4 simulation plan 4 1 introduction to the model in fig 2 we show the conceptual scheme of our compensation process for a given development of a parcel of land in one of the two municipalities we use a genetic algorithm hamblin 2013 witing et al 2022 ban et al 2022 to look for compensation landscapes that maintain the chosen geometric properties by shifting the land uses of some of the other parcels the set of properties to be maintained is defined by the public policy applied we then evaluate the cost and feasibility of successful compensation measures in order to compare the effects of the different public policies as well as the impact of the landscape s original structure and the given development 4 2 developments in each municipality we studied three urban developments where a parcel of land occupied by broad leaved woodland is built upon development corresponds to a shift of land use from l u 1 to l u 6 the three development cases studied differ in size and in their position with respect to the largest patch u 1 urban development of a parcel respectively of 122 pixels 1 1 1 pixel 2 64 1 0 4 m in m 1 and 74 in m 2 that is not in the largest patch u 2 urban development of a parcel of 56 pixels in both municipalities in the largest patch with u 2 we wanted to test the behaviour of compensation in the case of a development that affects the largest patch we expect it to have an impact under b o g and under b a o u 3 urban development of a very large parcel respectively of 511 pixels and 492 pixels in the largest patch with u 3 we wanted to test the behaviour of compensation in the case of a very large development especially as far as feasibility is concerned 4 3 tested scenarios in table 3 we summarise all the tested scenarios in each of the two municipalities m 1 and m 2 we simulate three different developments u 1 u 2 u 3 and each of these developments is compensated under three different policy objectives b o a b o g b a o we thus test a total of 18 different compensation scenarios named by concatenating the acronyms of the public policy the development and the municipality 4 4 the compensation process once the given parcel is developed we simulate the compensation process by using a genetic algorithm a search and optimisation technique based on natural selection largely used in ecology hamblin 2013 ban et al 2022 witing et al 2022 as well as in a variety of other fields the genetic algorithm we have defined is such that one parcel of land bigger than 3 pixels in the same municipality is randomly selected and every land use except urban is tested and evaluated the fitness function is defined accordingly to the policy s objective and it depends on the deltas of the landscape metric indexes measured for the different land uses involved it is linearly increasing in the ecological value of the compensated landscape full details on the genetic algorithm and the associated fitness function can be found in the python source code available on github 2 2 https github com ilariabrun spatialmodelforbiodiversityoffsetting if the fitness function improves but is not optimal the compensation continues with a second parcel and so on until the compensation is successful i e all the constraints are satisfied the compensation fails if after 400 attempts i e internal loops the fitness function does not improve and thus no compensation is found the number of internal loops has been chosen in order to have both a good rate of success and a good computable tractability we define a binary variable s u c c e s f a i l u r e to keep track of the internal cycle performance when the compensation is successful we also keep track of the total number of compensated pixels which is considered as an estimation of the compensation cost 4 5 meta simulation for each of the 18 scenarios defined we simulated 2000 compensation processes to evaluate the economic impact of public ecological compensation we assess the scenarios described above using a set of three indicators two related to the cost of compensation and one to its feasibility for each scenario we consider the median compensation cost m e d c and the minimum compensation cost m i n c among the 2000 simulated compensation processes the former provides information about the average cost in the case of a blind landscape manager the latter provides information about the cost when the landscape manager is willing able to minimise it note that we consider the median in order to eliminate outlier effects observed for the average we then complete this cost information by an assessment of the feasibility of the compensation process this feasibility is defined by the percentage of successful compensation trials among the 2000 that were simulated 5 results 5 1 median cost in this section we analyse the behaviour of the median cost m e d c of compensation under the different tested scenarios where m e d c is the median of the costs of all successful simulated compensation processes and the cost is defined as the normalised number of compensated pixels normalised for the size of the development an interesting result obtained for the median cost m e d c concerns the comparison among different policy objectives where a hierarchy clearly emerges in both municipalities we find that m e d c b o g m e d c b a o m e d c b o a with only one exception for development u 1 in municipality m 1 where m e d c b o g m e d c b o a see fig 3 under b o g in blue m e d c is always higher in both municipalities no matter the type of development in municipality m 1 the gap between the costs for different policy objectives is more obvious this quasi systematic ranking means that policy objective b o g which conserves some structural properties namely l p i and d i v of land uses l u 1 l u 2 and l u 3 is more costly than b o a which conserves only the surface area of these lus and this is true for both the municipalities tested and all types of development furthermore under b o a the compensated area is never more than twice that which is developed while to achieve b o g the compensated area is always bigger even reaching 20 times the original area in the case of scenario b o a u 2 m 1 it is interesting to note that under b a o where besides the maintenance of some structural properties of woods and grassland l u 1 l u 2 and l u 3 a further constraint is added in terms of the surface area of agricultural land use l u 4 l u 5 m e d c is lower than under b o g this result can be explained by the fact that the constraint imposed on the maintenance of the agricultural land uses obliges less invasive compensation to be considered since agricultural land must be conserved in our case study the shape of the municipality does not affect the ranking of compensation scenarios but it still has an impact on the marginal differences within municipality m 2 mainly covered by woodland l u 1 the differences between the costs for b o a and b a o are smaller than in m 1 where the main land use is seasonal crops l u 5 concentrated in the northern part of the municipality followed by woodland l u 1 concentrated in the south fig 3 thus since in m 2 the percentage of agricultural land use is really low 1 5 see table 2 compared to that in m 1 57 it is naturally less costly to maintain those areas as expected when the developed parcel is in the largest patch as for u 2 and u 3 the compensation for b o g and b a o is more costly than for u 1 this observation can be explained by the fact that both scenarios impose the maintenance of the largest patch area l p i as a consequence an impact of the development in the largest patch calls for a greater number of compensated pixels see fig 4 5 2 minimum cost although minimal cost is very sensitive to sampling exploring the minimum cost of compensation under the different tested scenarios still reveals interesting patterns the minimum cost minimum of the normalised number of compensated pixels normalised per unit area of development is defined as the minima of all the different successful configurations of compensation simulated the behaviour of the minimum cost is very different to that of the median cost and no clear hierarchy emerges among the different policy objectives fig 5 as expected in both municipalities the m i n c under b o a is 1 for all the 18 scenarios since the only policy objective is to conserve the area of green landscapes under b o g the compensated area is always smaller or equal to the developed area this would mean that by carefully choosing where and how to compensate in order to maintain the targeted structural properties of woods and grasslands l u 1 l u 2 l u 3 then a much smaller area can be used in compensation furthermore we see that unlike the situation for the median cost m e d c for the three tested developments in both municipalities under policy objective b o g preserving structural properties of green landscapes the minimum compensation cost m i n c is lower than or equal to that under the other two policy objectives while m e d c was the highest in the equivalent case in general for m i n c the differences between the different scenarios is rather small and the hierarchy among the different policy objectives depends on the municipality as well as on the location of the development in municipality m 2 for all the developments under policy objective b o a the compensation processes have the highest m i n c while m e d c is the lowest in these cases see fig 3 this behaviour of m i n c suggests that by carefully choosing the compensation one could compensate using smaller areas under b o g and b a o that is by targeting more complex structural properties than the area of l u 1 l u 2 and l u 3 we also observe that in municipality m 2 we find that m i n c b o g m i n c b a o since the percentage of agricultural land is very low in this municipality the constraint of maintaining this area imposed under b a o has a weak impact on the cost of compensation finally we observe that in m 2 the minimum costs of compensation under b o g and b a o are lower than in m 1 this is due to the particular configuration of land uses in m 2 which makes it easier to maintain the habitats properties 5 3 feasibility this section analyses the feasibility of the compensation processes which measures the ratio of successful compensation processes to the total number simulated we study the feasibility under the three policy objectives for the 18 tested scenarios we observe that under b o a and b o g policies compensation is generally very easy especially in m 1 fig 6 compensation proves to be more difficult under b a o in red on the right hand side for each municipality when the rate of success is lower this result means that it is generally harder to maintain both the area of agricultural land l u 4 l u 5 and the targeted structural properties of woodland and grassland l u 1 l u 2 l u 3 than to just consider either the area b o a in green or the structural properties of the latter land uses b o g in blue the gap is particularly evident in the case of u 3 very big development in the largest patch in m 1 where the feasibility of compensation in scenario b a o u 3 m 1 is around 20 while it is 100 for the other two policy objectives as a matter of fact with such a big development to compensate for it is very difficult to find a successful compensation under b a o which requires maintenance of the areas of agricultural parcels and of the more complex structural properties of woodland and grassland for the same kind of development the situation changes in municipality m 2 where for the three scenarios the feasibility is lower in particular the lowest feasibility is observed under b o a maintenance of the area of woodland and grassland since this municipality is mainly covered by grassland and woods and the developed area is very big it is very hard to find agricultural parcels l u 4 l u 5 for compensation in order to maintain the targeted land use l u 1 l u 2 l u 3 composition given that the existing urban areas cannot be modified in this case it is easier to maintain the structural properties of woodland and grassland land uses but the additional constraint on maintaining the agricultural area imposed under b a o further reduces the feasibility of compensation 5 4 relationship between cost and feasibility we analyse the feasibility of the 18 tested scenarios as a linear function of the median cost m e d c since the behaviour of the latter is more significant than that of m i n c fig 7 we observe that policy objective b o a green dots i e the case whose goal is to conserve woodland and grassland composition is the cheapest most feasible and therefore the easiest for a landscape manager to achieve as shown in the above sections alternative policy objectives that aim to achieve better ecological performance by going beyond the simple maintenance of surface area are generally more costly and less feasible than their simpler counterparts beyond this general finding we look here more precisely at the comparison between these two alternative policy objectives results show that shifting from policy objective b o g to policy objective b a o decreases costs fig 3 but it also decreases feasibility fig 6 whatever the municipality and the development considered we better show this particular behaviour in fig 8 where we can see that in both municipalities but especially in m 2 by shifting from b o g to b a o m e d c reduces but the feasibility also becomes lower this means that adding a constraint involving the maintenance of agricultural habitats requires smaller compensation areas i e lower cost but makes it harder to find a solution 6 discussion 6 1 the weaknesses of the current nnl policy although biodiversity offsetting looks appealing in theory the actual implementation of the law still remains open to interpretation weissgerbera et al 2019 moreno mateos et al 2015 and achieving nnl in practice raises a variety of problems biodiversity is a very complex concept and the legislation does not specify at which level it should be examined ordinary or extra ordinary species entire populations or functionalities and ecosystem services quétier et al 2012 bezombes et al 2019 neither does it specify which indicators and metrics should be adopted to correctly assess biodiversity and its loss marshall et al 2020 although the answer to none of these questions is obvious our results show that it is impossible to simply maintain the area of all the habitats despite its apparent triviality this result is crucial to proving the weakness of a strict vision of the nnl policy when biodiversity is approximated for by habitat areas as a consequence compensation generally only focuses on some habitats or features to be protected and or restored but even then it is still very difficult to maintain the ecological equivalence polasky et al 2020 beside this structural impossibility only focusing on area based compensation misses the impacts that development has on habitat configuration modifications to landscape structure are however known to have a major impact on biodiversity r k and moore 2004 although rarely considered as an option enhancing the landscape context may be as important as maintaining land use proportions in restoration projects de souza leite et al 2013 6 2 geometric based nnl principle an operational solution in order to overcome these problems this study explores different operational interpretations of the nnl principle based on certain landscape geometric properties since the relationship between ecological function and landscape structure is nowadays well known gustafson 2019 r k and moore 2004 this article tests compensation policies based on the relationship between biodiversity and landscape geometric properties landscape properties are quantified through a number of landscape metrics which have been chosen for their ability to capture important habitat features and for their ease of computation our study shows that a specification of the nnl principle based on geometric properties is able to meet compensation objectives to further examine the nnl specification we challenged these new operational interpretations of the nnl principle with different public policy objectives involving both biodiversity alone and coupled biodiversity agricultural objectives in order to assess their robustness more precisely we defined and compared three alternative policy objectives based on these metrics first a policy objective that consists of simply maintaining the area of semi natural habitats second one that aims to maintain other geometric properties of these habitats instead of area third one which adds to the second policy objective a further constraint on maintaining agricultural area in order to guarantee food production our results show that all three policy objectives make it possible to find compensation solutions the comparison of these three different public policy objectives highlights how they differ regarding both feasibility and compensation cost the policy based on the area of semi natural habitats only is the easiest and the least expensive in terms of median cost even though biodiversity outputs are expected to be limited indeed this policy only considers biodiversity as an area to be maintained and neglects many properties such as landscape fragmentation whose avoidance is essential for ecosystem conservation gustafson 2019 walz 2011 polasky et al 2020 furthermore compensation under such a policy implies the destruction of agricultural area which is then used for compensation and this has important negative consequences on food production in a context where the acquisition of agricultural land is becoming increasingly difficult le coent and calvet 2015 neglecting agricultural habitat in the compensation process moreover means failing to take into account a wide range of biodiversity already particularly threatened by global changes sánchez bayo and wyckhuys 2019 the other two policies which target better effects on biodiversity are both more costly and less feasible and differ in their positions in the trade off between feasibility and compensation costs more precisely with the public policy only preserving geometric properties of the landscape in our case the area of the largest patch and the division index a measure of fragmentation instead of the area of semi natural habitats compensation generally becomes more difficult and more expensive by adding a further constraint to the policy objective by insisting on the maintenance of the agricultural land area compensation becomes even more difficult lower feasibility the median cost associated with this compensation policy however decreases reflecting the fact that the set of possible solutions is reduced in a non uniform manner a likely explanation is that the additional constraints on agricultural areas reduces the set of possible solutions but tends towards the less costly ones in other words the costly compensation options involving inefficient shifts of land use in many agricultural parcels are no longer possible but the less costly options efficient in terms of land utilisation are still feasible this counter intuitive result is worthy of note since in such a complex decision making process involving non deterministic systems like ecosystems stakeholders are likely to choose sub optimal solutions kahneman and tversky 1979 therefore reducing the set of possible options towards those that are less costly is likely to have positive effects in such a context where stakeholders do not fully optimise their decisions the minimum cost metric is very sensitive to sampling and therefore our results analysis does not greatly emphasise it however it is interesting to note that the minimum cost of compensation when preserving other geometric properties is always lower or equal to that of maintaining the area which means that a landscape manager who carefully chooses where and how to compensate could achieve their objective using smaller areas when conserving certain targeted structural properties rather than focusing on surface area 6 3 limits and perspectives in this modelling framework we advocate a landscape perspective to capture functional dimensions of ecosystems at the landscape scale this choice presents the advantage of avoiding specific quantification of biodiversity which is always extremely ambiguous our model therefore captures overall ecosystem function rather than a specific component of biodiversity however it would be possible to include in addition to these landscape based proxies for the overall ecosystem indicators related to specific emblematic or endemic species if this proved to be relevant to another case study our model is a simple tool to study a possible alternative to ecological compensation and it can be very easily adapted to a variety of different scenarios according to the objective of the study and the situation considered a key metric central to landscape ecology that would be worth focusing on would be landscape heterogeneity however since definition of heterogeneity should be based on a functional categorisation of land uses that depends on the species considered fahrig et al 2011 the same issue applies to other metrics and the choice of the ecological equivalence criterion should therefore be carefully tuned to the ecosystem considered our modelling framework allows such a tuning of the ecological parameters considered which makes it applicable to different contexts not only can the scale of the landscape be modified and the land uses merged differently but also all the other parameters we defined can easily be modified to study a particular issue the choice of landscape metrics to be considered in the definition of public policies can be adapted according to conservation goals and can be easily implemented in our model in the same way other policy objectives can be defined with different constraints regulating biodiversity offsetting a more systematic analysis of the patterns found in the properties of the compensation patches would be a central perspective of this work it would therefore require extensive simulations and further methodological developments more complex performance indicators can also be defined to better evaluate the cost and feasibility of compensation processes the cost considered here depends on the compensated areas alone which is a significant simplification by defining more complex cost functions considering the kind of land uses changes the price of land or the externalities due to land use changes we could obtain a more precise picture of compensation costs the focus of this study is on the spatial dimension of the problem and in its current version our model is static adding a temporal dimension would be an interesting yet challenging perspective for future development but that is a strength of such an approach it is flexible and relatively easy to adapt to new questions in this article we have proposed an alternative to methods used to determine ecological compensation in practice beside all the benefits that our approach may bring to ecological compensation we still believe that such compensation raises many difficulties in practice being hard to both interpret and implement and having uncertain effects weissgerbera et al 2019 we therefore insist on the fact that wherever possible the first two steps of the mitigation hierarchy should always be preferred to compensation more effort should be made to avoid rather than compensate for damage to biodiversity while current legislation should be made clearer and controls strengthened on the basis of better knowledge of the consequences of development and restoration in this context more models should be developed to help decision makers

24192,in recent years biodiversity offsetting has been adopted as a conservation strategy in many different countries biodiversity offsets are mechanisms used to compensate for ecological impacts resulting from development projects especially those on non built land uses they usually rely on an equivalence principle based on achieving strict equality between the area that is developed and that which is offset this approach still remains very controversial this article explores an alternative offset design method where we look at biodiversity from a functional perspective and conceive public policies that aim to conserve biodiversity by maintaining important structural features of the landscape not limited to the proportion occupied by each land use we develop a spatially explicit land use change model to implement our geometric based compensation method and we define three different versions of the public compensation policy we apply the model to real case studies in two french municipalities and we compare the cost and feasibility of compensation under the different public policies we find that offsetting is easier and cheaper when public policies aim to conserve no more than the targeted semi natural land area but this approach has major ecological limits when considering more complex geometric properties of the landscape and therefore higher ecological expectations compensation becomes on average more difficult and more expensive our work shows how new approaches to ecological compensation could be defined and how models could help select the best options in the field keywords biodiversity offsetting landscape spatial model ecological compensation landscape metrics genetic algorithm data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction to mitigate the ecological crisis one public policy strategy consists of requiring ecological compensation when implementing development projects weissgerbera et al 2019 this kind of policy has been applied in different countries such as the usa mckenney and kiesecker 2010 germany rundcrantz and skärbäck 2013 and france quetier et al 2013 wende et al 2018 this principle is affirmed in most of the european union s environmental legislation in france the mitigation hierarchy was incorporated into environmental law in 1976 but the offsets policy was strengthened only forty years later with law n 2016 1087 of 8 august 2016 in france this public policy is built on three successive steps also called mitigation hierarchy levrel et al 2018 bigard et al 2020 first project managers must avoid ecological impacts as far as possible second they must reduce residual impacts third the remaining residual impacts must be compensated for the compensation relies on an equivalence principle quétier et al 2012 the loss of biodiversity in one place has to be compensated for in a different place the overall aim of this three step procedure is to achieve no net loss nnl of biodiversity weissgerbera et al 2019 however the efficiency of biodiversity offsetting also called ecological compensation remains controversial the first limit of this method is the difficulty of unambiguously quantifying biodiversity moreno mateos et al 2015 marshall et al 2020 grimm 2021 since the choice of metrics is critical in determining the success of offsetting but evaluating biodiversity is not easy and many different indicators could be used zu ermgassen et al 2019 simpson et al 2022 marshall et al 2021 indeed biodiversity is a complex concept involving dynamics and spatial patterns moilanena and kotiahoc 2018 as well as different levels of characterisation gene species population ecosystem in such a context evaluating biodiversity loss becomes a difficult process the second limit relates to endemic or emblematic ecosystems or species which might be difficult to compensate for jones and bull 2020 the third limit concerns the time horizon of the compensation while it has been shown that urban development has long term effects and delayed consequences the impact of restoration usually only has a mid or even short term perspective weissgerbera et al 2019 finally if the loss of biodiversity is too great the no net loss objective might be unrealistic making ecological offsetting inappropriate bezombes et al 2019 weissgerbera et al 2019 other criticisms relate to the practical conditions under which offsetting is implemented indeed there is a lack of control protocols covering the efficiency of compensation measures calvet et al 2015 quetier et al 2013 bezombes et al 2019 theis et al 2019 in this context the design of offsetting measures remains a sensitive issue in public policy debate current offsetting strategies are often based on restricted targets one species or habitat area and a common measure of offsetting benefits is simply the ratio between the damaged and compensatory areas which is based on an equivalence principle of extremely limited ecological value quétier et al 2012 ban et al 2022 in this article we investigate an alternative method for defining equivalence based on a more functional approach the objective is to maintain overall ecosystem function rather than similar land use composition it is now well known that landscape structure plays a major role in ecosystem functioning r k and moore 2004 grafius et al 2018 gustafson 2019 and landscape properties appear as a sound although insufficiently studied alternative to land use proportions in ecological compensation processes in this article we therefore explore offsetting design through the maintenance of landscape structure providing a simple but very adaptable tool for researchers and landscape managers technically this structure can be assessed using geometric properties and indicators these indicators can be related to different biodiversity features such as species diversity largest patch index patch density bailey et al 2007 tasser et al 2008 or landscape fragmentation mesh size division index jaeger 2000 landscape metrics regarding fragmentation or connectivity have been widely used to analyse ecosystem services walz 2011 frank et al 2012 the interest of these geometric properties is to capture some of the structural characteristics of the landscape that might guarantee sustainable long term biodiversity dynamics the objective of the paper is methodological we develop a spatially explicit land use change model to implement our geometric based offsetting method in response to development we use a genetic algorithm hamblin 2013 witing et al 2022 ban et al 2022 to look for compensation landscapes that maintain the chosen geometric properties by shifting the land uses of some of the parcels based on this model we explore different public policies regulating ecological compensation following the nnl objective built on different geometric properties of the landscape to be maintained or improved the model is applied to real case studies with six land uses corresponding to urban areas different cropping areas and different woodland and grassland areas we explore the maps of two french municipalities displaying different geometric architecture in order to illustrate the type of results generated by the model one of the main advantages of our modelling framework is its relative simplicity which as a consequence offers strong potential for generalisation from this viewpoint our modelling framework can be applied in different contexts including different geographical areas and land use change issues 2 the landscapes studied 2 1 municipalities we choose to work at the scale of the municipality the smallest french administrative division making public decisions that is still meaningful for landscape development plans and is also consistent with the organisational level of the ecosystem this scale is still large enough to observe the effects of the development compensation process but still computationally tractable at this early development stage of our modelling framework in fact when the geographical area to be analysed is increased the computing time required by the genetic algorithm to look for compensation increases exponentially note however that changing the scale of the study does not imply any methodological difficulty we studied two french municipalities in the loiret department in the centre val de loire region we selected these two municipalities due to their different sizes and very different landscape configurations as detailed in the next section the first chevilly 45093 covers 41 76 km 2 with balanced proportions of cropland and woodland the second ligny le ribault 45182 covers 59 21 km 2 mainly occupied by broad leaved woodland henceforth we refer to them respectively as m 1 chevilly and m 2 ligny le ribault 2 2 land uses we obtained land use maps of these two municipalities to serve as the basis of our model we defined a small number of general land uses which are considered as proxies for habitats and thus as indicators of the biodiversity level we used the land cover data provided by the cesbio center for the study of the biosphere from space we worked with the 2017 map of france in raster layer format with a spatial resolution of 20 metres and 17 classes or land uses data are available in shape file format in open source at government cadastral website we merged the 17 classes of the cesbio database into six land uses table 1 the remaining cesbio classes natural mineral surfaces beaches water and glaciers were not considered since they are minor land uses in the landscapes involved and they are little impacted by either development or the compensation process the two municipalities we studied have different land use compositions table 2 in m 1 fig 1 a the main land use is seasonal crops l u 5 representing 57 of the total area followed by broad leaved woodland l u 1 35 of the total area m 2 fig 1 b is mainly covered in broad leaved woodland l u 1 68 of the total area followed by coniferous woodland l u 2 18 of the total area and a very small area 1 5 of seasonal crops l u 5 we also observe that the two municipalities have different spatial distribution of their land uses fig 1 in m 1 the two main land uses are organised into two distinct zones while in m 2 l u 5 areas are very small and scattered among l u 1 areas the units to be developed and compensated for are parcels m 1 contains a total of 3024 parcels while m 2 contains 4040 by choosing these two different municipalities m 1 and m 2 we want to evaluate the impact of the original landscape s geometric properties on the performance in terms of compensation 3 public policies and landscape metrics 3 1 general purpose of public policies when a parcel of land in a landscape is developed the proportion of land uses and other landscape structure properties are modified public policy should regulate ecological compensation in order to recreate a new landscape achieving the nnl objective in our model this corresponds to the maintenance of certain specific landscape properties which we quantify through a number of meaningful landscape metrics 3 2 landscape metrics landscape metrics are an important tool in quantifying those elements of a landscape s spatial structure that have an impact on the ecological processes operating within it haines young and chopping 1996 many different numerical indices have been defined with this scope ranging from area to diversity metrics which allow the monitoring of different aspects of biodiversity since we are adopting an ecosystem approach rather than focusing on particular species we consider here three general simple intuitive metrics these can be easily measured using the fragstats program and interpreted in relation to landscape properties walz 2011 by capturing these structural and functional properties of the landscape we can evaluate and compare the compensation options by considering landscape metrics as indicators of biodiversity our goal is not to unambiguously quantify biodiversity and address emblematic species and ecosystem problems but to capture some properties of the landscape that can be important in the maintenance of biodiversity we choose a few intuitive metrics to test our model but in our method the landscape metrics under consideration can very easily be changed in order to address specific issues this is important when designing biodiversity offset programs gelcich et al 2017 percentage of landscape p l a n d the percentage of the total area occupied by a class for a given l u i it is defined as p l a n d i j 1 n a i j a 100 where a i j is the area in m 2 of patch j in class i and a is the total area in m 2 of the landscape largest patch index l p i the percentage of land occupied by the largest patch of a given class it is often considered as a predictor of species diversity walz 2011 for l u i it is defined as l p i i max j 1 n a i j a 100 where a i j is the area of patch j of l u i and a is the total area of the landscape division index d i v an indicator of landscape fragmentation walz 2011 it is defined as the probability that two randomly chosen places in the landscape are not situated in the same undivided patch for l u i it is defined as d i v i 1 j 1 n a i j a 2 given that 0 d i v 1 d i v equals zero if the entire landscape consists of one single patch and it increases the more the landscape is broken into separate patches notice that although this article focuses on a few specific metrics a strong point of our approach is that it remains robust to a change of metrics in the case where one metric or another would be more appropriate to a given case 3 3 public policy objectives we specify a public policy s objective by a set of constraints of these landscape metrics measured in the original landscape and in the compensated one let x i be a landscape metric index measured for land use i and let x i c and x i o be respectively the index value measured in the compensated landscape and in the original one we first define 1 δ x i x c i x o i where δ x i measures the variation of the landscape metric index from the original landscape to the compensated one public policy objectives then consist of a set of constraints in the form δ x i 0 where the sign depends on the ecological quality behaviour with respect to the targeted index if the ecological value of the measured property is increasing with respect to index x then δ x is considered otherwise if the ecological quality decreases with the index then in the policy objectives explained below we consider δ x we define three different public policy objectives two of which correspond to maintaining only biodiversity and the third to maintaining both biodiversity and agricultural production notice that it is impossible to maintain the area of each type of land since we assume that developed parcels cannot be changed back into undeveloped ones this trivial result illustrates a major structural failure in the classical area equivalence compensation policies since it is not possible to strictly maintain the area of all habitats once development occurs biodiversity objective b o the objective of these two policies is to maintain or to increase biodiversity alone by conserving or improving certain geometric properties of selected land uses hosting biodiversity bo in the first case bo a the geometric property of the selected land uses to be conserved is the area the aim of the public policy is translated in terms of constraints on the landscape metrics as follows 2 bo a δ p l a n d i 0 i 1 2 3 in the second scenario bo g the objective consists of preserving more complex geometric properties of the same land uses namely largest patch index l p i and division index d i v it is defined as follows 3 bo g δ l p i i 0 i 1 2 3 δ d i v i 0 δ d i v i 0 i 1 2 3 biodiversity and agricultural production objective b a o we define one more policy whose objective is to maintain in addition to biodiversity conservation agricultural food production achieved by conserving agricultural land area in this case thus bao targets the area p l a n d of agricultural land uses and other geometric properties of woodlands and grasslands namely l p i and d i v this corresponds to the following set of constraints 4 bao δ l p i i 0 i 1 2 3 δ d i v i 0 δ d i v i 0 i 1 2 3 δ p l a n d i 0 i 4 5 4 simulation plan 4 1 introduction to the model in fig 2 we show the conceptual scheme of our compensation process for a given development of a parcel of land in one of the two municipalities we use a genetic algorithm hamblin 2013 witing et al 2022 ban et al 2022 to look for compensation landscapes that maintain the chosen geometric properties by shifting the land uses of some of the other parcels the set of properties to be maintained is defined by the public policy applied we then evaluate the cost and feasibility of successful compensation measures in order to compare the effects of the different public policies as well as the impact of the landscape s original structure and the given development 4 2 developments in each municipality we studied three urban developments where a parcel of land occupied by broad leaved woodland is built upon development corresponds to a shift of land use from l u 1 to l u 6 the three development cases studied differ in size and in their position with respect to the largest patch u 1 urban development of a parcel respectively of 122 pixels 1 1 1 pixel 2 64 1 0 4 m in m 1 and 74 in m 2 that is not in the largest patch u 2 urban development of a parcel of 56 pixels in both municipalities in the largest patch with u 2 we wanted to test the behaviour of compensation in the case of a development that affects the largest patch we expect it to have an impact under b o g and under b a o u 3 urban development of a very large parcel respectively of 511 pixels and 492 pixels in the largest patch with u 3 we wanted to test the behaviour of compensation in the case of a very large development especially as far as feasibility is concerned 4 3 tested scenarios in table 3 we summarise all the tested scenarios in each of the two municipalities m 1 and m 2 we simulate three different developments u 1 u 2 u 3 and each of these developments is compensated under three different policy objectives b o a b o g b a o we thus test a total of 18 different compensation scenarios named by concatenating the acronyms of the public policy the development and the municipality 4 4 the compensation process once the given parcel is developed we simulate the compensation process by using a genetic algorithm a search and optimisation technique based on natural selection largely used in ecology hamblin 2013 ban et al 2022 witing et al 2022 as well as in a variety of other fields the genetic algorithm we have defined is such that one parcel of land bigger than 3 pixels in the same municipality is randomly selected and every land use except urban is tested and evaluated the fitness function is defined accordingly to the policy s objective and it depends on the deltas of the landscape metric indexes measured for the different land uses involved it is linearly increasing in the ecological value of the compensated landscape full details on the genetic algorithm and the associated fitness function can be found in the python source code available on github 2 2 https github com ilariabrun spatialmodelforbiodiversityoffsetting if the fitness function improves but is not optimal the compensation continues with a second parcel and so on until the compensation is successful i e all the constraints are satisfied the compensation fails if after 400 attempts i e internal loops the fitness function does not improve and thus no compensation is found the number of internal loops has been chosen in order to have both a good rate of success and a good computable tractability we define a binary variable s u c c e s f a i l u r e to keep track of the internal cycle performance when the compensation is successful we also keep track of the total number of compensated pixels which is considered as an estimation of the compensation cost 4 5 meta simulation for each of the 18 scenarios defined we simulated 2000 compensation processes to evaluate the economic impact of public ecological compensation we assess the scenarios described above using a set of three indicators two related to the cost of compensation and one to its feasibility for each scenario we consider the median compensation cost m e d c and the minimum compensation cost m i n c among the 2000 simulated compensation processes the former provides information about the average cost in the case of a blind landscape manager the latter provides information about the cost when the landscape manager is willing able to minimise it note that we consider the median in order to eliminate outlier effects observed for the average we then complete this cost information by an assessment of the feasibility of the compensation process this feasibility is defined by the percentage of successful compensation trials among the 2000 that were simulated 5 results 5 1 median cost in this section we analyse the behaviour of the median cost m e d c of compensation under the different tested scenarios where m e d c is the median of the costs of all successful simulated compensation processes and the cost is defined as the normalised number of compensated pixels normalised for the size of the development an interesting result obtained for the median cost m e d c concerns the comparison among different policy objectives where a hierarchy clearly emerges in both municipalities we find that m e d c b o g m e d c b a o m e d c b o a with only one exception for development u 1 in municipality m 1 where m e d c b o g m e d c b o a see fig 3 under b o g in blue m e d c is always higher in both municipalities no matter the type of development in municipality m 1 the gap between the costs for different policy objectives is more obvious this quasi systematic ranking means that policy objective b o g which conserves some structural properties namely l p i and d i v of land uses l u 1 l u 2 and l u 3 is more costly than b o a which conserves only the surface area of these lus and this is true for both the municipalities tested and all types of development furthermore under b o a the compensated area is never more than twice that which is developed while to achieve b o g the compensated area is always bigger even reaching 20 times the original area in the case of scenario b o a u 2 m 1 it is interesting to note that under b a o where besides the maintenance of some structural properties of woods and grassland l u 1 l u 2 and l u 3 a further constraint is added in terms of the surface area of agricultural land use l u 4 l u 5 m e d c is lower than under b o g this result can be explained by the fact that the constraint imposed on the maintenance of the agricultural land uses obliges less invasive compensation to be considered since agricultural land must be conserved in our case study the shape of the municipality does not affect the ranking of compensation scenarios but it still has an impact on the marginal differences within municipality m 2 mainly covered by woodland l u 1 the differences between the costs for b o a and b a o are smaller than in m 1 where the main land use is seasonal crops l u 5 concentrated in the northern part of the municipality followed by woodland l u 1 concentrated in the south fig 3 thus since in m 2 the percentage of agricultural land use is really low 1 5 see table 2 compared to that in m 1 57 it is naturally less costly to maintain those areas as expected when the developed parcel is in the largest patch as for u 2 and u 3 the compensation for b o g and b a o is more costly than for u 1 this observation can be explained by the fact that both scenarios impose the maintenance of the largest patch area l p i as a consequence an impact of the development in the largest patch calls for a greater number of compensated pixels see fig 4 5 2 minimum cost although minimal cost is very sensitive to sampling exploring the minimum cost of compensation under the different tested scenarios still reveals interesting patterns the minimum cost minimum of the normalised number of compensated pixels normalised per unit area of development is defined as the minima of all the different successful configurations of compensation simulated the behaviour of the minimum cost is very different to that of the median cost and no clear hierarchy emerges among the different policy objectives fig 5 as expected in both municipalities the m i n c under b o a is 1 for all the 18 scenarios since the only policy objective is to conserve the area of green landscapes under b o g the compensated area is always smaller or equal to the developed area this would mean that by carefully choosing where and how to compensate in order to maintain the targeted structural properties of woods and grasslands l u 1 l u 2 l u 3 then a much smaller area can be used in compensation furthermore we see that unlike the situation for the median cost m e d c for the three tested developments in both municipalities under policy objective b o g preserving structural properties of green landscapes the minimum compensation cost m i n c is lower than or equal to that under the other two policy objectives while m e d c was the highest in the equivalent case in general for m i n c the differences between the different scenarios is rather small and the hierarchy among the different policy objectives depends on the municipality as well as on the location of the development in municipality m 2 for all the developments under policy objective b o a the compensation processes have the highest m i n c while m e d c is the lowest in these cases see fig 3 this behaviour of m i n c suggests that by carefully choosing the compensation one could compensate using smaller areas under b o g and b a o that is by targeting more complex structural properties than the area of l u 1 l u 2 and l u 3 we also observe that in municipality m 2 we find that m i n c b o g m i n c b a o since the percentage of agricultural land is very low in this municipality the constraint of maintaining this area imposed under b a o has a weak impact on the cost of compensation finally we observe that in m 2 the minimum costs of compensation under b o g and b a o are lower than in m 1 this is due to the particular configuration of land uses in m 2 which makes it easier to maintain the habitats properties 5 3 feasibility this section analyses the feasibility of the compensation processes which measures the ratio of successful compensation processes to the total number simulated we study the feasibility under the three policy objectives for the 18 tested scenarios we observe that under b o a and b o g policies compensation is generally very easy especially in m 1 fig 6 compensation proves to be more difficult under b a o in red on the right hand side for each municipality when the rate of success is lower this result means that it is generally harder to maintain both the area of agricultural land l u 4 l u 5 and the targeted structural properties of woodland and grassland l u 1 l u 2 l u 3 than to just consider either the area b o a in green or the structural properties of the latter land uses b o g in blue the gap is particularly evident in the case of u 3 very big development in the largest patch in m 1 where the feasibility of compensation in scenario b a o u 3 m 1 is around 20 while it is 100 for the other two policy objectives as a matter of fact with such a big development to compensate for it is very difficult to find a successful compensation under b a o which requires maintenance of the areas of agricultural parcels and of the more complex structural properties of woodland and grassland for the same kind of development the situation changes in municipality m 2 where for the three scenarios the feasibility is lower in particular the lowest feasibility is observed under b o a maintenance of the area of woodland and grassland since this municipality is mainly covered by grassland and woods and the developed area is very big it is very hard to find agricultural parcels l u 4 l u 5 for compensation in order to maintain the targeted land use l u 1 l u 2 l u 3 composition given that the existing urban areas cannot be modified in this case it is easier to maintain the structural properties of woodland and grassland land uses but the additional constraint on maintaining the agricultural area imposed under b a o further reduces the feasibility of compensation 5 4 relationship between cost and feasibility we analyse the feasibility of the 18 tested scenarios as a linear function of the median cost m e d c since the behaviour of the latter is more significant than that of m i n c fig 7 we observe that policy objective b o a green dots i e the case whose goal is to conserve woodland and grassland composition is the cheapest most feasible and therefore the easiest for a landscape manager to achieve as shown in the above sections alternative policy objectives that aim to achieve better ecological performance by going beyond the simple maintenance of surface area are generally more costly and less feasible than their simpler counterparts beyond this general finding we look here more precisely at the comparison between these two alternative policy objectives results show that shifting from policy objective b o g to policy objective b a o decreases costs fig 3 but it also decreases feasibility fig 6 whatever the municipality and the development considered we better show this particular behaviour in fig 8 where we can see that in both municipalities but especially in m 2 by shifting from b o g to b a o m e d c reduces but the feasibility also becomes lower this means that adding a constraint involving the maintenance of agricultural habitats requires smaller compensation areas i e lower cost but makes it harder to find a solution 6 discussion 6 1 the weaknesses of the current nnl policy although biodiversity offsetting looks appealing in theory the actual implementation of the law still remains open to interpretation weissgerbera et al 2019 moreno mateos et al 2015 and achieving nnl in practice raises a variety of problems biodiversity is a very complex concept and the legislation does not specify at which level it should be examined ordinary or extra ordinary species entire populations or functionalities and ecosystem services quétier et al 2012 bezombes et al 2019 neither does it specify which indicators and metrics should be adopted to correctly assess biodiversity and its loss marshall et al 2020 although the answer to none of these questions is obvious our results show that it is impossible to simply maintain the area of all the habitats despite its apparent triviality this result is crucial to proving the weakness of a strict vision of the nnl policy when biodiversity is approximated for by habitat areas as a consequence compensation generally only focuses on some habitats or features to be protected and or restored but even then it is still very difficult to maintain the ecological equivalence polasky et al 2020 beside this structural impossibility only focusing on area based compensation misses the impacts that development has on habitat configuration modifications to landscape structure are however known to have a major impact on biodiversity r k and moore 2004 although rarely considered as an option enhancing the landscape context may be as important as maintaining land use proportions in restoration projects de souza leite et al 2013 6 2 geometric based nnl principle an operational solution in order to overcome these problems this study explores different operational interpretations of the nnl principle based on certain landscape geometric properties since the relationship between ecological function and landscape structure is nowadays well known gustafson 2019 r k and moore 2004 this article tests compensation policies based on the relationship between biodiversity and landscape geometric properties landscape properties are quantified through a number of landscape metrics which have been chosen for their ability to capture important habitat features and for their ease of computation our study shows that a specification of the nnl principle based on geometric properties is able to meet compensation objectives to further examine the nnl specification we challenged these new operational interpretations of the nnl principle with different public policy objectives involving both biodiversity alone and coupled biodiversity agricultural objectives in order to assess their robustness more precisely we defined and compared three alternative policy objectives based on these metrics first a policy objective that consists of simply maintaining the area of semi natural habitats second one that aims to maintain other geometric properties of these habitats instead of area third one which adds to the second policy objective a further constraint on maintaining agricultural area in order to guarantee food production our results show that all three policy objectives make it possible to find compensation solutions the comparison of these three different public policy objectives highlights how they differ regarding both feasibility and compensation cost the policy based on the area of semi natural habitats only is the easiest and the least expensive in terms of median cost even though biodiversity outputs are expected to be limited indeed this policy only considers biodiversity as an area to be maintained and neglects many properties such as landscape fragmentation whose avoidance is essential for ecosystem conservation gustafson 2019 walz 2011 polasky et al 2020 furthermore compensation under such a policy implies the destruction of agricultural area which is then used for compensation and this has important negative consequences on food production in a context where the acquisition of agricultural land is becoming increasingly difficult le coent and calvet 2015 neglecting agricultural habitat in the compensation process moreover means failing to take into account a wide range of biodiversity already particularly threatened by global changes sánchez bayo and wyckhuys 2019 the other two policies which target better effects on biodiversity are both more costly and less feasible and differ in their positions in the trade off between feasibility and compensation costs more precisely with the public policy only preserving geometric properties of the landscape in our case the area of the largest patch and the division index a measure of fragmentation instead of the area of semi natural habitats compensation generally becomes more difficult and more expensive by adding a further constraint to the policy objective by insisting on the maintenance of the agricultural land area compensation becomes even more difficult lower feasibility the median cost associated with this compensation policy however decreases reflecting the fact that the set of possible solutions is reduced in a non uniform manner a likely explanation is that the additional constraints on agricultural areas reduces the set of possible solutions but tends towards the less costly ones in other words the costly compensation options involving inefficient shifts of land use in many agricultural parcels are no longer possible but the less costly options efficient in terms of land utilisation are still feasible this counter intuitive result is worthy of note since in such a complex decision making process involving non deterministic systems like ecosystems stakeholders are likely to choose sub optimal solutions kahneman and tversky 1979 therefore reducing the set of possible options towards those that are less costly is likely to have positive effects in such a context where stakeholders do not fully optimise their decisions the minimum cost metric is very sensitive to sampling and therefore our results analysis does not greatly emphasise it however it is interesting to note that the minimum cost of compensation when preserving other geometric properties is always lower or equal to that of maintaining the area which means that a landscape manager who carefully chooses where and how to compensate could achieve their objective using smaller areas when conserving certain targeted structural properties rather than focusing on surface area 6 3 limits and perspectives in this modelling framework we advocate a landscape perspective to capture functional dimensions of ecosystems at the landscape scale this choice presents the advantage of avoiding specific quantification of biodiversity which is always extremely ambiguous our model therefore captures overall ecosystem function rather than a specific component of biodiversity however it would be possible to include in addition to these landscape based proxies for the overall ecosystem indicators related to specific emblematic or endemic species if this proved to be relevant to another case study our model is a simple tool to study a possible alternative to ecological compensation and it can be very easily adapted to a variety of different scenarios according to the objective of the study and the situation considered a key metric central to landscape ecology that would be worth focusing on would be landscape heterogeneity however since definition of heterogeneity should be based on a functional categorisation of land uses that depends on the species considered fahrig et al 2011 the same issue applies to other metrics and the choice of the ecological equivalence criterion should therefore be carefully tuned to the ecosystem considered our modelling framework allows such a tuning of the ecological parameters considered which makes it applicable to different contexts not only can the scale of the landscape be modified and the land uses merged differently but also all the other parameters we defined can easily be modified to study a particular issue the choice of landscape metrics to be considered in the definition of public policies can be adapted according to conservation goals and can be easily implemented in our model in the same way other policy objectives can be defined with different constraints regulating biodiversity offsetting a more systematic analysis of the patterns found in the properties of the compensation patches would be a central perspective of this work it would therefore require extensive simulations and further methodological developments more complex performance indicators can also be defined to better evaluate the cost and feasibility of compensation processes the cost considered here depends on the compensated areas alone which is a significant simplification by defining more complex cost functions considering the kind of land uses changes the price of land or the externalities due to land use changes we could obtain a more precise picture of compensation costs the focus of this study is on the spatial dimension of the problem and in its current version our model is static adding a temporal dimension would be an interesting yet challenging perspective for future development but that is a strength of such an approach it is flexible and relatively easy to adapt to new questions in this article we have proposed an alternative to methods used to determine ecological compensation in practice beside all the benefits that our approach may bring to ecological compensation we still believe that such compensation raises many difficulties in practice being hard to both interpret and implement and having uncertain effects weissgerbera et al 2019 we therefore insist on the fact that wherever possible the first two steps of the mitigation hierarchy should always be preferred to compensation more effort should be made to avoid rather than compensate for damage to biodiversity while current legislation should be made clearer and controls strengthened on the basis of better knowledge of the consequences of development and restoration in this context more models should be developed to help decision makers

24193,indirect effects index iei and cycling index fci are two key measures of ecological network analysis that are known to be correlated systems with high iei values are assumed to be more stable and resilient while this makes sense from a theoretical point of view there is lack of evidence on the contribution of indirect interactions to ecosystem stability and resilience investigation of this relationship between resilience and indirect effects leads to a better understanding of iei that it is actually a sum of three distinct components iei cycle iei mixed and iei pure each of which is identified by their relation to cycling iei and fci are highly correlated because both values increase with average path length path which is the average number of compartments a unit flow material passes through before exiting the system while iei and fci are highly correlated the third component of iei iei pure is totally uncorrelated with cycling this is because the effects of cycling are excluded from iei pure by definition interestingly we find out that iei pure is the major contributor to ecosystem resilience keywords resilience indirect effects cycling network particle tracking ecological network analysis individual based model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction indirect effects can be defined as the impact of one organism or species on another mediated or transmitted by a third for compartmental ecosystem models patten 1978 classifies the transfer of mass or energy from a compartment to another as a direct effect only if it occurs between two adjacent compartments through a direct flow otherwise as indirect effect if other compartments are involved in this transfer indirect effects index iei represents the proportion of total transactions of biomass or energy that are not adjacent ma and kazanci 2013 wootton 2002 claims that indirect effects cause the challenge to predict the impacts of environmental change thus a better understanding of indirect effects is critical to understand and predict ecosystem behavior min et al 2011 states that indirect effects are assumed to be the major causes of the complexity and stability for ecological networks indeed from a theoretical perspective it makes sense that high redundancy of energy or biomass flow among model compartments indicated by high iei values may provide resistance to environmental perturbations and impacts there is little information about the relation between indirect effects and stability or resilience however therefore in this paper we investigate the very question posed by krivtsov 2004 2009 what is the relative contribution of indirect interactions to resistance and resilience to address this question we study the correlation between indirect effects and resilience using 10 000 models derived from the silver springs energy flow model odum 1957 second we investigate what makes iei correlates with resilience this investigation leads to the well known similarity between cycling and indirect effects similar to indirect effects cycling index finn 1976 1982 is another essential ecological indicator for ecosystem analysis it measures how much of the environmental input into a system is cycled before exiting that system according to odum 1969 cycling of energy is an indicator of maturity of a system while cycling of carbon can be a sign of a more stressed community and appears to be a counter indicator of ecosystem health wulff and ulanowicz 1989 fath 2004 using a set of large scale cyber networks observes a strong correlation between indirect effects and cycling this high correlation is also confirmed by kazanci and ma 2015 using 52 real ecosystem models from literature while high cycling systems tend to have high indirect effects the inverse is not always true consequently iei is a composite measure involving some parts that are highly related to cycling as well as some that are independent of cycling we decompose indirect effects into three disjoint components iei pure iei cycle and iei mixed based on their relation to cycling while iei cycle and iei mixed are highly dependent on fci iei pure is totally unrelated to fci using the same 10 000 model set we show that iei pure is the major component of iei contributing to resilience 2 indirect effects and cycling 2 1 definitions of iei and fci ecosystems are often modeled as compartmental systems where active members in the ecosystem are categorized into compartments and transactions of specific currencies among compartments are identified and measured total effects in the system represent all relations among all compartments depending on whether the effects between two compartments is transmitted via others effects are classified into two categories direct d and indirect i the i d ratio is defined to represent the ratio of indirect to direct effects indirect effect index iei computed as i i d represents the proportion of indirect effects ma and kazanci 2012 to quantify cycling total system throughflow is divided into two parts flows generated by first visits and flows generated through cycling the proportion of this second part is defined as finn s cycling index fci computation of iei and fci relies on the flow information in the ecological system z i rate of environmental input to compartment i y i rate of environmental output from compartment i f i j rate of direct flow from compartment j to compartment i throughflow t i is the rate of material or energy moving through compartment i input throughflow is defined as the sum of flow rates into compartment i from other compartments and the environment similarly output throughflow is the sum of flow rates from compartment i to other compartments and the environment for a system at steady state input and output throughflows are equal to each other t i j 1 n f i j z i j 1 n f j i y i where n represents the number of compartments in the system total system throughflow tst is the sum of all throughflows in the system the flow intensity matrix g is obtained by normalizing the rows of the flow matrix f by the throughflow vector t g i j f i j t j the matrix g represents the fraction of the flow material originating from j and moving to i directly j i therefore by definition g i j 1 for all i j similarly g 2 i j is the fraction of the flow moving to j from i over two steps j k i in general g m i j represents the fraction of the flow material from j to i over m steps j i m the sum of all powers of the g matrix defines the throughflow analysis matrix n 1 n i boundary g direct g 2 g 3 indirect i g 1 where i is the identity matrix not to be confused with the i used later to denote the indirect effects n i j represents the throughflow generated at compartment i by per unit input at compartment j patten 1978 defines the ratio of indirect to direct flow i d as a measure to quantify the effect of indirect relations among compartments relative to direct connections 2 i d unit i 1 n j 1 n g 2 g 3 i 1 n j 1 n g i 1 n n i g 1 i 1 n g 1 where 1 is a vector of ones ma and kazanci 2013 find out the eq 2 compares indirect and direct flows generated by unit throughflows at all compartments but not by the actual throughflows therefore a revised formulation for i d is proposed as follows 3 i d revised i 1 n g 2 g 3 t i 1 n g t i d ratio can take any value from zero to infinity zero implies that no indirect effects exist direct effects equal indirect effects if i d 1 dominance of indirect effects holds if 1 i d direct effects dominate if 0 i d 1 the interval of values where dominance of indirect hypothesis holds is of length infinity whereas the interval of values where direct effects dominate is of length 1 to eliminate this imbalance ma and kazanci 2013 defines the indirect effects index iei which is derived by rescaling the i d ratio as follows 4 i e i i i d i d 1 i d iei acts much like fci with a range between zero and one for an ecological network iei 0 0 5 and 1 imply no indirect effects equal amount of direct and indirect effects and no direct effects respectively note that iei can never be equal to one though can be arbitrarily close to one the computation of fci depends on the throughflow analysis matrix n as well by definition diagonal values n i i represent the amount of throughflow generated at compartment i by one unit input into compartment i a unit input into compartment i contributes to its throughflow t i at least once therefore if n i i is larger than 1 then the difference n i i 1 represents the amount of throughflow generated at compartment i through cycling finn 1978 defines his cycling index based on this idea as the fraction of the total system throughflow t s t that is due to cycling t s t c as follows f c i t s t c t s t 1 t s t i 1 n t i n i i 1 n i i 2 2 comparison of iei and fci for an accurate statistical comparison of iei and fci we use both artificial and real ecological networks in this section we first check the correlation between iei and fci using a set of conceptual networks we generated 100 000 conceptual models representing all possible networks with up to five compartments as shown in fig 1 a compromising number five is chosen as the network size mainly because of the significantly heavier computation required to study all possible networks with more than five compartments while there are usually three to five trophic levels in an ecosystem our conceptual model is able to represent an ecosystem with up to five trophic levels thus is not too simple to build such 100 000 conceptual models we initially define a fully connected five compartment network which has the potential to represent any network at steady state with up to five compartments we then assign flow rates ranging from zero to 1 0 5 individually for each flow environmental input and output while making sure the system is at steady state assigning zero flow rates is effectively deleting flows creating sub networks with simpler structures similarly if all flow rates in and out of a specific compartment happen to be zero then the resulting network will represent models with only four compartments therefore by randomizing flow rates in this fully connected five compartment model it is theoretically possible to generate all possible networks of up to five compartments while the set of all networks with up to five compartments has infinite elements we set our sampling strategy so that any steady state network with less than six compartments is very close exactly the same in terms of structure and very similar in terms of flow rates to one of the 100 000 networks that we generated therefore although a fully connected network such as the one shown in fig 1 is not a realistic representation of an actual ecosystem it is guaranteed that any ecological network with up to five compartments is closely represented in our sample set of 100 000 networks we then compute iei and fci for each of the 100 000 elements of our sample network set fig 2 shows a scatter plot of iei and fci for all networks we find it striking that regardless of the network structure topology and flow rate values an extremely strong correlation between fci and iei is observed even for unrealistic networks as fci increases the variation of iei decreases dramatically for non cycling networks f c i 0 iei ranges between zero and 0 6 however for networks with 80 cycling f c i 0 8 iei can be estimated to be 0 9 with very little error this experiment confirms the strong correlation between iei and fci however the vertical spread of data i e the high variation of iei especially for small fci values requires further attention our preliminary result is based on a set of conceptual networks of up to five compartments most of which are probably unrealistic this observation may not hold for real ecological networks which may have higher number of compartments and connections and be more complex in general in order to check if our observation extends to real life cases we compute the iei and fci of thirty real ecosystem models selected from literature with number of compartments ranging from 4 to 125 table 1 provides the detailed information for each model used in this analysis including references fig 3 is created by superimposing the scatter plot of iei vs fci for these thirty ecosystem models onto fig 2 as all thirty ecological networks have fci values lower than 0 35 we only show the scatter plot for fci between 0 to 0 35 fig 3 shows that real and conceptual ecological network models show pretty consistent results for iei vs fci despite the fact that most of the conceptual models are actually unrealistic and that some real ecosystem models are a lot larger and more complex combining real models with a high number of conceptual networks enable us to reach a more general conclusion on this special relationship between iei and fci which transcends the model structure flow currency and network size 3 decomposing indirect effects the strong correlation between iei and fci indicate that they quantify a similar attribute of the network but the variability of iei reveals that iei involves an attribute that is independent of cycling neither the statistical analyses nor the complex algebraic definition of iei and fci offer any further information that explain the reasons for this relationship between the two measures therefore we need to employ an alternative method to get more useful insights into the interplay between cycling and indirect effects from a network point of view iei represents the proportion of connections that are not adjacent the transfer of mass or energy from compartment i to j is defined as direct effect only if it occurs between two adjacent compartments through a direct flow i j and it is classified as indirect effect if other compartments are involved in this transfer e g i k j fig 4 shows three different cases of indirect effects from i to j where two compartments are connected through a single path the figure also depicts the network representation of each pathway where all compartments are listed without repetition and are connected by directed links all three cases qualify as indirect effects as defined by eq 3 from the perspective of the network we can clearly see the involvement of cycling in each case for example fig 4 a shows the indirect effect of i on itself which is actually a simple cycle this type of indirect effect depends exclusively on cycling fig 4 b shows a second type of indirect effect of i on j which is actually a simple cycle at i combined with a direct effect of i on j this second type of indirect effect also depends on cycling but interestingly on the direct effect i j as well therefore if the existing direct link from i to j is broken this indirect effect will disappear as well this is somewhat contrary to the general understanding that indirect effects help increase robustness resilience and potentially stability wootton 1994 as the flow of biomass and energy from a compartment to another can occur through multiple routes for a system with high indirect effects removing a flow will probably have less of an impact e g extinction of a species as the existence of multiple independent pathways among compartments will help the system continue to function as usual however this type of indirect effect will not contribute to such quality fig 4 c represents a third type of indirect effect of i on j which is independent of both cycling and direct effects since i and j are only connected through other compartments a broken direct link from i to j will not eliminate this indirect effect based on the three examples in fig 4 we define three types of indirect effects a iei cycle i i b iei mixed i j contains the direct flow i j i j c iei pure i j does not contain the direct flow i j i j iei cycle is cycle from a compartment to itself involving one or more other compartment s in between iei mixed represents the indirect effect between compartments that also depends on the direct effect between the same two compartments by definition iei mixed has to contain a cycle within itself as well contribution of iei mixed to network stability or resilience is questionable as its existence entirely depends on the direct effect iei pure is independent of the direct effect and may contribute to network resilience and stability these three types of indirect effects are mutually disjoint and their sum constitute the total indirect effects index iei iei iei cycle iei mixed iei pure the existence of both iei cycle and iei mixed depend on cycling as they contain repeated nodes in their pathway if fci 0 then iei mixed iei cycle 0 on the other hand iei pure does not require a repeated node in its pathway for example the path i m n m j satisfies our criteria for iei pure from i to j however the value of iei pure may be positive even if fci 0 to compute the three components of iei individually we need all possible paths of material flow through the system an agent based stochastic simulation method called network particle tracking npt kazanci et al 2012 is used for this purpose npt discretizes the stocks into particles as shown in fig 5 then npt uses probabilities based on the flow values to move the particles between compartments the movement of each particle in the system is traced and the path of each particle is recorded the pathway that a particle goes through the system is recorded as a list of ordered compartment numbers for example in the three compartment system in fig 5 numbers 1 2 and 3 represent producers consumers and nutrient pool respectively fig 6 shows one possible pathway if a particle is moving through this system ma and kazanci 2013 computes iei using pathways and shows that the pathway based computation agrees with the algebraic formula 4 pathway based iei is simply computed as the proportion of dashed arrows over the total number of solid and dashed arrows note that the environmental input 1 and output 3 arrows are not counted because they do not represent within system interactions for a real ecological network npt simulation generates a long list of pathways that particles move through the system by decomposing all the indirect relations within each pathway we can quantify three components of iei for the entire system for the single pathway shown in fig 6 there are totally four direct connections and six indirect connections three 2 step two 3 step and a single 4 step the classification of all these connections as iei cycle iei mixed and iei pure is shown in table 2 using the algorithm shown in table 2 we first use npt to simulate the thirty real ecosystem models provided in table 1 and then compute iei cycle iei mixed and iei pure for each network fig 7 shows the comparison of each iei component with respect to fci fig 7 shows that both iei cycle and iei mixed increase with the growth of fci in a linear fashion pearson correlation coefficient for iei cycle became r 0 9373 and that of iei mixed became r 0 9603 what we consider as pure indirect effects iei pure is totally unrelated to fci as its pearson correlation coefficient is r 0 0870 these results explain our previous observation that iei and fci are strongly correlated for high cycling networks whereas more variation of iei is observed for low cycling networks for high cycling networks both iei cycle and iei mixed dominate iei pure and leave little room for variation of iei with respect to fci on the other hand for low cycling networks iei pure becomes the dominating component of iei since iei pure is not correlated to fci we observe a high variation of iei when fci is small 4 indirect effects and resilience resilience has come to mean so many different things that it must assume its broadest definition hodgson et al 2015 holling 1973 defines resilience as the ability of a system to resist change in the face of disturbance a different definition proposed by deangelis 1980 is the speed with which a system returns to equilibrium state following a perturbation based on our own survey of literature we use the word resilience to represent the ability of a system to return to its original state after a disturbance webster et al 1975 allison and martiny 2008 hodgson et al 2015 interestingly this definition has been used for stability by holling 1973 and elasticity by orians 1975 in the past to assess the ability of a system to return to its original state after a disturbance we perturb an ecosystem model at steady state by changing a single flow value by a certain percentage so the system is no longer at steady state once the system reaches a new steady state we measure the difference between the initial and final compartment storage values and flows this difference is smaller for resilient ecosystems the details of this procedure is explained in fig 8 to investigate the relationship between the different indirect effect measures and resilience we evaluated 10 000 ecosystem models see fig 9 with similar structure same number of compartments and flows same connectivity but different indirect effects and resilience properties r s r f iei iei pure values we generate 10 000 variations of this ecosystem model by assigning normally distributed random number variables to parameters a b c d and e fig 10 shows the iei and iei pure vs resilience values of these 10 000 models we observe a positive correlation between the resilience and both indirect effects iei and iei pure measures in other words models with higher iei values are more resilient to perturbations we observe the same result for iei pure and strikingly the perturbations are more sensitive to iei pure than iei as the slope of the average line for iei pure is higher in magnitude than that of iei in other words changes in iei pure values are a better indicator of ecosystem resilience this result holds whether for both the storage and the flow based resilience measures as both are almost the same for a given model as shown in fig 10 5 statistical prediction of iei pure using iei and fci as we do not have a closed algebraic formula for each component of iei decomposition of iei is not easily calculated without computer simulations yet a good approximation is possible based on the fact that the two components of iei are strongly correlated with fci by fitting a line to the data set we can predict iei cycle iei cycle 0 8313 fci and iei mixed iei mixed 0 8835 fci then we can estimate iei pure as follows 5 predicted i e i pure i e i 0 8313 0 8835 f c i fig 11 shows the accuracy of this estimation by comparing the predicted and actual iei pure 6 conclusion we investigate the close relationship between two important ecological network measures cycling fci and indirect effects iei in detail both fci and iei have a simpler and more intuitive description within the context of pathways compared to their algebraic formulations therefore we utilize a pathway based method to decompose iei into three disjoint components iei cycle iei mixed and iei pure based on their relation to cycling eliminating the influence of cycling on indirect effect results in iei pure an essential feature of iei pure is not only its independence of cycling but also its contribution to resilience while iei is a mathematically well defined index its practical implications on ecosystem resilience are not well studied min et al 2011 claims that indirect effects can be the major causes of stability of ecological networks however not every component of iei contributes to resilience equally based on the 10 000 models created as variations of the silver springs model we observe that resilience is more sensitive to iei pure than iei on average in contrast to the strong correlation between iei and fci we observe almost no correlation between iei pure and fci therefore while iei and fci combine similar attributes of an ecosystem model iei pure and fci quantify completely different aspects of ecosystem function which may be more desirable for certain applications for example if multiple ena measures are used to compare two different networks then we already know that iei and fci will show similar results with a high probability on the other hand iei pure and fci can be more informative as they capture quasi orthogonal attributes of the system a significant disadvantage of iei pure is the need for a simulation for accurate computation nevertheless it is possible to construct a somewhat decent approximation for iei pure based on fci and iei this work does not only explain the correlation between cycling and indirect effects observed in earlier work but also reveals an index that may be better suited to quantify the indirect relations in ecosystems that contribute to stability robustness and resilience we propose the use of iei pure an ecological network analysis measure that provides a new dimension of information different than fci and iei and one that is indicative of ecosystem resilience to simplify the

24193,indirect effects index iei and cycling index fci are two key measures of ecological network analysis that are known to be correlated systems with high iei values are assumed to be more stable and resilient while this makes sense from a theoretical point of view there is lack of evidence on the contribution of indirect interactions to ecosystem stability and resilience investigation of this relationship between resilience and indirect effects leads to a better understanding of iei that it is actually a sum of three distinct components iei cycle iei mixed and iei pure each of which is identified by their relation to cycling iei and fci are highly correlated because both values increase with average path length path which is the average number of compartments a unit flow material passes through before exiting the system while iei and fci are highly correlated the third component of iei iei pure is totally uncorrelated with cycling this is because the effects of cycling are excluded from iei pure by definition interestingly we find out that iei pure is the major contributor to ecosystem resilience keywords resilience indirect effects cycling network particle tracking ecological network analysis individual based model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction indirect effects can be defined as the impact of one organism or species on another mediated or transmitted by a third for compartmental ecosystem models patten 1978 classifies the transfer of mass or energy from a compartment to another as a direct effect only if it occurs between two adjacent compartments through a direct flow otherwise as indirect effect if other compartments are involved in this transfer indirect effects index iei represents the proportion of total transactions of biomass or energy that are not adjacent ma and kazanci 2013 wootton 2002 claims that indirect effects cause the challenge to predict the impacts of environmental change thus a better understanding of indirect effects is critical to understand and predict ecosystem behavior min et al 2011 states that indirect effects are assumed to be the major causes of the complexity and stability for ecological networks indeed from a theoretical perspective it makes sense that high redundancy of energy or biomass flow among model compartments indicated by high iei values may provide resistance to environmental perturbations and impacts there is little information about the relation between indirect effects and stability or resilience however therefore in this paper we investigate the very question posed by krivtsov 2004 2009 what is the relative contribution of indirect interactions to resistance and resilience to address this question we study the correlation between indirect effects and resilience using 10 000 models derived from the silver springs energy flow model odum 1957 second we investigate what makes iei correlates with resilience this investigation leads to the well known similarity between cycling and indirect effects similar to indirect effects cycling index finn 1976 1982 is another essential ecological indicator for ecosystem analysis it measures how much of the environmental input into a system is cycled before exiting that system according to odum 1969 cycling of energy is an indicator of maturity of a system while cycling of carbon can be a sign of a more stressed community and appears to be a counter indicator of ecosystem health wulff and ulanowicz 1989 fath 2004 using a set of large scale cyber networks observes a strong correlation between indirect effects and cycling this high correlation is also confirmed by kazanci and ma 2015 using 52 real ecosystem models from literature while high cycling systems tend to have high indirect effects the inverse is not always true consequently iei is a composite measure involving some parts that are highly related to cycling as well as some that are independent of cycling we decompose indirect effects into three disjoint components iei pure iei cycle and iei mixed based on their relation to cycling while iei cycle and iei mixed are highly dependent on fci iei pure is totally unrelated to fci using the same 10 000 model set we show that iei pure is the major component of iei contributing to resilience 2 indirect effects and cycling 2 1 definitions of iei and fci ecosystems are often modeled as compartmental systems where active members in the ecosystem are categorized into compartments and transactions of specific currencies among compartments are identified and measured total effects in the system represent all relations among all compartments depending on whether the effects between two compartments is transmitted via others effects are classified into two categories direct d and indirect i the i d ratio is defined to represent the ratio of indirect to direct effects indirect effect index iei computed as i i d represents the proportion of indirect effects ma and kazanci 2012 to quantify cycling total system throughflow is divided into two parts flows generated by first visits and flows generated through cycling the proportion of this second part is defined as finn s cycling index fci computation of iei and fci relies on the flow information in the ecological system z i rate of environmental input to compartment i y i rate of environmental output from compartment i f i j rate of direct flow from compartment j to compartment i throughflow t i is the rate of material or energy moving through compartment i input throughflow is defined as the sum of flow rates into compartment i from other compartments and the environment similarly output throughflow is the sum of flow rates from compartment i to other compartments and the environment for a system at steady state input and output throughflows are equal to each other t i j 1 n f i j z i j 1 n f j i y i where n represents the number of compartments in the system total system throughflow tst is the sum of all throughflows in the system the flow intensity matrix g is obtained by normalizing the rows of the flow matrix f by the throughflow vector t g i j f i j t j the matrix g represents the fraction of the flow material originating from j and moving to i directly j i therefore by definition g i j 1 for all i j similarly g 2 i j is the fraction of the flow moving to j from i over two steps j k i in general g m i j represents the fraction of the flow material from j to i over m steps j i m the sum of all powers of the g matrix defines the throughflow analysis matrix n 1 n i boundary g direct g 2 g 3 indirect i g 1 where i is the identity matrix not to be confused with the i used later to denote the indirect effects n i j represents the throughflow generated at compartment i by per unit input at compartment j patten 1978 defines the ratio of indirect to direct flow i d as a measure to quantify the effect of indirect relations among compartments relative to direct connections 2 i d unit i 1 n j 1 n g 2 g 3 i 1 n j 1 n g i 1 n n i g 1 i 1 n g 1 where 1 is a vector of ones ma and kazanci 2013 find out the eq 2 compares indirect and direct flows generated by unit throughflows at all compartments but not by the actual throughflows therefore a revised formulation for i d is proposed as follows 3 i d revised i 1 n g 2 g 3 t i 1 n g t i d ratio can take any value from zero to infinity zero implies that no indirect effects exist direct effects equal indirect effects if i d 1 dominance of indirect effects holds if 1 i d direct effects dominate if 0 i d 1 the interval of values where dominance of indirect hypothesis holds is of length infinity whereas the interval of values where direct effects dominate is of length 1 to eliminate this imbalance ma and kazanci 2013 defines the indirect effects index iei which is derived by rescaling the i d ratio as follows 4 i e i i i d i d 1 i d iei acts much like fci with a range between zero and one for an ecological network iei 0 0 5 and 1 imply no indirect effects equal amount of direct and indirect effects and no direct effects respectively note that iei can never be equal to one though can be arbitrarily close to one the computation of fci depends on the throughflow analysis matrix n as well by definition diagonal values n i i represent the amount of throughflow generated at compartment i by one unit input into compartment i a unit input into compartment i contributes to its throughflow t i at least once therefore if n i i is larger than 1 then the difference n i i 1 represents the amount of throughflow generated at compartment i through cycling finn 1978 defines his cycling index based on this idea as the fraction of the total system throughflow t s t that is due to cycling t s t c as follows f c i t s t c t s t 1 t s t i 1 n t i n i i 1 n i i 2 2 comparison of iei and fci for an accurate statistical comparison of iei and fci we use both artificial and real ecological networks in this section we first check the correlation between iei and fci using a set of conceptual networks we generated 100 000 conceptual models representing all possible networks with up to five compartments as shown in fig 1 a compromising number five is chosen as the network size mainly because of the significantly heavier computation required to study all possible networks with more than five compartments while there are usually three to five trophic levels in an ecosystem our conceptual model is able to represent an ecosystem with up to five trophic levels thus is not too simple to build such 100 000 conceptual models we initially define a fully connected five compartment network which has the potential to represent any network at steady state with up to five compartments we then assign flow rates ranging from zero to 1 0 5 individually for each flow environmental input and output while making sure the system is at steady state assigning zero flow rates is effectively deleting flows creating sub networks with simpler structures similarly if all flow rates in and out of a specific compartment happen to be zero then the resulting network will represent models with only four compartments therefore by randomizing flow rates in this fully connected five compartment model it is theoretically possible to generate all possible networks of up to five compartments while the set of all networks with up to five compartments has infinite elements we set our sampling strategy so that any steady state network with less than six compartments is very close exactly the same in terms of structure and very similar in terms of flow rates to one of the 100 000 networks that we generated therefore although a fully connected network such as the one shown in fig 1 is not a realistic representation of an actual ecosystem it is guaranteed that any ecological network with up to five compartments is closely represented in our sample set of 100 000 networks we then compute iei and fci for each of the 100 000 elements of our sample network set fig 2 shows a scatter plot of iei and fci for all networks we find it striking that regardless of the network structure topology and flow rate values an extremely strong correlation between fci and iei is observed even for unrealistic networks as fci increases the variation of iei decreases dramatically for non cycling networks f c i 0 iei ranges between zero and 0 6 however for networks with 80 cycling f c i 0 8 iei can be estimated to be 0 9 with very little error this experiment confirms the strong correlation between iei and fci however the vertical spread of data i e the high variation of iei especially for small fci values requires further attention our preliminary result is based on a set of conceptual networks of up to five compartments most of which are probably unrealistic this observation may not hold for real ecological networks which may have higher number of compartments and connections and be more complex in general in order to check if our observation extends to real life cases we compute the iei and fci of thirty real ecosystem models selected from literature with number of compartments ranging from 4 to 125 table 1 provides the detailed information for each model used in this analysis including references fig 3 is created by superimposing the scatter plot of iei vs fci for these thirty ecosystem models onto fig 2 as all thirty ecological networks have fci values lower than 0 35 we only show the scatter plot for fci between 0 to 0 35 fig 3 shows that real and conceptual ecological network models show pretty consistent results for iei vs fci despite the fact that most of the conceptual models are actually unrealistic and that some real ecosystem models are a lot larger and more complex combining real models with a high number of conceptual networks enable us to reach a more general conclusion on this special relationship between iei and fci which transcends the model structure flow currency and network size 3 decomposing indirect effects the strong correlation between iei and fci indicate that they quantify a similar attribute of the network but the variability of iei reveals that iei involves an attribute that is independent of cycling neither the statistical analyses nor the complex algebraic definition of iei and fci offer any further information that explain the reasons for this relationship between the two measures therefore we need to employ an alternative method to get more useful insights into the interplay between cycling and indirect effects from a network point of view iei represents the proportion of connections that are not adjacent the transfer of mass or energy from compartment i to j is defined as direct effect only if it occurs between two adjacent compartments through a direct flow i j and it is classified as indirect effect if other compartments are involved in this transfer e g i k j fig 4 shows three different cases of indirect effects from i to j where two compartments are connected through a single path the figure also depicts the network representation of each pathway where all compartments are listed without repetition and are connected by directed links all three cases qualify as indirect effects as defined by eq 3 from the perspective of the network we can clearly see the involvement of cycling in each case for example fig 4 a shows the indirect effect of i on itself which is actually a simple cycle this type of indirect effect depends exclusively on cycling fig 4 b shows a second type of indirect effect of i on j which is actually a simple cycle at i combined with a direct effect of i on j this second type of indirect effect also depends on cycling but interestingly on the direct effect i j as well therefore if the existing direct link from i to j is broken this indirect effect will disappear as well this is somewhat contrary to the general understanding that indirect effects help increase robustness resilience and potentially stability wootton 1994 as the flow of biomass and energy from a compartment to another can occur through multiple routes for a system with high indirect effects removing a flow will probably have less of an impact e g extinction of a species as the existence of multiple independent pathways among compartments will help the system continue to function as usual however this type of indirect effect will not contribute to such quality fig 4 c represents a third type of indirect effect of i on j which is independent of both cycling and direct effects since i and j are only connected through other compartments a broken direct link from i to j will not eliminate this indirect effect based on the three examples in fig 4 we define three types of indirect effects a iei cycle i i b iei mixed i j contains the direct flow i j i j c iei pure i j does not contain the direct flow i j i j iei cycle is cycle from a compartment to itself involving one or more other compartment s in between iei mixed represents the indirect effect between compartments that also depends on the direct effect between the same two compartments by definition iei mixed has to contain a cycle within itself as well contribution of iei mixed to network stability or resilience is questionable as its existence entirely depends on the direct effect iei pure is independent of the direct effect and may contribute to network resilience and stability these three types of indirect effects are mutually disjoint and their sum constitute the total indirect effects index iei iei iei cycle iei mixed iei pure the existence of both iei cycle and iei mixed depend on cycling as they contain repeated nodes in their pathway if fci 0 then iei mixed iei cycle 0 on the other hand iei pure does not require a repeated node in its pathway for example the path i m n m j satisfies our criteria for iei pure from i to j however the value of iei pure may be positive even if fci 0 to compute the three components of iei individually we need all possible paths of material flow through the system an agent based stochastic simulation method called network particle tracking npt kazanci et al 2012 is used for this purpose npt discretizes the stocks into particles as shown in fig 5 then npt uses probabilities based on the flow values to move the particles between compartments the movement of each particle in the system is traced and the path of each particle is recorded the pathway that a particle goes through the system is recorded as a list of ordered compartment numbers for example in the three compartment system in fig 5 numbers 1 2 and 3 represent producers consumers and nutrient pool respectively fig 6 shows one possible pathway if a particle is moving through this system ma and kazanci 2013 computes iei using pathways and shows that the pathway based computation agrees with the algebraic formula 4 pathway based iei is simply computed as the proportion of dashed arrows over the total number of solid and dashed arrows note that the environmental input 1 and output 3 arrows are not counted because they do not represent within system interactions for a real ecological network npt simulation generates a long list of pathways that particles move through the system by decomposing all the indirect relations within each pathway we can quantify three components of iei for the entire system for the single pathway shown in fig 6 there are totally four direct connections and six indirect connections three 2 step two 3 step and a single 4 step the classification of all these connections as iei cycle iei mixed and iei pure is shown in table 2 using the algorithm shown in table 2 we first use npt to simulate the thirty real ecosystem models provided in table 1 and then compute iei cycle iei mixed and iei pure for each network fig 7 shows the comparison of each iei component with respect to fci fig 7 shows that both iei cycle and iei mixed increase with the growth of fci in a linear fashion pearson correlation coefficient for iei cycle became r 0 9373 and that of iei mixed became r 0 9603 what we consider as pure indirect effects iei pure is totally unrelated to fci as its pearson correlation coefficient is r 0 0870 these results explain our previous observation that iei and fci are strongly correlated for high cycling networks whereas more variation of iei is observed for low cycling networks for high cycling networks both iei cycle and iei mixed dominate iei pure and leave little room for variation of iei with respect to fci on the other hand for low cycling networks iei pure becomes the dominating component of iei since iei pure is not correlated to fci we observe a high variation of iei when fci is small 4 indirect effects and resilience resilience has come to mean so many different things that it must assume its broadest definition hodgson et al 2015 holling 1973 defines resilience as the ability of a system to resist change in the face of disturbance a different definition proposed by deangelis 1980 is the speed with which a system returns to equilibrium state following a perturbation based on our own survey of literature we use the word resilience to represent the ability of a system to return to its original state after a disturbance webster et al 1975 allison and martiny 2008 hodgson et al 2015 interestingly this definition has been used for stability by holling 1973 and elasticity by orians 1975 in the past to assess the ability of a system to return to its original state after a disturbance we perturb an ecosystem model at steady state by changing a single flow value by a certain percentage so the system is no longer at steady state once the system reaches a new steady state we measure the difference between the initial and final compartment storage values and flows this difference is smaller for resilient ecosystems the details of this procedure is explained in fig 8 to investigate the relationship between the different indirect effect measures and resilience we evaluated 10 000 ecosystem models see fig 9 with similar structure same number of compartments and flows same connectivity but different indirect effects and resilience properties r s r f iei iei pure values we generate 10 000 variations of this ecosystem model by assigning normally distributed random number variables to parameters a b c d and e fig 10 shows the iei and iei pure vs resilience values of these 10 000 models we observe a positive correlation between the resilience and both indirect effects iei and iei pure measures in other words models with higher iei values are more resilient to perturbations we observe the same result for iei pure and strikingly the perturbations are more sensitive to iei pure than iei as the slope of the average line for iei pure is higher in magnitude than that of iei in other words changes in iei pure values are a better indicator of ecosystem resilience this result holds whether for both the storage and the flow based resilience measures as both are almost the same for a given model as shown in fig 10 5 statistical prediction of iei pure using iei and fci as we do not have a closed algebraic formula for each component of iei decomposition of iei is not easily calculated without computer simulations yet a good approximation is possible based on the fact that the two components of iei are strongly correlated with fci by fitting a line to the data set we can predict iei cycle iei cycle 0 8313 fci and iei mixed iei mixed 0 8835 fci then we can estimate iei pure as follows 5 predicted i e i pure i e i 0 8313 0 8835 f c i fig 11 shows the accuracy of this estimation by comparing the predicted and actual iei pure 6 conclusion we investigate the close relationship between two important ecological network measures cycling fci and indirect effects iei in detail both fci and iei have a simpler and more intuitive description within the context of pathways compared to their algebraic formulations therefore we utilize a pathway based method to decompose iei into three disjoint components iei cycle iei mixed and iei pure based on their relation to cycling eliminating the influence of cycling on indirect effect results in iei pure an essential feature of iei pure is not only its independence of cycling but also its contribution to resilience while iei is a mathematically well defined index its practical implications on ecosystem resilience are not well studied min et al 2011 claims that indirect effects can be the major causes of stability of ecological networks however not every component of iei contributes to resilience equally based on the 10 000 models created as variations of the silver springs model we observe that resilience is more sensitive to iei pure than iei on average in contrast to the strong correlation between iei and fci we observe almost no correlation between iei pure and fci therefore while iei and fci combine similar attributes of an ecosystem model iei pure and fci quantify completely different aspects of ecosystem function which may be more desirable for certain applications for example if multiple ena measures are used to compare two different networks then we already know that iei and fci will show similar results with a high probability on the other hand iei pure and fci can be more informative as they capture quasi orthogonal attributes of the system a significant disadvantage of iei pure is the need for a simulation for accurate computation nevertheless it is possible to construct a somewhat decent approximation for iei pure based on fci and iei this work does not only explain the correlation between cycling and indirect effects observed in earlier work but also reveals an index that may be better suited to quantify the indirect relations in ecosystems that contribute to stability robustness and resilience we propose the use of iei pure an ecological network analysis measure that provides a new dimension of information different than fci and iei and one that is indicative of ecosystem resilience to simplify the adoption iei pure we rename it pure indirect effects pie econet software kazanci 2007 includes the computation of pie in its results among other ena measures credit authorship contribution statement

24194,loggerhead sea turtles caretta caretta are a threatened sea turtle species that nests on beaches along the northwestern atlantic ocean loggerhead nesting in florida accounts for approximately 80 of the loggerhead population in the atlantic ocean yet the underlying ecological mechanisms behind their population dynamics are understudied c caretta are largely inaccessible since they spend most of their early life in open ocean habitats consequently their nesting and hatchling production offer quantifiable insight of their population dynamics emergence success the proportion of eggs laid that produce offspring which successfully leave the nest is the source of all later life stages yet the abiotic factors that drive emergence success trends have not been fully described this study explores the relationship between air temperature and emergence success across multiple nesting seasons to better understand the potential impact of anthropogenic climate change on subsequent loggerhead populations here we investigate the effect of changing emergence success on the juvenile and adult life stages after exploring numerous aspects of temperature and precipitation metrics we determined that the mean of the maximum daily temperatures for each trimester of the eggs incubation periods related most closely to the variation in emergence success the proportion of hatchlings that make it out of the nest across nests a novel feature of our approach to modeling the impact of temperature on the later life stages is through connecting a statistical model into a discrete mechanistic population model our population model has two parts one with eggs and hatchlings on a daily time scale in the nesting season and the other with juveniles and adults on an annual time scale the statistical model enables us to illustrate the effect of temperature changes across these life stages the decline in the adult population follows from the decline of the hatchling emergence success using predicted increases in temperature due to climate change we illustrate a corresponding prediction for the population classes keywords loggerhead turtles temperature effects statistical model discrete stage structure model data availability we have provided the information to request the data from gumbo limbo nature center boca raton fl 1 introduction and background loggerhead sea turtles caretta caretta are an imperiled species that nests on the coast of southeastern florida bovery and wyneken 2013 they are listed as threatened in the united states under the endangered species act of 1973 as amended through the 108th congress p l 108 136 november 24 2003 conant et al 2009 their imperiled status is primarily due to the pertubation of production among which are the negative effects of juveniles and adult bycatch in the fishing industry lewison and crowder 2007 loggerhead population decline led to the widespread introduction of turtle excluder devices teds in many trawl fisheries and modifications of gillnet and long line fisheries which significantly reduced the threat to loggerhead survival but other anthropogenic activities continue to threaten the health of koggerhead populations conant et al 2009 the northwest atlantic loggerhead s status as a threatened species merits a management plan to minimize threats to the population until it reaches a sustainable population size without human interference an effective management plan for loggerheads requires an understanding of their population dynamics in addition to threats fuentes et al 2013 lópez mendilaharsu et al 2020 measuring population sizes in highly migratory long lived late maturing species is difficult musick 1999 the task is particularly challenging because loggerheads spend much of their lives at sea where detailed census is not feasible our goal is to mathematically explore the relationship between air temperature and emergence success of hatchings across multiple nesting seasons to better anticipate the potential impact of anthropogenic climate change on subsequent loggerhead populations using data from southeast florida we build a statistical model representing the relationship of air temperature and hatchling emergence success the results of the statistical model are then used in the nesting season submodel that connects to annual population model to demonstrate the effect of changing emergence success on the juvenile and adult life stages the terrestrial life stages eggs hatchlings and reproductive females are the easiest to observe and consequently the best described females in the united states typically nest every 2 3 years between april and september erb and wyneken 2019 in boca raton area of florida nests contain an average of 105 eggs and incubate for 42 60 days brost et al 2015 loggerhead embryonic incubation can be partitioned functionally into three major phases trimesters of development erb and wyneken 2019 bentley et al 2020 during the first trimester embryos undergo cell division and form gross features but do not undergo much overall growth bladow and milton 2020 wyneken and lolavar 2015 in the second trimester embryos develop all major organ systems and metabolism increases bladow and milton 2020 in the third trimester of development embryos produce greater amounts of metabolic heat as they grow rapidly and metabolize yolk reserves they become mobile in the egg and develop strength that is employed during hatching and emergence from the nest and then the initiation of offshore migration bladow and milton 2020 wyneken and lolavar 2015 current estimates of incubation conditions indicate that loggerhead embryos must spend the vast majority of their development at nest temperatures ranging from 27 c to 34 c for the embryos to become hatchlings and successfully emerge from the nest bladow and milton 2020 wyneken and lolavar 2015 ackerman 1997 ackerman and lott 2004 yet the effects of environmental temperature on loggerhead nests are not well studied there is also evidence that sand moisture plays an important role in the success of the nests erb et al 2018 miller 1985 temperature of the air and of the sand plays a role in the sex determination of loggerhead turtles with warmer temperatures above a critical threshold tending to produce female dominant clutches yntema and mrosovsky 1980 1982 mitchell and janzen 2010 girondot et al 2010 wyneken and lolavar 2015 clusa et al 2018 since we do not have data nor a clear trajectory for how much feminization will occur across the temperature ranges explored here we chose not to include this feature in our current modeling work estimating sex ratios without data verification may not be productive monsinjon et al 2022 lolavar and wyneken 2020 heppell et al 2022 jensen et al 2022 stage based population models have been used historically to examine the population dynamics of a variety of populations including loggerhead sea turtles caswell 2018 henson et al 2010 these models consider fecundity rates survival rates and transition rates to predict the number of individuals in each life stage caswell 2018 heppell et al 2000 work led by crouse and crowder with collaborators constructed stage based matrix models for loggerhead sea turtles and predicted the need for teds to protect juveniles and later reported on the effects of such devices crouse et al 1987 crowder et al 1994 although survival rates for these life stages have been studied the underlying mechanisms informing the transition between stages along with the effects of environmental conditions during development remain underappreciated montero et al 2018 fuentes et al 2010 glen and mrosovsky 2004 booth and limpus 2008 to explore possible mechanisms we investigate environmental predictors of emergence success we evaluated temperature and precipitation as possible predictors for hatchling emergence success to better understand the impacts of changing climatic conditions on recruitment within the atlantic loggerhead population this statistical model construction used the nest inventory data provided by the city of boca raton s sea turtle program at gumbo limbo nature center rusenko and anderson 2020 then to see the results of the statistical model propagate through the life stages we created a discrete predictive model that provides an understanding of the effects of hatchling emergence success on juveniles and adults from year to year in addition to building on the background of stage structured discrete models some recent research on such models using different time scales and time varying coefficients relates to our discrete population level model with two time scales sanz et al 2019 cushing and henson 2018 in the nesting part of our model the transition probability of eggs into the hatchling stage was determined by the statistical model using a novel approach we link the statistical model into a discrete time population model we do this by using the hatchling emergence success rate as a time varying coefficient this discrete population model also has innovative features of two different time scales connecting the egg and hatching classes on a daily time step during the nesting season with the two juvenile classes and an adult class on a yearly time scale our linked model is based on a cohort of turtles from 12 nests in the southeast florida nesting beach area using the loggerhead nest data rusenko and anderson 2020 we illustrate the dynamic results of our model using 20 random draws from the boca raton florida nest data from each of the years 2006 2020 which gives about 3600 nest start dates using a statistical model with the effects of temperature on the hatchling emergence to provide output for a time varying coefficient in a matrix stage structure model is a new approach with two combined models we can predict the possible effects of changing temperature on the loggerhead population along the beaches of peninsular florida this model provides a tool for predicting the impact of anthropogenic climate change on loggerheads especially those in florida offering vital perspectives for future conservation efforts 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection we began our analysis of emergence success for northwestern atlantic loggerheads using nest inventory data provided by the city of boca raton sea turtle conservation program rusenko and anderson 2020 each year hundreds of nests on the beaches of boca raton are surveyed and inventoried to collect the lay date hatchling emergence date and success of the eggs in each nest at inventory eggs are sorted into fate classes based on the fate of the embryo numbers of hatchlings that successfully emerge from the nest hatchlings that do not successfully emerge from the nest and those that are unhatched miller et al 2017 miller 1999 from these data we used the lay date hatchling emergence date and proportion emerged for 4309 nests from nesting seasons from 2006 2020 we examined aspects of air temperature available from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa noaa nce 2020a the west palm beach international airport weather station was the closest about 40 km to the nesting beaches in boca raton and offered full weather data across the entire range of nesting seasons this station was near the coastline and provided as accurate air temperature readings as possible for the nests that we examined in later years weather stations closer to the nesting beaches were installed these allowed us to verify that air temperatures between this station were closely correlated with a subset of clutches that were instrumented with temperature dataloggers throughout incubation erb et al 2018 2 2 data management and model selection we input the raw nest inventory data for each clutch including the total number of eggs the emergence success of hatchlings the lay date and the emergence date hereafter termed hatch date rusenko and anderson 2020 two matrices were then populated with the daily minimum and daily maximum air temperatures for each nest we extracted temperatures for each of the three developmental trimesters for individual nests trimesters were estimated by finding the duration of incubation in days from oviposition to the first hatchling emergence divided by 3 this approach assumes linear rates of development but minor deviations were present delmas et al 2008 girondot et al 2018 for our analysis we focused on the maximum daily temperature for each trimester maximum and minimum daily temperatures were defined as the arithmetic mean of the daily maximum and the daily minimum temperature for each trimester the daily cumulative precipitation data were not normally distributed and were log transformed prior to data analysis total precipitation per trimester was estimated by summing rainfall amounts for the developmental trimesters calculated for each nest we then calculated the arithmetic mean of daily precipitation for each day in each trimester we constructed a generalized linear mixed model to predict emergence success modeled as the logit transformation of the proportion of hatchling emerging from a nest we explored various models using temperature and precipitation metrics for each trimester temperature covariates explored included mean mean minimum mean maximum and degree day accumulation above 3 2 3 3 and 34 c for each trimester potential precipitation covariates included mean daily precipitation and cumulative precipitation for each trimester year was treated

proportion ρ of hatchling emergence success given by ρ the natural logarithm of the odds ratio of ρ 2 ρ ln ρ 1 ρ then ρ is calculated using the following 3 ρ exp ρ 1 exp ρ in table 1 the predictors incubation trimester temperature measures t 1 t 2 t 3 represent the mean of the daily maximum air temperatures for the respective trimesters of nest incubation from 2006 to 2019 the southeastern florida coast experienced years with variable weather trends some were abnormally warm and dry and others cooler with significant precipitation the range of maximum air temperatures that an individual nest experienced during each trimester is related its lay date the nests proportion of emergence success ranged from 0 42 to 0 81 throughout these nesting seasons generally daily maximum temperatures tended to increase throughout the incubation periods for nests laid early in the nesting season and tended to decrease throughout the period for nests laid later in the season across years mean maximum temperatures remained relatively stable with a few years e 2010 2011 2015 2016 that were irregularly warm these warmer years also experienced intense dips in emergence success overall as seen in fig 1 for illustrative purposes in this figure we used mean of the daily maximum air temperatures over the nesting seasons which were negatively correlated with the hatching emergence success proportions with r 0 63 2 4 discrete turtle population model our discrete mathematical model represents the eggs hatchlings juveniles and adult turtles that are associated with a fixed number of clutches in the southeastern florida beach area we start by considering the turtles associated with 12 clutches a cohort of females laying the nests and their progeny hatchlings and juveniles we started with 12 nests each year from wyneken s lab research and then expanded to use other boca raton data using 12 nests when the adult population decreases a corresponding decrease in the number of nests occurs in the model our annual discrete model with yearly time steps is formulated with two juvenile classes based upon the natural history of the loggerheads and an adult class in the summer of each year the eggs and the hatchlings are modeled with time steps of days where t t means in year t and summer nesting time step t note that time t 0 in year t corresponds to the beginning of the nesting season taken to be april 1 we take the last possible day of the nesting season to be september 30 corresponding to t f 182 with time t in years and t in days of the nesting season the classes in our mathematical model are e t t eggs and h t t hatchlings in all the nests at t t j 1 t first juvenile class j 2 t second juvenile class a t adults as the reproductive class the descriptions of the juvenile and adult classes are given in table 2 and fig 2 shows the pathway through the annual model with the nesting season submodel which uses the statistical model 1 for hatchling recruitment in our model we only counted hatchlings that had successfully exited the nest crossed the beach and entered water to swim through nearshore waters the distance traveled varies because beach width varies with sand erosion or accretion bladow and briggs bladow and roberts briggs 2017 measured nesting beach geomorphology including much of the beach represented in our study loggerheads tend to nest in the middle of the beach consequentially their crawl distance typically ranges from 10 20 m assuming that we are given the size of the adult class a t at time t in years we calculated the proportion of the female adults that will lay nests each summer to represent the nests laid in year t we use a vector n t t with entries for each day t of the nesting season with n t t being the number of nests laid at time t t in our model n t t takes integer values 0 1 n the initial number of nests considered each year we want to express the number of hatchlings at the end of the nesting season as a function of a t and the results of the statistical model using the temperature conditions during the nesting season the order of events is important in a discrete time model our model starts with adult a t producing the number of eggs to be laid in the nesting season of year t the ratio of females to the total population of adults is estimated to be s 7 9 which means that females are about 7 out of 9 adults in the population casale et al 2005 arendt et al 2021 we acknowledge variation in the annual breeding probability and we use a reasonable approximation one third of the female adults are laying nests each summer because females nest on 2 4 year cycles with an average remigration interval number of years between two consecutive nesting years of 2 7 years which we rounded to 3 years bjorndal et al 1983 shamblin et al 2021 therefore we choose our values for n t t to satisfy 4 t 0 182 n t t a t 1 3 7 9 and use choices for nest laying dates from our data the sum over time t in eq 4 gives the total number of nests in the nesting season note we assume that there are 182 days in a nesting season in which nests could be actively incubating each trimester for eggs has length 17 days and thus the length l of the incubation period of each nest is approximately 51 days the average number of incubation days for this site using the average clutch size c 105 using the mean from the boca raton data our discrete equations for eggs leading to hatchlings is for 0 t 51 5 e t t 1 e t t c n t t for t 51 6 e t t 1 e t t c n t t c n t t 51 7 h t t 1 0 9 g 1 t t 51 c n t t 51 p 1 h t t in eq 6 the term c n t t gives the total number of eggs laid on day t in year t using the clutch size c and the number of nests n t t the term c n t t 51 moves out the eggs from nests laid 51 days ago average total length of the three trimesters and moves the surviving eggs to the hatchling class in eq 7 the daily survival rate of hatchlings is given by p 1 until the end of the nesting season at t f the coefficient g 1 t t 51 gives the probability of hatching survival from the nests laid at day t 51 in year t the value of g 1 is the output of the statistical model ρ from eqs 1 and 3 for year t with nest start day t using the mean of the maximum air temperatures over the three trimesters the scalar 0 9 comes from our definition of the hatchling class here the probability of a hatchling successfully entering the ocean beyond the nearshore waters from water s edge to 20 m out is 0 9 an estimated 5 of the emergent hatchlings do not make it across the sand and another 5 may be consumed by predators in the nearshore waters whelan and wyneken 2007 erb and wyneken 2019 resulting in that probability 0 9 0 95 0 95 the coefficient p 1 is the daily survival rate of hatchlings once they have left the nearshore waters for ocean nursery areas when the nesting season has concluded with t f being the last day of the season some proportion g 2 of hatchlings survive to the end of the year and transition to the first juvenile stage j 1 the next event involves the surviving hatchlings joining the surviving j 1 juveniles which are also the proportion of j 1 who are staying in this class and both are going into j 1 t 1 the surviving j 1 juveniles are divided in those staying in j 1 and those transitioning into j 2 the surviving and transitioning j 1 join the surviving j 2 those j 2 who are staying in that class and both are going into j 2 t 1 lastly the adults survive and are joined by surviving j 2 that are transferring in and both go into a t 1 our juvenile adult model is given by 8 j 1 t 1 g 2 h t t f p 2 j 1 t 9 j 2 t 1 g 3 j 1 t p 3 j 2 t 10 a t 1 g 4 j 2 t p 4 a t the coefficient p 2 gives the annual rate proportion of survival and remaining in j 1 while g 3 gives the proportion in j 1 that survive and move into j 2 similarly p 3 is the annual rate proportion of survival and remaining in j 2 and g 4 is the proportion in j 2 that survive and move into a lastly p 4 is the annual survival probability of a t the parameter definitions and baseline values are in table 2 we can write the rate α t of new juveniles in year t per adult in a t compartment as the result of their hatchlings surviving to become juveniles as 11 α t g 2 h t t f a t note that h t t f depends on the size of adult class a t and the results of the statistical model during the nesting season in that year thus eq 8 can be rewritten as 12 j 1 t 1 p 2 j 1 t α t a t where α t depends on the statistical model 1 through the egg and hatchling eqs 5 7 we consider the population of turtles associated with n nests laid in our beach cohort recall from above the total number of nests corresponds to a proportion of the adult population reproducing in a given year given by 13 n a t 1 3 7 9 which gives 14 a t 3 9 7 n the juvenile adult system 8 10 is a 3 3 matrix model with classes j 1 j 2 and a but one coefficient α t will vary over time 3 calculation of growth and survival rates at each time step we calculate the proportion that remain and transfer out of each class directly from our annual survival probabilities see table 2 these calculations are different for the different stages for hatchlings we scale the annual survival probability to match the daily time step of the seasonal model 7 for the juvenile classes we split up the annual survival probabilities into the proportions that survive and remain juveniles and the proportions that survive and transfer to the next stage for the adult class they do not transfer out to another stage so we can keep their annual survival probability as the proportion that survives and remains adults this is to say p 4 0 9 from national marine fisheries service and u s fish and wildlife service 2008 since hatchlings are modeled with a daily time scale to get their proportion that survive and remain and the proportion that survive and transfer to become juvenile j 1 we must scale the annual hatchling survival probability using an annual survival rate of 0 6 for hatchlings we choose the daily rate p 1 to satisfy p 1 365 0 6 which gives p 1 0 6 365 0 9986 national marine fisheries service and u s fish and wildlife service 2008 the proportion that survives to transfer out from the hatchling class into the first juvenile class is calculated similarly thus the probability that the hatchlings on the final day of the nesting season survive until the end of the year for 92 days the number of days in the year after day t f october december is g 2 such that g 2 365 92 0 6 giving g 2 0 88 for the two juvenile classes at each yearly time step the surviving turtles either remain in that class or transfer to the next class this gives a corresponding split of the annual survival probabilities caswell 2018 crouse et al 1987 this calculation involves the class s annual survival probability p and its stage duration d first we calculate the proportion that survive and remain in that class if we set the proportion of individuals alive in the first juvenile year cohort to be 1 then the distribution of juveniles across all years of being a juvenile will be 1 p p 2 p 3 p d 1 here p d 1 is the probability that a juvenile will survive to the oldest age in the class the proportion of juveniles that survive and remain in the same juvenile class is the probability p that juveniles not in the oldest year survive another year 15 p 1 p p 2 p d 2 1 p p 2 p d 1 p a similar calculation is done to find the proportion g that survive and transfer to the next stage 16 g p d 1 1 p p 2 p d 1 p explicitly we choose the annual survival for j 1 and j 2 and use the p and g formulas 15 and 16 to obtain p 2 g 3 p 3 and g 4 to calculate the initial conditions of our three annual classes we use the method of eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors on the leslie matrix formed from our annual classes j 1 j 2 a caswell 2018 this is an approximation to get our initial conditions since we will assume temporarily that the 3 3 matrix has constant coefficients that can predict the stable age distribution we know that the coefficient that produces j 1 from a t is time varying due to the nest lay dates and the corresponding temperatures each summer 17 l p 2 0 α t g 3 p 3 0 0 g 4 p 4 to find the rate of new juveniles in year t per adult α t we calculate h t t f by using a t g 1 from the statistical model and the egg and hatchling eqs 5 7 we also use our egg laying vector n to give exactly when each nest was laid that year now with the number of hatchlings at the end of the nesting season t f h t t f known for a given t we know α t from 11 and thus can calculate the eigenvalues for our matrix the dominant eigenvalue λ would be the long term growth rate of our population assuming this matrix representation would remain valid for generations let v v 1 v 2 v 3 be the eigenvector corresponding to λ and v represents the population distribution that grows at the given rate λ thus to calculate the initial population for our model and assuming a t is known we need to scale v by a scalar c such that c v 3 a t and that gives c v 1 j 1 t and c v 2 j 2 t if data relating to the ratios of juvenile classes to the adult class were available we could make a better estimate of the population distribution using our data coupled with our statistical model we simulate the turtle populations using the dates and outcomes of 12 nests per year by using eq 14 for the number of nests we see that the number of initial adults is 46 for each year we divided the nest data into 12 quantiles and randomly chose 12 nest laying dates one from each quartile of the nest lay date data that summer from the sea turtle nesting database of nests and nest outcomes in boca raton florida rusenko and anderson 2020 to show future simulation predictions we draw 20 sets of data each set has 15 years with 12 summer nest lay dates for one draw of 12 nests we obtain the nest lay dates and corresponding g 1 hatchling survival depending on the temperature during the three trimesters for each date and the resulting egg and hatchling populations are simulated over the nesting season notice the peak of the egg populations is near t 100 followed by the increase in hatchlings over one summer nesting season in fig 3 those dates together with the corresponding temperature data from the nest and the corresponding results from our statistical model give the proportion of the hatchlings that survive to enter the ocean and successfully exit the nearshore waters then a proportion of those hatchlings survive until the end of the year from the g 2 coefficient going into α t rate in the j 1 eq 11 the annual survival rates for j 1 and j 2 classes were not clearly available in the literature but the other baseline parameters in table 2 were found from national marine fisheries service and u s fish and wildlife service 2008 and our data summarizing parameters for the annual survival rates of hatchlings and adults were taken from national marine fisheries service and u s fish and wildlife service 2008 and the survival rates of hatchlings gave values for p 1 and q 2 after we chose the annual survival rates of j 1 and j 2 as discussed in the next paragraph we used them to calculate p 2 q 3 and p 3 q 4 the average clutch size and the length of the nesting season were taken from the data we chose j 1 and j 2 by using 12 nest laying dates in specific years from our random draws together with the corresponding temperature data then the statistical model gave the corresponding emergence rates for each nest and the nesting model gives the α t coefficient in our annual model for year t for the matrix at year t the dominant eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector with 46 adults were found these results are presented in table 4 we then chose our baseline survival rates for j 1 and j 2 as 0 78 and 0 83 respectively which yields p 2 g 3 and p 3 g 4 respectively 0 76 0 02 and 0 82 0 0135 as we examined choices for these survival rates we assumed that the survival rate for j 2 is greater than for j 1 and used the size distribution of the classes to decide this illustrative model could be run for other baseline values if more were known about these survival rates then this model could be rerun with adjusted rates to get the initial conditions for the first year we used the adult initial population 46 corresponding to 12 nests and eq 14 and the dominant eigenvalue for the matrix l to find the corresponding eigenvector with 46 in its third component and then other two components were the initial conditions for the two juvenile classes for our baseline parameters the initial populations for j 1 and j 2 are 2803 and 317 respectively 4 results for each draw of 12 nests we obtain the nest lay dates and corresponding g 1 from the statistical model for each date and the resulting e and h equations are solved for one draw we show the corresponding numbers of eggs and hatchlings over one summer nesting season fig 3 our simulations show some oscillations in the hatchlings at time t f but overall they decline as does j 1 j 2 and a for years 2006 to 2020 fig 4 as the number of adults goes down from 46 to 41 we adjust our numbers of nests to be lower due to having a smaller reproductive cohort using the relationship between the number n of nests and the number of adults in eq 14 when viewing the hatchlings at t f the population level is affected by the nesting season temperatures and by a decrease in the number of the nests the eigenvalues corresponding to the 3 3 matrix l for each year t are calculated to obtain the dominant eigenvalue note that the dominant eigenvalues are mostly less than 1 in fig 5 we cannot predict the long term growth from these eigenvalues due to the time varying coefficient with stochasticity coming from the statistical model but we can expect to see decline in the population without predicting the long term structure for some cases of deterministic matrix models there are some stability results for periodic rates and analysis for certain types of other time varying rates is beginning to be developed cushing and ackleh 2012 bacaër 2009 elaydi 2005 mokni et al 2020 4 1 results from 20 draws of nest dates we illustrate the population changes by using 20 draws of nest dates from our data for each year rusenko and anderson 2020 which gives about 3600 nest start dates where 20 draws 12 nests each summer for 15 years 3600 then using our baseline parameters values and nest dates from 20 draws of our data we simulated the populations from 2006 to 2020 and the resulting dynamics of the hatchlings at t f are presented in fig 6 and the corresponding variances are in table 3 the unusual population dynamics and its high variances around 2017 and 2018 are due to temperatures in those years and the drop in the number of nests 4 2 projection with temperature increase due to climate change with current climate change predictions the temperature is projected to increase by 0 18 c every 10 years noaa nce 2020b to see how the population classes would change in the future if the temperature went up 0 01 8 each year assuming a linear rate of change we simulated our population model forward starting from 2020 baseline nest dates and going for 50 years fig 7 shows a decline in the adult population from our original cohort of 46 adults as time goes on this decline in the adult population causes the number of nests to decrease even more which gives the resulting decline in the hatchlings at the end of each summer nesting season the adult population drops from 46 to 25 in those 50 years and every population class drops significantly this temperature change will negatively affect both male production due to temperature dependent sex determination and embryonic survival as temperatures that are too warm kill developing embryos 5 discussion we successfully built a hybrid model connecting our statistical model for the emergence success of hatchlings to our population model of juveniles and adults besides having feedback from a statistical model the population model is innovative due to two different linked time scales with a discrete sub model for the nesting seasons in days linked into a discrete annual model for juveniles and adults in years the coefficients in the nesting season submodel vary with t t years and days and depend on the statistical model the matrix in the population model has a time varying coefficient connected to the nesting season model through hatchlings across the 15 year time frame of the data from 2006 to 2020 we can demonstrate the decrease in hatchlings in certain years and the decreasing trend of both juveniles classes and the adult class these decreasing trends were illustrated for 20 random draws of the data we also showed how changes in the survival rates of the j 1 and j 2 affect the growth of juvenile and adult populations and the population distribution using our choice of baseline parameters for the survival rates for the two juvenile classes we illustrated the corresponding population dynamics we illustrated how the dynamics would change with those rates as shown in table 4 this hybrid model was used to predict the populations going forward in time with an increase in temperature due to climate change using random draws the temperatures were increased by a fixed percentage each year and we can see the decline in the populations to the increased temperatures due to climate change we developed a generalized linear mixed model to determine the effects of environmental changes on the emergence success of loggerhead nests this model explained roughly 22 6 of the variation in the hatchling emergence success proportions with predictors of the mean daily maximum air temperature for each trimester and with intercepts for differing years this level of success gives us a perspective on how climatic changes i e air temperature will influence loggerhead populations in years to come air temperature relates closely to nest temperatures and is well documented across time and space lolavar and wyneken 2020 erb et al 2018 we found that high air temperatures tend to negatively impact emergence success in all three trimesters of incubation additionally loggerhead eggs are especially susceptible to elevated air temperature in the first trimester of incubation previous studies have shown that incubation temperatures above 34 c negatively impact hatching success miller 1985 ackerman 1997 bladow and milton 2020 since we were interested in the environmental effects due to climate change specifically we did not use clutch temperatures this is because the clutch temperatures late in the middle trimester and in the 3rd trimester reflect both thermal effects from solar radiation and biogenic heat from embryo s metabolic processes metabolic heat degregorio and williard 2011 our simulation results using the data and our linked model suggests that global warming will negatively impact the success of loggerhead nests in the boca raton area in the coming years however how climate changes will affect hatchling production in the northwest atlantic loggerhead population is unclear some beaches may experience enhanced hatchling output while others may experience worse declines than the predictions here for the boca raton rookery we acknowledge that increasing temperature would probably change the sex ratios in these populations more female turtles could lay more nests but eventually the lack of males would have a negative impact heppell et al 2022 the effect of climate change could have uncertain tradeoff features effective reduction of greenhouse gas emissions could moderate the temperature increase and then improve the incubation conditions of the population of peninsular loggerheads ultimately these aspects of temperature throughout incubation are not sufficient predictors alone to adequately understand the abiotic and biological mechanisms behind emergence success our work used data from a particular geographical area and more research involving other locations is needed to understand climate effects diverse variables such as the maternal health hatchling condition also termed fitness predators wave run up and tidal inundation sediment characteristics such as sand porosity gas exchange sand moisture and human activity around the nests likely play roles as well brost et al 2015 steinitz et al 1998 greater focus on the interactions of factors influencing emergence success is necessary to improve the predictability of hatchling emergence success a key metric in measuring production these fundamental steps are necessary to improve population dynamic models of these threatened sea turtles to account for more predictors of emergence success and the population trends 6 conclusions hatchlings from loggerhead nests in peninsular florida account for a majority of the atlantic population conant et al 2009 so factors impacting the success of these nests have a sizable impact on the loggerhead population as a whole loggerheads are an imperiled species in the u s under the endangered species act of 1973 as amended through the 108th congress p l 108 136 november 24 2003 making increased surveillance and conservation measures essential to create effective conservation plans it is vital that we understand the factors with the greatest influence on nest productivity and population trends although the hatchling stage of sea turtles is the simplest to observe given the fact juveniles and adults spend a majority of their lives at sea relatively little research beyond fisheries bycatch has yet been done and more research is needed to determine aspects of their habitat that might contribute to further degradation of their population health despite the clear need for further exploration of emergence success predictors the model defined in this study provides novel insight to the effects of changing climatic patterns on loggerhead nests such an approach allows testing with data and with projected scenarios so that we can gain better understanding of the dynamics of some populations depending on available data of loggerhead turtles and develop conservation plans tailored to the specific needs of nesting sites to promote population growth of a threatened species our approach goes beyond the models representing temperature effects via correlation or microclimate models on hatchling emergence success due to our inclusion of egg hatchling juvenile and adult populations fuentes et al 2013 our work presents a tool which is an important starting point since it combines a statistical model with stochasticity and features connecting eggs hatchlings juveniles and adults as more robust data become available this tool can be expanded and refined at this time we are limited by available high quality data and recognize the need to extend this model in the future using data from other locations to get more insight into the variety of effects of climate change many data are not known but needed to take models such as this one to the next level the agent based model in piacenza et al 2017 has the potential to examine some effects of climate change piacenza et al 2017 but that work also would need more data a model with tropic relationships by morales zarate et al 2004 incorporated the effect of fishery measures and sea surface temperatures on loggerhead turtles in the gulf of ulloa mexico such models could be linked with models of hatchling emergence success morales zárate et al 2021 adding the feature of time varying sex ratios connected to data would be important to understand the combination effect of temperature and sex ratios changes the tradeoff between the decreasing number of hatchlings and the possible increasing percentages of female turtles due to rising temperature would be interesting to explore when data sets are available relating to sex ratios the ratio of females to males can easily be changed in this model we would consider some of the new approaches to this issue monsinjon et al 2022 laloe et al 2017 we acknowledge that other effects like breeding and nesting time adjustments may be needed in future work weishampel et al 2004 ceriani et al 2019 clusa et al 2018 the breeding and nesting timing could be adjusted if one had the appropriate data we also note that more knowledge about growth dynamics and obtaining juvenile loggerhead recruitment data would be useful avens et al 2013 in future model formulations one could also consider agent based models with environmental features extending the work of past studies mazaris et al 2005 2006 piacenza et al 2017 gaining much needed empirical measures of more accurate rates for the survival of the juvenile classes would also be important having sufficient empirical data to use clutch temperatures rather than proxies will remove sources of environmental error not captured by the current approach one could also consider soil temperature and its effects as in a microclimate model fuentes and porter 2013 regardless of how future studies proceed continuing to investigate the effects of climate change on sea turtle production and health with more data and

24194,loggerhead sea turtles caretta caretta are a threatened sea turtle species that nests on beaches along the northwestern atlantic ocean loggerhead nesting in florida accounts for approximately 80 of the loggerhead population in the atlantic ocean yet the underlying ecological mechanisms behind their population dynamics are understudied c caretta are largely inaccessible since they spend most of their early life in open ocean habitats consequently their nesting and hatchling production offer quantifiable insight of their population dynamics emergence success the proportion of eggs laid that produce offspring which successfully leave the nest is the source of all later life stages yet the abiotic factors that drive emergence success trends have not been fully described this study explores the relationship between air temperature and emergence success across multiple nesting seasons to better understand the potential impact of anthropogenic climate change on subsequent loggerhead populations here we investigate the effect of changing emergence success on the juvenile and adult life stages after exploring numerous aspects of temperature and precipitation metrics we determined that the mean of the maximum daily temperatures for each trimester of the eggs incubation periods related most closely to the variation in emergence success the proportion of hatchlings that make it out of the nest across nests a novel feature of our approach to modeling the impact of temperature on the later life stages is through connecting a statistical model into a discrete mechanistic population model our population model has two parts one with eggs and hatchlings on a daily time scale in the nesting season and the other with juveniles and adults on an annual time scale the statistical model enables us to illustrate the effect of temperature changes across these life stages the decline in the adult population follows from the decline of the hatchling emergence success using predicted increases in temperature due to climate change we illustrate a corresponding prediction for the population classes keywords loggerhead turtles temperature effects statistical model discrete stage structure model data availability we have provided the information to request the data from gumbo limbo nature center boca raton fl 1 introduction and background loggerhead sea turtles caretta caretta are an imperiled species that nests on the coast of southeastern florida bovery and wyneken 2013 they are listed as threatened in the united states under the endangered species act of 1973 as amended through the 108th congress p l 108 136 november 24 2003 conant et al 2009 their imperiled status is primarily due to the pertubation of production among which are the negative effects of juveniles and adult bycatch in the fishing industry lewison and crowder 2007 loggerhead population decline led to the widespread introduction of turtle excluder devices teds in many trawl fisheries and modifications of gillnet and long line fisheries which significantly reduced the threat to loggerhead survival but other anthropogenic activities continue to threaten the health of koggerhead populations conant et al 2009 the northwest atlantic loggerhead s status as a threatened species merits a management plan to minimize threats to the population until it reaches a sustainable population size without human interference an effective management plan for loggerheads requires an understanding of their population dynamics in addition to threats fuentes et al 2013 lópez mendilaharsu et al 2020 measuring population sizes in highly migratory long lived late maturing species is difficult musick 1999 the task is particularly challenging because loggerheads spend much of their lives at sea where detailed census is not feasible our goal is to mathematically explore the relationship between air temperature and emergence success of hatchings across multiple nesting seasons to better anticipate the potential impact of anthropogenic climate change on subsequent loggerhead populations using data from southeast florida we build a statistical model representing the relationship of air temperature and hatchling emergence success the results of the statistical model are then used in the nesting season submodel that connects to annual population model to demonstrate the effect of changing emergence success on the juvenile and adult life stages the terrestrial life stages eggs hatchlings and reproductive females are the easiest to observe and consequently the best described females in the united states typically nest every 2 3 years between april and september erb and wyneken 2019 in boca raton area of florida nests contain an average of 105 eggs and incubate for 42 60 days brost et al 2015 loggerhead embryonic incubation can be partitioned functionally into three major phases trimesters of development erb and wyneken 2019 bentley et al 2020 during the first trimester embryos undergo cell division and form gross features but do not undergo much overall growth bladow and milton 2020 wyneken and lolavar 2015 in the second trimester embryos develop all major organ systems and metabolism increases bladow and milton 2020 in the third trimester of development embryos produce greater amounts of metabolic heat as they grow rapidly and metabolize yolk reserves they become mobile in the egg and develop strength that is employed during hatching and emergence from the nest and then the initiation of offshore migration bladow and milton 2020 wyneken and lolavar 2015 current estimates of incubation conditions indicate that loggerhead embryos must spend the vast majority of their development at nest temperatures ranging from 27 c to 34 c for the embryos to become hatchlings and successfully emerge from the nest bladow and milton 2020 wyneken and lolavar 2015 ackerman 1997 ackerman and lott 2004 yet the effects of environmental temperature on loggerhead nests are not well studied there is also evidence that sand moisture plays an important role in the success of the nests erb et al 2018 miller 1985 temperature of the air and of the sand plays a role in the sex determination of loggerhead turtles with warmer temperatures above a critical threshold tending to produce female dominant clutches yntema and mrosovsky 1980 1982 mitchell and janzen 2010 girondot et al 2010 wyneken and lolavar 2015 clusa et al 2018 since we do not have data nor a clear trajectory for how much feminization will occur across the temperature ranges explored here we chose not to include this feature in our current modeling work estimating sex ratios without data verification may not be productive monsinjon et al 2022 lolavar and wyneken 2020 heppell et al 2022 jensen et al 2022 stage based population models have been used historically to examine the population dynamics of a variety of populations including loggerhead sea turtles caswell 2018 henson et al 2010 these models consider fecundity rates survival rates and transition rates to predict the number of individuals in each life stage caswell 2018 heppell et al 2000 work led by crouse and crowder with collaborators constructed stage based matrix models for loggerhead sea turtles and predicted the need for teds to protect juveniles and later reported on the effects of such devices crouse et al 1987 crowder et al 1994 although survival rates for these life stages have been studied the underlying mechanisms informing the transition between stages along with the effects of environmental conditions during development remain underappreciated montero et al 2018 fuentes et al 2010 glen and mrosovsky 2004 booth and limpus 2008 to explore possible mechanisms we investigate environmental predictors of emergence success we evaluated temperature and precipitation as possible predictors for hatchling emergence success to better understand the impacts of changing climatic conditions on recruitment within the atlantic loggerhead population this statistical model construction used the nest inventory data provided by the city of boca raton s sea turtle program at gumbo limbo nature center rusenko and anderson 2020 then to see the results of the statistical model propagate through the life stages we created a discrete predictive model that provides an understanding of the effects of hatchling emergence success on juveniles and adults from year to year in addition to building on the background of stage structured discrete models some recent research on such models using different time scales and time varying coefficients relates to our discrete population level model with two time scales sanz et al 2019 cushing and henson 2018 in the nesting part of our model the transition probability of eggs into the hatchling stage was determined by the statistical model using a novel approach we link the statistical model into a discrete time population model we do this by using the hatchling emergence success rate as a time varying coefficient this discrete population model also has innovative features of two different time scales connecting the egg and hatching classes on a daily time step during the nesting season with the two juvenile classes and an adult class on a yearly time scale our linked model is based on a cohort of turtles from 12 nests in the southeast florida nesting beach area using the loggerhead nest data rusenko and anderson 2020 we illustrate the dynamic results of our model using 20 random draws from the boca raton florida nest data from each of the years 2006 2020 which gives about 3600 nest start dates using a statistical model with the effects of temperature on the hatchling emergence to provide output for a time varying coefficient in a matrix stage structure model is a new approach with two combined models we can predict the possible effects of changing temperature on the loggerhead population along the beaches of peninsular florida this model provides a tool for predicting the impact of anthropogenic climate change on loggerheads especially those in florida offering vital perspectives for future conservation efforts 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection we began our analysis of emergence success for northwestern atlantic loggerheads using nest inventory data provided by the city of boca raton sea turtle conservation program rusenko and anderson 2020 each year hundreds of nests on the beaches of boca raton are surveyed and inventoried to collect the lay date hatchling emergence date and success of the eggs in each nest at inventory eggs are sorted into fate classes based on the fate of the embryo numbers of hatchlings that successfully emerge from the nest hatchlings that do not successfully emerge from the nest and those that are unhatched miller et al 2017 miller 1999 from these data we used the lay date hatchling emergence date and proportion emerged for 4309 nests from nesting seasons from 2006 2020 we examined aspects of air temperature available from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa noaa nce 2020a the west palm beach international airport weather station was the closest about 40 km to the nesting beaches in boca raton and offered full weather data across the entire range of nesting seasons this station was near the coastline and provided as accurate air temperature readings as possible for the nests that we examined in later years weather stations closer to the nesting beaches were installed these allowed us to verify that air temperatures between this station were closely correlated with a subset of clutches that were instrumented with temperature dataloggers throughout incubation erb et al 2018 2 2 data management and model selection we input the raw nest inventory data for each clutch including the total number of eggs the emergence success of hatchlings the lay date and the emergence date hereafter termed hatch date rusenko and anderson 2020 two matrices were then populated with the daily minimum and daily maximum air temperatures for each nest we extracted temperatures for each of the three developmental trimesters for individual nests trimesters were estimated by finding the duration of incubation in days from oviposition to the first hatchling emergence divided by 3 this approach assumes linear rates of development but minor deviations were present delmas et al 2008 girondot et al 2018 for our analysis we focused on the maximum daily temperature for each trimester maximum and minimum daily temperatures were defined as the arithmetic mean of the daily maximum and the daily minimum temperature for each trimester the daily cumulative precipitation data were not normally distributed and were log transformed prior to data analysis total precipitation per trimester was estimated by summing rainfall amounts for the developmental trimesters calculated for each nest we then calculated the arithmetic mean of daily precipitation for each day in each trimester we constructed a generalized linear mixed model to predict emergence success modeled as the logit transformation of the proportion of hatchling emerging from a nest we explored various models using temperature and precipitation metrics for each trimester temperature covariates explored included mean mean minimum mean maximum and degree day accumulation above 3 2 3 3 and 34 c for each trimester potential precipitation covariates included mean daily precipitation and cumulative precipitation for each trimester year was treated as a random effect and permitted to have varying intercepts model selection was done using backwards stepwise procedure with α 0 1 for elimination using satterthwaite s approximation for denominator degrees of freedom all statistical analyses were performed in the r statistical programming environment v 4 0 2 r core team 2020 using functions from the lmertest v3 1 2 kuznetsova et al 2017 and rsq v2 0 zhang 2020 packages 2 3 results of the statistical model based on stepwise model selection the best model included mean daily maximum temperature from each trimester neither of the precipitation measures were identified as a useful predictor for emergence success and were not included in our final model our final model explained 22 6 of the variation in emergence success r a d j 2 0 226 with 8 explained by mean daily maximum temperature r a d j 2 0 082 the final statistical model is below 1 ρ 11 999 0 159 t 1 0 101 t 2 0 086 t 3 with the predictors t 1 t 2 t 3 described in table 1 and the proportion ρ of hatchling emergence success given by ρ the natural logarithm of the odds ratio of ρ 2 ρ ln ρ 1 ρ then ρ is calculated using the following 3 ρ exp ρ 1 exp ρ in table 1 the predictors incubation trimester temperature measures t 1 t 2 t 3 represent the mean of the daily maximum air temperatures for the respective trimesters of nest incubation from 2006 to 2019 the southeastern florida coast experienced years with variable weather trends some were abnormally warm and dry and others cooler with significant precipitation the range of maximum air temperatures that an individual nest experienced during each trimester is related its lay date the nests proportion of emergence success ranged from 0 42 to 0 81 throughout these nesting seasons generally daily maximum temperatures tended to increase throughout the incubation periods for nests laid early in the nesting season and tended to decrease throughout the period for nests laid later in the season across years mean maximum temperatures remained relatively stable with a few years e 2010 2011 2015 2016 that were irregularly warm these warmer years also experienced intense dips in emergence success overall as seen in fig 1 for illustrative purposes in this figure we used mean of the daily maximum air temperatures over the nesting seasons which were negatively correlated with the hatching emergence success proportions with r 0 63 2 4 discrete turtle population model our discrete mathematical model represents the eggs hatchlings juveniles and adult turtles that are associated with a fixed number of clutches in the southeastern florida beach area we start by considering the turtles associated with 12 clutches a cohort of females laying the nests and their progeny hatchlings and juveniles we started with 12 nests each year from wyneken s lab research and then expanded to use other boca raton data using 12 nests when the adult population decreases a corresponding decrease in the number of nests occurs in the model our annual discrete model with yearly time steps is formulated with two juvenile classes based upon the natural history of the loggerheads and an adult class in the summer of each year the eggs and the hatchlings are modeled with time steps of days where t t means in year t and summer nesting time step t note that time t 0 in year t corresponds to the beginning of the nesting season taken to be april 1 we take the last possible day of the nesting season to be september 30 corresponding to t f 182 with time t in years and t in days of the nesting season the classes in our mathematical model are e t t eggs and h t t hatchlings in all the nests at t t j 1 t first juvenile class j 2 t second juvenile class a t adults as the reproductive class the descriptions of the juvenile and adult classes are given in table 2 and fig 2 shows the pathway through the annual model with the nesting season submodel which uses the statistical model 1 for hatchling recruitment in our model we only counted hatchlings that had successfully exited the nest crossed the beach and entered water to swim through nearshore waters the distance traveled varies because beach width varies with sand erosion or accretion bladow and briggs bladow and roberts briggs 2017 measured nesting beach geomorphology including much of the beach represented in our study loggerheads tend to nest in the middle of the beach consequentially their crawl distance typically ranges from 10 20 m assuming that we are given the size of the adult class a t at time t in years we calculated the proportion of the female adults that will lay nests each summer to represent the nests laid in year t we use a vector n t t with entries for each day t of the nesting season with n t t being the number of nests laid at time t t in our model n t t takes integer values 0 1 n the initial number of nests considered each year we want to express the number of hatchlings at the end of the nesting season as a function of a t and the results of the statistical model using the temperature conditions during the nesting season the order of events is important in a discrete time model our model starts with adult a t producing the number of eggs to be laid in the nesting season of year t the ratio of females to the total population of adults is estimated to be s 7 9 which means that females are about 7 out of 9 adults in the population casale et al 2005 arendt et al 2021 we acknowledge variation in the annual breeding probability and we use a reasonable approximation one third of the female adults are laying nests each summer because females nest on 2 4 year cycles with an average remigration interval number of years between two consecutive nesting years of 2 7 years which we rounded to 3 years bjorndal et al 1983 shamblin et al 2021 therefore we choose our values for n t t to satisfy 4 t 0 182 n t t a t 1 3 7 9 and use choices for nest laying dates from our data the sum over time t in eq 4 gives the total number of nests in the nesting season note we assume that there are 182 days in a nesting season in which nests could be actively incubating each trimester for eggs has length 17 days and thus the length l of the incubation period of each nest is approximately 51 days the average number of incubation days for this site using the average clutch size c 105 using the mean from the boca raton data our discrete equations for eggs leading to hatchlings is for 0 t 51 5 e t t 1 e t t c n t t for t 51 6 e t t 1 e t t c n t t c n t t 51 7 h t t 1 0 9 g 1 t t 51 c n t t 51 p 1 h t t in eq 6 the term c n t t gives the total number of eggs laid on day t in year t using the clutch size c and the number of nests n t t the term c n t t 51 moves out the eggs from nests laid 51 days ago average total length of the three trimesters and moves the surviving eggs to the hatchling class in eq 7 the daily survival rate of hatchlings is given by p 1 until the end of the nesting season at t f the coefficient g 1 t t 51 gives the probability of hatching survival from the nests laid at day t 51 in year t the value of g 1 is the output of the statistical model ρ from eqs 1 and 3 for year t with nest start day t using the mean of the maximum air temperatures over the three trimesters the scalar 0 9 comes from our definition of the hatchling class here the probability of a hatchling successfully entering the ocean beyond the nearshore waters from water s edge to 20 m out is 0 9 an estimated 5 of the emergent hatchlings do not make it across the sand and another 5 may be consumed by predators in the nearshore waters whelan and wyneken 2007 erb and wyneken 2019 resulting in that probability 0 9 0 95 0 95 the coefficient p 1 is the daily survival rate of hatchlings once they have left the nearshore waters for ocean nursery areas when the nesting season has concluded with t f being the last day of the season some proportion g 2 of hatchlings survive to the end of the year and transition to the first juvenile stage j 1 the next event involves the surviving hatchlings joining the surviving j 1 juveniles which are also the proportion of j 1 who are staying in this class and both are going into j 1 t 1 the surviving j 1 juveniles are divided in those staying in j 1 and those transitioning into j 2 the surviving and transitioning j 1 join the surviving j 2 those j 2 who are staying in that class and both are going into j 2 t 1 lastly the adults survive and are joined by surviving j 2 that are transferring in and both go into a t 1 our juvenile adult model is given by 8 j 1 t 1 g 2 h t t f p 2 j 1 t 9 j 2 t 1 g 3 j 1 t p 3 j 2 t 10 a t 1 g 4 j 2 t p 4 a t the coefficient p 2 gives the annual rate proportion of survival and remaining in j 1 while g 3 gives the proportion in j 1 that survive and move into j 2 similarly p 3 is the annual rate proportion of survival and remaining in j 2 and g 4 is the proportion in j 2 that survive and move into a lastly p 4 is the annual survival probability of a t the parameter definitions and baseline values are in table 2 we can write the rate α t of new juveniles in year t per adult in a t compartment as the result of their hatchlings surviving to become juveniles as 11 α t g 2 h t t f a t note that h t t f depends on the size of adult class a t and the results of the statistical model during the nesting season in that year thus eq 8 can be rewritten as 12 j 1 t 1 p 2 j 1 t α t a t where α t depends on the statistical model 1 through the egg and hatchling eqs 5 7 we consider the population of turtles associated with n nests laid in our beach cohort recall from above the total number of nests corresponds to a proportion of the adult population reproducing in a given year given by 13 n a t 1 3 7 9 which gives 14 a t 3 9 7 n the juvenile adult system 8 10 is a 3 3 matrix model with classes j 1 j 2 and a but one coefficient α t will vary over time 3 calculation of growth and survival rates at each time step we calculate the proportion that remain and transfer out of each class directly from our annual survival probabilities see table 2 these calculations are different for the different stages for hatchlings we scale the annual survival probability to match the daily time step of the seasonal model 7 for the juvenile classes we split up the annual survival probabilities into the proportions that survive and remain juveniles and the proportions that survive and transfer to the next stage for the adult class they do not transfer out to another stage so we can keep their annual survival probability as the proportion that survives and remains adults this is to say p 4 0 9 from national marine fisheries service and u s fish and wildlife service 2008 since hatchlings are modeled with a daily time scale to get their proportion that survive and remain and the proportion that survive and transfer to become juvenile j 1 we must scale the annual hatchling survival probability using an annual survival rate of 0 6 for hatchlings we choose the daily rate p 1 to satisfy p 1 365 0 6 which gives p 1 0 6 365 0 9986 national marine fisheries service and u s fish and wildlife service 2008 the proportion that survives to transfer out from the hatchling class into the first juvenile class is calculated similarly thus the probability that the hatchlings on the final day of the nesting season survive until the end of the year for 92 days the number of days in the year after day t f october december is g 2 such that g 2 365 92 0 6 giving g 2 0 88 for the two juvenile classes at each yearly time step the surviving turtles either remain in that class or transfer to the next class this gives a corresponding split of the annual survival probabilities caswell 2018 crouse et al 1987 this calculation involves the class s annual survival probability p and its stage duration d first we calculate the proportion that survive and remain in that class if we set the proportion of individuals alive in the first juvenile year cohort to be 1 then the distribution of juveniles across all years of being a juvenile will be 1 p p 2 p 3 p d 1 here p d 1 is the probability that a juvenile will survive to the oldest age in the class the proportion of juveniles that survive and remain in the same juvenile class is the probability p that juveniles not in the oldest year survive another year 15 p 1 p p 2 p d 2 1 p p 2 p d 1 p a similar calculation is done to find the proportion g that survive and transfer to the next stage 16 g p d 1 1 p p 2 p d 1 p explicitly we choose the annual survival for j 1 and j 2 and use the p and g formulas 15 and 16 to obtain p 2 g 3 p 3 and g 4 to calculate the initial conditions of our three annual classes we use the method of eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors on the leslie matrix formed from our annual classes j 1 j 2 a caswell 2018 this is an approximation to get our initial conditions since we will assume temporarily that the 3 3 matrix has constant coefficients that can predict the stable age distribution we know that the coefficient that produces j 1 from a t is time varying due to the nest lay dates and the corresponding temperatures each summer 17 l p 2 0 α t g 3 p 3 0 0 g 4 p 4 to find the rate of new juveniles in year t per adult α t we calculate h t t f by using a t g 1 from the statistical model and the egg and hatchling eqs 5 7 we also use our egg laying vector n to give exactly when each nest was laid that year now with the number of hatchlings at the end of the nesting season t f h t t f known for a given t we know α t from 11 and thus can calculate the eigenvalues for our matrix the dominant eigenvalue λ would be the long term growth rate of our population assuming this matrix representation would remain valid for generations let v v 1 v 2 v 3 be the eigenvector corresponding to λ and v represents the population distribution that grows at the given rate λ thus to calculate the initial population for our model and assuming a t is known we need to scale v by a scalar c such that c v 3 a t and that gives c v 1 j 1 t and c v 2 j 2 t if data relating to the ratios of juvenile classes to the adult class were available we could make a better estimate of the population distribution using our data coupled with our statistical model we simulate the turtle populations using the dates and outcomes of 12 nests per year by using eq 14 for the number of nests we see that the number of initial adults is 46 for each year we divided the nest data into 12 quantiles and randomly chose 12 nest laying dates one from each quartile of the nest lay date data that summer from the sea turtle nesting database of nests and nest outcomes in boca raton florida rusenko and anderson 2020 to show future simulation predictions we draw 20 sets of data each set has 15 years with 12 summer nest lay dates for one draw of 12 nests we obtain the nest lay dates and corresponding g 1 hatchling survival depending on the temperature during the three trimesters for each date and the resulting egg and hatchling populations are simulated over the nesting season notice the peak of the egg populations is near t 100 followed by the increase in hatchlings over one summer nesting season in fig 3 those dates together with the corresponding temperature data from the nest and the corresponding results from our statistical model give the proportion of the hatchlings that survive to enter the ocean and successfully exit the nearshore waters then a proportion of those hatchlings survive until the end of the year from the g 2 coefficient going into α t rate in the j 1 eq 11 the annual survival rates for j 1 and j 2 classes were not clearly available in the literature but the other baseline parameters in table 2 were found from national marine fisheries service and u s fish and wildlife service 2008 and our data summarizing parameters for the annual survival rates of hatchlings and adults were taken from national marine fisheries service and u s fish and wildlife service 2008 and the survival rates of hatchlings gave values for p 1 and q 2 after we chose the annual survival rates of j 1 and j 2 as discussed in the next paragraph we used them to calculate p 2 q 3 and p 3 q 4 the average clutch size and the length of the nesting season were taken from the data we chose j 1 and j 2 by using 12 nest laying dates in specific years from our random draws together with the corresponding temperature data then the statistical model gave the corresponding emergence rates for each nest and the nesting model gives the α t coefficient in our annual model for year t for the matrix at year t the dominant eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector with 46 adults were found these results are presented in table 4 we then chose our baseline survival rates for j 1 and j 2 as 0 78 and 0 83 respectively which yields p 2 g 3 and p 3 g 4 respectively 0 76 0 02 and 0 82 0 0135 as we examined choices for these survival rates we assumed that the survival rate for j 2 is greater than for j 1 and used the size distribution of the classes to decide this illustrative model could be run for other baseline values if more were known about these survival rates then this model could be rerun with adjusted rates to get the initial conditions for the first year we used the adult initial population 46 corresponding to 12 nests and eq 14 and the dominant eigenvalue for the matrix l to find the corresponding eigenvector with 46 in its third component and then other two components were the initial conditions for the two juvenile classes for our baseline parameters the initial populations for j 1 and j 2 are 2803 and 317 respectively 4 results for each draw of 12 nests we obtain the nest lay dates and corresponding g 1 from the statistical model for each date and the resulting e and h equations are solved for one draw we show the corresponding numbers of eggs and hatchlings over one summer nesting season fig 3 our simulations show some oscillations in the hatchlings at time t f but overall they decline as does j 1 j 2 and a for years 2006 to 2020 fig 4 as the number of adults goes down from 46 to 41 we adjust our numbers of nests to be lower due to having a smaller reproductive cohort using the relationship between the number n of nests and the number of adults in eq 14 when viewing the hatchlings at t f the population level is affected by the nesting season temperatures and by a decrease in the number of the nests the eigenvalues corresponding to the 3 3 matrix l for each year t are calculated to obtain the dominant eigenvalue note that the dominant eigenvalues are mostly less than 1 in fig 5 we cannot predict the long term growth from these eigenvalues due to the time varying coefficient with stochasticity coming from the statistical model but we can expect to see decline in the population without predicting the long term structure for some cases of deterministic matrix models there are some stability results for periodic rates and analysis for certain types of other time varying rates is beginning to be developed cushing and ackleh 2012 bacaër 2009 elaydi 2005 mokni et al 2020 4 1 results from 20 draws of nest dates we illustrate the population changes by using 20 draws of nest dates from our data for each year rusenko and anderson 2020 which gives about 3600 nest start dates where 20 draws 12 nests each summer for 15 years 3600 then using our baseline parameters values and nest dates from 20 draws of our data we simulated the populations from 2006 to 2020 and the resulting dynamics of the hatchlings at t f are presented in fig 6 and the corresponding variances are in table 3 the unusual population dynamics and its high variances around 2017 and 2018 are due to temperatures in those years and the drop in the number of nests 4 2 projection with temperature increase due to climate change with current climate change predictions the temperature is projected to increase by 0 18 c every 10 years noaa nce 2020b to see how the population classes would change in the future if the temperature went up 0 01 8 each year assuming a linear rate of change we simulated our population model forward starting from 2020 baseline nest dates and going for 50 years fig 7 shows a decline in the adult population from our original cohort of 46 adults as time goes on this decline in the adult population causes the number of nests to decrease even more which gives the resulting decline in the hatchlings at the end of each summer nesting season the adult population drops from 46 to 25 in those 50 years and every population class drops significantly this temperature change will negatively affect both male production due to temperature dependent sex determination and embryonic survival as temperatures that are too warm kill developing embryos 5 discussion we successfully built a hybrid model connecting our statistical model for the emergence success of hatchlings to our population model of juveniles and adults besides having feedback from a statistical model the population model is innovative due to two different linked time scales with a discrete sub model for the nesting seasons in days linked into a discrete annual model for juveniles and adults in years the coefficients in the nesting season submodel vary with t t years and days and depend on the statistical model the matrix in the population model has a time varying coefficient connected to the nesting season model through hatchlings across the 15 year time frame of the data from 2006 to 2020 we can demonstrate the decrease in hatchlings in certain years and the decreasing trend of both juveniles classes and the adult class these decreasing trends were illustrated for 20 random draws of the data we also showed how changes in the survival rates of the j 1 and j 2 affect the growth of juvenile and adult populations and the population distribution using our choice of baseline parameters for the survival rates for the two juvenile classes we illustrated the corresponding population dynamics we illustrated how the dynamics would change with those rates as shown in table 4 this hybrid model was used to predict the populations going forward in time with an increase in temperature due to climate change using random draws the temperatures were increased by a fixed percentage each year and we can see the decline in the populations to the increased temperatures due to climate change we developed a generalized linear mixed model to determine the effects of environmental changes on the emergence success of loggerhead nests this model explained roughly 22 6 of the variation in the hatchling emergence success proportions with predictors of the mean daily maximum air temperature for each trimester and with intercepts for differing years this level of success gives us a perspective on how climatic changes i e air temperature will influence loggerhead populations in years to come air temperature relates closely to nest temperatures and is well documented across time and space lolavar and wyneken 2020 erb et al 2018 we found that high air temperatures tend to negatively impact emergence success in all three trimesters of incubation additionally loggerhead eggs are especially susceptible to elevated air temperature in the first trimester of incubation previous studies have shown that incubation temperatures above 34 c negatively impact hatching success miller 1985 ackerman 1997 bladow and milton 2020 since we were interested in the environmental effects due to climate change specifically we did not use clutch temperatures this is because the clutch temperatures late in the middle trimester and in the 3rd trimester reflect both thermal effects from solar radiation and biogenic heat from embryo s metabolic processes metabolic heat degregorio and williard 2011 our simulation results using the data and our linked model suggests that global warming will negatively impact the success of loggerhead nests in the boca raton area in the coming years however how climate changes will affect hatchling production in the northwest atlantic loggerhead population is unclear some beaches may experience enhanced hatchling output while others may experience worse declines than the predictions here for the boca raton rookery we acknowledge that increasing temperature would probably change the sex ratios in these populations more female turtles could lay more nests but eventually the lack of males would have a negative impact heppell et al 2022 the effect of climate change could have uncertain tradeoff features effective reduction of greenhouse gas emissions could moderate the temperature increase and then improve the incubation conditions of the population of peninsular loggerheads ultimately these aspects of temperature throughout incubation are not sufficient predictors alone to adequately understand the abiotic and biological mechanisms behind emergence success our work used data from a particular geographical area and more research involving other locations is needed to understand climate effects diverse variables such as the maternal health hatchling condition also termed fitness predators wave run up and tidal inundation sediment characteristics such as sand porosity gas exchange sand moisture and human activity around the nests likely play roles as well brost et al 2015 steinitz et al 1998 greater focus on the interactions of factors influencing emergence success is necessary to improve the predictability of hatchling emergence success a key metric in measuring production these fundamental steps are necessary to improve population dynamic models of these threatened sea turtles to account for more predictors of emergence success and the population trends 6 conclusions hatchlings from loggerhead nests in peninsular florida account for a majority of the atlantic population conant et al 2009 so factors impacting the success of these nests have a sizable impact on the loggerhead population as a whole loggerheads are an imperiled species in the u s under the endangered species act of 1973 as amended through the 108th congress p l 108 136 november 24 2003 making increased surveillance and conservation measures essential to create effective conservation plans it is vital that we understand the factors with the greatest influence on nest productivity and population trends although the hatchling stage of sea turtles is the simplest to observe given the fact juveniles and adults spend a majority of their lives at sea relatively little research beyond fisheries bycatch has yet been done and more research is needed to determine aspects of their habitat that might contribute to further degradation of their population health despite the clear need for further exploration of emergence success predictors the model defined in this study provides novel insight to the effects of changing climatic patterns on loggerhead nests such an approach allows testing with data and with projected scenarios so that we can gain better understanding of the dynamics of some populations depending on available data of loggerhead turtles and develop conservation plans tailored to the specific needs of nesting sites to promote population growth of a threatened species our approach goes beyond the models representing temperature effects via correlation or microclimate models on hatchling emergence success due to our inclusion of egg hatchling juvenile and adult populations fuentes et al 2013 our work presents a tool which is an important starting point since it combines a statistical model with stochasticity and features connecting eggs hatchlings juveniles and adults as more robust data become available this tool can be expanded and refined at this time we are limited by available high quality data and recognize the need to extend this model in the future using data from other locations to get more insight into the variety of effects of climate change many data are not known but needed to take models such as this one to the next level the agent based model in piacenza et al 2017 has the potential to examine some effects of climate change piacenza et al 2017 but that work also would need more data a model with tropic relationships by morales zarate et al 2004 incorporated the effect of fishery measures and sea surface temperatures on loggerhead turtles in the gulf of ulloa mexico such models could be linked with models of hatchling emergence success morales zárate et al 2021 adding the feature of time varying sex ratios connected to data would be important to understand the combination effect of temperature and sex ratios changes the tradeoff between the decreasing number of hatchlings and the possible increasing percentages of female turtles due to rising temperature would be interesting to explore when data sets are available relating to sex ratios the ratio of females to males can easily be changed in this model we would consider some of the new approaches to this issue monsinjon et al 2022 laloe et al 2017 we acknowledge that other effects like breeding and nesting time adjustments may be needed in future work weishampel et al 2004 ceriani et al 2019 clusa et al 2018 the breeding and nesting timing could be adjusted if one had the appropriate data we also note that more knowledge about growth dynamics and obtaining juvenile loggerhead recruitment data would be useful avens et al 2013 in future model formulations one could also consider agent based models with environmental features extending the work of past studies mazaris et al 2005 2006 piacenza et al 2017 gaining much needed empirical measures of more accurate rates for the survival of the juvenile classes would also be important having sufficient empirical data to use clutch temperatures rather than proxies will remove sources of environmental error not captured by the current approach one could also consider soil temperature and its effects as in a microclimate model fuentes and porter 2013 regardless of how future studies proceed continuing to investigate the effects of climate change on sea turtle production and health with more data and modeling is vital to sea turtle conservation and management credit authorship contribution statement spencer catron developed the mathematical models completed numerical simulations formulating ideas
