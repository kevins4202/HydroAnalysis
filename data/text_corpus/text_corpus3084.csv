15420,site average natural source zone depletion nszd rates measured from 40 petroleum light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl source zone sites were compiled from researchers project reports and scientific papers at each site the following data were compiled i general site location ii lnapl fuel type iii measurement method number of locations and number of measurements per location and iv calculated site average nszd rate in liters per hectare per year l ha yr per site and the associated measurement method i e gradient method carbon traps dynamic closed chamber dcc or thermal monitoring the resulting dataset showed site average nszd rates that ranged from 650 to 152 000 l ha yr 70 to 16 250 gallons per acre per year gal acre yr with a median value of 9 540 l ha yr 1 020 gal acre yr the median site average nszd rate by type of fuel spill did not show a statistically significant difference between fuel types when comparing the different nszd measurement methods applied to the same sites the site average nszd rates differed by up to 4 8 times i e ratio of faster rate to slower rate with a median difference of 2 1 times no clear bias was observed between nszd rate measurement methods at four sites with calculations of nszd rates by season nszd rates were typically higher during summer and fall compared to winter and spring for these sites q10 values a measure of the increase in nszd rate associated with a 10 c increase in temperature ranged from 0 8 to 15 1 with a median of 2 2 the implications of this study suggest that increasing mean annual soil temperature at a site using engineered methods could potentially increase the biodegradation rate e g an increase of 10 c could double the nszd rate finally for five sites with site average nszd rates for multiple years average nszd rates varied by 1 1 to 4 9 times across years overall the evaluation of nszd rates measured at 40 lnapl sites suggests that measurable nszd occurs across a broad range of lnapl sites although nszd rates vary across sites fuel type is not the primary factor explaining observed differences in rates graphical abstract image graphical abstract data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction natural source zone depletion nszd includes the natural processes leading to the degradation of light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl at lnapl impacted sites although the importance of biodegradation of lnapl has been recognized since at least the 1990s lundegard and johnson 2006 the measurement of nszd rates using the gaseous expression of biodegradation processes at lnapl impacted sites has been utilized only within the last 15 years garg et al 2017 itrc 2018 sookhak lari et al 2019 smith et al 2022 historically methods of nszd monitoring or monitoring natural attenuation mna focused on groundwater transport and aqueous phase biodegradation namely through quantifying losses of electron acceptors and byproduct formation more recent emerging research has improved our understanding of the gaseous expression of nszd processes where 90 99 of the biodegradation results in gaseous byproducts and their vertical transport through the vadose zone as such nszd measurement methods now focus on the analysis of gases or subsurface temperature in the vadose zone consequently sufficient data have only recently become available to support a preliminary evaluation of the differences in nszd rates across a range of sites and the potential causes of these differences an improved understanding of the basis for observed differences in nszd rates between sites provides a basis for improving conceptual site models csms identification of sites where nszd is most likely to be an effective long term remedy and which methods might best be used to estimate nszd rates as of 2022 there are four primary methods used for measuring nszd rates at lnapl sites api 2017 itrc 2018 crc care 2018 gradient method applies the vertical soil gas profile of oxygen consumption to calculate a flux which is converted to an nszd rate lundegard and johnson 2006 here soil gas nested probes are used to measure the oxygen concentrations in the vadose zone in both impacted and background locations to account for natural soil respiration the resulting oxygen consumption is converted to a nszd rate using a stoichiometric coefficient for a reference compound e g octane assuming complete mineralization note that other soil gases such as carbon dioxide or methane can be used to calculate gradients and resulting nszd rates carbon traps a receptacle with a carbon dioxide adsorbent is installed at the ground surface for a period of approximately two weeks the receptacle is then removed and sent to the laboratory for analysis of carbon dioxide carbon dioxide flux resulting from fossil fuel degradation is measured via isotopic analysis of carbon 14 14c the fossil fuel flux is then converted to a hydrocarbon degradation rate assuming a density of 0 77 grams per milliliter g ml a molecular weight equal to 114 23 grams per mole g mol of octane c8h18 and a cross sectional area of 8 11 10 3 square meters m2 for the carbon trap mccoy et al 2015 note that a different reference compound and a different value for the lnapl density can be used to convert to a nszd rate dynamic closed chamber dcc a closed chamber is installed at the ground surface and measures carbon dioxide concentrations as they accumulate over time resulting in a carbon dioxide flux this flux is then converted to a hydrocarbon degradation rate after a background correction of flux from a clean i e non lnapl impacted location and assuming decane as the representative compound sihota et al 2011 2012 sihota et al 2016 though another reference compound may be used additionally the carbon 14 analysis can be applied to account for natural soil respiration thermal monitoring the heat generated from biodegradation processes is measured using temperature sensors e g thermocouples in a vertical depth profile the heat flux toward the ground surface and toward the deeper saturated zone are then calculated using a background corrected temperature this total heat flux can then be converted to an nszd rate assuming complete mineralization of a reference compound such as decane warren and bekins 2015 karimi et al 2018 kulkarni et al 2020 the comparability of these methods between locations has been evaluated at a small number of individual sites by kulkarni et al 2020 and smith et al 2021 additionally estimating nszd rates using changes in lnapl composition has been under investigation for some time kaplan et al 1997 and has recently been promoted by devaull et al 2020 and estimated over long periods by sookhak lari et al 2022 however while extremely promising this method has only been used at a few sites and is not evaluated further in this paper at individual sites researchers have explored spatial and temporal variability in nszd rates the impact of temperature and rainfall events and the impact of water level fluctuations e g sihota et al 2011 2016 2018 eichert et al 2017 van de ven et al 2021 ganna et al 2022 davis et al 2022 however we hypothesized that a meta analysis of site average nszd rates would provide additional insights into the factors that influence measured nszd rates at sites including fuel type nszd rate measurement method and temperature in this multi site study we compiled measured nszd rates and other key site data from 40 lnapl source zone sites in the united states u s australia and canada specifically we evaluated site average nszd rates over multiple sampling events and various locations per site study as an overall metric for use in conceptual site models subsequently this dataset was used to evaluate the following key research questions i across the range of sites what are the range of measured site average nszd rates ii do site average nszd rates change with fuel type iii how comparable are nszd rate measurement methods when employed at the same site and is there method bias across sites iv how do site average nszd rates vary over time seasonal and annual 2 methods measured nszd rates and other key site data from published literature were compiled from sites in the u s australia and canada for each study the following data were captured i site location ii lnapl fuel type iii nszd rates and iv the measurement method number of measurement locations and number of measurements per location for each site the nszd rate data were used to calculate a site average nszd rate in liters per hectare per year l ha yr or gallons per acre per year gal acre yr for each measurement method used at the site for studies reporting units of µmol m2 sec or similar a representative lnapl of octane was assumed with a hydrocarbon density of 0 77 g ml to convert from a molar rate to a volume or mass rate as such an nszd rate of 1 µmol m2 sec was assumed to equate to 5 846 l ha yr 625 gal acre yr because nszd rates are most commonly measured only within known lnapl source zones we assumed that site average nszd values only represent lnapl degradation and not degradation of dissolved hydrocarbons plumes outside of lnapl source zones for subsets of sites site average nszd rates were measured using different methods employed at the same site or were measured across multiple time intervals when evaluating the variability in nszd rates measured using two different methods or measured during two different time periods the ratio of the higher site average rate to the lower site average rate i e ratio of maximum minimum was applied as a metric to characterize the degree of temporal or inter method variability this provides a consistent measure of the variation between the two nszd rates regardless of which individual measurement method or time period yielded the higher rate to evaluate potential bias between different nszd rate measurement methods the ratio of one specific method rate to each alternate method rate was used such that a value greater than one indicated that the specific method yielded a higher nszd rate while a value of less than one indicated that the specific method yielded a lower rate finally as described in kulkarni et al 2017 higher subsurface temperature was shown to be associated with faster attenuation of dissolved concentrations in individual monitoring wells i e higher point attenuation rates due to the expected increase in microbial activity with warmer temperatures as such we hypothesize that similar trends should be observed with measured nszd rates generally the temperature dependence on microbial activity is expressed in terms of the increase in rate following a 10 c rise in temperature also known as the q10 value many biochemical processes exhibit q10 values of approximately 2 indicating that a 10 c increase in temperature causes a doubling of the reaction rate atlas and bartha 1986 at four sites with nszd rates measured across seasons q10 values for the nszd rates were calculated based on i the differences in seasonal site average nszd rates and ii the estimated difference in average soil temperature between seasons at a clean location at a representative depth of lnapl impacts at each site additionally seasons were defined as the following i spring march 1 may 31 ii summer june 1 august 31 iii fall september 1 november 30 and iv winter december 1 february 28 for site 1 site 19 and site 34 in this subset location specific rapid optical screening tool rost data or site reports were evaluated to select the depths representing the majority of lnapl impacts per site at site 26 this data was not available as such the average depth to the water table was selected overall the following subsurface depths were selected i site 1 3 05 m bgs 10 ft bgs ii site 19 3 05 m bgs 10 ft bgs iii site 26 6 1 m bgs 20 ft bgs and iv site 34 3 66 m bgs 12 ft bgs at two sites without measured continuous subsurface temperature data at a background location i e site 1 dcc and site 26 carbon traps the hillel soil temperature model was applied to estimate soil temperatures at selected depths and selected times this natural soil heating cooling model hillel 1982 wu and nofziger 1999 nofziger 2005 estimates the average daily soil temperature at specified depths and times based on site specific meteorological inputs and soil properties see supplemental information as such air temperatures at site specific locations can be used to estimate the temperature of the soil at the surface with the addition of a heating term 2 ºc for bare soil nofziger 2005 additionally the q10 value was calculated as follows 1 q 10 r 2 r 1 10 t 2 t 1 where r1 is the seasonal site average nszd rate in the spring when subsurface temperatures at a depth of 3 05 6 1 m bgs 10 20 ft bgs are lowest r2 is the seasonal site average nszd rate in the fall when subsurface temperatures at a depth of 3 05 6 1 m bgs 10 20 ft bgs are highest t1 is the seasonal average subsurface temperature at the same depth in the spring and t2 is the seasonal average subsurface temperature at the same depth in the fall 3 results a complete dataset comprising 40 distinct sites was evaluated where each study employed one or more measurement methods at multiple locations and varying temporal frequency for a total of 4 838 measurements see table 1 subsets of sites were used to evaluate i comparisons of rates using multiple methods at the same site 13 sites ii temporal variability across seasons 4 sites and multiple years at the same site 5 sites and iii the impact of subsurface temperature on measured nszd rates evaluated using average seasonal rates 4 sites 3 1 measured site average nszd rates the sites varied in the number of locations where an nszd rate was measured using a specific method ranging from 1 to 150 locations with median number of locations per method typically 2 to 14 table 1 additionally the total number of measurements e g multiple sampling events x number of locations also varied from 2 to 1 460 depending on the measurement method with lower numbers for carbon traps and gradient methods the median total number of measurements per method per site were as follows i carbon traps 7 ii gradient method 4 iii dcc 17 and iv thermal monitoring 24 these differences are a reflection of both the capabilities and costs associated with such methods for instance the dcc method can be employed at many locations for a single snapshot measurement over short time intervals whereas thermal monitoring might typically be conducted at a limited number of locations but potentially capture daily measurements measured site average nszd rates from 40 sites ranged from 650 to 152 000 l ha yr 70 to 16 250 gal acre yr with a median of 9 540 l ha yr 1 020 gal acre yr tables 2 and 3 however although site average rates are non zero we note that rayner et al 2020 and smith et al 2022 reported zero nszd rates for some methods at some individual locations higher oxygen consumption carbon dioxide production or heat production at background sites can lead to such zero or negative nszd rates for the middle 50 of sites i e the interquartile range 25th to 75th percentile nszd rates ranged from 2 810 to 25 440 l ha yr 300 to 2 720 gal acre yr table 2 this dataset resulted in a similar interquartile range of rates as observed by garg et al 2017 6 550 26 200 l ha yr 700 2 800 gal acre yr 25 sites but had a lower median nszd rate 9 540 l ha yr 1 020 gal acre yr as compared to 15 900 l ha yr 1 700 gal acre yr in garg et al 2017 3 2 nszd rates for various lnapl types table 4 and fig 1 summarize the ranges of nszd rates observed for sites impacted by different types of petroleum lnapl with at least five sites per group of fuel type overall the range of nszd rates within each fuel type 40x was much higher than the median nszd rates between fuel types 2x in addition there was no consistent trend in either increasing or decreasing median nszd rates as a function of lnapl weight volatility in other words no trend in the median nszd rates is observed from natural gas liquids and diluent to gasoline to diesel and to jet fuel for fuel types with five or more site average nszd rates the kruskal wallis non parametric statistical test was used to evaluate whether the median nszd rates were statistically different between each type the medians were not found to be statistically different p 0 24 based on pair wise comparisons between datasets across the sites evaluated there was not enough information available on site characteristics such as age of spill soil type soil moisture depth to lnapl lnapl volume or annual average site temperature to evaluate the effect of these site factors on measured nszd rates 3 3 comparison of nszd rate measurement methods at 13 sites nszd rates were measured using two or more methods yielding a dataset of 31 paired nszd rate measurements table 5 for individual paired rates the ratio of the maximum nszd rate and the minimum nszd rate from each pair of methods was calculated in order to evaluate the difference in rates by measurement method these ratios ranged from 1 1 to 12 5 with a median ratio of 2 1 across all pairings in other words two different nszd rate measurement methods yield site average nszd rates that agreed within a factor of two in approximately half the cases for 22 of the 31 paired measurements 71 the ratio between the two rates was 3 or less thermal monitoring and carbon traps yielded the most consistent nszd rate estimates with a median ratio of 1 5 between the two methods while thermal monitoring rates compared to the gradient method were least consistent with a median ratio of 4 8 for the two carbon dioxide efflux methods carbon traps and dcc the measurement median ratio in site average nszd rates was 2 1 overall these results based on 71 of the paired cases in our study indicate that nszd rates measured using two different methods typically agree within a factor of 3 3 4 method bias across all sites bias between nszd measurement methods was evaluated by i comparing the distribution of site average nszd rates for each set of sites where an individual method was applied and ii for each paired set of nszd rates measured using two methods calculating the nszd rate ratio named method alternate method fig 2 summarizes site average nszd rates across all 40 sites where each method was employed here method bias was evaluated using the kruskal wallis non parametric test to understand if any one of the methods are consistently higher or lower than others median site average nszd rates across all sites using carbon traps was 7 400 l ha yr 790 gal acre yr 11 200 l ha yr 1 200 gal acre yr for dcc 5 850 l ha yr 630 gal acre yr for gradient method and 4 600 l ha yr 490 gal acre yr for thermal monitoring the kruskal wallis test did not identify any significant differences in rates p 0 05 additionally fig 3 shows the nszd rate ratios for each individual measurement method i e the ratio of named method alternate method for each method ratios were calculated for all paired measurements involving the named method and any of the three alternate methods because the nszd rate for the named method was in the numerator a ratio of greater than one indicates that the named method yielded a higher nszd rate compared to the alternate method thus if most of the ratios are greater than one this suggests an overall high bias for the named method relative to the other methods for this analysis the significance was evaluated using a kruskal wallis test and no statistical significance p 0 05 was found between the ratios while our analysis indicates no large bias between methods it is possible that the observed variability limited our ability to detect smaller biases 3 5 effect of season temperature on nszd rates at a subset of four sites with sufficient data across all four seasons per year seasonal nszd rates were determined to evaluate the degree of variability between seasons as seen in fig 4 at two out of four sites seasonal measured nszd rates are higher in the summer and fall when the subsurface temperatures are higher and lower in the winter and spring when subsurface temperatures are lower as previously indicated this corresponds to highest subsurface temperatures blue bars observed in the fall and lowest in spring while two of four sites show clear evidence of this seasonal trend one site showed little seasonal variation in nszd rate site 34 and at the fourth site site 26 large variations in nszd rates from event to event made evaluation of seasonal effects difficult as seen in table 6 calculated q10 values using seasonal nszd site average rates and seasonal subsurface temperatures at the site specific depths of lnapl impacts ranged from 0 8 to 15 1 with a median of 2 2 note the seasonal nszd rates or temperatures varied at sites 19 and 34 creating different q10 values for each year that thermal monitoring was performed while many factors can contribute to seasonal changes in measured nszd rates e g seasonal temperature fluctuations soil moisture water table fluctuations etc as well as the location specific variability of the depths of lnapl impacts this analysis provides additional support for the impact of temperature on microbial activity additionally a median q10 of 2 2 of seasonal nszd rates closely matches other laboratory studies zeman et al 2014 and applications in the wastewater industry atlas and bartha 1986 and the arrhenius law q10 of 2 0 note however that because the biodegradation of lnapl also generates heat there may be positive feedback with the seasonal temperature variation causing a larger than predicted seasonal variation in subsurface temperature within lnapl source areas if this occurs at some or all sites then our analysis may have resulted in an over estimation of the median q10 value while this evaluation focused on natural seasonal fluctuations the results imply that engineered remedial methods to increase subsurface temperatures at hydrocarbon sites can potentially increase microbial degradation rates by up to a factor of 2 0 3 6 variation in nszd rates over multiple years at a subset of five sites sufficient data were available across multiple years with at least two seasons per year as seen in table 7 annual site average nszd rates can vary from a factor of 1 1 to 4 9 from year to year with thermal monitoring showing lower annual variability compared to the other methods average of 1 3 vs 4 6 for two other methods in addition to method specific variability other site specific factors that vary annually such as total rainfall temperatures etc can impact changes in annual rates but were not evaluated in this study note these time scales are relatively short up to four years and longer term decadal trends in nszd rates have not been evaluated in this study davis et al 2022 however evaluated site specific nszd rates using the gradient method over a span of 21 26 years and found that nszd rates decreased at one site they also note that nszd rates may in reality follow zero order first order monod kinetics or some other trend overall nszd rates may change over long time periods and further evaluation is needed across a variety of sites using multiple measurement methods 4 discussion over the last 15 years of nszd research site average nszd rates were high enough to measure at all 40 sites evaluated in this study where 50 of all sites have average nszd rates that fall within a range of 2 810 to 25 440 l ha yr 300 to 2 720 gal acre yr 90 of sites have nszd rates of 1 590 l ha yr 170 gal acre year or greater these results are consistent with the ranges presented in garg et al 2017 an evaluation of nszd rates at sites with different fuel types indicated that fuel type is not a primary predictor of nszd rates while not enough published information at the 40 sites in this study was available to evaluate the effect of other site factors on nszd rates other studies have explored this question specifically researchers have speculated that measured nszd rates may depend on soil type soil moisture content site temperatures and lnapl spill age or composition changes garg et al 2017 mcalexander et al 2019 for example at one site key characteristics found to impact measured nszd rates using carbon traps and thermal monitoring included the amount of clay layers higher percent of clay resulted in lower nszd rates and amount of lnapl impacts in the saturated zone higher amount of lnapl impacts in the saturated zone led to higher rates ganna et al 2022 additionally many researchers have indicated that the nszd rates have significant temporal and spatial variability e g sihota et al 2016 garg et al 2017 eichert et al 2017 van de ven et al 2021 because of this variability and because each method is quite different in approach it was hypothesized that a comparison between methods would show significant variability as well based on the observed variation between nszd rate measurement methods applied at the same site and year to year variations in nszd rates at individual sites it appears that a measurement of nszd rates at 3 to 7 locations using a single measurement method will commonly 50 to 70 of cases yield a site average nszd rate that matches the long term site average nszd rate within a factor of 2 or 3 although some rate variations are more extreme for example those reported in davis et al 2022 spanning 26 years nszd rates measured using the thermal monitoring method may be somewhat more stable over time however this observation is based on measurements over time at a very small number of sites overall no bias was observed between measurement methods and the choice of a specific method at a site should be based on site specific scientific and technical goals however it is recognized that surface measurement of carbon dioxide flux might be strongly influenced by soil layering especially in fine grained soils and where high moisture contents might occur an evaluation of the impact of subsurface temperatures on measured nszd rates was conducted using a subset of sites with sufficient data while studied in laboratory studies using site soils and a measure of biogas production zeman et al 2014 as well as evaluated using a large dataset of 2 000 sites of dissolved groundwater concentrations kulkarni et al 2017 to our knowledge this is the first large nszd dataset to estimate the q10 value using measured degradation rates here natural seasonal variations in temperature appear to have a clear effect on nszd rates at some sites with nszd rates in the fall when subsurface temperatures are highest being 2 or more times higher than in the spring when subsurface temperatures are lowest thus for nszd rates determined using measurement periods of less than a full year it is important to clearly identify the time of year when the measurements were conducted similar conclusions have been observed in studies by sihota et al 2016 and mcalexander and sihota 2019 while this study did not evaluate the annual average air temperature or latitude of the study site these results suggest that warmer sites likely have higher inherent nszd than those located in colder climates the implications of this study also suggest that increasing mean annual soil temperature at a site using engineered methods could potentially increase the microbial degradation rate e g an increase of 10 c could potentially double the nszd rate 5 conclusions a compiled dataset of 40 sites from the u s australia and canada were evaluated to assess overall trends in site average nszd rates here the following conclusions and implications of the study include all sites studied had measurable nszd rates with the majority 90 of sites with site average nszd rates greater than 1 590 l ha yr 170 gal acre yr note that at some sites and for some methods yielded a non detect individual location nszd rate estimate overall nszd rates should be incorporated into conceptual site models at lnapl impacted sites to either compare against active remediation efforts or be incorporated into site cleanup estimates fuel type was not a primary driver of nszd rates indicating other site specific factors likely have more of an impact on rates such as soil properties or the age of the spill site average nszd rates were found to vary with i measurement method ii seasonally due to temperature and iii annually despite the variability at the majority of sites a reasonable estimate of the long term nszd rate e g within a factor of 2 or 3 can be achieved by i a single measurement method employed at 3 7 locations per site and ii spanning at least two semi annual fall and spring or four seasonal measurements per location at least some sites show clear seasonal differences in nszd rates with higher rates during periods of warmer soil temperatures as such engineered methods and equipment that can provide low level heat e g an increase in 10 c of the annual subsurface temperature may meaningfully increase biodegradation rates disclosures gsi environmental inc is owner of thermal nszd llc a

15420,site average natural source zone depletion nszd rates measured from 40 petroleum light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl source zone sites were compiled from researchers project reports and

of the increase in nszd rate associated with a 10 c increase in temperature ranged from 0 8 to 15 1 with a median of 2 2 the implications of this study suggest that increasing mean annual soil

for multiple years average nszd rates varied by 1 1 to 4 9 times across years overall the evaluation of nszd rates measured at 40 lnapl sites suggests that measurable nszd occurs across a broad range of lnapl sites although nszd rates vary across sites fuel type is not the primary factor explaining observed differences in rates graphical abstract image graphical abstract data availability no data

the vertical soil gas profile of oxygen consumption to calculate a flux which is converted to an nszd rate lundegard and johnson 2006 here soil gas nested probes are used to measure the oxygen

corrected temperature this total heat flux can then be converted to an nszd rate assuming complete mineralization of a reference compound such as decane warren and bekins 2015 karimi et al 2018 kulkarni et al 2020 the comparability of these methods between locations has been evaluated at a small number of individual sites by kulkarni et al 2020 and smith et al 2021 additionally estimating nszd rates using changes in lnapl composition has been under investigation for some time kaplan et al 1997 and has recently been promoted by devaull et al 2020 and estimated over long periods by sookhak lari et al 2022 however while extremely promising this method has only been used at a few sites and is not evaluated further in this paper at individual sites researchers have explored spatial and temporal variability in nszd rates the impact of temperature and rainfall events and the impact of water level fluctuations e g sihota et al 2011 2016 2018 eichert et al 2017 van de ven et al 2021 ganna et al 2022 davis et al 2022 however we hypothesized that a meta analysis of site average nszd rates would provide additional insights into the factors that influence measured nszd rates at sites including fuel type nszd rate measurement method and temperature in this multi site study we compiled measured nszd rates and other key site data from 40 lnapl source zone sites in the united states u s australia and canada specifically we evaluated site average nszd rates over multiple sampling events and various locations per site study as an overall metric for use in conceptual site models subsequently this dataset was used to evaluate the following key research questions i across the range of sites what are the range of measured site average nszd rates ii do site average nszd rates change with fuel type iii how comparable are nszd rate measurement methods when employed at the same site and is there method bias across sites iv how do site average nszd rates vary over time seasonal and annual 2 methods measured nszd rates and other key site data from published literature were compiled from sites in the u s australia and canada for each study the following data were captured i site location ii lnapl fuel type iii nszd rates and iv the measurement method number of measurement locations and number of measurements per location for each site the nszd rate data were used to calculate a site average nszd rate in liters per hectare per year l ha yr or gallons per acre per year gal acre yr for each measurement method used at the site for studies reporting units of µmol m2 sec or similar a representative lnapl of octane was assumed with a hydrocarbon density of 0 77 g ml to convert from a molar rate to a volume or mass rate as such an nszd rate of 1 µmol m2 sec was assumed to equate to 5 846 l ha yr 625 gal acre yr because nszd rates are most commonly measured only within known lnapl source zones we assumed that site average nszd values only represent lnapl degradation and not degradation of dissolved hydrocarbons plumes outside of lnapl source zones for subsets of sites site average nszd rates were measured using different methods employed at the same site or were measured across multiple time intervals when evaluating the variability in nszd rates measured using two different methods or measured during two different time periods the ratio of the higher site average rate to the lower site average rate i e ratio of maximum minimum was applied as a metric to characterize the degree of temporal or inter method variability this provides a consistent measure of the variation between the two nszd rates regardless of which individual measurement method or time period yielded the higher rate to evaluate potential bias between different nszd rate measurement methods the ratio of one specific method rate to each alternate method rate was used such that a value greater than one indicated that the specific method yielded a higher nszd rate while a value of less than one indicated that the specific method yielded a lower rate finally as described in kulkarni et al 2017 higher subsurface temperature was shown to be associated with faster attenuation of dissolved concentrations in individual monitoring wells i e higher point attenuation rates due to the expected increase in microbial activity with warmer temperatures as such we hypothesize that similar trends should be observed with measured nszd rates generally the temperature dependence on microbial activity is expressed in terms of the increase in rate following a 10 c rise in temperature also known as the q10 value many biochemical processes exhibit q10 values of approximately 2 indicating that a 10 c increase in temperature causes a doubling of the reaction rate atlas and bartha 1986 at four sites with nszd rates measured across seasons q10 values for the nszd rates were calculated based on i the differences in seasonal site average nszd rates and ii the estimated difference in average soil temperature between seasons at a clean location at a representative depth of lnapl impacts at each site additionally seasons were defined as the following i spring march 1 may 31 ii summer june 1 august 31 iii fall september 1 november 30 and iv winter december 1 february 28 for site 1 site 19 and site 34 in this subset location specific rapid optical screening tool rost data or site reports were evaluated to select the depths representing the majority of lnapl impacts per site at site 26 this data was not available as such the average depth to the water table was selected overall the following subsurface depths were selected i site 1 3 05 m bgs 10 ft bgs ii site 19 3 05 m bgs 10 ft bgs iii site 26 6 1 m bgs 20 ft bgs and iv site 34 3 66 m bgs 12 ft bgs at two sites without measured continuous subsurface temperature data at a background location i e site 1 dcc and site 26 carbon traps the hillel soil temperature model was applied to estimate soil temperatures at selected depths and selected times this natural soil heating cooling model hillel 1982 wu and nofziger 1999 nofziger 2005 estimates the average daily soil temperature at specified depths and times based on site specific meteorological inputs and soil properties see supplemental information as such air temperatures at site specific locations can be used to estimate the temperature of the soil at the surface with the addition of a heating term 2 ºc for bare soil nofziger 2005 additionally the q10 value was calculated as follows 1 q 10 r 2 r 1 10 t 2 t 1 where r1 is the seasonal site average nszd rate in the spring when subsurface temperatures at a depth of 3 05 6 1 m bgs 10 20 ft bgs are lowest r2 is the seasonal site average nszd rate in the fall when subsurface temperatures at a depth of 3 05 6 1 m bgs 10 20 ft bgs are highest t1 is the seasonal average subsurface temperature at the same depth in the spring and t2 is the seasonal average subsurface temperature at the same depth in the fall 3 results a complete dataset comprising 40 distinct sites was evaluated where each study employed one or more measurement methods at multiple locations and varying temporal frequency for a total of 4 838 measurements see table 1 subsets of sites were used to evaluate i comparisons of rates using multiple methods at the same site 13 sites ii temporal variability across seasons 4 sites and multiple years at the same site 5 sites and iii the impact of subsurface temperature on measured nszd rates evaluated using average seasonal rates 4 sites 3 1 measured site average nszd rates the sites varied in the number of locations where an nszd rate was measured using a specific method ranging from 1 to 150 locations with median number of locations per method typically 2 to 14 table 1 additionally the total number of measurements e g multiple sampling events x number of locations also varied from 2 to 1 460 depending on the measurement method with lower numbers for carbon traps and gradient methods the median total number of measurements per method per site were as follows i carbon traps 7 ii gradient method 4 iii dcc 17 and iv thermal monitoring 24 these differences are a reflection of both the capabilities and costs associated with such methods for instance the dcc method can be employed at many locations for a single snapshot measurement over short time intervals whereas thermal monitoring might typically be conducted at a limited number of locations but potentially capture daily measurements measured site average nszd rates from 40 sites ranged from 650 to 152 000 l ha yr 70 to 16 250 gal acre yr with a median of 9 540 l ha yr 1 020 gal acre yr tables 2 and 3 however although site average rates are non zero we note that rayner et al 2020 and smith et al 2022 reported zero nszd rates for some methods at some individual locations higher oxygen consumption carbon dioxide production or heat production at background sites can lead to such zero or negative nszd rates for the middle 50 of sites i e the interquartile range 25th to 75th percentile nszd rates ranged from 2 810 to 25 440 l ha yr 300 to 2 720 gal acre yr table 2 this dataset resulted in a similar interquartile range of rates as observed by garg et al 2017 6 550 26 200 l ha yr 700 2 800 gal acre yr 25 sites but had a lower median nszd rate 9 540 l ha yr 1 020 gal acre yr as compared to 15 900 l ha yr 1 700 gal acre yr in garg et al 2017 3 2 nszd rates for various lnapl types table 4 and fig 1 summarize the ranges of nszd rates observed for sites impacted by different types of petroleum lnapl with at least five sites per group of fuel type overall the range of nszd rates within each fuel type 40x was much higher than the median nszd rates between fuel types 2x in addition there was no consistent trend in either increasing or decreasing median nszd rates as a function of lnapl weight volatility in other words no trend in the median nszd rates is observed from natural gas liquids and diluent to gasoline to diesel and to jet fuel for fuel types with five or more site average nszd rates the kruskal wallis non parametric statistical test was used to evaluate whether the median nszd rates were statistically different between each type the medians were not found to be statistically different p 0 24 based on pair wise comparisons between datasets across the sites evaluated there was not enough information available on site characteristics such as age of spill soil type soil moisture depth to lnapl lnapl volume or annual average site temperature to evaluate the effect of these site factors on measured nszd rates 3 3 comparison of nszd rate measurement methods at 13 sites nszd rates were measured using two or more methods yielding a dataset of 31 paired nszd rate measurements table 5 for individual paired rates the ratio of the maximum nszd rate and the minimum nszd rate from each pair of methods was calculated in order to evaluate the difference in rates by measurement method these ratios ranged from 1 1 to 12 5 with a median ratio of 2 1 across all pairings in other words two different nszd rate measurement methods yield site average nszd rates that agreed within a factor of two in approximately half the cases for 22 of the 31 paired measurements 71 the ratio between the two rates was 3 or less thermal monitoring and carbon traps yielded the most consistent nszd rate estimates with a median ratio of 1 5 between the two methods while thermal monitoring rates compared to the gradient method were least consistent with a median ratio of 4 8 for the two carbon dioxide efflux methods carbon traps and dcc the measurement median ratio in site average nszd rates was 2 1 overall these results based on 71 of the paired cases in our study indicate that nszd rates measured using two different methods typically agree within a factor of 3 3 4 method bias across all sites bias between nszd measurement methods was evaluated by i comparing the distribution of site average nszd rates for each set of sites where an individual method was applied and ii for each paired set of nszd rates measured using two methods calculating the nszd rate ratio named method alternate method fig 2 summarizes site average nszd rates across all 40 sites where each method was employed here method bias was evaluated using the kruskal wallis non parametric test to understand if any one of the methods are consistently higher or lower than others median site average nszd rates across all sites using carbon traps was 7 400 l ha yr 790 gal acre yr 11 200 l ha yr 1 200 gal acre yr for dcc 5 850 l ha yr 630 gal acre yr for gradient method and 4 600 l ha yr 490 gal acre yr for thermal monitoring the kruskal wallis test did not identify any significant differences in rates p 0 05 additionally fig 3 shows the nszd rate ratios for each individual measurement method i e the ratio of named method alternate method for each method ratios were calculated for all paired measurements involving the named method and any of the three alternate methods because the nszd rate for the named method was in the numerator a ratio of greater than one indicates that the named method yielded a higher nszd rate compared to the alternate method thus if most of the ratios are greater than one this suggests an overall high bias for the named method relative to the other methods for this analysis the significance was evaluated using a kruskal wallis test and no statistical significance p 0 05 was found between the ratios while our analysis indicates no large bias between methods it is possible that the observed variability limited our ability to detect smaller biases 3 5 effect of season temperature on nszd rates at a subset of four sites with sufficient data across all four seasons per year seasonal nszd rates were determined to evaluate the degree of variability between seasons as seen in fig 4 at two out of four sites seasonal measured nszd rates are higher in the summer and fall when the subsurface temperatures are higher and lower in the winter and spring when subsurface temperatures are lower as previously indicated this corresponds to highest subsurface temperatures blue bars observed in the fall and lowest in spring while two of four sites show clear evidence of this seasonal trend one site showed little seasonal variation in nszd rate site 34 and at the fourth site site 26 large variations in nszd rates from event to event made evaluation of seasonal effects difficult as seen in table 6 calculated q10 values using seasonal nszd site average rates and seasonal subsurface temperatures at the site specific depths of lnapl impacts ranged from 0 8 to 15 1 with a median of 2 2 note the seasonal nszd rates or temperatures varied at sites 19 and 34 creating different q10 values for each year that thermal monitoring was performed while many factors can contribute to seasonal changes in measured nszd rates e g seasonal temperature fluctuations soil moisture water table fluctuations etc as well as the location specific variability of the depths of lnapl impacts this analysis provides additional support for the impact of temperature on microbial activity additionally a median q10 of 2 2 of seasonal nszd rates closely matches other laboratory studies zeman et al 2014 and applications in the wastewater industry atlas and bartha 1986 and the arrhenius law q10 of 2 0 note however that because the biodegradation of lnapl also generates heat there may be positive feedback with the seasonal temperature variation causing a larger than predicted seasonal variation in subsurface temperature within lnapl source areas if this occurs at some or all sites then our analysis may have resulted in an over estimation of the median q10 value while this evaluation focused on natural seasonal fluctuations the results imply that engineered remedial methods to increase subsurface temperatures at hydrocarbon sites can potentially increase microbial degradation rates by up to a factor of 2 0 3 6 variation in nszd rates over multiple years at a subset of five sites sufficient data were available across multiple years with at least two seasons per year as seen in table 7 annual site average nszd rates can vary from a factor of 1 1 to 4 9 from year to year with thermal monitoring showing lower annual variability compared to the other methods average of 1 3 vs 4 6 for two other methods in addition to method specific variability other site specific factors that vary annually such as total rainfall temperatures etc can impact changes in annual rates but were not evaluated in this study note these time scales are relatively short up to four years and longer term decadal trends in nszd rates have not been evaluated in this study davis et al 2022 however evaluated site specific nszd rates using the gradient method over a span of 21 26 years and found that nszd rates decreased at one site they also note that nszd rates may in reality follow zero order first order monod kinetics or some other trend overall nszd rates may change over long time periods and further evaluation is needed across a variety of sites using multiple measurement methods 4 discussion over the last 15 years of nszd research site average nszd rates were high enough to measure at all 40 sites evaluated in this study where 50 of all sites have average nszd rates that fall within a range of 2 810 to 25 440 l ha yr 300 to 2 720 gal acre yr 90 of sites have nszd rates of 1 590 l ha yr 170 gal acre year or greater these results are consistent with the ranges presented in garg et al 2017 an evaluation of nszd rates at sites with different fuel types indicated that fuel type is not a primary predictor of nszd rates while not enough published information at the 40 sites in this study was available to evaluate the effect of other site factors on nszd rates other studies have explored this question specifically researchers have speculated that measured nszd rates may depend on soil type soil moisture content site temperatures and lnapl spill age or composition changes garg et al 2017 mcalexander et al 2019 for example at one site key characteristics found to impact measured nszd rates using carbon traps and thermal monitoring included the amount of clay layers higher percent of clay resulted in lower nszd rates and amount of lnapl impacts in the saturated zone higher amount of lnapl impacts in the saturated zone led to higher rates ganna et al 2022 additionally many researchers have indicated that the nszd rates have significant temporal and spatial variability e g sihota et al 2016 garg et al 2017 eichert et al 2017 van de ven et al 2021 because of this variability and because each method is quite different in approach it was hypothesized that a comparison between methods would show significant variability as well based on the observed variation between nszd rate measurement methods applied at the same site and year to year variations in nszd rates at individual sites it appears that a measurement of nszd rates at 3 to 7 locations using a single measurement method will commonly 50 to 70 of cases yield a site average nszd rate that matches the long term site average nszd rate within a factor of 2 or 3 although some rate variations are more extreme for example those reported in davis et al 2022 spanning 26 years nszd rates measured using the thermal monitoring method may be somewhat more stable over time however this observation is based on measurements over time at a very small number of sites overall no bias was observed between measurement methods and the choice of a specific method at a site should be based on site specific scientific and technical goals however it is recognized that surface measurement of carbon dioxide flux might be strongly influenced by soil layering especially in fine grained soils and where high moisture contents might occur an evaluation of the impact of subsurface temperatures on measured nszd rates was conducted using a subset of sites with sufficient data while studied in laboratory studies using site soils and a measure of biogas production zeman et al 2014 as well as evaluated using a large dataset of 2 000 sites of dissolved groundwater concentrations kulkarni et al 2017 to our knowledge this is the first large nszd dataset to estimate the q10 value using measured degradation rates here natural seasonal variations in temperature appear to have a clear effect on nszd rates at some sites with nszd rates in the fall when subsurface temperatures are highest being 2 or more times higher than in the spring when subsurface temperatures are lowest thus for nszd rates determined using measurement periods of less than a full year it is important to clearly identify the time of year when the measurements were conducted similar conclusions have been observed in studies by sihota et al 2016 and mcalexander and sihota 2019 while this study did not evaluate the annual average air temperature or latitude of the study site these results suggest that warmer sites likely have higher inherent nszd than those located in colder climates the implications of this study also suggest that increasing mean annual soil temperature at a site using engineered methods could potentially increase the microbial degradation rate e g an increase of 10 c could potentially double the nszd rate 5 conclusions a compiled dataset of 40 sites from the u s australia and canada were evaluated to assess overall trends in site average nszd rates here the following conclusions and implications of the study include all sites studied had measurable nszd rates with the majority 90 of sites with site average nszd rates greater than 1 590 l ha yr 170 gal acre yr note that at some sites and for some methods yielded a non detect individual location nszd rate estimate overall nszd rates should be incorporated into conceptual site models at lnapl impacted sites to either compare against active remediation efforts or be incorporated into site cleanup estimates fuel type was not a primary driver of nszd rates indicating other site specific factors likely have more of an impact on rates such as soil properties or the age of the spill site average nszd rates were found to vary with i measurement method ii seasonally due to temperature and iii annually despite the variability at the majority of sites a reasonable estimate of the long term nszd rate e g within a factor of 2 or 3 can be achieved by i a single measurement method employed at 3 7 locations per site and ii spanning at least two semi annual fall and spring or four seasonal measurements per location at least some sites show clear seasonal differences in nszd rates with higher rates during periods of warmer soil temperatures as such engineered methods and equipment that can provide low level heat e g an increase in 10 c of the annual subsurface temperature may meaningfully increase biodegradation rates disclosures gsi environmental inc is owner of thermal nszd llc a

15421,different microbial fuel cell mfc configurations have been successfully operated at pilot scale levels 100 l to demonstrate electricity generation while accomplishing domestic or industrial wastewater treatment two cathode configurations have been primarily used based on either oxygen transfer by aeration of a liquid catholyte or direct oxygen transfer using air cathodes analysis of several pilot scale mfcs showed that air cathode mfcs outperformed liquid catholyte reactors based on power density producing 233 larger area normalized power densities and 181 higher volumetric power densities reactors with higher electrode packing densities improved performance by enabling larger power production while minimizing the reactor footprint despite producing more power than the liquid catholyte mfcs and reducing energy consumption for catholyte aeration pilot mfcs based on air cathode configuration failed to produce effluents with chemical oxygen demand cod levels low enough to meet typical threshold for discharge therefore additional treatment would be required to further reduce the organic matter in the effluent to levels suitable for discharge scaling up mfcs must incorporate designs that can minimize electrode and solution resistances to maximize power and enable efficient wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial fuel cell mfc wastewater treatment air cathode liquid catholyte chemical oxygen demand cod power density data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microbial fuel cells mfcs use microorganisms on electrodes to produce electricity from the degradation of organic matter logan et al 2019 in an mfc a biofilm containing exoelectrogenic bacteria colonizes the anode oxidizing the organic matter in solution and producing electrons for the oxygen reduction reaction orr at the cathode advances in mfc engineering have allowed development of reactors avoiding the use of expensive ion exchange membranes to separate the electrodes and precious catalysts on the cathode and have used relatively inexpensive carbon anode materials with high surface areas making this technology appealing for wastewater treatment logan et al 2015 activated sludge is the most common biological wastewater treatment in the developed world but due to the high energy required for aeration it consumes approximately 1 of the global retail electricity sales scholz 2016 employing mfcs for wastewater treatment could reduce the high operating costs of activated sludge treatment technologies by coupling the oxidation of the organic matter in wastewater with the production of electrical energy and avoid aeration due to the urgency of reducing energy consumption in wastewater treatment as an aim to diminish climate change novel technologies for efficient wastewater treatments such as mfcs need to be demonstrated at the relevant scales mfcs using wastewater have been demonstrated at laboratory scales up to several liters more than a decade ago and continuous improvements on the design and engineering have led to the recent 2014 to 2022 development of several large scale pilot mfcs having a liquid volumes larger than 100 l based on different configurations babanova et al 2020 blatter et al 2021 das et al 2020 dong et al 2019 feng et al 2014 he et al 2019 hiegemann et al 2019 leininger et al 2021 liu et al 2017 mohamed et al 2021 rossi et al 2022b sugioka et al 2022 walter et al 2020 therefore for the first time there is now a sufficient number of studies to make it possible to directly compare results for these large reactors versus laboratory scale systems and investigate the impact of the different reactor configurations on performance there have been many reviews on the performance of smaller mfcs lovley 2006 pant et al 2010 santoro et al 2017 but smaller reactors can have design features that may not translate to larger scale systems for example h cell reactors while optimal to investigate the performance of pure culture bioelectrochemical systems would not be useful at larger scales due to the high internal resistance rossi and logan 2020 electrical connections to the circuit for a smaller electrode such as a single pressure connection to a wire in a 28 ml cube type reactor may not be practical for larger electrodes wang et al 2015 water pressure can for larger systems cause leakage across air cathodes feng et al 2014 rossi et al 2019 dissolved oxygen might be more difficult to maintain in larger aqueous phase cathodes than smaller systems dong et al 2019 he et al 2019 the cost of materials such as pt might not be affordable in larger systems that would require less expensive materials feng et al 2014 and the methods used to producing smaller laboratory mfcs might not be possible for making larger reactors such as hand made cathodes compared to more industrialized cathode preparation processes an earlier analysis in 2015 suggested that performance tended to decline with increased scale of the system and that electrode packing densities decreased with size resulting in lower volumetric power densities than smaller systems logan et al 2015 however at that time there was insufficient data to more critically examine the performance of larger mfcs therefore a review of these larger systems can now be accomplished and looking only at these more recent larger scale systems will provide greater insight into the actual performance of more practical sized pilot scale mfcs in this study we reviewed the performance of these larger mfcs based on electrical power produced normalized by the electrode area and reactor volume and wastewater treatment capacity based on chemical oxygen demand removal cod

jadhav et al 2020 liang et al 2019 2018 despite having a volume 100 l have been excluded from the analysis due concerns relating to calculations or results reported in the paper or a lack of sufficient information to enable comparisons to other studies as explained in the supporting information the 100 l mfc volume cut off was selected based on the number of studies available in the literature and the relevant wastewater flow rate per capita assuming a wastewater production per capita of approximately 200 l d cheng et al 2021 koutsou et al 2018 mesdaghinia et al 2015 and hrts of 6 h typical for wastewater treatment hao et al 2013 huang et al 2011 rossi et al 2019b a 100 l mfcs allow processing of a relevant wastewater flux 400 l d while a 10 l mfc is not sufficient even for one person studies on mfcs with 1000 l volumes were too scarce for a thorough review of the literature 2 mfc configuration liquid catholyte and air cathodes two different types of cathode configurations have been primarily used in pilot scale mfcs for providing oxygen to the cathode for the oxygen reduction reaction liquid catholytes and air cathodes fig 1 in liquid catholyte mfcs the cathode is submerged in a liquid and the oxygen reduction reaction occurs on the electrode surface in contact with the solution fig 1a due to the low solubility of oxygen in water 0 2 mm the liquid catholyte is typically sparged with air either directly in the cathode chamber or prior to flowing into it a separator can be placed between anode and cathode to minimize oxygen transfer to the exoelectrogenic biofilm on the anode cheng et al 2006 lin et al 2004 in air cathode mfcs the cathode separates the liquid chamber from the air and this configuration is often referred to as a single chamber air cathode mfc in pilot sized reactors multiple pairs of electrodes are typically used and therefore an air chamber in addition to the liquid anode chamber is required between two cathodes facing each other allowing for passive air flow fig 1b the air chamber allows a passive flow of oxygen to the cathode for the reduction reaction the oxygen in air diffuses through a hydrophobic layer and reaches the catalyst immobilized on the cathode where it is reduced consuming the electrons generated at the anode and producing electrical energy water leakage through the cathode in the air chamber is typically prevented by using a thick hydrophobic layer on the air side of the electrode the porosity of the hydrophobic surface can be tuned to minimize water leakage and control oxygen diffusion zhang et al 2011 air cathodes due to the large area exposed to the air do not require aeration allowing passive diffusion of oxygen through the hydrophobic layer 2 1 impact of cathode configuration on power density of pilot mfcs a total of 13 pilot mfc studies were identified in the refereed literature based on having a total volume larger than 100 l and containing sufficient information for analysis babanova et al 2020 blatter et al 2021 das et al 2020 dong et al 2019 feng et al 2014 he et al 2019 hiegemann et al 2019 leininger et al 2021 liu et al 2017 mohamed et al 2021 rossi et al 2022b sugioka et al 2022 walter et al 2020 the power densities used to characterize reactor performance in 8 of these studies babanova et al 2020 blatter et al 2021 feng et al 2014 liu et al 2017 mohamed et al 2021 rossi et al 2022b sugioka et al 2022 walter et al 2020 were those obtained after the startup phase and during stable operation of the reactor under a specified load or resistance in 5 of the studies reviewed here data were not immediately available for electrical power production during operation and thus power density from polarization tests was used das et al 2020 dong et al 2019 he et al 2019 hiegemann et al 2019 leininger et al 2021 typically data from stable operation are more reliable compared to results from polarization curves based on these 13 studies the pilot mfcs employing air cathodes 6 studies produced an average of 2 more power based on the electrode area than the liquid catholyte mfcs fig 2 the average power density of the air cathode mfcs was 49 27 mw m 2 6 95 mw m 2 compared to 21 14 mw m 2 8 44 mw m 2 for the liquid catholyte mfcs comparison of power densities requires consideration of factors other than cathode configuration such as operational conditions wastewater strength and electrode sizes using polarization data rather than stable operational results can overestimate power than can be produced under steady state conditions if the scan is conducted too quickly velasquez orta et al 2009 the power produced using a rapid scan rate can be overestimated due to the capacitance of the bacterial biofilm heijne et al 2018 and electrode materials for example activated carbon liang et al 2019 the magnitude of the capacitance increases with the electrode size and therefore the time to reach steady state conditions where this discharge of capacitance does not affect the current at a specific resistance or scanned voltage will require longer periods of time liang et al 2019 wastewater strength conductivity and alkalinity buffer capacity can also influence performance for example the area power density reported in the air cathode study by babanova et al was larger 75 greater than the average power density of the other air cathode mfcs using brush anodes babanova et al 2020 one reason for the increased power could be due to the swine wastewater used in that study had a much higher chemical oxygen demand cod 1 g l than the other studies cod of 0 3 g l that used domestic wastewater providing more substrate for the bioanode another possible reason could be due to the smaller mfc module size which limited hydraulic pressure on the cathode and reduced ohmic losses by minimizing electrode size the size of the electrodes can impact internal resistance and therefore power and the main source of the internal resistance can shift as electrodes become larger the cathode area 0 037 m2 of the mfc by babanova et al 2020 was approximately one order of magnitude lower than those used in the other air cathode studies 1 m2 feng et al 2014 0 72 m2 hiegemann et al 2019 0 62 m2 rossi et al 2022b the ohmic resistance of a material increases with distance according to 1 r a ρ l where r a ω m2 is the area based resistance ρ is the material resistivity and l is the distance as the electrode area is increased r a changes due to the larger distance the electrons have to travel for example over the length of carbon cloth from where they are generated to the point of extraction connection to the wire collecting the current therefore the electrode resistance will likely increase for large electrodes resulting in a loss of power as the electrode size increases even though cathodes are made using relatively conductive materials this increase in electrode resistance for the larger electrodes used in pilot scale mfcs reduces the impact of electrode spacing or solution conductivity for these larger systems compared to laboratory scale systems for example it was previously reported that 34 of the internal resistance 223 16 mω m2 of a laboratory scale 28 ml mfc fed domestic wastewater was due to the anode resistance 75 9 mω m2 24 to the cathode resistance 54 7 mω m2 and 39 to the solution resistance 87 mω m2 however when a similar design was used in a much larger 85 l mfc where the electrode dimensions were increased from 7 cm2 to 0 62 m2 the cathode resistance increased to 555 24 mω m2 62 of the internal resistance and anode resistance to 238 18 mω m2 27 of the internal resistance while the solution resistance was 93 mω m2 corresponding to only 10 of the overall internal resistance rossi et al 2019 therefore while solution resistance and electrode spacing can be important in smaller laboratory scale reactors in pilot scale systems have a much smaller relative impact due to the larger resistances of the electrodes not all the air cathode mfcs had higher power than the liquid catholyte reactors in the study by das et al 2020 it was reported a power density of only 6 0 mw m 2 in polarization tests approximately one order of magnitude lower than that reported in the other air cathode mfcs likely due to a suboptimal electrode configuration das et al 2020 in that study even though air cathodes were used a clayware ceramic membrane was sandwiched between the carbon felt anode and the cathode it has been previously reported that flat anodes placed in direct contact with the membrane and the solution not forced through the anode typically results in mass transfer limitations due to a poor substrate and ion transport between the electrodes cario et al 2019 all the other pilot scale reactors with air cathodes mfcs babanova et al 2020 das et al 2020 feng et al 2014 hiegemann et al 2019 except in das et al 2020 and sugioka et al 2022 used carbon brush anodes producing approximately 4 times larger power density 64 18 mw m 2 than the studies not using carbon brush anodes 18 11 mw m 2 indicating that carbon brush anodes should be the preferred choice for pilot scale mfc reactors the mfc developed by feng et al used a precious metal catalyst pt c at the cathode which produced performance 45 mw m 2 similar to the other air cathode mfcs using a comparable configuration and no precious metal cathode catalyst 59 2 mw m 2 air cathode and brush anode domestic wastewater hiegemann et al 2019 rossi et al 2022b but increased the overall cost of the mfc by approximately 32 compared to activated carbon cathodes feng et al 2014 precious metal catalysts are not needed for mfcs due to the relatively low current densities compared to abiotic hydrogen fuel cells and these metal catalysts can rapidly become deactivated due to chemicals contained in the wastewater santoro et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 the use of a membrane or separator between anode and cathode coupled with catholyte aeration increased the performance of the liquid catholyte mfcs fig 2 the average power density 36 6 mw m 2 in the three studies with an aerated liquid catholyte and separator between anode and cathode blatter et al 2021 dong et al 2019 he et al 2019 was approximately 4 larger than that produced by mfcs without a separator and aerated catholyte 10 1 mw m 2 leininger et al 2021 liu et al 2017 mohamed et al 2021 walter et al 2020 this suggests that sparging the catholyte with air to maintain a high oxygen concentration in the chamber was needed to sustain the current generation while a separator avoids the sparged oxygen to interact with the anodic biofilm and decrease performance unfortunately air sparging of the catholyte substantially increase the operational cost of the mfc for example he et al reported that sparging air in the catholyte required an additional 3 63 10 2 kwh m 3 for their mfc representing the largest energy consumption process with pumping 2 51 10 4 kwh m 3 he et al 2019 the energy consumed for aeration was slightly reduced in a following study to 2 34 10 2 kwh m 3 by optimizing the energy consumption using intermittent aeration and an optimized cathode material dong et al 2019 despite the energy input required for aeration and the low electrical energy produced by the mfc in that study wastewater treatment was accomplished consuming only 12 0 034 kwh m 3 of the energy typically required for an activated sludge process 0 3 kwh m 3 he et al 2019 mccarty et al 2011 indicating that mfcs despite the low electrical energy production can accomplish wastewater treatment at a fraction of the energy cost of current wastewater treatment technologies the volume of the mfc module was not as critical to performance as reactor design and materials as smaller modules did not always produce more power for example the pilot mfc producing the largest power density 95 mw m 2 used many small individual modules with a volume of 8 l babanova et al 2020 however this power density was only 56 larger 61 mw m 2 than that of an mfc with a single module 100 larger 850 l rossi et al 2022b another mfc using modules of only 8 l produced only 29 mw m 2 sugioka et al 2022 or about half of the power density produced by the 850 l mfc the low power density produced in the study by sugioka et al was likely due to the different tubular reactor configuration using a separator and a flat carbon felt anode with the wastewater flowing behind it compared with the plate and frame designs using brush anodes in the other two systems previous work indicated that tubular mfcs can be a viable alternative to conventional plate and frame configuration janicek et al 2014 but most of the larger mfcs have used the plate and frame configuration likely due to the easier scalability operability and maintenance 2 2 additional challenges for using air cathodes in mfcs the main challenge for large scale air cathode mfcs is manufacturing cathodes with high electrical conductivity and large surface area and ensuring the cathode is leak proof water leakage is not a concern in liquid catholyte mfcs but for air cathode mfc water leaking in the air chamber would disrupt mfc operation by reducing the amount of oxygen in contact with the cathode catalyst in a pilot air cathode mfc where the cathodes were subjected to 0 7 m water height pressure after only 6 months of operation 10 out 32 cathodes were leaking greatly reducing the performance of the reactor rossi et al 2022b in another study feng et al 2014 high water pressure was avoided to minimize water leakage by orienting the 1 m2 cathodes horizontally so that the water height was only 0 25 m although large and leak proof cathodes can be manufactured increasing the size of the cathodes also increases the electrode resistance which is detrimental for the mfc performance it has been previously estimated that the electrical power loss could be as much as 47 by increasing the size of a carbon mesh electrode from 0 001 to 1 m2 at current density of 3 a m 2 cheng et al 2014b thus large air cathodes with resistance to leakage under high water pressures along with high electrical conductivity need to be developed to increase the performance of pilot scale mfcs rossi et al 2019 3 volumetric power densities of pilot mfcs the impact of the mfc configuration on the volumetric power density was consistent with that of the area normalized power density with larger volumetric power density produced by air cathode mfcs compared to liquid catholyte mfc the volumetric power density was 600 452 mw m 3 12 1435 mw m 3 for the air cathode mfcs approximately 2 times larger than that of the liquid catholyte reactors 332 361 mw m 3 range 3 1081 mw m 3 liquid catholyte mfcs with separator and catholyte aeration produced slightly more power 405 86 mw m 3 than liquid catholyte mfcs without separator if a study using urine and small electrode spacing was included 277 464 mw m 3 walter et al 2020 however the volumetric power density of liquid catholyte mfcs without aeration and separators largely decreased when considering only mfcs treating domestic wastewater 8 4 mw m 3 indicating that the low oxygen concentration in the wastewater resulted in lower power generation unless there was catholyte aeration energy recovery was also larger for the air cathode mfcs than liquid catholytes three air cathode mfcs hiegemann et al 2019 rossi et al 2022b sugioka et al 2022 had an average energy recovery of 11 6 wh m 3 which was more than twice that 5 6 wh m 3 produced using a liquid catholyte in four studies blatter et al 2021 dong et al 2019 he et al 2019 leininger et al 2021 another goal in wastewater treatment is to minimize the areal footprint of the treatment plant the mfc footprint can be reduced by increasing the electrode packing density the electrode packing density has been previously reported to be one of the key parameters for scaling up mfcs and is defined as the total projected area of the electrodes normalized by the reactor volume logan et al 2015 higher electrode packing densities enable larger volumetric power densities by using smaller reactor sizes accomplishing wastewater treatment in a more compact unit volumetric power densities produced by pilot mfcs increased with electrode packing density fig 2 insert for example increasing the electrode packing density from 5 2 to 24 m 2 m 3 in air cathode mfcs increased the volumetric power density by 450 from 318 to 1435 mw m 3 hiegemann et al 2019 rossi et al 2022b in liquid catholyte mfcs with separator and aerated catholyte the power density was 300 mw m 3 with a packing density of 6 7 m 2 and increased to 510 mw m 3 with a packing density of 15 m 2 m 3 blatter et al 2021 dong et al 2019 the largest volumetric power density in the liquid catholyte mfcs was obtained by walker et al 2020 by using a large electrode packing density of 134 m2 m 3 approximately 20 times larger than that of the other liquid catholyte mfcs 7 m2 m 3 likely using urine in that study characterized by a low solid content allowed to use a reduced spacing between the electrodes and minimize clogging of the reactor which could have been a concern in the other liquid catholyte mfcs using domestic wastewater air cathode mfcs and liquid catholyte mfcs showed different but proportional increases in volumetric power density with increased packing densities air cathode r2 0 61 liquid catholyte r2 0 96 excluding the urine study fig 2 insert 4 wastewater treatment based on cod removal liquid catholyte mfc configuration produced effluents with lower cod than air cathode mfcs when treating domestic wastewater suggesting a tradeoff in higher power densities and cod reduction for the two configurations fig 3 the reported effluent cod was 247 206 mg l 1 70 640 mg l 1 in six air cathode mfc studies babanova et al 2020 das et al 2020 feng et al 2014 hiegemann et al 2019 sugioka et al 2022 and 151 223 mg l 1 25 596 mg l 1 for the liquid catholyte mfcs blatter et al 2021 dong et al 2019 he et al 2019 leininger et al 2021 liu et al 2017 mohamed et al 2021 however in two studies using the liquid catholyte configuration the effluent cod was very high likely due to the type of wastewater used in those studies for example leininger et al 2021 used a mix of digestate and sewage which resulted in a large effluent cod content 596 mg l 1 also coupled with a low cod removal rate leininger et al 2021 the study by walter et al was focused on treating urine while producing sufficient power to sustain illumination of the toilets the cod removal was approximately 69 however due to the large cod content of the urine 6000 1000 mg l 1 the effluent had the largest cod 2000 500 mg l 1 among the other liquid catholyte studies 151 mg l 1 walter et al 2020 in the other five studies the average effluent cod was 40 13 mg l 1 blatter et al 2021 dong et al 2019 he et al 2019 liu et al 2017 mohamed et al 2021 on a percentage basis the liquid catholyte mfcs removed an average of 73 25 of the influent cod approximately 21 more than the air cathode mfcs 52 19 the average hrt was lower for the liquid catholyte mfcs 15 h compared to the air cathode configuration 38 h indicating that the higher treatment efficiencies of the liquid catholyte mfcs was not due to longer treatment times lower effluent cod concentrations for the liquid catholyte mfcs could be due to the cod removed by biofilm or suspended microorganisms using oxygen from air sparged in the cathode chamber increasing the oxygen availability can improve organic matter removal resulting in a combined mfc aerated treatment cha et al 2010 as a result of the high cod concentrations in the effluent of the air cathode mfcs effluent and for some of the liquid catholyte mfcs additional treatment would be required to further reduce the cod to a level suitable for discharge typically the bod is about half the cod thus the nominal regulation of effluent bod to 30 mg l would translate to an effluent cod of 60 mg l mfcs have been previously integrated with an additional anaerobic treatment process to further reduce the cod for example effluent from mfc was treated in fluidized bed membrane bioelectrochemical reactor mber reducing the cod to 28 11 mg l 1 mfc cod removal 59 mfc mber cod removal 95 li et al 2014 in a different study the mfc effluent cod 330 mg l 1 was fed to an ultrafiltration nanofiltration unit producing a final cod of only 4 mg l 1 zinadini et al 2017 osmotic membrane bioreactors were used to reduce the cod concentration of an mfc effluent from 70 to 20 mg l 1 hou et al 2016 while minimizing sludge production and therefore reducing membrane fouling mfcs can also be combined with an anaerobic fluidized bed membrane bioreactor afmbr to produce a final effluent cod of 16 3 mg l 1 requiring minimal energy input comparable to the energy produced by the mfc ren et al 2014 innovative treatment technologies for reducing the mfc effluent cod content were also tested al larger scales the mfc effluent of a pilot scale mfc was treated in a 600 l biofilter bf combining aerobic treatment and ultrafiltration and reducing the cod content from 220 105 mg l 1 in the mfc effluent to 36 23 mg l 1 in the bf effluent rossi et al 2022b thus there are several different technologies available to reduce the cod content in mfc effluent before discharge however future studies should elucidate the overall energy consumption of these treatment processes at a pilot scale there was no significant relationship between effluent cod and area power density due in part to the different electrode configurations fig 3 insert for example in air cathode mfcs the highest cod content in the effluent 640 mg l 1 produced the highest power density 95 mw m 2 in babanova et al 2020 when brush anode and gas diffusion cathodes were used but the second highest cod content 375 mg l 1 produced a maximum power density of only 6 mw m 2 in das et al using different electrodes das et al 2020 the mfc reactor used by das et al 2020 used anode felt pressed against a ceramic membrane which could have produced a higher mass transfer resistance than brushes and separators thus lowering the performance even though the cod content in the effluent was large if the study by das et al 2020 is excluded from the air cathode analysis and only reactors using brush anodes and gas diffusion cathodes are considered then there is a good correlation between the effluent cod and the mfc performance with reactors producing larger power with higher cod content in the effluent figure s1 the mfcs with liquid catholytes showed limited impact of the cod effluent on the power density with mfcs producing between 8 and 44 mw m 2 with a cod effluent 100 mg l 1 and 11 mw m 2 with a cod effluent of 596 mg l 1 the study using urine produced a low power density 10 mw m 2 compared to the other studies even though the cod content was the largest 6000 1000 mg l 1 it is not possible to compare nitrogen and phosphorus removals for these systems as these two nutrients were only reported in two of these 13 pilot scale studies in the future n and p removals should be measured and reported to better identify the downstream processes needed to produce a treated effluent that can meet discharge limits 5 improving pilot mfc performance the above analysis of pilot scale performance suggests there are many factors that can limit mfc performance in terms of power production and cod removal the following suggestions are made for improving reactor design and mfc performance as well as for obtaining data that can help in understanding the factors that are limiting performance such as electrode and solution resistances and cod concentrations develop cost analysis future studies on pilot scale systems should include some analysis of the cost for installation and operation compared to existing technologies most of the studies reviewed here used custom made cathodes and reactor configuration a recent technoeconomic analysis indicated that mfcs can potentially be economically beneficial for conventional wastewater treatment with estimated yearly costs 1700 2300 yr approaching those for conventional wastewater treatment savla et al 2021 however that analysis did not consider the cost for electrode or membrane replacements and when they might be needed thus future pilot mfcs studies should clarify the stability of performance and the potential frequency for part replacements in a previously developed life cycle cost assessment lcca based on the results obtained from a pilot scale mfc reviewed here it was estimated that electrode cost primarily contributed to initial capital costs while electrode replacement due to fouling and chemical consumption for cleaning cathodes was the main driver in operational costs for mfc cropek 2021 rossi et al 2022b the system was designed to treat approximately 19 000 l d 1 of domestic wastewater and compared with a state of the art aerobic membrane bioreactor mbr treatment system for small scale on site wastewater systems it was estimated that despite initial capital costs that were larger for the mfc system compared to mbr the estimated annual energy cost to operate the mfc bf system was approximately 50 lower than that of the conventional mbr system due to the absence of continuous aeration and the positive electrical energy generated by the mfcs future studies should elucidate the capital and operational costs associated with mfc operation and installation and develop economical methods to scale up electrochemically active and robust electrodes for pilot scale mfcs additionally the organic matter effectively converted in electricity during mfc operation should be measured and the coulombic efficiency reported to identify the optimal reactor architecture to maximize it improve solution chemistry the buffer capacity of the wastewater plays a critical role in determining mfc performance as both cathodic and anodic reactions are ph dependent rossi et al 2020a torres et al 2008 at the cathode the oxygen reduction reaction produces hydroxide ions increasing the local electrode ph while the anodic oxidation of organic matter at the anode generates protons as described in the following equations assuming acetate oxidation at the anode near neutral ph and oxygen reduction at the cathode neutral to alkaline ph 3 c h 3 c o o 4 h 2 o h c o 3 h 2 c o 3 8 e 8 h 4 o 2 2 h 2 o 4 e 4 o h due to the negligible concentration of h and oh 0 1 μm compared to other ions present in wastewater at ph 7 protons and hydroxide ions are not effectively transported away from the electrode and tend to accumulate near the electrode surface producing large differences in the local ph environment popat and torres 2016 rossi et al 2020a torres et al 2008 a high cathode ph decreases the performance by reducing the cell voltage by 59 mv ph following the nernst equation popat et al 2012 the acidic ph at the anode limits the maximum current density that can be delivered by the bioanode due to the lower performance of exoelectrogenic bacteria in solutions when the ph decreases below 7 he et al 2008 popat and torres 2016 pilot scale mfcs typically use domestic and industrial wastewaters with low alkalinity compared to tests performed in the laboratory using media with high buffer capacity it would be beneficial to clarify the impact of the buffer capacity of the wastewater on the performance of pilot scale mfcs and investigate the use of wastewater with large alkalinity enabling better control of the local electrode ph improving current densities by maintaining an anode ph closer to neutrality and higher cell voltages by limiting cathode basification popat et al 2012 reducing the electrode resistances the mfc internal resistance is the sum of the solution anode ran and cathode rcat resistances and thus the electrode resistances must be reduced to increase power production of larger scale mfcs rossi et al 2019 the electrode resistances can be obtained by measuring the electrode potentials as a function of current using the electrode potential slope eps method rossi et al 2019 it has been shown that the electrode resistances will increase with electrode sizes and thus reduce performance at larger scale for example scaling up an air cathode from 7 to 4800 cm2 using the same electrode configuration stainless steel mesh current collector pressed against an activated carbon catalyst and a ptfe hydrophobic layer increased the cathode resistance by 10 times from 54 7 mω m2 7 cm2 to 555 24 mω m2 4800 cm2 using domestic wastewater as a feed the higher electrode resistance was calculated to be due to increased resistivity of the electrode with its size due to the longer distances needed for charge transfer from the reaction point to the collection wire location cheng et al 2014b another factor that can impact an air cathode performance is the water pressure as flooding of the cathode with water will decrease electrode performance cheng et al 2014a it was previously showed that the resistance of brush anodes was less impacted by the increase in size than the cathode resistance rossi et al 2019 increasing the brush anode area facing the cathode by 1270 times from 4 9 cm2 2 5 cm by 2 5 cm to 6200 cm2 22 brushes 5 1 cm in diameter by 61 cm long increased the anode resistance by 3 2 times 75 9 mω m2 to 238 18 mω m2 compared to 10 times for the cathode thus the final cathode resistance was about 2 3 times that of the anode in the pilot scale reactor it is important that the three components of the resistances be reported in mfc studies in order to better understand the specific reasons for the change in internal resistance with reactor size minimize electrode spacing coupled with electrode resistance solution resistance represents a contributor to the mfc internal resistance to maximize power densities the distances between the electrodes needs to be reduced to lower solution resistance the solution resistance r ω ω m2 is 5 r ω l σ where l is the electrode spacing and σ is the solution conductivity therefore the solution resistance increases in direct proportion to the electrode spacing and with lower solution conductivities logan et al 2019 rossi et al 2019 highly saline solutions are more conductive but they inhibit microbial activities and thus power generation by bacteria colonizing the anode rossi et al 2020b it is important for the electrodes not be too close as this can lead to short circuiting if one electrode contacts the counter electrode inexpensive and non conductive cloth or ceramic separators can be placed between the electrodes to avoid short circuiting air cathode mfcs do not require a separator or solution between the separator and the cathode and therefore they can have smaller spacing compared to liquid catholyte mfcs which have electrolytes in both chambers despite being a large contributor to the mfc internal resistance in small size reactors the solution resistance in pilot scale mfcs is minor compared to anode and cathode resistances for example it was previously reported that solution resistance increased from 87 to 93 mω m2 by scaling up an mfc from a projected area of 7 cm2 to 6200 cm2 due to a small increase in electrode spacing to avoid short circuiting however in that same study it was reported that anode resistance increased by 3 from 75 9 mω m2 to 238 18 mω m2 while cathode resistance increased by 10 from 54 7 to 555 24 mω m2 rossi et al 2019a thus solution resistance has a smaller impact on the performance in large scale systems compared to anode and cathode resistance but reducing electrode spacing can also improve the solution chemistry and minimize ph imbalances between the electrodes rossi et al 2022a maintain sufficiently high cod concentrations for maximizing power production when the cod concentration gets too low power production can decrease due to insufficient mass transfer of substrate to the anodic biofilm zhang et al 2015 in small mfcs 28 ml the current density produced by bioanode 3 5 a m2 rapidly decreased when the cod concentration decreased to 200 mg l indicating that the performance of mfcs was limited by the substrate availability below this concentration stager et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 power production in pilot scale mfcs therefore can be greatly decreased if the reactor is operated to achieve cod levels suitable for effluent discharge the impact of cod concentration on power generation using wastewater can be difficult to evaluate due to the highly variable nature of the wastewater composition over time for this reason it is important to obtain both operational data at typical cod concentrations as well as polarization data at different influent cods innovations in architecture and materials can improve performance the design and engineering of pilot scale systems requires developing reliable methods and equations to predict the performance at different scales over the last decade innovations have improved the performance of lab scale mfcs fed solutions with high buffer and substrate content largely by optimizing the cell architecture to overcome solution chemistry limitations and reduce internal resistances using high substrate and buffer concentrations reduces anode and cathode resistances while close electrode spacing enable smaller solution resistances rossi et al 2020a however changes using well buffered media have not translated to comparable increases in power densities for wastewater fed reactors fig 4 since 2013 the maximum power density of mfcs fed media with high buffer capacity and substrate content increased at an average rate of 0 83 w m 2 each year over the same timeframe the maximum power of wastewater fed mfcs increased by only 0 05 w m 2 per year novel architectures are being investigated in small scale mfcs to overcome limitations due to the wastewater composition it was recently shown that a closely stacked configuration with the electrodes placed on either side of an anion exchange membrane to minimize the impact of local ph gradients and low solution conductivity improved power generation in mfcs fed media with low conductivity and buffer capacity 4 mm carbonate buffer and produced a maximum power density of 1 34 0 03 w m 2 rossi et al 2021 the solution conditions were meant to reflect the composition of a typical domestic wastewater however even in an optimized configuration using closely stacked electrodes the solution composition can have a large impact on the performance for example in a similar mfc configuration using well buffered media the maximum power density was increased by 7 times to 8 8 w m 2 thus even if better configurations are developed to minimize the mfc internal resistance the low wastewater conductivity buffer capacity and substrate content can still largely impact the reactor performance in addition if wastewater is used in closely stacked configurations pretreatment is likely needed to minimize total suspended solids that could lead to clogging of the cell moreover membranes represent an additional capital cost during scale up laboratory experiments can therefore inform on changes that can improve reactor performance but ultimately tests will need to be conducted at pilot scales to fully test the impact of new designs under actual operational conditions that can include highly variable ph buffer capacities conductivities and substrate concentrations 6 conclusions the analysis of the performance of 13 pilot scale mfcs with an overall volume larger than 100 l indicated that air cathode mfcs produce more power than liquid catholyte while requiring lower energy input by avoiding aeration of the cathode chamber however liquid catholyte mfcs produced effluents with lower cod content at similar hrts than that of air cathode mfcs suggesting that a tradeoff exists between air cathode mfcs which generate more power but produce effluent with high cod content and liquid catholyte mfcs generating low power and needing additional energy for aeration but producing an effluent with low cod content downstream processes should be identified to further decrease the cod concentration in the effluent of pilot scale air cathode mfcs and meet specification for discharge brush anodes and activated carbon cathodes produced the highest power density in air cathode pilot mfcs while using membranes and separator in a closed stacking configuration was detrimental for the performance pilot scale liquid catholyte mfcs needs to be developed using separators between anode and cathode and aeration of the catholyte is required to increase maximum power density the analysis presented here clearly indicates the most promising pilot scale mfc configurations for maximize power generation and wastewater treatment and suggested gaps in the current literature and understanding that need to be filled in future studies to move the mfc technology forward pilot scale mfcs have been effectively integrated into the existing wastewater treatment infrastructure in the studies presented here enabling low cost wastewater treatment

15421,different microbial fuel cell mfc configurations have been successfully operated at pilot scale levels 100 l to demonstrate electricity generation while accomplishing domestic or industrial wastewater treatment two cathode configurations have been primarily used based on either oxygen transfer by aeration of a liquid catholyte or direct oxygen transfer using air cathodes analysis of several pilot scale mfcs showed that air cathode mfcs outperformed liquid catholyte reactors based on power density producing 233 larger area normalized power densities and 181 higher volumetric power densities reactors with higher electrode packing densities improved performance by enabling larger power production while minimizing the reactor footprint despite producing more power than the liquid catholyte mfcs and reducing energy consumption for catholyte aeration pilot mfcs based on air cathode configuration failed to produce effluents with chemical oxygen demand cod levels low enough to meet typical threshold for discharge therefore additional treatment would be required to further reduce the organic matter in the effluent to levels suitable for discharge scaling up mfcs must incorporate designs that can minimize electrode and solution resistances to maximize power and enable efficient wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial fuel cell mfc wastewater treatment air cathode liquid catholyte chemical oxygen demand cod power density data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microbial fuel cells mfcs use microorganisms on electrodes to produce electricity from the degradation of organic matter logan et al 2019 in an mfc a biofilm containing exoelectrogenic bacteria colonizes the anode oxidizing the organic matter in solution and producing electrons for the oxygen reduction reaction orr at the cathode advances in mfc engineering have allowed development of reactors avoiding the use of expensive ion exchange membranes to separate the electrodes and precious catalysts on the cathode and have used relatively inexpensive carbon anode materials with high surface areas making this technology appealing for wastewater treatment logan et al 2015 activated sludge is the most common biological wastewater treatment in the developed world but due to the high energy required for aeration it consumes approximately 1 of the global retail electricity sales scholz 2016 employing mfcs for wastewater treatment could reduce the high operating costs of activated sludge treatment technologies by coupling the oxidation of the organic matter in wastewater with the production of electrical energy and avoid aeration due to the urgency of reducing energy consumption in wastewater treatment as an aim to diminish climate change novel technologies for efficient wastewater treatments such as mfcs need to be demonstrated at the relevant scales mfcs using wastewater have been demonstrated at laboratory scales up to several liters more than a decade ago and continuous improvements on the design and engineering have led to the recent 2014 to 2022 development of several large scale pilot mfcs having a liquid volumes larger than 100 l based on different configurations babanova et al 2020 blatter et al 2021 das et al 2020 dong et al 2019 feng et al 2014 he et al 2019 hiegemann et al 2019 leininger et al 2021 liu et al 2017 mohamed et al 2021 rossi et al 2022b sugioka et al 2022 walter et al 2020 therefore for the first time there is now a sufficient number of studies to make it possible to directly compare results for these large reactors versus laboratory scale systems and investigate the impact of the different reactor configurations on performance there have been many reviews on the performance of smaller mfcs lovley 2006 pant et al 2010 santoro et al 2017 but smaller reactors can have design features that may not translate to larger scale systems for example h cell reactors while optimal to investigate the performance of pure culture bioelectrochemical systems would not be useful at larger scales due to the high internal resistance rossi and logan 2020 electrical connections to the circuit for a smaller electrode such as a single pressure connection to a wire in a 28 ml cube type reactor may not be practical for larger electrodes wang et al 2015 water pressure can for larger systems cause leakage across air cathodes feng et al 2014 rossi et al 2019 dissolved oxygen might be more difficult to maintain in larger aqueous phase cathodes than smaller systems dong et al 2019 he et al 2019 the cost of materials such as pt might not be affordable in larger systems that would require less expensive materials feng et al 2014 and the methods used to producing smaller laboratory mfcs might not be possible for making larger reactors such as hand made cathodes compared to more industrialized cathode preparation processes an earlier analysis in 2015 suggested that performance tended to decline with increased scale of the system and that electrode packing densities decreased with size resulting in lower volumetric power densities than smaller systems logan et al 2015 however at that time there was insufficient data to more critically examine the performance of larger mfcs therefore a review of these larger systems can now be accomplished and looking only at these more recent larger scale systems will provide greater insight into the actual performance of more practical sized pilot scale mfcs in this study we reviewed the performance of these larger mfcs based on electrical power produced normalized by the electrode area and reactor volume and wastewater treatment capacity based on chemical oxygen demand removal cod

mfc configuration aerated liquid catholyte or air cathodes anode material electrode packing density and wastewater type and strength babanova et al 2020 blatter et al 2021 das et al 2020 dong et al 2019 feng et al 2014 he et al 2019 hiegemann et al 2019 leininger et al 2021 liu et al 2017 mohamed et al 2021 rossi et al 2022b sugioka et al 2022 walter et al 2020 a few studies ge and he 2016 jadhav et al 2020 liang et al 2019 2018 despite having a volume 100 l have been excluded from the analysis due concerns relating to calculations or results reported in the paper or a lack of sufficient information to enable comparisons to other studies as explained in the supporting information the 100 l mfc volume cut off was selected based on the number of studies available in the literature and the relevant wastewater flow rate per capita assuming a wastewater production per capita of approximately 200 l d cheng et al 2021 koutsou et al 2018 mesdaghinia et al 2015 and hrts of 6 h typical for wastewater treatment hao et al 2013 huang et al 2011 rossi et al 2019b a 100 l mfcs allow processing of a relevant wastewater flux 400 l d while a 10 l mfc is not sufficient even for one person studies on mfcs with 1000 l volumes were too scarce for a thorough review of the literature 2 mfc configuration liquid catholyte and air cathodes two different types of cathode configurations have been primarily used in pilot scale mfcs for providing oxygen to the cathode for the oxygen reduction reaction liquid catholytes and air cathodes fig 1 in liquid catholyte mfcs the cathode is submerged in a liquid and the oxygen reduction reaction occurs on the electrode surface in contact with the solution fig 1a due to the low solubility of oxygen in water 0 2 mm the liquid catholyte is typically sparged with air either directly in the cathode chamber or prior to flowing into it a separator can be placed between anode and cathode to minimize oxygen transfer to the exoelectrogenic biofilm on the anode cheng et al 2006 lin et al 2004 in air cathode mfcs the cathode separates the liquid chamber from the air and this configuration is often referred to as a single chamber air cathode mfc in pilot sized reactors multiple pairs of electrodes are typically used and therefore an air chamber in addition to the liquid anode chamber is required between two cathodes facing each other allowing for passive air flow fig 1b the air chamber allows a passive flow of oxygen to the cathode for the reduction reaction the oxygen in air diffuses through a hydrophobic layer and reaches the catalyst immobilized on the cathode where it is reduced consuming the electrons generated at the anode and producing electrical energy water leakage through the cathode in the air chamber is typically prevented by using a thick hydrophobic layer on the air side of the electrode the porosity of the hydrophobic surface can be tuned to minimize water leakage and control oxygen diffusion zhang et al 2011 air cathodes due to the large area exposed to the air do not require aeration allowing passive diffusion of oxygen through the hydrophobic layer 2 1 impact of cathode configuration on power density of pilot mfcs a total of 13 pilot mfc studies were identified in the refereed literature based on having a total volume larger than 100 l and containing sufficient information for analysis babanova et al 2020 blatter et al 2021 das et al 2020 dong et al 2019 feng et al 2014 he et al 2019 hiegemann et al 2019 leininger et al 2021 liu et al 2017 mohamed et al 2021 rossi et al 2022b sugioka et al 2022 walter et al 2020 the power densities used to characterize reactor performance in 8 of these studies babanova et al 2020 blatter et al 2021 feng et al 2014 liu et al 2017 mohamed et al 2021 rossi et al 2022b sugioka et al 2022 walter et al 2020 were those obtained after the startup phase and during stable operation of the reactor under a specified load or resistance in 5 of the studies reviewed here data were not immediately available for electrical power production during operation and thus power density from polarization tests was used das et al 2020 dong et al 2019 he et al 2019 hiegemann et al 2019 leininger et al 2021 typically data from stable operation are more reliable compared to results from polarization curves based on these 13 studies the pilot mfcs employing air cathodes 6 studies produced an average of 2 more power based on the electrode area than the liquid catholyte mfcs fig 2 the average power density of the air cathode mfcs was 49 27 mw m 2 6 95 mw m 2 compared to 21 14 mw m 2 8 44 mw m 2 for the liquid catholyte mfcs comparison of power densities requires consideration of factors other than cathode configuration such as operational conditions wastewater strength and electrode sizes using polarization data rather than stable operational results can overestimate power than can be produced under steady state conditions if the scan is conducted too quickly velasquez orta et al 2009 the power produced using a rapid scan rate can be overestimated due to the capacitance of the bacterial biofilm heijne et al 2018 and electrode materials for example activated carbon liang et al 2019 the magnitude of the capacitance increases with the electrode size and therefore the time to reach steady state conditions where this discharge of capacitance does not affect the current at a specific resistance or scanned voltage will require longer periods of time liang et al 2019 wastewater strength conductivity and alkalinity buffer capacity can also influence performance for example the area power density reported in the air cathode study by babanova et al was larger 75 greater than the average power density of the other air cathode mfcs using brush anodes babanova et al 2020 one reason for the increased power could be due to the swine wastewater used in that study had a much higher chemical oxygen demand cod 1 g l than the other studies cod of 0 3 g l that used domestic wastewater providing more substrate for the bioanode another possible reason could be due to the smaller mfc module size which limited hydraulic pressure on the cathode and reduced ohmic losses by minimizing electrode size the size of the electrodes can impact internal resistance and therefore power and the main source of the internal resistance can shift as electrodes become larger the cathode area 0 037 m2 of the mfc by babanova et al 2020 was approximately one order of magnitude lower than those used in the other air cathode studies 1 m2 feng et al 2014 0 72 m2 hiegemann et al 2019 0 62 m2 rossi et al 2022b the ohmic resistance of a material increases with distance according to 1 r a ρ l where r a ω m2 is the area based resistance ρ is the material resistivity and l is the distance as the electrode area is increased r a changes due to the larger distance the electrons have to travel for example over the length of carbon cloth from where they are generated to the point of extraction connection to the wire collecting the current therefore the electrode resistance will likely increase for large electrodes resulting in a loss of power as the electrode size increases even though cathodes are made using relatively conductive materials this increase in electrode resistance for the larger electrodes used in pilot scale mfcs reduces the impact of electrode spacing or solution conductivity for these larger systems compared to laboratory scale systems for example it was previously reported that 34 of the internal resistance 223 16 mω m2 of a laboratory scale 28 ml mfc fed domestic wastewater was due to the anode resistance 75 9 mω m2 24 to the cathode resistance 54 7 mω m2 and 39 to the solution resistance 87 mω m2 however when a similar design was used in a much larger 85 l mfc where the electrode dimensions were increased from 7 cm2 to 0 62 m2 the cathode resistance increased to 555 24 mω m2 62 of the internal resistance and anode resistance to 238 18 mω m2 27 of the internal resistance while the solution resistance was 93 mω m2 corresponding to only 10 of the overall internal resistance rossi et al 2019 therefore while solution resistance and electrode spacing can be important in smaller laboratory scale reactors in pilot scale systems have a much smaller relative impact due to the larger resistances of the electrodes not all the air cathode mfcs had higher power than the liquid catholyte reactors in the study by das et al 2020 it was reported a power density of only 6 0 mw m 2 in polarization tests approximately one order of magnitude lower than that reported in the other air cathode mfcs likely due to a suboptimal electrode configuration das et al 2020 in that study even though air cathodes were used a clayware ceramic membrane was sandwiched between the carbon felt anode and the cathode it has been previously reported that flat anodes placed in direct contact with the membrane and the solution not forced through the anode typically results in mass transfer limitations due to a poor substrate and ion transport between the electrodes cario et al 2019 all the other pilot scale reactors with air cathodes mfcs babanova et al 2020 das et al 2020 feng et al 2014 hiegemann et al 2019 except in das et al 2020 and sugioka et al 2022 used carbon brush anodes producing approximately 4 times larger power density 64 18 mw m 2 than the studies not using carbon brush anodes 18 11 mw m 2 indicating that carbon brush anodes should be the preferred choice for pilot scale mfc reactors the mfc developed by feng et al used a precious metal catalyst pt c at the cathode which produced performance 45 mw m 2 similar to the other air cathode mfcs using a comparable configuration and no precious metal cathode catalyst 59 2 mw m 2 air cathode and brush anode domestic wastewater hiegemann et al 2019 rossi et al 2022b but increased the overall cost of the mfc by approximately 32 compared to activated carbon cathodes feng et al 2014 precious metal catalysts are not needed for mfcs due to the relatively low current densities compared to abiotic hydrogen fuel cells and these metal catalysts can rapidly become deactivated due to chemicals contained in the wastewater santoro et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 the use of a membrane or separator between anode and cathode coupled with catholyte aeration increased the performance of the liquid catholyte mfcs fig 2 the average power density 36 6 mw m 2 in the three studies with an aerated liquid catholyte and separator between anode and cathode blatter et al 2021 dong et al 2019 he et al 2019 was approximately 4 larger than that produced by mfcs without a separator and aerated catholyte 10 1 mw m 2 leininger et al 2021 liu et al 2017 mohamed et al 2021 walter et al 2020 this suggests that sparging the catholyte with air to maintain a high oxygen concentration in the chamber was needed to sustain the current generation while a separator avoids the sparged oxygen to interact with the anodic biofilm and decrease performance unfortunately air sparging of the catholyte substantially increase the operational cost of the mfc for example he et al reported that sparging air in the catholyte required an additional 3 63 10 2 kwh m 3 for their mfc representing the largest energy consumption process with pumping 2 51 10 4 kwh m 3 he et al 2019 the energy consumed for aeration was slightly reduced in a following study to 2 34 10 2 kwh m 3 by optimizing the energy consumption using intermittent aeration and an optimized cathode material dong et al 2019 despite the energy input required for aeration and the low electrical energy produced by the mfc in that study wastewater treatment was accomplished consuming only 12 0 034 kwh m 3 of the energy typically required for an activated sludge process 0 3 kwh m 3 he et al 2019 mccarty et al 2011 indicating that mfcs despite the low electrical energy production can accomplish wastewater treatment at a fraction of the energy cost of current wastewater treatment technologies the volume of the mfc module was not as critical to performance as reactor design and materials as smaller modules did not always produce more power for example the pilot mfc producing the largest power density 95 mw m 2 used many small individual modules with a volume of 8 l babanova et al 2020 however this power density was only 56 larger 61 mw m 2 than that of an mfc with a single module 100 larger 850 l rossi et al 2022b another mfc using modules of only 8 l produced only 29 mw m 2 sugioka et al 2022 or about half of the power density produced by the 850 l mfc the low power density produced in the study by sugioka et al was likely due to the different tubular reactor configuration using a separator and a flat carbon felt anode with the wastewater flowing behind it compared with the plate and frame designs using brush anodes in the other two systems previous work indicated that tubular mfcs can be a viable alternative to conventional plate and frame configuration janicek et al 2014 but most of the larger mfcs have used the plate and frame configuration likely due to the easier scalability operability and maintenance 2 2 additional challenges for using air cathodes in mfcs the main challenge for large scale air cathode mfcs is manufacturing cathodes with high electrical conductivity and large surface area and ensuring the cathode is leak proof water leakage is not a concern in liquid catholyte mfcs but for air cathode mfc water leaking in the air chamber would disrupt mfc operation by reducing the amount of oxygen in contact with the cathode catalyst in a pilot air cathode mfc where the cathodes were subjected to 0 7 m water height pressure after only 6 months of operation 10 out 32 cathodes were leaking greatly reducing the performance of the reactor rossi et al 2022b in another study feng et al 2014 high water pressure was avoided to minimize water leakage by orienting the 1 m2 cathodes horizontally so that the water height was only 0 25 m although large and leak proof cathodes can be manufactured increasing the size of the cathodes also increases the electrode resistance which is detrimental for the mfc performance it has been previously estimated that the electrical power loss could be as much as 47 by increasing the size of a carbon mesh electrode from 0 001 to 1 m2 at current density of 3 a m 2 cheng et al 2014b thus large air cathodes with resistance to leakage under high water pressures along with high electrical conductivity need to be developed to increase the performance of pilot scale mfcs rossi et al 2019 3 volumetric power densities of pilot mfcs the impact of the mfc configuration on the volumetric power density was consistent with that of the area normalized power density with larger volumetric power density produced by air cathode mfcs compared to liquid catholyte mfc the volumetric power density was 600 452 mw m 3 12 1435 mw m 3 for the air cathode mfcs approximately 2 times larger than that of the liquid catholyte reactors 332 361 mw m 3 range 3 1081 mw m 3 liquid catholyte mfcs with separator and catholyte aeration produced slightly more power 405 86 mw m 3 than liquid catholyte mfcs without separator if a study using urine and small electrode spacing was included 277 464 mw m 3 walter et al 2020 however the volumetric power density of liquid catholyte mfcs without aeration and separators largely decreased when considering only mfcs treating domestic wastewater 8 4 mw m 3 indicating that the low oxygen concentration in the wastewater resulted in lower power generation unless there was catholyte aeration energy recovery was also larger for the air cathode mfcs than liquid catholytes three air cathode mfcs hiegemann et al 2019 rossi et al 2022b sugioka et al 2022 had an average energy recovery of 11 6 wh m 3 which was more than twice that 5 6 wh m 3 produced using a liquid catholyte in four studies blatter et al 2021 dong et al 2019 he et al 2019 leininger et al 2021 another goal in wastewater treatment is to minimize the areal footprint of the treatment plant the mfc footprint can be reduced by increasing the electrode packing density the electrode packing density has been previously reported to be one of the key parameters for scaling up mfcs and is defined as the total projected area of the electrodes normalized by the reactor volume logan et al 2015 higher electrode packing densities enable larger volumetric power densities by using smaller reactor sizes accomplishing wastewater treatment in a more compact unit volumetric power densities produced by pilot mfcs increased with electrode packing density fig 2 insert for example increasing the electrode packing density from 5 2 to 24 m 2 m 3 in air cathode mfcs increased the volumetric power density by 450 from 318 to 1435 mw m 3 hiegemann et al 2019 rossi et al 2022b in liquid catholyte mfcs with separator and aerated catholyte the power density was 300 mw m 3 with a packing density of 6 7 m 2 and increased to 510 mw m 3 with a packing density of 15 m 2 m 3 blatter et al 2021 dong et al 2019 the largest volumetric power density in the liquid catholyte mfcs was obtained by walker et al 2020 by using a large electrode packing density of 134 m2 m 3 approximately 20 times larger than that of the other liquid catholyte mfcs 7 m2 m 3 likely using urine in that study characterized by a low solid content allowed to use a reduced spacing between the electrodes and minimize clogging of the reactor which could have been a concern in the other liquid catholyte mfcs using domestic wastewater air cathode mfcs and liquid catholyte mfcs showed different but proportional increases in volumetric power density with increased packing densities air cathode r2 0 61 liquid catholyte r2 0 96 excluding the urine study fig 2 insert 4 wastewater treatment based on cod removal liquid catholyte mfc configuration produced effluents with lower cod than air cathode mfcs when treating domestic wastewater suggesting a tradeoff in higher power densities and cod reduction for the two configurations fig 3 the reported effluent cod was 247 206 mg l 1 70 640 mg l 1 in six air cathode mfc studies babanova et al 2020 das et al 2020 feng et al 2014 hiegemann et al 2019 sugioka et al 2022 and 151 223 mg l 1 25 596 mg l 1 for the liquid catholyte mfcs blatter et al 2021 dong et al 2019 he et al 2019 leininger et al 2021 liu et al 2017 mohamed et al 2021 however in two studies using the liquid catholyte configuration the effluent cod was very high likely due to the type of wastewater used in those studies for example leininger et al 2021 used a mix of digestate and sewage which resulted in a large effluent cod content 596 mg l 1 also coupled with a low cod removal rate leininger et al 2021 the study by walter et al was focused on treating urine while producing sufficient power to sustain illumination of the toilets the cod removal was approximately 69 however due to the large cod content of the urine 6000 1000 mg l 1 the effluent had the largest cod 2000 500 mg l 1 among the other liquid catholyte studies 151 mg l 1 walter et al 2020 in the other five studies the average effluent cod was 40 13 mg l 1 blatter et al 2021 dong et al 2019 he et al 2019 liu et al 2017 mohamed et al 2021 on a percentage basis the liquid catholyte mfcs removed an average of 73 25 of the influent cod approximately 21 more than the air cathode mfcs 52 19 the average hrt was lower for the liquid catholyte mfcs 15 h compared to the air cathode configuration 38 h indicating that the higher treatment efficiencies of the liquid catholyte mfcs was not due to longer treatment times lower effluent cod concentrations for the liquid catholyte mfcs could be due to the cod removed by biofilm or suspended microorganisms using oxygen from air sparged in the cathode chamber increasing the oxygen availability can improve organic matter removal resulting in a combined mfc aerated treatment cha et al 2010 as a result of the high cod concentrations in the effluent of the air cathode mfcs effluent and for some of the liquid catholyte mfcs additional treatment would be required to further reduce the cod to a level suitable for discharge typically the bod is about half the cod thus the nominal regulation of effluent bod to 30 mg l would translate to an effluent cod of 60 mg l mfcs have been previously integrated with an additional anaerobic treatment process to further reduce the cod for example effluent from mfc was treated in fluidized bed membrane bioelectrochemical reactor mber reducing the cod to 28 11 mg l 1 mfc cod removal 59 mfc mber cod removal 95 li et al 2014 in a different study the mfc effluent cod 330 mg l 1 was fed to an ultrafiltration nanofiltration unit producing a final cod of only 4 mg l 1 zinadini et al 2017 osmotic membrane bioreactors were used to reduce the cod concentration of an mfc effluent from 70 to 20 mg l 1 hou et al 2016 while minimizing sludge production and therefore reducing membrane fouling mfcs can also be combined with an anaerobic fluidized bed membrane bioreactor afmbr to produce a final effluent cod of 16 3 mg l 1 requiring minimal energy input comparable to the energy produced by the mfc ren et al 2014 innovative treatment technologies for reducing the mfc effluent cod content were also tested al larger scales the mfc effluent of a pilot scale mfc was treated in a 600 l biofilter bf combining aerobic treatment and ultrafiltration and reducing the cod content from 220 105 mg l 1 in the mfc effluent to 36 23 mg l 1 in the bf effluent rossi et al 2022b thus there are several different technologies available to reduce the cod content in mfc effluent before discharge however future studies should elucidate the overall energy consumption of these treatment processes at a pilot scale there was no significant relationship between effluent cod and area power density due in part to the different electrode configurations fig 3 insert for example in air cathode mfcs the highest cod content in the effluent 640 mg l 1 produced the highest power density 95 mw m 2 in babanova et al 2020 when brush anode and gas diffusion cathodes were used but the second highest cod content 375 mg l 1 produced a maximum power density of only 6 mw m 2 in das et al using different electrodes das et al 2020 the mfc reactor used by das et al 2020 used anode felt pressed against a ceramic membrane which could have produced a higher mass transfer resistance than brushes and separators thus lowering the performance even though the cod content in the effluent was large if the study by das et al 2020 is excluded from the air cathode analysis and only reactors using brush anodes and gas diffusion cathodes are considered then there is a good correlation between the effluent cod and the mfc performance with reactors producing larger power with higher cod content in the effluent figure s1 the mfcs with liquid catholytes showed limited impact of the cod effluent on the power density with mfcs producing between 8 and 44 mw m 2 with a cod effluent 100 mg l 1 and 11 mw m 2 with a cod effluent of 596 mg l 1 the study using urine produced a low power density 10 mw m 2 compared to the other studies even though the cod content was the largest 6000 1000 mg l 1 it is not possible to compare nitrogen and phosphorus removals for these systems as these two nutrients were only reported in two of these 13 pilot scale studies in the future n and p removals should be measured and reported to better identify the downstream processes needed to produce a treated effluent that can meet discharge limits 5 improving pilot mfc performance the above analysis of pilot scale performance suggests there are many factors that can limit mfc performance in terms of power production and cod removal the following suggestions are made for improving reactor design and mfc performance as well as for obtaining data that can help in understanding the factors that are limiting performance such as electrode and solution resistances and cod concentrations develop cost analysis future studies on pilot scale systems should include some analysis of the cost for installation and operation compared to existing technologies most of the studies reviewed here used custom made cathodes and reactor configuration a recent technoeconomic analysis indicated that mfcs can potentially be economically beneficial for conventional wastewater treatment with estimated yearly costs 1700 2300 yr approaching those for conventional wastewater treatment savla et al 2021 however that analysis did not consider the cost for electrode or membrane replacements and when they might be needed thus future pilot mfcs studies should clarify the stability of performance and the potential frequency for part replacements in a previously developed life cycle cost assessment lcca based on the results obtained from a pilot scale mfc reviewed here it was estimated that electrode cost primarily contributed to initial capital costs while electrode replacement due to fouling and chemical consumption for cleaning cathodes was the main driver in operational costs for mfc cropek 2021 rossi et al 2022b the system was designed to treat approximately 19 000 l d 1 of domestic wastewater and compared with a state of the art aerobic membrane bioreactor mbr treatment system for small scale on site wastewater systems it was estimated that despite initial capital costs that were larger for the mfc system compared to mbr the estimated annual energy cost to operate the mfc bf system was approximately 50 lower than that of the conventional mbr system due to the absence of continuous aeration and the positive electrical energy generated by the mfcs future studies should elucidate the capital and operational costs associated with mfc operation and installation and develop economical methods to scale up electrochemically active and robust electrodes for pilot scale mfcs additionally the organic matter effectively converted in electricity during mfc operation should be measured and the coulombic efficiency reported to identify the optimal reactor architecture to maximize it improve solution chemistry the buffer capacity of the wastewater plays a critical role in determining mfc performance as both cathodic and anodic reactions are ph dependent rossi et al 2020a torres et al 2008 at the cathode the oxygen reduction reaction produces hydroxide ions increasing the local electrode ph while the anodic oxidation of organic matter at the anode generates protons as described in the following equations assuming acetate oxidation at the anode near neutral ph and oxygen reduction at the cathode neutral to alkaline ph 3 c h 3 c o o 4 h 2 o h c o 3 h 2 c o 3 8 e 8 h 4 o 2 2 h 2 o 4 e 4 o h due to the negligible concentration of h and oh 0 1 μm compared to other ions present in wastewater at ph 7 protons and hydroxide ions are not effectively transported away from the electrode and tend to accumulate near the electrode surface producing large differences in the local ph environment popat and torres 2016 rossi et al 2020a torres et al 2008 a high cathode ph decreases the performance by reducing the cell voltage by 59 mv ph following the nernst equation popat et al 2012 the acidic ph at the anode limits the maximum current density that can be delivered by the bioanode due to the lower performance of exoelectrogenic bacteria in solutions when the ph decreases below 7 he et al 2008 popat and torres 2016 pilot scale mfcs typically use domestic and industrial wastewaters with low alkalinity compared to tests performed in the laboratory using media with high buffer capacity it would be beneficial to clarify the impact of the buffer capacity of the wastewater on the performance of pilot scale mfcs and investigate the use of wastewater with large alkalinity enabling better control of the local electrode ph improving current densities by maintaining an anode ph closer to neutrality and higher cell voltages by limiting cathode basification popat et al 2012 reducing the electrode resistances the mfc internal resistance is the sum of the solution anode ran and cathode rcat resistances and thus the electrode resistances must be reduced to increase power production of larger scale mfcs rossi et al 2019 the electrode resistances can be obtained by measuring the electrode potentials as a function of current using the electrode potential slope eps method rossi et al 2019 it has been shown that the electrode resistances will increase with electrode sizes and thus reduce performance at larger scale for example scaling up an air cathode from 7 to 4800 cm2 using the same electrode configuration stainless steel mesh current collector pressed against an activated carbon catalyst and a ptfe hydrophobic layer increased the cathode resistance by 10 times from 54 7 mω m2 7 cm2 to 555 24 mω m2 4800 cm2 using domestic wastewater as a feed the higher electrode resistance was calculated to be due to increased resistivity of the electrode with its size due to the longer distances needed for charge transfer from the reaction point to the collection wire location cheng et al 2014b another factor that can impact an air cathode performance is the water pressure as flooding of the cathode with water will decrease electrode performance cheng et al 2014a it was previously showed that the resistance of brush anodes was less impacted by the increase in size than the cathode resistance rossi et al 2019 increasing the brush anode area facing the cathode by 1270 times from 4 9 cm2 2 5 cm by 2 5 cm to 6200 cm2 22 brushes 5 1 cm in diameter by 61 cm long increased the anode resistance by 3 2 times 75 9 mω m2 to 238 18 mω m2 compared to 10 times for the cathode thus the final cathode resistance was about 2 3 times that of the anode in the pilot scale reactor it is important that the three components of the resistances be reported in mfc studies in order to better understand the specific reasons for the change in internal resistance with reactor size minimize electrode spacing coupled with electrode resistance solution resistance represents a contributor to the mfc internal resistance to maximize power densities the distances between the electrodes needs to be reduced to lower solution resistance the solution resistance r ω ω m2 is 5 r ω l σ where l is the electrode spacing and σ is the solution conductivity therefore the solution resistance increases in direct proportion to the electrode spacing and with lower solution conductivities logan et al 2019 rossi et al 2019 highly saline solutions are more conductive but they inhibit microbial activities and thus power generation by bacteria colonizing the anode rossi et al 2020b it is important for the electrodes not be too close as this can lead to short circuiting if one electrode contacts the counter electrode inexpensive and non conductive cloth or ceramic separators can be placed between the electrodes to avoid short circuiting air cathode mfcs do not require a separator or solution between the separator and the cathode and therefore they can have smaller spacing compared to liquid catholyte mfcs which have electrolytes in both chambers despite being a large contributor to the mfc internal resistance in small size reactors the solution resistance in pilot scale mfcs is minor compared to anode and cathode resistances for example it was previously reported that solution resistance increased from 87 to 93 mω m2 by scaling up an mfc from a projected area of 7 cm2 to 6200 cm2 due to a small increase in electrode spacing to avoid short circuiting however in that same study it was reported that anode resistance increased by 3 from 75 9 mω m2 to 238 18 mω m2 while cathode resistance increased by 10 from 54 7 to 555 24 mω m2 rossi et al 2019a thus solution resistance has a smaller impact on the performance in large scale systems compared to anode and cathode resistance but reducing electrode spacing can also improve the solution chemistry and minimize ph imbalances between the electrodes rossi et al 2022a maintain sufficiently high cod concentrations for maximizing power production when the cod concentration gets too low power production can decrease due to insufficient mass transfer of substrate to the anodic biofilm zhang et al 2015 in small mfcs 28 ml the current density produced by bioanode 3 5 a m2 rapidly decreased when the cod concentration decreased to 200 mg l indicating that the performance of mfcs was limited by the substrate availability below this concentration stager et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 power production in pilot scale mfcs therefore can be greatly decreased if the reactor is operated to achieve cod levels suitable for effluent discharge the impact of cod concentration on power generation using wastewater can be difficult to evaluate due to the highly variable nature of the wastewater composition over time for this reason it is important to obtain both operational data at typical cod concentrations as well as polarization data at different influent cods innovations in architecture and materials can improve performance the design and engineering of pilot scale systems requires developing reliable methods and equations to predict the performance at different scales over the last decade innovations have improved the performance of lab scale mfcs fed solutions with high buffer and substrate content largely by optimizing the cell architecture to overcome solution chemistry limitations and reduce internal resistances using high substrate and buffer concentrations reduces anode and cathode resistances while close electrode spacing enable smaller solution resistances rossi et al 2020a however changes using well buffered media have not translated to comparable increases in power densities for wastewater fed reactors fig 4 since 2013 the maximum power density of mfcs fed media with high buffer capacity and substrate content increased at an average rate of 0 83 w m 2 each year over the same timeframe the maximum power of wastewater fed mfcs increased by only 0 05 w m 2 per year novel architectures are being investigated in small scale mfcs to overcome limitations due to the wastewater composition it was recently shown that a closely stacked configuration with the electrodes placed on either side of an anion exchange membrane to minimize the impact of local ph gradients and low solution conductivity improved power generation in mfcs fed media with low conductivity and buffer capacity 4 mm carbonate buffer and produced a maximum power density of 1 34 0 03 w m 2 rossi et al 2021 the solution conditions were meant to reflect the composition of a typical domestic wastewater however even in an optimized configuration using closely stacked electrodes the solution composition can have a large impact on the performance for example in a similar mfc configuration using well buffered media the maximum power density was increased by 7 times to 8 8 w m 2 thus even if better configurations are developed to minimize the mfc internal resistance the low wastewater conductivity buffer capacity and substrate content can still largely impact the reactor performance in addition if wastewater is used in closely stacked configurations pretreatment is likely needed to minimize total suspended solids that could lead to clogging of the cell moreover membranes represent an additional capital cost during scale up laboratory experiments can therefore inform on changes that can improve reactor performance but ultimately tests will need to be conducted at pilot scales to fully test the impact of new designs under actual operational conditions that can include highly variable ph buffer capacities conductivities and substrate concentrations 6 conclusions the analysis of the performance of 13 pilot scale mfcs with an overall volume larger than 100 l indicated that air cathode mfcs produce more power than liquid catholyte while requiring lower energy input by avoiding aeration of the cathode chamber however liquid catholyte mfcs produced effluents with lower cod content at similar hrts than that of air cathode mfcs suggesting that a tradeoff exists between air cathode mfcs which generate more power but produce effluent with high cod content and liquid catholyte mfcs generating low power and needing additional energy for aeration but producing an effluent with low cod content downstream processes should be identified to further decrease the cod concentration in the effluent of pilot scale air cathode mfcs and meet specification for discharge brush anodes and activated carbon cathodes produced the highest power density in air cathode pilot mfcs while using membranes and separator in a closed stacking configuration was detrimental for the performance pilot scale liquid catholyte mfcs needs to be developed using separators between anode and cathode and aeration of the catholyte is required to increase maximum power density the analysis presented here clearly indicates the most promising pilot scale mfc configurations for maximize power generation and wastewater treatment and suggested gaps in the current literature and understanding that need to be filled in future studies to move the mfc technology forward pilot scale mfcs have been effectively integrated into the existing wastewater treatment infrastructure in the studies presented here enabling low cost wastewater treatment

15422,the microplastics in nature water are important for the environmental fate of nitrous oxide n2o this study investigated the influence and microbial mechanism of microplastic abundance to the n2o flux in typical inflow rivers of taihu lake the microplastic abundance were in a range of 160 700 particles m3 surface water and 514 3018 particles kg dry sediment the highest percentage of microplastic color was transparent significantly higher than other color p 0 0001 in both surface water and sediment the dominant microplastic size was 500 5000 μm in surface water while size lower than 1000 μm was dominant in sediment the microplastic abundance in sediment was negatively correlated with the concentration of suspended sediments sps p 0 05 chl a p 0 05 nh4 n p 0 05 and tp p 0 01 in inflow river surface water the dissolved n2o concentration were 45 71 132 42 nmol l and the n2o fluxes were 29 85 276 60 μmol m2 d the dissolved n2o concentration was significantly correlated with the nirk abundance and nirk noszi ratio negatively p 0 05 revealed that sediment nirk type denitrification was the main driver of dissolved n2o meanwhile the n2o flux water air interface was significantly correlated with noszi napa narg and nirs negatively implied that nitrification and denitrification interaction in sediment is the main influence factor the denitrification process in sediment was the main driven factor of n2o releasing mantel test shows that microplastic abundance in surface water was significantly correlated with nitrification p 0 001 0 01 and denitrification p 0 01 0 05 genera in water the dominant denitrification microorganism was dechloromonas in sediment and flavobacterium in surface water these results provided new insight into the fact that plastisphere which comprises microbial community on microplastic could affect the n2o emission in aquatic system graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastic plastisphere nitrous oxide microbial functional gene inflow rivers 1 introduction microplastics as emerging contaminants its effect to the aquatic environment has arouse increasing concern microplastics could affect the nitrogen geochemical cycle through changing the microorganism community structure and functions in both terrestrial and aquatic systems bank and hansson 2019 shen et al 2021 the nutrients organic matters or contaminants in the surrounding environment could be adsorbed to the microplastics which is ideal niche for microbes to colonize this also could be defined as microplastics heteroaggregates an aggregate with microplastics biofilm and multi types of nutrients besseling et al 2017 wang et al 2021 2022 this is also be referred as plastisphere put forward by zettler et al 2013 by which the microorganism structure including bacterial and eukaryotic on marine plastics plastic litter 5 mm with varies materials were determined by high throughput sequencing as a first try the diverse microbial structure on plastisphere including heterotrophs autotrophs predators and symbiote were unveiled barros and seena 2021 the composite risks of plastisphere were widely reported yang et al 2020 found that plastisphere was a hotspot in spreading antibiotic resistome and poses long term eco risks the plastisphere also may affect ecological processes in marine system such as environmental contaminants transportation microplastics biodegradation carbon cycling and so forth liu et al 2022 meanwhile recent studies revealed that only 1 of plastic debris that released to aquatic system were counted which means that the microplastics and corresponding plastisphere biomass in global ocean is substantial van sebille et al 2015 amaral zettler et al 2020 plastisphere could act as potential reservoir for microbes in aquatic system it could affect the nitrogen biogeochemical process thus the impact of microplastics heteroaggregates to the nitrogen biogeochemical process should be concerned the nitrogen cycling is an essential part of the biogeochemistry process and mostly depends on the biotic nitrogen transformation this process occurs both in aquatic matrix and the sediment of eutrophic lakes rysgaard et al 1993 yang et al 2021 the effect of microplastics to the nitrogen biogeochemical cycling has aroused increasing interest in recent decade shen et al 2022 seeley et al 2020 the decomposition and accumulation of microplastics in soil could change the microbial functions in soil and affect the generation of greenhouse gasses rillig and lehmann 2020 the polyethylene microplastic addition to soil has increased the nitrite reductase nirs gene abundance and thus result in increased n2o emission from the paddy soil gao et al 2021 yu et al 2022 the heteroaggregates interact with soil and microplastics was widely investigated illustrated microplastics has influence the soil microbial community nitrogen cycling functional gene and thus affect the n2o emission the scenario that occurs in soil matrix could be existed in aquatic system the microplastic heteroaggregates are in high abundance in aquatic system wang et al 2021 barros and seena 2021 its interaction with nitrogen cycling in aquatic system has rarely been reported the resuspension of microplastic and sediments could enhance shallow lake eutrophication zhang et al 2020 tammeorg et al 2013 thus the characteristic of microplastic could be correlated with the nitrogen cycling in aquatic system nitrous oxide n2o a key intermediate released during nitrogen cycling has been regarded as top three greenhouse gasses together with methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 the global warming potential of n2o is 265 298 times greater than co2 in a 100 year period makowski 2019 ipcc 2014 the global n2o emission was increased substantially since 2009 with a faster rate than ipcc emission factor estimation due to high level nitrogen input thompson et al 2019 it is estimated that the n2o emission from rivers are 0 3 2 1 tg n2on yr 1 6 30 of the global anthropogenic n2o emission beaulieu et al 2011 the estimated global riverine n2o emission was 29 6 35 3 gg n2on yr 1 hu et al 2016 the global warming potential of n2o from aquatic system cannot be neglected inflow rivers are important network that transfer nitrogen microplastics and other nutrients to lakes and other aqueous system the riverway estuary and eutrophic lakes are all important hotspot for n2o emission and microplastics aggregation kortelainen et al 2020 li et al 2019 yu et al 2013 su et al 2021 fan et al 2022 whether microplastics or the plastisphere has play significant role in the n2o emission in eutrophic lake inflow rivers are not well documented this study aims at investigate the correlation between microplastics abundance and the n2o emission in inflow rivers the occurrence and characteristics of microplastics in typical inflow rivers of taihu lake were determined the n2o flux and dissolved n2o concentration were all measured the correlation between microplastic abundance n2o emission and water quality indexes were analyzed the correlated microbial mechanism including nitrification and denitrification bacteria functional genes were analyzed in the meantime the following hypothesis was discussed 1 the microplastic heteroaggregates including nitrifier and denitrifier inoculated participate to the inorganic nitrogen cycle and contribute to n2o emission 2 the existence of microplastics or the formed plastisphere affect the aquatic or sediment matrix and the microbial structure the n2o related functional gene abundance was changed and the n2o emission was affected 3 the microplastics has the similar source of the nitrogen inputs to aquatic system so the microplastic abundance could be related to the n2o emission this study for the first time linking microplastics to n2o emission in eutrophic lake inflow rivers which is meaningful for filling the gap that microplastics in aquatic matrix could interact to climate warming 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites taihu lake is typical eutrophic lake the third largest freshwater lake of china surface area 2338 km2 connected over 30 major rivers with complex river network surrounded qin et al 2007 li et al 2019 the main inflow rivers are in the north and northwest of taihu lake where zhang et al 2021a reported that those part occupied 79 of microplastics inflow into taihu lake five typical inflow rivers in this area including caoqiao river guandu river hongxiang river chendong river and dapu river were investigated in this study the inflow river which was reported as has highest microplastics contamination potential were included in this study there were three sampling sites for each inflow rivers located in riverway the estuary and adjacent lake site each sampling site are in a distance of approximately 1 km 2 2 microplastics sampling pretreatment and characterization the microplastics in the surface water and sediment were both collected in all sampling sites at august 2020 50 l surface water was collected by a 5 l container the container was pre rinsed by the in situ water before use the surface water was then pass through a nylon plankton net inner diameter 20 cm height 50 cm pore size 0 064 mm the residues on the net was rinsed to a 500 ml glass bottle by pure water this sampling process can be used for microplastics collection from small volume of water kapp and yeatman 2018 zhang et al 2018 su et al 2020 the sediment sample was collected by a 2 l volume van veen grab haifuda ltd beijing the microplastics in surface water and sediment were pretreated in lab followed by the same methods as our previous work with slight modification li et al 2019 xiong et al 2018 the water sample were pass through 5 μm stainless steel filter membrane jiudinggaoke ltd beijing the microplastics with size over 5 μm could be all retained on the membrane the membrane was then transfer to 250 ml clean conical bottle 10 ml feso4 7 2 mm ph 5 20 ml 30 h2o2 mixing for 15 min the conical bottle was then put in ultrasonic cleanser for 5 min to make sure microplastics remain in the solution remove the stainless filter membrane and clean with pure water after that 10 ml 4 5 hcl solution was added and totally mixed the solution was then filtered with a new rinsed 5 μm

recorded and transferred to a 100 ml clean conical bottle the saturated zinc chloride solution desity 1 6 g ml was added to the bottle put into ultrasonic cleanser for 15 min then totally mixed in a magnetic stirrer for 12 h the out part of the conical bottle was cleaned with pure water for 5 times and then the bottle was presented on a clean glass culture ware after that zinc chloride was added to the bottle settle for 12 h the floating debris were overflowed to the culture ware by adding zinc chloride solution by glass burette the density flotation was repeated for 5 7 times and the solution in culture ware was totally transferred to a 250 ml glass conical bottle followed by which the solution was further treated with the same methods used for surface water sample described above lenaker et al 2019 mani et al 2019 the microplastics were visually examined under stereomicroscope sz61 olympus japan and raman microscope invia renishaw uk the material quantity shape color and size of the microplastics were recorded microplastics were divided into 4 groups based on the size distribution 0 200 μm 200 500 μm 500 1000 μm 1000 5000 um 3 categories based on their shape fiber fragment film and 7 groups black yellow green white red blue and transparent on the color the microplastic abundance in water was computed as total amount of debris per 50 l water sample used reported as particles m3 the microplastic concentration in sediment was calculated by debris amount divided by dry sediment used reported as particles kg dw dry weight 2 3 n2o sampling and detection the n2o flux in air water interface was measured by floating chamber method zhou et al 2021 cole et al 2010 the floating chamber l w h 38 5 30 5 18 5 unit cm was fixed on the water surface manually gas sample in the headspace of the chamber was collected for 1 h at 10 min interval respectively the first gas sample was regarded as the n2o concentration in the in situ air the n2o sample was collected at pre cleaned gas bag and measured by gas chromatography gc 2014c shimadzu the n2o flux was calculated by eq 1 1 f s p v a r t 10 9 60 24 10 6 in the eq 1 f is the n2o emission flux µmol m 2 d 1 s is the slope of n2o concentration versus time ppbv min 1 p is the atmospheric pressure pa v is the chamber volume m3 and a is the water surface area covered by the chamber m2 r is the ideal gas constant 8 314 m3 pa mol 1 k 1 and t is the air temperature k following process was used for dissolved n2o sample collection and calculation the surface water was collected in situ with 115 ml vials by fine silicone tube to avoid bubbles the water was inflow to the vial by gravity until overflow and no visible bubble in the vial 200 μl mercuric chloride hgcl2 were added to the vial and then the vial was sealed with rubber stopper and aluminum foil cover the dissolved n2o concentration was measured by headspace equilibrium technique the detail of the calculation methods was as previous reported text s1 2 4 water quality analysis the overlaying water 20 cm below the surface water level sample was collected in triplicate stored in an ice cooler 4 c and transported to lab after sampling immediately the water quality parameters including ph dissolved oxygen do and temperature of the surface water was measured in situ dq3d hach usa other basic water quality index such as nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n ammonia nh4 n total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn dissolved organic carbon doc suspended sediment sps and chlorophyll a chl a were analyzed in lab the basic water parameters were analyzed by standard methods as previous reported zhou et al 2021 song et al 2022 2 5 microbial analysis the surface water 20 cm below the water level and surface sediment 0 10 cm were collected in triplicate stored in a cooler 4 c stored less than 5 days and transported to lab immediately the dna in surface water and surface sediment were extracted by dneasy powersoil kit qiagen hilden germany the 16s rrna high throughput sequencing were conducted follow a previous work deng et al 2020 the denitrifying functional gene abundance in surface water and sediment were all determined by real time quantitative pcr qpcr as previously reported deng et al 2020 the functional genes determined were napa narg nirk nirs and nosz 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analysis conducted in this study were using spss 20 graphpad prism 8 and r 4 1 2 the relationship between microplastics abundance in surface water microplastics abundance in sediment n2o flux dissolved n2o concentration and basic water quality parameters were evaluated by pearson correlation analysis the data normality was checked by shapiro wilk test followed with log transformation where necessary the statistically significance difference of microplastics color and size distribution in surface water and sediment were determined by one way analysis of variance anova pearson correlation analysis also used for evaluating the relationship between microplastics abundance n2o concentration and functional gene abundance mantel test was conducted between the nitrification and denitrification genera in water with the microplastics abundance and water quality indexes in surface water with ggcor package in r the environmental variables significantly correlated with n2o concentration and microplastics abundance in surface water were analyzed by stepwise multiple regression model analysis inter variable collinearity of the models was used for evaluate the variance inflation factor vif 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and characteristics of microplastics in surface water and sediment the microplastics abundance in taihu inflow rivers were in the range of 513 96 3017 93 particles kg dw and 160 700 particles m3 for sediments and surface water respectively the average value of microplastics abundance were 1804 23 726 44 particles kg dw for sediment and 429 33 136 17 particles m3 for surface water table s1 the surface water microplastics abundance in guandu river was significantly lower than chendong and dapu river p 0 05 the highest microplastics abundance in sediment was observed in the riverway 2159 893 91 particles kg dw followed by estuary 1738 55 702 85 particles kg dw and then the lake site 1515 18 426 52 particles kg dw the microplastics abundance in the sediment of this work has similar range with zhang et al 2021a which the value was 460 1390 items kg but far higher than the results reported by su et al 2016 as 11 234 6 items kg this could imply that the microplastics inflow into in the taihu lake has facing a dramatically increase during the last 5 years which most was settled to the sediment it might not be precise to compare the microplastics abundance directly due to the variations of the microplastics sampling pretreatment and detection methods applied in different studies but it is still worth concern that the microplastics abundance in taihu lake sediment was increased in recent years the microplastics abundance in riverway estuary and lake site does not show significant difference in this work the microplastics in each of the five inflow rivers also did not show significant difference in abundance for sediment samples meanwhile the microplastics in surface water of inflow river in taihu lake was lower than other lakes fan et al 2022 li et al 2019 su et al 2016 earlier work has reported the microplastics contamination in freshwater lakes of china where the inland water was seriously polluted with microplastics and mainly originated from a secondary source zhang et al 2018 the relative lower amount of microplastics in surface water and higher abundance in sediment suggest that the inflow concentration of microplastics to taihu lake might be low while the total amount is high thus taihu lake sediment contains higher microplastics as compared with other inland lakes even though the microplastics abundance in surface water was low this indicated that the microplastics contamination control should consider a total amount control which is famous for tn and tp control in taihu basin zhang et al 2015 this results also implied that the microplastics contamination in taihu lake should be highly concerned the microplastics shape observed in this study including fiber 50 fragment 30 and film 20 in both sediment and water sample figs s1 s4 s9 the fiber shape was significantly higher than fragment p 0 001 and film p 0 0001 shape in sediment in water sample the film shape was significantly lower than fiber p 0 0001 and fragment p 0 01 shapes this indicated that the fiber was the dominant shape of microplastics in both sediment and surface sample comparable with other study fan et al 2022 xiong et al 2018 the colors found in both sediment and water samples were transparent blue red white green yellow and black fig s2 the transparent were significantly higher than other colors occupied around 40 in both sediment and water figs 1a fig 1b s2 this result is comparable with other work but different with earlier work of taihu lake su et al 2016 fu and wang 2019 it is reported that in 2015 the dominant microplastics color in taihu lake sediment was white 50 transparent 30 and others black red yellow green and blue in total around 20 the dominant color in surface water of taihu lake 2015 was blue 50 transparent 30 and others 20 this suggest that the microplastics color distribution has spatiotemporal heterogeneity in taihu lake the microplastics size distribution was quite different in sediment and water of the taihu lake the dominant size in surface water was 500 1000 μm and 1000 5000 μm which was significantly higher than 0 200 μm p 0 001 and p 0 0001 conversely the dominant size in sediment was 200 500 μm significantly higher than 0 200 μm p 0 05 and 500 1000 μm p 0 05 the 1000 5000 μm was significantly lower than other size in sediment p 0 0001 figs 1c fig 1d s3 s4 this is comparable with earlier reported situation of taihu lake in 2015 the material of microplastics in sediment and water were including polypropylene pp polyethylene pe polyethylene terephthalate pet polyvinyl alcohol pva fluorinated ethylene propylene fep polyvinyl chloride pvc and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe the dominant material was pp 40 significantly higher than other material p 0 0001 and pe 30 significantly higher than other material p 0 01 in both sediment and water sample and pvc and ptfe were quite low figs s5 s6 s7 the highest abundance in sediment was pp found in guandu estuary and in water was pp found in dapu estuary fig s8 pp and pe were the main material in wastewater treatment plants influent and effluent wang et al 2020 pp and pe are also the most widely used plastic globally which composed 36 and 21 of the global plastic manufacturing respectively geyer et al 2017 the pp and pe was dominant in this study and comparable with other works mintenig et al 2020 koelmans et al 2019 li et al 2020 wang et al 2018 3 2 dissolved n2o concentration and n2o flux in inflow rivers the dissolved n2o concentration was 45 71 132 42 nmol l the average value was 62 34 35 20 nmol l the n2o flux was 29 85 276 60 μmol m2 d average value was 96 09 84 79 μmol m2 d table s1 both n2o flux and dissolved concentration did not show obvious difference in the sampling site of riverway estuary and the lake sites the highest dissolved n2o concentration was 132 42 nmol l at estuary of guandu river the n2o flux has higher value in the chendong river estuary 276 60 μmol m2 d and dapu river estuary 252 13 μmol m2 d as compared with other sampling sites according to ipcc estimation the n2o emission was calculated based on the no3 n concentration ipcc 2019 the results of this study reflected that both the dissolved n2o concentration and n2o flux did not show significant correlation with the no3 n concentration this also suggest that the estimation of n2o emission in aquatic system single based on no3 n concentration might not be accurate the n2o emission from aquatic system could be affected by various environmental factors xiao et al 2019 liu et al 2018 the n2o saturation in the surface water of the five inflow rivers were ranged from 364 to 1064 with an average fluctuation of 547 the dissolved n2o concentration in taihu lake inflow rivers were over saturated with respect to atmospheric equilibrium levels suggest that these sampling sites were n2o net sources to the atmosphere liu et al 2011 the n2o flux reported in this work is significantly lower than the value in chaohu lake urban rivers which the mean n2o fluxes was 470 μmol m2 d zhang w et al 2021 this further emphasized that the inflow rivers were likely n2o emission hotspots 3 3 the microbial community structure and functional genes abundances the microbial community structure of the sampling sites surface water and sediment were analyzed fig s10 there was no significant difference in microbial structure between different sampling sites over 99 and 96 of the otus were classified to phylum level from water and sediment sample respectively the dominant phylum was proteobacteria 19 07 2 54 acidobacteria 6 99 0 83 planctomycetes 3 48 1 46 chloroflexi 3 76 0 93 and bacteroidetes 2 87 0 81 in sediment proteobacteria 14 52 3 10 cyanobacteria 10 57 3 78 bacteroidetes 9 67 5 35 actinobacteria 8 42 5 38 and planctomycetes 2 30 1 31 were predominant phyla in water the nitrification and denitrification related bacteria in genera level was selected for further analysis the n2o production and reduction related functional gene including napa narg nirk nitrite reductase k fragments nirs nitrite reductase s fragments and nosz clade i nitrous oxide reductase noszi was analyzed the napa in water sample was in the range of 0 35e 08 to 3 73e 08 copies l water with mean value at 1 54 0 91e 08 copies l water the abundance of narg nirk nirs and nosz clade i in water was 0 10e 10 2 07e 10 mean at 0 91 0 57e 10 0 43e 08 4 80e 08 mean at 1 83 1 20e 08 0 18e 08 8 72e 08 mean at 2 56 1 99 e 08 and 0 42e 09 5 02e 09 mean at 1 75 1 20e 09 copies l water respectively the nosz clade i generally indicate the n2o reduction potential was at 1 75 1 20e 09 copies l water and 1 02 0 69e 09 copies g sediment shows significantly higher n2o reduction potential in sediment as compared with in water the nirk noszi ratio nirs noszi ratio and nirk nirs noszi ratio which indicates the n2o production potential in surface water and sediment was also compared fig 2 the nirs type denitrifiers were predominant in n2o production during the denitrification process in both sediment and surface water more significant in sediment as compared with in surface water this suggest that the n2o production potential during denitrification was higher in sediment as compared with in water earlier work in soil matrix has reported that the addition of microplastics has reduced the nirs gene by nearly 40 while no significant effect to nirk and nosz gao et al 2021 rong et al 2021 the existence of microplastics could lead to inhibition of n2o emission during denitrification process the different material of microplastics could lead to the upregulation or downregulation for nirs and nirk sun et al 2022 han et al 2022 the effect and correlation of microplastics and the n2o emission in real lake still requires discussion 3 4 the correlation between microplastics abundance and n2o emission the pearson correlation between microplastics abundance in surface water and sediment with the n2o emission and other water quality parameters were analyzed fig 3a the microplastics in sediment was correlated with the dissolved n2o concentration and suspended sediments sps concentration sps was reported as important niche in aquatic system for denitrification process also the perfect site for n2o production and reduction xia et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 liu et al 2013 the sps in overlaying water of the shallow lakes could come from the inflowing input sediment resuspension and other suspended heteroaggregates the microplastics in surface water and sediment are also perfect niche for biofilm to attach and could be suspended either as sps or re suspended with sediments by windborne wave zhang y 2020 möhlenkamp et al 2018 the correlation between microplastics abundance in sediment and the dissolved n2o concentration gives the evidence that sediment was main n2o production contributor the functional gene results also support this conclusion as explained in section 3 3 meanwhile the pearson correlation between sps and microplastics abundance in sediment verified that sediment was a main sink of microplastics resuspension could bring microplastics aggregates to the water matrix the pearson correlation that concerns only sampling sites in the riverway of inflow river shows that the microplastics abundance in surface water was significantly correlated with the nitrite concentration positively p 0 01 and doc concentration negatively p 0 05 fig 3b the microplastics abundance in surface water also has correlation with n2o flux and dissolved n2o concentration in riverway indicated microplastics could participate in the nitrification or denitrification process in the form of plastisphere or others wu et al 2019 oberbeckmann et al 2015 rummel et al 2017 parrish and fahrenfeld 2019 the negative correlation between microplastics abundance in sediment of the riverway and tp p 0 01 nh4 n p 0 05 chl a p 0 05 and sps p 0 05 concentration implied that when the water was with higher pollutants loading the microplastics in sediment could be lower this could because that microplastics heteroaggregates has higher buoyancy and suspended in the polluted surface water instead of settle to the sediment in this case chen et al 2019 lu et al 2016 the microplastics abundance in surface water and sediment both has higher pearson correlation with water quality index in riverway than estuary and lake site figs 3b fig 3a s11 this implied the importance of investigate the correlation between n2o emission and microplastics characteristics in the riverway fan et al 2022 zhang et al 2021b hu et al 2016 the microplastics abundance in sediment was positively correlated with nh4 n concentration in estuary this suggest that the microplastics abundance also reflect the contamination situation of that area since nh4 n always been used as an indicator of lake water quality lin et al 2019 the pearson correlation of lake site samples indicated that the n2o flux was positively correlated with the no2 n and no3 n concentration significantly p 0 05 while the dissolved n2o was positively correlated with the nh4 n concentration significantly p 0 01 this suggest that the ammonia oxidation process is also importance source for n2o generation in lake site where most of the lake site are oxygen saturated prosser et al 2020 jung et al 2019 meanwhile the n2o flux in lake site are probably more related to the denitrification process zhou et al 2019 the microplastics abundance in sediment also shown positively correlation with sps concentration p 0 05 significantly of the guandu river fig s11d negatively with the doc tn ratio p 0 01 of the caoqiao river fig s11c and positively with tn concentration p 0 01 of the chendong river fig s11e respectively this suggests the heterogeneity of the microplastics involved in the n2o emission process in various inflowing rivers the pearson correlation between microplastics abundance in sediment surface water n2o flux and the denitrification related functional genes were analyzed figs 4 5 the n2o flux was negatively correlated with the nirs p 0 05 narg p 0 01 napa p 0 05 and noszi p 0 05 abundance in sediment the dissolved n2o concentration was also negatively correlated with nirk p 0 01 and nirk noszi ratio p 0 01 significantly this implied that the denitrification bacteria in sediment plays significant role to the n2o flux and the nirk type denitrifier in sediment was the main factor that inhibit the n2o generation the n2o flux was negatively correlated with nirs noszi ratio p 0 05 in surface water indicated that nirs type denitrifier was the main inhibitor that related to the n2o flux in water matrix the dissolved n2o concentration was positively correlated with the microplastics abundance in sediment indicated the sediment microplastics could participate in the n2o generation or reduction process to further discern the differentiated controls of n2o emission in inflow rivers stepwise regression analysis was conducted table s2 zhang et al 2021b zhou et al 2021 for microplastics abundance in riverway it was correlated with the no2 n and doc concentration the n2o flux can be explained by narg in sediment and nirs noszi ratio in water the dissolved n2o can be explained by nirk noszi in sediment the mantel test results revealed that nitrification genera p 0 01 and denitrification genera p 0 05 in water matrix was significantly correlated with microplastics abundance in water fig 6a this indicated that the microplastics in surface water are important niche for nitrification and denitrification process huang et al 2021 bhagwat et al 2021 agathokleous et al 2021 in which the percentage of nitrification and denitrification genera in surface water were as shown in fig 6c and fig 6e the predominant nitrification genera were nitrospira in both sediment and water while predominant denitrification genera were dechloromonas 1 96 1 36 in sediment and flavobacterium 12 34 12 18 in water respectively fig 6b e nitrospira are aerobic chemolithoautotrophic bacteria with strong diversity and plasticity most of which are pretend to form biofilm and densely grow on the microcolonies such as plastisphere cao et al 2017 mehrani et al 2020 nitrospira genera metabolism could occurs in both aerobic and anoxic conditions it includes not only nitrite oxidation comammox and other functions beyond nitrogen cycle dechloromonas is dominant denitrifier in many wastewater treatment plants activated sludge and also in high abundance in soils and sediments with high n2o production and consumption potential han et al 2019 flavobacterium genera contains full set of denitrifying related functional genes encoded all the enzymes that required for catalyze the denitrification processes harter et al 2016 wang et al 2018 flavobacterium has high nitrogen removal performance tolerant to temperature shock conditions and are dominant denitrifying genera in other systems wang et al 2016 the mantel test also revealed that the denitrification genera in sediment was correlated with the no2 n concentration in water p 0 05 this verified that no2 n reduction is the rate limiting step of the denitrification process fig s12 4 implication of this study the microplastics contamination in aquatic system has aroused dramatically increasing attention in last 2 decades li et al 2019 ren et al 2022 the global plastics production is increasing sustainably over the past 70 years which the annual production increased from 1 5 million metric tons mt in 1950s to 359 mt in 2018 okoffo et al 2021 plasticseurope 2019 mai et al 2020 it is estimated that about 6300 mt plastic wastes were produced since 1950 to 2015 79 of those was discharged to nature environments 4 8 12 7 mt plastic wastes were transferred from land to marine environment geyer et al 2017 huang et al 2021 lebreton et al 2017 reported that around 1 15 to 2 41 mt plastic wastes were transferred into ocean from global river every year the global riverine outflows of plastics to the aquatic environment should be concerned the plastics in aquatic system and inflow microplastics from terrestrial source through riverine are important source of microplastics our study emphasized the potential correlation between microplastics abundance in surface water and sediment with the nitrification and denitrification process especially could affect the powerful greenhouse gas n2o production and consumption process earlier work has emphasized the importance of n2o control in riverway hu et al 2016 song et al 2022 and the effect of microplastics to the nutrient cycling chen et al 2020 arias andres et al 2018 this work for the first time linking the n2o emission to microplastics abundance in riverine ecosystem and illustrate the correlated microbial process considering the high amount of microplastics in aquatic system its effect to the nitrogen cycling in the whole water ecosystem should not be ignored the results of this work emphasized the importance of microplastics occurrence in aquatic system to the n2o emission the control of microplastics contamination should be concerned 5 conclusion the main goal of this work was to examine whether microplastics involved in the n2o emission in rivers in this study the microplastics occurrence and n2o emission in five typical inflow rivers of taihu lake was investigated the results demonstrated that the inflow rivers were important source of microplastics to lakes taihu lake sediment microplastics amount was largely increased in last 5 years the relatively low microplastics abundance in surface water and high abundance in sediment of taihu lake suggest that the microplastics contamination control should consider a total amount control the typical inflow rivers investigated were all n2o source in this work with n2o saturation ranged from 364 to 1064 average fluctuation of 547 the microplastics abundance in riverway water was negatively correlated with doc p 0 05 where the microplastics abundance in riverway sediment was negatively correlated with tp p 0 01 nh4 n p 0 05 chl a p 0 05 and sps p 0 05 concentration this suggested that compared with estuary and lake site riverway microplastics has higher correlation with the nutrient cycling process microplastics abundance in surface water was significantly correlated with the nitrification p 0 01 and denitrification p 0 05 genera indicated that the microplastics in surface water were important niche for nitrification and denitrification process considering riverway are important microplastics transporting route and n2o emission hotspot further work should focus on the investigation of effect of microplastics to the

15422,the microplastics in nature water are important for the environmental fate of nitrous oxide n2o this study investigated the influence and microbial mechanism of microplastic abundance to the n2o flux in typical inflow rivers of taihu lake the microplastic abundance were in a range of 160 700 particles m3 surface water and 514 3018 particles kg dry sediment the highest percentage of microplastic color was transparent significantly higher than other color p 0 0001 in both surface water and sediment the dominant microplastic size was 500 5000 μm in surface water while size lower than 1000 μm was dominant in sediment the microplastic abundance in sediment was negatively correlated with the concentration of suspended sediments sps p 0 05 chl a p 0 05 nh4 n p 0 05 and tp p 0 01 in inflow river surface water the dissolved n2o concentration were 45 71 132 42 nmol l and the n2o fluxes were 29 85 276 60 μmol m2 d the dissolved n2o concentration was significantly correlated with the nirk abundance and nirk noszi ratio negatively p 0 05 revealed that sediment nirk type denitrification was the main driver of dissolved n2o meanwhile the n2o flux water air interface was significantly correlated with noszi napa narg and nirs negatively implied that nitrification and denitrification interaction in sediment is the main influence factor the denitrification process in sediment was the main driven factor of n2o releasing mantel test shows that microplastic abundance in surface water was significantly correlated with nitrification p 0 001 0 01 and denitrification p 0 01 0 05 genera in water the dominant denitrification microorganism was dechloromonas in sediment and flavobacterium in surface water these results provided new insight into the fact that plastisphere which comprises microbial community on microplastic could affect the n2o emission in aquatic system graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastic plastisphere nitrous oxide microbial functional gene inflow rivers 1 introduction microplastics as emerging contaminants its effect to the aquatic environment has arouse increasing concern microplastics could affect the nitrogen geochemical cycle through changing the microorganism community structure and functions in both terrestrial and aquatic systems bank and hansson 2019 shen et al 2021 the nutrients organic matters or contaminants in the surrounding environment could be adsorbed to the microplastics which is ideal niche for microbes to colonize this also could be defined as microplastics heteroaggregates an aggregate with microplastics biofilm and multi types of nutrients besseling et al 2017 wang et al 2021 2022 this is also be referred as plastisphere put forward by zettler et al 2013 by which the microorganism structure including bacterial and eukaryotic on marine plastics plastic litter 5 mm with varies materials were determined by high throughput sequencing as a first try the diverse microbial structure on plastisphere including heterotrophs autotrophs predators and symbiote were unveiled barros and seena 2021 the composite risks of plastisphere were widely reported yang et al 2020 found that plastisphere was a hotspot in spreading antibiotic resistome and poses long term eco risks the plastisphere also may affect ecological processes in marine system such as environmental contaminants transportation microplastics biodegradation carbon cycling and so forth liu et al 2022 meanwhile recent studies revealed that only 1 of plastic debris that released to aquatic system were counted which means that the microplastics and corresponding plastisphere biomass in global ocean is substantial van sebille et al 2015 amaral zettler et al 2020 plastisphere could act as potential reservoir for microbes in aquatic system it could affect the nitrogen biogeochemical process thus the impact of microplastics heteroaggregates to the nitrogen biogeochemical process should be concerned the nitrogen cycling is an essential part of the biogeochemistry process and mostly depends on the biotic nitrogen transformation this process occurs both in aquatic matrix and the sediment of eutrophic lakes rysgaard et al 1993 yang et al 2021 the effect of microplastics to the nitrogen biogeochemical cycling has aroused increasing interest in recent decade shen et al 2022 seeley et al 2020 the decomposition and accumulation of microplastics in soil could change the microbial functions in soil and affect the generation of greenhouse gasses rillig and lehmann 2020 the polyethylene microplastic addition to soil has increased the nitrite reductase nirs gene abundance and thus result in increased n2o emission from the paddy soil gao et al 2021 yu et al 2022 the heteroaggregates interact with soil and microplastics was widely investigated illustrated microplastics has influence the soil microbial community nitrogen cycling functional gene and thus affect the n2o emission the scenario that occurs in soil matrix could be existed in aquatic system the microplastic heteroaggregates are in high abundance in aquatic system wang et al 2021 barros and seena 2021 its interaction with nitrogen cycling in aquatic system has rarely been reported the resuspension of microplastic and sediments could enhance shallow lake eutrophication zhang et al 2020 tammeorg et al 2013 thus the characteristic of microplastic could be correlated with the nitrogen cycling in aquatic system nitrous oxide n2o a key intermediate released during nitrogen cycling has been regarded as top three greenhouse gasses together with methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 the global warming potential of n2o is 265 298 times greater than co2 in a 100 year period makowski 2019 ipcc 2014 the global n2o emission was increased substantially since 2009 with a faster rate than ipcc emission factor estimation due to high level nitrogen input thompson et al 2019 it is estimated that the n2o emission from rivers are 0 3 2 1 tg n2on yr 1 6 30 of the global anthropogenic n2o emission beaulieu et al 2011 the estimated global riverine n2o emission was 29 6 35 3 gg n2on yr 1 hu et al 2016 the global warming potential of n2o from aquatic system cannot be neglected inflow rivers are important network that transfer nitrogen microplastics and other nutrients to lakes and other aqueous system the riverway estuary and eutrophic lakes are all important hotspot for n2o emission and microplastics aggregation kortelainen et al 2020 li et al 2019 yu et al 2013 su et al 2021 fan et al 2022 whether microplastics or the plastisphere has play significant role in the n2o emission in eutrophic lake inflow rivers are not well documented this study aims at investigate the correlation between microplastics abundance and the n2o emission in inflow rivers the occurrence and characteristics of microplastics in typical inflow rivers of taihu lake were determined the n2o flux and dissolved n2o concentration were all measured the correlation between microplastic abundance n2o emission and water quality indexes were analyzed the correlated microbial mechanism including nitrification and denitrification bacteria functional genes were analyzed in the meantime the following hypothesis was discussed 1 the microplastic heteroaggregates including nitrifier and denitrifier inoculated participate to the inorganic nitrogen cycle and contribute to n2o emission 2 the existence of microplastics or the formed plastisphere affect the aquatic or sediment matrix and the microbial structure the n2o related functional gene abundance was changed and the n2o emission was affected 3 the microplastics has the similar source of the nitrogen inputs to aquatic system so the microplastic abundance could be related to the n2o emission this study for the first time linking microplastics to n2o emission in eutrophic lake inflow rivers which is meaningful for filling the gap that microplastics in aquatic matrix could interact to climate warming 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites taihu lake is typical eutrophic lake the third largest freshwater lake of china surface area 2338 km2 connected over 30 major rivers with complex river network surrounded qin et al 2007 li et al 2019 the main inflow rivers are in the north and northwest of taihu lake where zhang et al 2021a reported that those part occupied 79 of microplastics inflow into taihu lake five typical inflow rivers in this area including caoqiao river guandu river hongxiang river chendong river and dapu river were investigated in this study the inflow river which was reported as has highest microplastics contamination potential were included in this study there were three sampling sites for each inflow rivers located in riverway the estuary and adjacent lake site each sampling site are in a distance of approximately 1 km 2 2 microplastics sampling pretreatment and characterization the microplastics in the surface water and sediment were both collected in all sampling sites at august 2020 50 l surface water was collected by a 5 l container the container was pre rinsed by the in situ water before use the surface water was then pass through a nylon plankton net inner diameter 20 cm height 50 cm pore size 0 064 mm the residues on the net was rinsed to a 500 ml glass bottle by pure water this sampling process can be used for microplastics collection from small volume of water kapp and yeatman 2018 zhang et al 2018 su et al 2020 the sediment sample was collected by a 2 l volume van veen grab haifuda ltd beijing the microplastics in surface water and sediment were pretreated in lab followed by the same methods as our previous work with slight modification li et al 2019 xiong et al 2018 the water sample were pass through 5 μm stainless steel filter membrane jiudinggaoke ltd beijing the microplastics with size over 5 μm could be all retained on the membrane the membrane was then transfer to 250 ml clean conical bottle 10 ml feso4 7 2 mm ph 5 20 ml 30 h2o2 mixing for 15 min the conical bottle was then put in ultrasonic cleanser for 5 min to make sure microplastics remain in the solution remove the stainless filter membrane and clean with pure water after that 10 ml 4 5 hcl solution was added and totally mixed the solution was then filtered with a new rinsed 5 μm stainless filter membrane the membrane was then dried in desiccator waiting for determination the sediment sample was dry in oven at 60 c for 4 days around 10 g of dry sediment were then weighted recorded and transferred to a 100 ml clean conical bottle the saturated zinc chloride solution desity 1 6 g ml was added to the bottle put into ultrasonic cleanser for 15 min then totally mixed in a magnetic stirrer for 12 h the out part of the conical bottle was cleaned with pure water for 5 times and then the bottle was presented on a clean glass culture ware after that zinc chloride was added to the bottle settle for 12 h the floating debris were overflowed to the culture ware by adding zinc chloride solution by glass burette the density flotation was repeated for 5 7 times and the solution in culture ware was totally transferred to a 250 ml glass conical bottle followed by which the solution was further treated with the same methods used for surface water sample described above lenaker et al 2019 mani et al 2019 the microplastics were visually examined under stereomicroscope sz61 olympus japan and raman microscope invia renishaw uk the material quantity shape color and size of the microplastics were recorded microplastics were divided into 4 groups based on the size distribution 0 200 μm 200 500 μm 500 1000 μm 1000 5000 um 3 categories based on their shape fiber fragment film and 7 groups black yellow green white red blue and transparent on the color the microplastic abundance in water was computed as total amount of debris per 50 l water sample used reported as particles m3 the microplastic concentration in sediment was calculated by debris amount divided by dry sediment used reported as particles kg dw dry weight 2 3 n2o sampling and detection the n2o flux in air water interface was measured by floating chamber method zhou et al 2021 cole et al 2010 the floating chamber l w h 38 5 30 5 18 5 unit cm was fixed on the water surface manually gas sample in the headspace of the chamber was collected for 1 h at 10 min interval respectively the first gas sample was regarded as the n2o concentration in the in situ air the n2o sample was collected at pre cleaned gas bag and measured by gas chromatography gc 2014c shimadzu the n2o flux was calculated by eq 1 1 f s p v a r t 10 9 60 24 10 6 in the eq 1 f is the n2o emission flux µmol m 2 d 1 s is the slope of n2o concentration versus time ppbv min 1 p is the atmospheric pressure pa v is the chamber volume m3 and a is the water surface area covered by the chamber m2 r is the ideal gas constant 8 314 m3 pa mol 1 k 1 and t is the air temperature k following process was used for dissolved n2o sample collection and calculation the surface water was collected in situ with 115 ml vials by fine silicone tube to avoid bubbles the water was inflow to the vial by gravity until overflow and no visible bubble in the vial 200 μl mercuric chloride hgcl2 were added to the vial and then the vial was sealed with rubber stopper and aluminum foil cover the dissolved n2o concentration was measured by headspace equilibrium technique the detail of the calculation methods was as previous reported text s1 2 4 water quality analysis the overlaying water 20 cm below the surface water level sample was collected in triplicate stored in an ice cooler 4 c and transported to lab after sampling immediately the water quality parameters including ph dissolved oxygen do and temperature of the surface water was measured in situ dq3d hach usa other basic water quality index such as nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n ammonia nh4 n total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn dissolved organic carbon doc suspended sediment sps and chlorophyll a chl a were analyzed in lab the basic water parameters were analyzed by standard methods as previous reported zhou et al 2021 song et al 2022 2 5 microbial analysis the surface water 20 cm below the water level and surface sediment 0 10 cm were collected in triplicate stored in a cooler 4 c stored less than 5 days and transported to lab immediately the dna in surface water and surface sediment were extracted by dneasy powersoil kit qiagen hilden germany the 16s rrna high throughput sequencing were conducted follow a previous work deng et al 2020 the denitrifying functional gene abundance in surface water and sediment were all determined by real time quantitative pcr qpcr as previously reported deng et al 2020 the functional genes determined were napa narg nirk nirs and nosz 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analysis conducted in this study were using spss 20 graphpad prism 8 and r 4 1 2 the relationship between microplastics abundance in surface water microplastics abundance in sediment n2o flux dissolved n2o concentration and basic water quality parameters were evaluated by pearson correlation analysis the data normality was checked by shapiro wilk test followed with log transformation where necessary the statistically significance difference of microplastics color and size distribution in surface water and sediment were determined by one way analysis of variance anova pearson correlation analysis also used for evaluating the relationship between microplastics abundance n2o concentration and functional gene abundance mantel test was conducted between the nitrification and denitrification genera in water with the microplastics abundance and water quality indexes in surface water with ggcor package in r the environmental variables significantly correlated with n2o concentration and microplastics abundance in surface water were analyzed by stepwise multiple regression model analysis inter variable collinearity of the models was used for evaluate the variance inflation factor vif 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and characteristics of microplastics in surface water and sediment the microplastics abundance in taihu inflow rivers were in the range of 513 96 3017 93 particles kg dw and 160 700 particles m3 for sediments and surface water respectively the average value of microplastics abundance were 1804 23 726 44 particles kg dw for sediment and 429 33 136 17 particles m3 for surface water table s1 the surface water microplastics abundance in guandu river was significantly lower than chendong and dapu river p 0 05 the highest microplastics abundance in sediment was observed in the riverway 2159 893 91 particles kg dw followed by estuary 1738 55 702 85 particles kg dw and then the lake site 1515 18 426 52 particles kg dw the microplastics abundance in the sediment of this work has similar range with zhang et al 2021a which the value was 460 1390 items kg but far higher than the results reported by su et al 2016 as 11 234 6 items kg this could imply that the microplastics inflow into in the taihu lake has facing a dramatically increase during the last 5 years which most was settled to the sediment it might not be precise to compare the microplastics abundance directly due to the variations of the microplastics sampling pretreatment and detection methods applied in different studies but it is still worth concern that the microplastics abundance in taihu lake sediment was increased in recent years the microplastics abundance in riverway estuary and lake site does not show significant difference in this work the microplastics in each of the five inflow rivers also did not show significant difference in abundance for sediment samples meanwhile the microplastics in surface water of inflow river in taihu lake was lower than other lakes fan et al 2022 li et al 2019 su et al 2016 earlier work has reported the microplastics contamination in freshwater lakes of china where the inland water was seriously polluted with microplastics and mainly originated from a secondary source zhang et al 2018 the relative lower amount of microplastics in surface water and higher abundance in sediment suggest that the inflow concentration of microplastics to taihu lake might be low while the total amount is high thus taihu lake sediment contains higher microplastics as compared with other inland lakes even though the microplastics abundance in surface water was low this indicated that the microplastics contamination control should consider a total amount control which is famous for tn and tp control in taihu basin zhang et al 2015 this results also implied that the microplastics contamination in taihu lake should be highly concerned the microplastics shape observed in this study including fiber 50 fragment 30 and film 20 in both sediment and water sample figs s1 s4 s9 the fiber shape was significantly higher than fragment p 0 001 and film p 0 0001 shape in sediment in water sample the film shape was significantly lower than fiber p 0 0001 and fragment p 0 01 shapes this indicated that the fiber was the dominant shape of microplastics in both sediment and surface sample comparable with other study fan et al 2022 xiong et al 2018 the colors found in both sediment and water samples were transparent blue red white green yellow and black fig s2 the transparent were significantly higher than other colors occupied around 40 in both sediment and water figs 1a fig 1b s2 this result is comparable with other work but different with earlier work of taihu lake su et al 2016 fu and wang 2019 it is reported that in 2015 the dominant microplastics color in taihu lake sediment was white 50 transparent 30 and others black red yellow green and blue in total around 20 the dominant color in surface water of taihu lake 2015 was blue 50 transparent 30 and others 20 this suggest that the microplastics color distribution has spatiotemporal heterogeneity in taihu lake the microplastics size distribution was quite different in sediment and water of the taihu lake the dominant size in surface water was 500 1000 μm and 1000 5000 μm which was significantly higher than 0 200 μm p 0 001 and p 0 0001 conversely the dominant size in sediment was 200 500 μm significantly higher than 0 200 μm p 0 05 and 500 1000 μm p 0 05 the 1000 5000 μm was significantly lower than other size in sediment p 0 0001 figs 1c fig 1d s3 s4 this is comparable with earlier reported situation of taihu lake in 2015 the material of microplastics in sediment and water were including polypropylene pp polyethylene pe polyethylene terephthalate pet polyvinyl alcohol pva fluorinated ethylene propylene fep polyvinyl chloride pvc and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe the dominant material was pp 40 significantly higher than other material p 0 0001 and pe 30 significantly higher than other material p 0 01 in both sediment and water sample and pvc and ptfe were quite low figs s5 s6 s7 the highest abundance in sediment was pp found in guandu estuary and in water was pp found in dapu estuary fig s8 pp and pe were the main material in wastewater treatment plants influent and effluent wang et al 2020 pp and pe are also the most widely used plastic globally which composed 36 and 21 of the global plastic manufacturing respectively geyer et al 2017 the pp and pe was dominant in this study and comparable with other works mintenig et al 2020 koelmans et al 2019 li et al 2020 wang et al 2018 3 2 dissolved n2o concentration and n2o flux in inflow rivers the dissolved n2o concentration was 45 71 132 42 nmol l the average value was 62 34 35 20 nmol l the n2o flux was 29 85 276 60 μmol m2 d average value was 96 09 84 79 μmol m2 d table s1 both n2o flux and dissolved concentration did not show obvious difference in the sampling site of riverway estuary and the lake sites the highest dissolved n2o concentration was 132 42 nmol l at estuary of guandu river the n2o flux has higher value in the chendong river estuary 276 60 μmol m2 d and dapu river estuary 252 13 μmol m2 d as compared with other sampling sites according to ipcc estimation the n2o emission was calculated based on the no3 n concentration ipcc 2019 the results of this study reflected that both the dissolved n2o concentration and n2o flux did not show significant correlation with the no3 n concentration this also suggest that the estimation of n2o emission in aquatic system single based on no3 n concentration might not be accurate the n2o emission from aquatic system could be affected by various environmental factors xiao et al 2019 liu et al 2018 the n2o saturation in the surface water of the five inflow rivers were ranged from 364 to 1064 with an average fluctuation of 547 the dissolved n2o concentration in taihu lake inflow rivers were over saturated with respect to atmospheric equilibrium levels suggest that these sampling sites were n2o net sources to the atmosphere liu et al 2011 the n2o flux reported in this work is significantly lower than the value in chaohu lake urban rivers which the mean n2o fluxes was 470 μmol m2 d zhang w et al 2021 this further emphasized that the inflow rivers were likely n2o emission hotspots 3 3 the microbial community structure and functional genes abundances the microbial community structure of the sampling sites surface water and sediment were analyzed fig s10 there was no significant difference in microbial structure between different sampling sites over 99 and 96 of the otus were classified to phylum level from water and sediment sample respectively the dominant phylum was proteobacteria 19 07 2 54 acidobacteria 6 99 0 83 planctomycetes 3 48 1 46 chloroflexi 3 76 0 93 and bacteroidetes 2 87 0 81 in sediment proteobacteria 14 52 3 10 cyanobacteria 10 57 3 78 bacteroidetes 9 67 5 35 actinobacteria 8 42 5 38 and planctomycetes 2 30 1 31 were predominant phyla in water the nitrification and denitrification related bacteria in genera level was selected for further analysis the n2o production and reduction related functional gene including napa narg nirk nitrite reductase k fragments nirs nitrite reductase s fragments and nosz clade i nitrous oxide reductase noszi was analyzed the napa in water sample was in the range of 0 35e 08 to 3 73e 08 copies l water with mean value at 1 54 0 91e 08 copies l water the abundance of narg nirk nirs and nosz clade i in water was 0 10e 10 2 07e 10 mean at 0 91 0 57e 10 0 43e 08 4 80e 08 mean at 1 83 1 20e 08 0 18e 08 8 72e 08 mean at 2 56 1 99 e 08 and 0 42e 09 5 02e 09 mean at 1 75 1 20e 09 copies l water respectively the nosz clade i generally indicate the n2o reduction potential was at 1 75 1 20e 09 copies l water and 1 02 0 69e 09 copies g sediment shows significantly higher n2o reduction potential in sediment as compared with in water the nirk noszi ratio nirs noszi ratio and nirk nirs noszi ratio which indicates the n2o production potential in surface water and sediment was also compared fig 2 the nirs type denitrifiers were predominant in n2o production during the denitrification process in both sediment and surface water more significant in sediment as compared with in surface water this suggest that the n2o production potential during denitrification was higher in sediment as compared with in water earlier work in soil matrix has reported that the addition of microplastics has reduced the nirs gene by nearly 40 while no significant effect to nirk and nosz gao et al 2021 rong et al 2021 the existence of microplastics could lead to inhibition of n2o emission during denitrification process the different material of microplastics could lead to the upregulation or downregulation for nirs and nirk sun et al 2022 han et al 2022 the effect and correlation of microplastics and the n2o emission in real lake still requires discussion 3 4 the correlation between microplastics abundance and n2o emission the pearson correlation between microplastics abundance in surface water and sediment with the n2o emission and other water quality parameters were analyzed fig 3a the microplastics in sediment was correlated with the dissolved n2o concentration and suspended sediments sps concentration sps was reported as important niche in aquatic system for denitrification process also the perfect site for n2o production and reduction xia et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 liu et al 2013 the sps in overlaying water of the shallow lakes could come from the inflowing input sediment resuspension and other suspended heteroaggregates the microplastics in surface water and sediment are also perfect niche for biofilm to attach and could be suspended either as sps or re suspended with sediments by windborne wave zhang y 2020 möhlenkamp et al 2018 the correlation between microplastics abundance in sediment and the dissolved n2o concentration gives the evidence that sediment was main n2o production contributor the functional gene results also support this conclusion as explained in section 3 3 meanwhile the pearson correlation between sps and microplastics abundance in sediment verified that sediment was a main sink of microplastics resuspension could bring microplastics aggregates to the water matrix the pearson correlation that concerns only sampling sites in the riverway of inflow river shows that the microplastics abundance in surface water was significantly correlated with the nitrite concentration positively p 0 01 and doc concentration negatively p 0 05 fig 3b the microplastics abundance in surface water also has correlation with n2o flux and dissolved n2o concentration in riverway indicated microplastics could participate in the nitrification or denitrification process in the form of plastisphere or others wu et al 2019 oberbeckmann et al 2015 rummel et al 2017 parrish and fahrenfeld 2019 the negative correlation between microplastics abundance in sediment of the riverway and tp p 0 01 nh4 n p 0 05 chl a p 0 05 and sps p 0 05 concentration implied that when the water was with higher pollutants loading the microplastics in sediment could be lower this could because that microplastics heteroaggregates has higher buoyancy and suspended in the polluted surface water instead of settle to the sediment in this case chen et al 2019 lu et al 2016 the microplastics abundance in surface water and sediment both has higher pearson correlation with water quality index in riverway than estuary and lake site figs 3b fig 3a s11 this implied the importance of investigate the correlation between n2o emission and microplastics characteristics in the riverway fan et al 2022 zhang et al 2021b hu et al 2016 the microplastics abundance in sediment was positively correlated with nh4 n concentration in estuary this suggest that the microplastics abundance also reflect the contamination situation of that area since nh4 n always been used as an indicator of lake water quality lin et al 2019 the pearson correlation of lake site samples indicated that the n2o flux was positively correlated with the no2 n and no3 n concentration significantly p 0 05 while the dissolved n2o was positively correlated with the nh4 n concentration significantly p 0 01 this suggest that the ammonia oxidation process is also importance source for n2o generation in lake site where most of the lake site are oxygen saturated prosser et al 2020 jung et al 2019 meanwhile the n2o flux in lake site are probably more related to the denitrification process zhou et al 2019 the microplastics abundance in sediment also shown positively correlation with sps concentration p 0 05 significantly of the guandu river fig s11d negatively with the doc tn ratio p 0 01 of the caoqiao river fig s11c and positively with tn concentration p 0 01 of the chendong river fig s11e respectively this suggests the heterogeneity of the microplastics involved in the n2o emission process in various inflowing rivers the pearson correlation between microplastics abundance in sediment surface water n2o flux and the denitrification related functional genes were analyzed figs 4 5 the n2o flux was negatively correlated with the nirs p 0 05 narg p 0 01 napa p 0 05 and noszi p 0 05 abundance in sediment the dissolved n2o concentration was also negatively correlated with nirk p 0 01 and nirk noszi ratio p 0 01 significantly this implied that the denitrification bacteria in sediment plays significant role to the n2o flux and the nirk type denitrifier in sediment was the main factor that inhibit the n2o generation the n2o flux was negatively correlated with nirs noszi ratio p 0 05 in surface water indicated that nirs type denitrifier was the main inhibitor that related to the n2o flux in water matrix the dissolved n2o concentration was positively correlated with the microplastics abundance in sediment indicated the sediment microplastics could participate in the n2o generation or reduction process to further discern the differentiated controls of n2o emission in inflow rivers stepwise regression analysis was conducted table s2 zhang et al 2021b zhou et al 2021 for microplastics abundance in riverway it was correlated with the no2 n and doc concentration the n2o flux can be explained by narg in sediment and nirs noszi ratio in water the dissolved n2o can be explained by nirk noszi in sediment the mantel test results revealed that nitrification genera p 0 01 and denitrification genera p 0 05 in water matrix was significantly correlated with microplastics abundance in water fig 6a this indicated that the microplastics in surface water are important niche for nitrification and denitrification process huang et al 2021 bhagwat et al 2021 agathokleous et al 2021 in which the percentage of nitrification and denitrification genera in surface water were as shown in fig 6c and fig 6e the predominant nitrification genera were nitrospira in both sediment and water while predominant denitrification genera were dechloromonas 1 96 1 36 in sediment and flavobacterium 12 34 12 18 in water respectively fig 6b e nitrospira are aerobic chemolithoautotrophic bacteria with strong diversity and plasticity most of which are pretend to form biofilm and densely grow on the microcolonies such as plastisphere cao et al 2017 mehrani et al 2020 nitrospira genera metabolism could occurs in both aerobic and anoxic conditions it includes not only nitrite oxidation comammox and other functions beyond nitrogen cycle dechloromonas is dominant denitrifier in many wastewater treatment plants activated sludge and also in high abundance in soils and sediments with high n2o production and consumption potential han et al 2019 flavobacterium genera contains full set of denitrifying related functional genes encoded all the enzymes that required for catalyze the denitrification processes harter et al 2016 wang et al 2018 flavobacterium has high nitrogen removal performance tolerant to temperature shock conditions and are dominant denitrifying genera in other systems wang et al 2016 the mantel test also revealed that the denitrification genera in sediment was correlated with the no2 n concentration in water p 0 05 this verified that no2 n reduction is the rate limiting step of the denitrification process fig s12 4 implication of this study the microplastics contamination in aquatic system has aroused dramatically increasing attention in last 2 decades li et al 2019 ren et al 2022 the global plastics production is increasing sustainably over the past 70 years which the annual production increased from 1 5 million metric tons mt in 1950s to 359 mt in 2018 okoffo et al 2021 plasticseurope 2019 mai et al 2020 it is estimated that about 6300 mt plastic wastes were produced since 1950 to 2015 79 of those was discharged to nature environments 4 8 12 7 mt plastic wastes were transferred from land to marine environment geyer et al 2017 huang et al 2021 lebreton et al 2017 reported that around 1 15 to 2 41 mt plastic wastes were transferred into ocean from global river every year the global riverine outflows of plastics to the aquatic environment should be concerned the plastics in aquatic system and inflow microplastics from terrestrial source through riverine are important source of microplastics our study emphasized the potential correlation between microplastics abundance in surface water and sediment with the nitrification and denitrification process especially could affect the powerful greenhouse gas n2o production and consumption process earlier work has emphasized the importance of n2o control in riverway hu et al 2016 song et al 2022 and the effect of microplastics to the nutrient cycling chen et al 2020 arias andres et al 2018 this work for the first time linking the n2o emission to microplastics abundance in riverine ecosystem and illustrate the correlated microbial process considering the high amount of microplastics in aquatic system its effect to the nitrogen cycling in the whole water ecosystem should not be ignored the results of this work emphasized the importance of microplastics occurrence in aquatic system to the n2o emission the control of microplastics contamination should be concerned 5 conclusion the main goal of this work was to examine whether microplastics involved in the n2o emission in rivers in this study the microplastics occurrence and n2o emission in five typical inflow rivers of taihu lake was investigated the results demonstrated that the inflow rivers were important source of microplastics to lakes taihu lake sediment microplastics amount was largely increased in last 5 years the relatively low microplastics abundance in surface water and high abundance in sediment of taihu lake suggest that the microplastics contamination control should consider a total amount control the typical inflow rivers investigated were all n2o source in this work with n2o saturation ranged from 364 to 1064 average fluctuation of 547 the microplastics abundance in riverway water was negatively correlated with doc p 0 05 where the microplastics abundance in riverway sediment was negatively correlated with tp p 0 01 nh4 n p 0 05 chl a p 0 05 and sps p 0 05 concentration this suggested that compared with estuary and lake site riverway microplastics has higher correlation with the nutrient cycling process microplastics abundance in surface water was significantly correlated with the nitrification p 0 01 and denitrification p 0 05 genera indicated that the microplastics in surface water were important niche for nitrification and denitrification process considering riverway are important microplastics transporting route and n2o emission hotspot further work should focus on the investigation of effect of microplastics to the

15423,microplastics are emerging contaminants in various aquatic environments leading to human and environmental health concerns viruses have also been ubiquitously detected in aquatic environments and there is an unknown risk of microplastics mediated virus migration through adsorption this study applied polystyrene microplastics as the carrier and the t4 bacteriophage or phage as the virus model and a violet side scatter green fluorescence double gated flow cytometry approach to investigate the adsorption capacity of viruses on microplastics our results show that up to 98 6 0 2 of the dosed viruses can be adsorbed by microplastics and such adsorptions are dependent on size and surface functional groups both fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and fluorescence labelled confocal microscopy confirmed that the virus can successfully adsorb onto microplastics zeta potential characterisation revealed that the electrostatic interaction is the primary adsorption mechanism associated with the adsorption of viruses uv aging was found to enhance the adsorption capacities of viruses on microplastics both pristine and uv aged microplastics were found to significantly prolong the infectivity of the adsorbed viruses even under elevated temperatures collectively our findings highlight that microplastics are associated with the biological risks of water borne viral transmission through virus adsorption graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polystyrene microplastic virus freshwater adsorption mechanism uv aging virus survival 1 introduction with the growing manufacturing and application of an estimated worldwide mass of 6 300 million metric tons in 2015 geyer et al 2017 plastics have been detected in global aquatic environments as weathered derivative debris of various chemical compositions and sizes with polyethylene polypropylene and polystyrene as the most commonly detected plastic types erni cassola et al 2019 xu et al 2020 among these various fragments of plastic contaminants there have been increasing public and regulatory concerns with microplastics diameter from 1 to 1 000 μm hartmann et al 2019 since microplastics have been increasingly detected in human bodies cox et al 2019 even in placenta ragusa et al 2021 and various ecosystems to illustrate this microplastics can be released to downstream aquatic environments from wastewater treatment plants wwtps after secondary treatment with a concentration of up to 447 microplastic particles per liter simon et al 2018 after entering aquatic environments microplastics can be bio accumulated in aquatic life rist et al 2018 moreover microplastics can be further transmitted to freshwaters and even to drinking water novotna et al 2019 hence there is a risk of the environmental transfer of microplastics to humans via consuming contaminated aquatic lives van cauwenberghe and janssen 2014 or contaminated water novotna et al 2019 the direct health risks of microplastics to humans are unresolved in addition to the direct risks microplastics can also pose risks to humans as vectors of various chemical and biological contaminants botterell et al 2019 jin et al 2021 mao et al 2020 perveen et al 2022 for chemical contaminants various chemicals such as heavy metals mao et al 2020 antibiotics perveen et al 2022 and persistent organic contaminants yu et al 2019 have been observed to adsorb onto microplastic vectors however the detected levels of chemical contaminants on microplastics brennecke et al 2016 yu et al 2019 are usually a logarithmic lower than the effective concentration thresholds e g the minimum selective pressure for antibiotics to select for antibiotic resistance khan et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 that can cause a noticeable adverse effect compared to chemical contaminants less focus has been placed on the potential of microplastics to adsorb biological contaminants a limited number of literature reported that various microorganisms including algae bacteria protozoa and fungi could rapidly colonise on microplastic surfaces upon the release of microplastic into the aquatic systems lobelle and cunliffe 2011 mammo et al 2020 it should be noticed that the minimum infective dose for some pathogens is very low 102 cfu of shigella to successfully cause infection yezli and otter 2011 and the microplastics associated biological contaminants can proliferate on microplastics or inside the host organism after being taken up together with microplastics guo et al 2020 lobelle and cunliffe 2011 therefore compared with chemical contaminants the biological substances adsorbed on microplastics might be of larger concern to the health of humans and animals viruses can be adsorbed onto abiotic surfaces armanious et al 2016 and soil wong et al 2013 which might further facilitate their transmission for example sars cov 2 can survive on polystyrene plastic for over 92 h with only a 1 log10 drop of infectivity pastorino et al 2020 such a prolonged virus survival mediates the transmission of sars cov 2 via inanimate objects onakpoya et al 2021 compared to the bulk plastic surface it is still unclear whether and how viruses can be adsorbed onto microplastic surfaces if microplastics can adsorb viruses whether such adsorption can promote the environmental transmission of viruses by prolonging their survival is also unknown wwtps simultaneously discharge a large quantity of microplastics sun et al 2019 and a diversity of viruses corpuz et al 2020 to downstream aquatic environments and the coexistence of microplastics rochman et al 2015 and human viruses iwamoto et al 2010 have been frequently detected in aquatic animals including shellfish hence a comprehensive investigation is needed to evaluate the potential of microplastics to adsorb viruses and mediate the environmental transmission of viruses this study aims to investigate the potential of microplastics to adsorb viruses and reveal the adsorption mechanism to investigate this escherichia coli bacteriophage t4 was selected as a model virus for microplastic models polyethylene and polypropylene have densities below 1 g cm3 and are buoyant in aquatic environments in contrast polystyrene has a density of 1 04 1 11 g cm3 and can be submerged and suspended in water environments duis and coors 2016 therefore polystyrene microplastics were selected as vectors to evaluate the contributions of size concentration of microplastics and surface functional groups on the adsorption of viruses a violet side scatter vssc sybr green fluorescence double gated fluorescence activated cell sorting facs approach based on size and green fluorescence was applied together with plaque assay to quantify the adsorption of viruses the adsorption of viruses was confirmed by fourier transform infra red ftir spectroscopy analysis and confocal microscopy imaging the virus adsorption kinetics and isotherms were estimated and the adsorption mechanism was investigated by measuring the zeta potential the aging of microplastics was conducted by uv treatments and the virus adsorption capacity of aged microplastics was compared with pristine microplastics the survival of viruses being adsorbed onto microplastics was also evaluated under different temperatures 2 materials and methods 2 1 microplastics viruses and plaque assay in order to investigate whether and how microplastics are environmental carriers of viruses through adsorption this study used polystyrene microplastics as vectors to evaluate the potential of microplastics to carry viruses spherical shaped polystyrene microplastics with various sizes in diameter 2 μm namely mp2 20 μm namely mp20 and 100 μm namely mp100 and surface functional group modification both of 20 μm in diameter cooh namely mp20 cooh and nh2 namely mp20 nh2 were commercially purchased dongguan zhongzheng plastic china microplastics were suspended in milli q water 18 2 mω cm 1 and sonicated at 80 j for 5 min with alternating pulses and pauses of equal duration every second branson sonifier 450 to achieve a homogeneous suspension phase before each experiment escherichia coli bacteriophage phage t4 was purchased from american type culture collection atcc 11303 b4 as the target virus and e coli k 12 mg1655 was purchased from atcc 700926 as the bacterial host to enrich t4 phage e coli was grown in luria bertani lb broth at 37 c to reach a mid exponential growing phase od600 0 2 0 3 t4 phages with the multiplicity of infection of 1 were added to the e coli host and further incubated for 5 h at 37 c until clear lysate occurred then the t4 phages were separated from the e coli host by ultra centrifugation at 12 000 g for 10 min at 4 c and further purified by membrane filtration 0 22 μm sterivex afterward a plaque assay using a double layer agar plate method was used to assess the virus titer of the purified t4 phage suspensions bonilla et al 2016 2 2 batch adsorption desorption experiments and virus quantification by using a flow cytometer the adsorption of viruses onto microplastics was measured indirectly by quantifying the un adsorbed viruses in the experimental groups briefly t4 phage as the virus model was freshly prepared and diluted into desired concentrations the viruses were then equally divided into two groups into sealed static electricity neutralised 2 ml glass vials with one group without microplastic treatment and the other group added with microplastics ranging from 0 001 to 100 mg l to conduct the adsorption experiments for various durations at the end of the adsorption experiment 1 ml of the adsorption mixture was transferred to a 1 5 ml centrifuge tube and microplastics were precipitated by 12 000 g centrifuge at room temperature for 10 min to separate with the un adsorbed viruses and subjected to the quantification of the un adsorbed virus by plaque assay or flow cytometer detection fig 1a to calculate the adsorption rate of viruses the non microplastic added group was set as the control the treated groups were dosed with various types and concentrations of microplastics the percentage of adsorbed viruses was calculated by using the following equation 1 adsorption c c c t c c 100 where cc and ct are the concentrations of viruses with and without microplastic dosage at sampling time respectively to further validate the accuracy of the indirect quantification of virus adsorption rate by measuring the un adsorbed viruses desorption experiments were conducted to close the total quantity balance of adsorbed and un adsorbed viruses for the desorption experiment the precipitants from the previous step were resuspended in a final tween 80 concentration of 1 w v and sonicated for 10 min to desorb viruses followed by a high speed centrifuge to remove microplastics the desorption experiments were repeated 3 times to achieve maximum desorption of viruses fig 1a to quantify the virus a vssc sybr green fluorescence double gated facs approach was applied to detect virus particles based on both size 100 200 nm in length and green fluorescence from stained nucleic acids such a method can increase the detection resolution of the flow cytometer for small particles 500 nm while excluding the optical and electronic background generated by nucleic acids free unstained particles brittain et al 2019 in brief the collected viruses were stained with sybr green at 0 1 μm final concentration for 15 min at 80 c this was further validated by the double gated facs detection method and was analysed using a cytoflex flow cytometer beckman usa equipped with violet 405 nm and blue 488 nm laser excitation sources fig 1a the cytoflex flow cytometer was first calibrated using the 130 nm fluorescent megamix fs microbeads fig s1 beads emitting a fitc like fluorescent light at the size of 130 nm in diameter was used throughout all experiments to establish the best photodiode gains for fitc and vssc the gating windows obtained from the calibration using 130 nm fluorescent megamix fs microbeads were applied to distinguish the non virus containing background fig 1b and the virus particles fig 1c all signals were collected in log area mode with biological replicates n 3 afterward the accuracy of facs detection was further validated by comparing the facs results with the culture based plaque assay results the equilibrium time of the adsorption of viruses was evaluated by a time course experiment to illustrate 5 106 pfu ml viruses were divided into two groups with one group as untreated control and another group was added with mp20 cooh at a final concentration of 100 mg l then the adsorption rate of viruses was measured in a time course manner for 24 h with sampling time at various durations 0 10 min 20 min 30 min 40 min 50 min 1 h 2 h 4 h 8 h and 24 h after determining the maximum adsorption equilibrium time of viruses 50 min fig 1d further adsorption experiments were conducted for 50 min and facs detection was immediately conducted after reaching the maximum adsorption equilibrium time virus adsorption experiments were conducted with 1 000 pfu μl virus concentration and mixed with various microplastics types mp2 mp20 mp100 mp20 cooh and mp20 nh2 either pristine or uv aged at 100 mg l to investigate the parameters of microplastics that affect the virus adsorption with the non microplastic treated group as a control each experiment was conducted with biological triplicates at least n 3 2 3 ftir spectroscopy analysis the adsorption of viruses onto microplastics was confirmed chemically through the fourier transform infra red ftir spectroscopy analysis of the chemical composition of the microplastics before and after the adsorption of viruses by using a fourier transform infrared spectrometer tensor 27 bruker billerica the us the attenuated total reflection mode with a wavenumber in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 and step size of 2 cm 1 was used chemical bonding information of various microplastics before viruses adsorption was compared to those after viruses adsorption in addition ftir analysis was also conducted on uv aged microplastics to evaluate the changes in chemical properties of aged microplastics 2 4 assessment of virus adsorption and uv aging via confocal microscopy the size and morphology of various microplastics before and after phage adsorption or uv aging were determined by the conventional wide field fluorescence microscopy imaging on an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope zeiss lsm 710 axioobserver plan apochromat 40 1 4 oil dic m27 objective and 3 channel quasa spectral pmt array was equipped confocal microscope and zen2 3 software was used for image acquisition the acquisition was set up with 0 39 µs pixel time of green fluorescence at 488 nm excitation wavelength using a fluo led spectra x light source the images of viruses only microplastics only and microplastics adsorbed with viruses were taken with 1024 1024 pixels 2 5 transmission electron microscope imaging of virus after adsorption onto microplastics the orientations of the phage after adsorption onto the microplastics were analyzed under a jem 1010 transmission electron microscope jeol usa at 80 kv according to a previously described method lu et al 2020 which can also be found in supporting methods in si 2 6 microplastics size and zeta potentials analyses measurements of the size distribution of mp2 before and after uv aging and zeta potential of various polystyrene microplastics before and after virus adsorption or before and after uv aging were conducted using a zetasizer nano zsp laser particle analyzer malvern instruments ltd malvern the uk at 25 c at a 173 scattering angle with 4 mw he ne laser mps samples were prepared in 100 mg l concentration as stated in section 2 1 with sonication branson sonifier 450 and placed in standard malvern zeta potential disposable capillary cells and polystyrene cuvettes malvern instruments ltd malvern the uk for zeta potential and size measurements respectively all measurements were repeated at least three times 2 7 virus adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm in different water matrices the adsorption kinetics of viruses onto microplastics were estimated by fitting the experimental data to the pseudo first order model pseudo second order model elovich model and weber morris model until reaching the maximum adsorption equilibrium time 50 min the equations of all models can be found in supporting information the data best fit the pseudo second order model after evaluation table s2 therefore pseudo second order model 2 has been applied to investigate the adsorption kinetic of viruses onto microplastics 2 q t t 1 k 2 q 2 2 t q 2 where qt represents the detected amount of viruses adsorbed on microplastics at time t pfu mg q 2 mg g are the estimated adsorption capacities by the models k 2 g mg 1 min 1 corresponds to the kinetic constant t is the contact time min respectively virus adsorption was conducted in different water matrices milliq water and freshwater to evaluate the adsorption isotherm and to investigate the influence of the physicochemical properties of the water matrix on the adsorption of viruses for adsorption experiments of the viruses on microplastics in freshwater freshwater samples were collected in the pine river area brisbane queensland australia august 2021 27 353923 152 948871 into a glass container and were sterile filtered 0 22 μm sterivex to remove microorganisms and large particles from the sample viruses and microplastics were then suspended and mixed in the filtered fresh water to conduct the adsorption experiments the physicochemical properties of the freshwater matrix have been analysed and shown in table s1 the adsorption isotherms of viruses onto microplastics were estimated by fitting the experimental data to the langmuir henry temkin sips toth koble corrigan khan and fritz schluender adsorption isotherm models the equations of all models can be found in supporting information the data best fit the khan model after evaluation table s3 therefore khan isotherm model 3 has been

microplastics by mimicking uv irradiation microplastics of various types mp2 mp20 mp100 mp20 cooh and mp20 nh2 were placed in glass petri dishes uv aging experiments were performed using a xenon lamp 300 w equipped with an oriel cornerstone 260 1 4 m monochromator with intensity regulated using and sunlight filter to adjust the emission range between 320 and 420 nm irradiation was conducted at 24 2 c with an intensity of 500 w m2 for 28 days according to a previous publication mao et al 2020 2 9 stability of viruses adsorbed on microplastics the stability of the viruses after being adsorbed onto various microplastics was determined by incubating mixtures of viruses and microplastics at different temperatures 22 3 c and 30 c for 10 days firstly t4 phage was amplified using e coli strain as described in section 2 1 and diluted in milli q water to obtain an approximate concentration of 106 pfu ml then various microplastic types mp2 mp20 mp100 mp20 cooh and mp20 nh2 both original and uv aged were mixed with viruses to obtain a final microplastic concentration of 100 mg l with virus alone as the control group aliquots were stored in the dark at 24 2 c or 30 c for up to 10 days after 3 6 and 10 days aliquots were enumerated by using a plaque assay all experiments were conducted with biological triplicates 2 10 statistical analysis data analysis was used by spss 27 0 ibm armonk usa significant differences were performed by analysis of variance anova p values were corrected using the bonferroni correction vizcaíno et al 2016 and presented as padj a value of padj 0 05 was considered significant data were expressed as mean standard deviation 3 results 3 1 facs determination of virus adsorption the detection of viruses was conducted by a double gated facs detection method fig 1 which was further validated by plaque assay the results from the facs detection 3798 78 event μl were similar padj 0 05 to the values obtained from plaque assay 3912 110 event μl indicating the accuracy of facs detection the accuracy of indirect quantification on the adsorption of viruses was further validated by closing the total quantity balance of adsorbed and un adsorbed viruses after repeating the desorption process three times the total number of viruses quantified by such a method accounted for 99 6 0 2 of the total dosed viruses therefore the closed quantity balance further validated the double gated facs detection method the maximum adsorption equilibrium was attained at 50 min when a maximum of 15 6 of the total viruses were adsorbed onto the microplastics the adsorption rate of viruses started to decrease from 1 h indicating potential virus desorption after reaching adsorption equilibrium fig 1d 3 2 changes in ftir spectra with virus adsorption to confirm the adsorption of viruses onto microplastics the chemical properties of microplastic surfaces before and after adsorption were evaluated by comparing the ftir spectra firstly the ftir spectra of the five types of microplastics used in this study were measured before adsorption overall all five types of microplastics shared several conservative peaks in their ftir spectra at 690 720 cm 1 760 780 cm 1 1480 1500 cm 1 2850 2920 cm 1 and 3020 3030 cm 1 which have been observed among polystyrene microplastics fig s2 particularly the ftir spectrum of mp20 cooh showed unique absorption peaks in oxygen containing functional groups at 1720 cm 1 co and 3000 cm 1 oh which correspond to co and oh vibration stretches respectively similarly the ftir spectrum of mp20 nh2 also showed unique absorption peaks at 1650 1580 cm 1 and 3500 cm 1 indicating nh bending and stretching fig s2 the ftir spectra of microplastics were altered after the viruses were adsorbed suggesting that viruses can successfully adsorb onto microplastics compared with microplastics before adsorption more peaks at 1650 cm 1 or higher absorption intensity around 3000 2800 cm 1 were observed in ftir spectra of microplastics after adsorption fig 2a the vibrations around 3000 2800 cm 1 are assigned to the stretching of ch2 group which could be contributed by virus nucleic acids winder and goodacre 2004 in addition the peak at 1650 cm 1 was attributed to the cn stretching the region around 1700 1500 cm 1 is mainly derived from proteins and the bands from 1450 to 1200 cm 1 are due to the combination of free amino acids carboxylic groups of proteins and polysaccharides in addition to proteins and nucleic acids carbohydrates were also present with a typical region of 1200 900 cm 1 wavenumber therefore successful adsorption of viruses onto microplastics can be chemically confirmed by the alteration of ftir spectra 3 3 validation of virus adsorption by confocal microscopy to further confirm the adsorption of viruses onto microplastics by an optical approach images of microplastics before and after the adsorption of viruses were obtained from a confocal microscope microplastics alone did not show any green fluorescence due to the lack of lipid or nucleic acid content therefore they could not be stained with sybr fig 2b in contrast after the adsorption of viruses strong green fluorescences could be observed at the edge surface of the microplastic indicating the successful adsorption of multiple viruses onto the surface of the microplastic fig 2c moreover the asymmetrical distribution of green fluorescence signals demonstrated that the adsorption of viruses onto microplastics is not a homogenous process overall the successful adsorption of viruses onto microplastics was optically confirmed by a confocal microscope 3 4 effects of concentration size and functional groups of microplastics on the adsorption of viruses the influence of the physicochemical properties of microplastics on the adsorption of viruses was investigated on various microplastic types firstly virus adsorption onto microplastics is dependent on the concentration of microplastic no virus adsorption was detected at 0 001 mg l mp2 whereas when the adsorption of viruses started at 0 01 mg l mp2 5 6 3 4 the adsorption rate was significantly higher padj 0 05 from 0 1 mg l mp2 then the adsorption rate increased with increasing microplastics concentration and maximized at 100 mg l mp2 98 6 0 2 padj 0 01 fig 3a secondly virus adsorption onto microplastics is dependent on the size of the microplastic to illustrate this viruses at a concentration of 1 000 pfu μl were mixed with microplastics of different sizes 2 20 and 100 μm in diameter at 100 mg l the adsorption rates at adsorption equilibrium time were 98 6 0 2 padj 0 01 for 100 mg l mp2 83 6 0 8 padj 0 01 for 100 mg l mp20 and 73 7 2 1 padj 0 01 for 100 mg l mp100 overall virus adsorption rates decreased with increasing microplastic size fig 3b lastly the modification of functional groups on the microplastic surface affects the adsorption of viruses after mixing a concentration of 1000 pfu μl viruses with similarly sized 20 μm in diameter microplastics with different surface functional group modifications at 100 mg l the adsorption rate at adsorption equilibrium time was the highest 94 3 0 8 padj 0 01 for 100 mg l mp20 cooh in contrast the adsorption rate was 83 6 0 8 padj 0 01 for 100 mg l mp20 and it was the lowest 51 4 12 5 padj 0 01 for 100 mg l mp20 nh2 fig 3c 3 5 zeta potentials affect virus adsorption as the primary factor affecting the particle s adsorption capacity via electrostatic attraction zeta potential indicates the electrical potential exhibited by any particles savaji et al 2014 the negative zeta potential values of microplastics affected their virus adsorption capacity to illustrate this all five microplastic types showed negative zeta potential with decreasing microplastic sizes from 100 to 2 μm their net zeta potential values of microplastics increased fig 4a which was associated with an increased adsorption rate of viruses on smaller sized microplastics fig 3b in addition the absolute zeta potential values of microplastics with different functional groups modification were also correlated to their virus adsorption rate the microplastic type mp20 cooh that has the highest absolute zeta potential value also expressed the highest virus adsorption rate conversely mp20 nh2 has both the lowest absolute zeta potential and virus adsorption rate figs 4b and 3c moreover after virus adsorption all five types of microplastic showed an increase in absolute zeta potential fig 4 tem imaging demonstrated the orientation of t4 phages after being adsorbed onto microplastics with negatively charged capsids facing out and positively charged tail fibers facing towards the microplastic fig s3 which might be one of the causes of the increased overall absolute zeta potential after virus adsorption 3 6 virus adsorption kinetics in milli q water and freshwater to investigate virus adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherms adsorption equilibrium experiments were conducted by mixing viruses with mp2 at different ratios the adsorption kinetics of viruses onto microplastics in milli q water reaching the maximum adsorption equilibrium time 50 min have been fitted to the pseudo first order model pseudo second order model elovich and weber morris models fig s4 among all models pseudo second order model had the highest r 2 value r 2 0 96 table s2 suggesting that the adsorption kinetics of viruses onto microplastics in milli q water is best explained by the pseudo second order model the adsorption isotherms of viruses onto microplastics in milli q water at adsorption equilibrium time were estimated by fitting the experimental results to the langmuir freundlich henry temkin sips toth koble corrigan khan and fritz schluender adsorption isotherm models the r2 values of all the models except the henry model were high r 2 0 95 suggesting that the adsorption behaviors of viruses onto microplastics in milli q water can be explained by these adsorption isotherm models fig s5 nevertheless the khan adsorption isotherm model r 2 0 99 was the best fit to illustrate the virus adsorption behaviors in comparison to the other models table s3 the maximum adsorption capacity qmax of the viruses onto microplastics according to the khan adsorption isotherm model was 61 4 viruses per microgram of microplastics afterward the khan adsorption isotherm model was used to fit the parameters of the experimental results of virus adsorption onto mp2 in milli q water fig 5a and freshwater fig 5b respectively 3 7 effect of aging of microplastics on adsorption of viruses to investigate whether the aging of microplastics can affect their capabilities to adsorb viruses uv aged microplastics were prepared by a 28 day uv treatment to mimic the effect of natural uv irradiation the aging effect of uv treatment on the size and morphology of microplastics was investigated by confocal microscopy imaging fig 6a b and fig s6 before the uv treatment the pristine microplastics had smooth spherical shapes and sizes as indicated by the manufacturer fig 6a and fig s6a d after 28 day uv treatment the surfaces of the aged microplastics became rough their shapes became irregular and even started to break down into smaller microplastics and generated debris fig 6b fig s6e h most evidently the average size of 2 μm microplastic also reduced from 2 μm to less than 1 μm after uv aging fig s7 in addition uv aging significantly reduced the absolute zeta potential of mp2 and mp20 cooh while significantly increased the absolute zeta potential of mp100 and mp20 nh2 fig s8 such a reduction in zeta potential might be correlated with the changes in the surface chemistry of the microplastics after aging to illustrate this the co stretching peaks around 1715 could be found in both pristine and aged mp20 mp20 cooh and mp20 nh2 and aged mp100 fig s9b e but not in pristine or aged mp2 fig s9a compared with the pristine microplastics the adsorption of co stretching peaks increased for the uv aged mp20 mp20 nh2 and mp100 which indicated more carbonyl functional groups might have formed in those aged microplastics in contrast the adsorption of co stretching peaks reduced for the uv aged mp20 cooh likely indicating the corrosion of the microplastic surfaces and the consequent loss of the cooh surface chemical modification fig s9c more evidently the absolute zeta potential of uv aged mp20 cooh also decreased fig s8 which further suggested a loss of the negatively charged cooh functional group after aging the uv aging of microplastics enhanced the adsorption of viruses in terms of microplastics with various sizes aging of the microplastics with sizes 20 μm in diameter significantly padj 0 01 enhanced their virus adsorption capacities from 83 6 0 8 to 91 6 0 9 for 100 mg l mp20 and from 73 7 2 1 to 92 11 for 100 mg l mp100 respectively fig 6c in contrast uv aging significantly padj 0 01 decreased the virus adsorption capacities of 100 mg l mp2 from 98 6 0 2 to 91 0 0 6 fig 6c in terms of microplastics with different functional groups aging of the microplastics with nh2 groups modified significantly padj 0 01 enhanced its virus adsorption capacities from 51 4 12 5 to 75 1 5 7 in comparison uv aging significantly padj 0 01 decreased the virus adsorption capacities of 100 mg l mp20 cooh from 94 3 0 8 to 82 5 3 5 fig 6d overall the changes of virus adsorption capacities of uv aged microplastics correlate with their changes in zeta potential the increases in the absolute zeta potential fig s7 result in increases in virus adsorption rate fig 6 c d and vice versa 3 8 infectivity of viruses after adsorption onto microplastics to evaluate whether the adsorption onto microplastics can prolong the virus infectivity or survival rate viruses were mixed with various microplastic types mp2 mp20 mp100 mp20 cooh and mp20 nh2 both original and uv aged and stored in the dark at 24 2 c or 30 c for up to 10 days the initial virus concentration 1 000 pfu μl was set as 100 of the fraction and the loss of plaque forming ability of viruses with time was then estimated by comparing it with the initial concentration of viruses based on the plaque assay results a significant difference in the survival rate of the virus could be detected after 3 days of inoculation for the control group without microplastics the survival percentages of the virus after 3 days of inoculation at 24 2 c and 30 c were 15 6 0 6 and 0 65 0 04 respectively in comparison the survival rates of the virus after being absorbed onto either the pristine or uv aged microplastics were significantly higher p adj 0 05 p adj 0 01 than the control group without microplastics under both 24 2 c and 30 c the survival rate of the virus was the highest 91 8 4 4 after being adsorbed onto the pristine mp2 under 24 2 c in addition the survival rates of the virus after being adsorbed onto the uv aged microplastics were significantly higher p adj 0 05 p adj 0 01 than those groups that were adsorbed onto the pristine microplastics regardless of the inoculation temperature fig 7a b the overall survival rate of the virus decreased with the prolonged inoculation time to 10 days to illustrate this under 24 2 c the survival rate of the virus without adsorption onto microplastics showed a constant decrease in 10 days and only 0 25 0 02 of the viruses still retained their infectivity after 10 days in comparison after being adsorbed onto the pristine microplastics the survival rate of the virus was much higher than the control group where a maximum of 65 9 1 9 of the viruses still retained their infectivity after being adsorbed onto mp2 fig 7c the aging of microplastics enhanced their protective effects on virus survival when comparing to the effects of pristine microplastics for example 16 4 0 5 of viruses still retained their infectivity after being adsorbed onto uv aged mp20 for 10 days fig 7d in contrast only 1 3 0 2 of viruses survived after being adsorbed onto the pristine mp20 fig 7c moreover under 30 c the survival rate of the virus showed a fast decrease trend with a 4 log reduction in the amount of infectious virus only after 6 days of inoculation fig 7e and f adsorption onto either the pristine or aged microplastic prolonged the survival of viruses for the virus after being adsorbed onto the pristine mp2 microplastics 26 8 1 2 still retained their infectivity after 10 days fig 7e for viruses being adsorbed onto uv aged mp20 0 8 0 1 of the viruses still retained their infectivity after 10 days while no virus could be detected after being adsorbed onto the pristine mp20 after 6 days fig 7f 4 discussion 4 1 mps are potential carriers of viruses through adsorption based on the vssc sybr green fluorescence double gated facs approach using the model virus the t4 phage we demonstrated that microplastics can significantly adsorb viruses and reach the maximum adsorption equivalent within 50 min at room temperature this maximum adsorption equivalent time conforms with the adsorption equivalent time of another e coli phage λ at 20 c where over 95 of the phage λ was adsorbed onto e coli after 40 min moldovan et al 2007 the maximum virus adsorption capacity in this study was lower than the reported phage λ adsorption capacity with high host e coli cell density this was because the microplastics used in this study did not have phage receptors and thus the binding was reversible therefore the adsorption of viruses onto microplastic is only a physical process without subsequent biological host recognition and irreversible binding dennehy and abedon 2020 consequently the adsorbed viruses started to desorb from the microplastic and become mobile again after exceeding the maximum adsorption equivalent time moldovan et al 2007 in addition since the detection of viruses using a flow cytometer was conducted on freshly prepared t4 phage after 50 min of the adsorption the decay of the virus is minimal given that the virus can survive for more than 10 days at room temperature fig 7c therefore the decay of the virus did not affect the results of flow cytometer detection the successful virus adsorption was further confirmed chemically via ftir spectra and optically via a confocal microscope based on the ftir spectra new peaks generated from proteins nucleic acids and carbohydrates were observed after mixing the microplastics with viruses confirming the adsorption of viruses onto microplastics in addition according to the images obtained from a confocal microscope the green fluorescence distribution on microplastic surfaces generated from stained viruses showed agglomerated and heterogeneous distribution patterns indicating that the adsorption of viruses on microplastics is an inhomogeneous process the kinetics and isotherms of the adsorption of viruses onto microplastics were mainly investigated by the experiments based on ultrapure water to exclude other parameters that might affect the results e g presence of natural organic matter presence of ions and differences in conductivity the adsorption kinetics is best explained by the pseudo second order model indicating the adsorption is due to physicochemical interactions between viruses and microplastics and limited by the free surface on the microplastic the adsorption isotherm is best explained by the khan adsorption isotherm model which is representing both langmuir and freundlich models al ghouti and da ana 2020 besides investigating the mechanism involved we further conducted the adsorption experiment in real freshwater to demonstrate such adsorption can happen in real environments where other interferences exist the lower virus adsorption rate in freshwater may be affected by the soil or dissolved organic matter in the freshwater to illustrate this dissolved organic carbon and soil were found to inhibit the adsorption of the human adenovirus to polypropene containers wong et al 2013 in addition dissolved humic acid and other soluble organic matters reduce the adsorption of ms 2 phage in sand columns due to the competition for adsorption sites cao et al 2010 zhuang and jin 2003 moreover hydraulic conductivity distribution enhances the transport of viruses torkzaban et al 2019 therefore the higher conductivity in freshwater 458 μs cm table s1 than in ultrapure water 0 055 µs cm might promote the movement of viruses since the virus adsorption on microplastics is reversible the enhanced virus movement in freshwater might lead to the desorption of viruses from microplastics thereby resulting in a lower virus adsorption rate in freshwater than in ultrapure water 4 2 concentration size and surface functional group dependent adsorption profiles the virus adsorption capacity was concentration size and surface functional group dependent overall microplastics with smaller sizes higher concentrations and modified with cooh surface functional groups were found to have a higher virus adsorption capacity virus adhesion to plastics and other abiotic surfaces is primarily associated with the virus surface electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic forces that surround them armanious et al 2016 dika et al 2015 dika et al 2013 our results also found that the virus adsorption capacities of microplastics were associated with the electrostatic properties of the microplastics as reflected by their zeta potential parameters to illustrate this all five microplastic types showed a negative zeta potential which is similar to the negative electrostatic properties of bacteria cell outer membrane generated from the carboxylate substituents and ionized phosphoryl wilson et al 2001 more evidently microplastics with smaller particle sizes and cooh group surface modification showed higher negative zeta potential levels which was correlated with their higher adsorption capacities of viruses the increase in net zeta potential has been shown to be associated with a higher adsorption affinity for minerals in uv irradiated microplastic lee and hur 2020 in contrast the decrease in net zeta potential could result in an inhibition of virus adsorption dika et al 2015 lastly all microplastics showed increases in negative zeta potential after adsorption which also has been found after the adsorption of coliphage ms 2 and bacteriophage prd 1 onto silica particles chen et al 2006 the increase in the absolute zeta potential of microplastics after virus adsorption is likely due to the orientation of t4 phages which have negatively charged capsids facing out and positively charged tail fibers facing towards the microplastic as confirmed by tem imaging fig s3 consequently the bipolarity of t4 phage particles accumulated more negative charges on the outer layer of the microplastics resulting in an increase of negative zeta potential in summary the zeta potential of microplastics is positively correlated to their virus adsorption capacity 4 3 aging of microplastics enhances virus adsorption in the environment plastic wastes are decomposed into microplastics under the effects of chemical and or physical aging barnes et al 2009 the aging of microplastics can significantly improve their adsorption capacities of environmental pollutants such as heavy metals mao et al 2020 organic contaminants such as triclosan wu et al 2020 pharmaceuticals liu et al 2020 and antibiotic resistant bacteria yuan et al 2022 our results also indicate that uv aging of microplastics can significantly enhance their virus adsorption capacities which might be associated with the changes in chemical physical properties caused by aging effects first and most importantly uv aging led to changes in the absolute zeta potential of aged microplastics which was correlated with the changes in virus adsorption capacities secondly uv aging was found to cause the breakdown of microplastics into smaller debris uv aging might enhance the virus adsorption affinity of microplastics by reducing the particle sizes of microplastics in contrast the virus adsorption and protection effects of mp2 decreased such a decrease in virus adsorption capacity is likely associated with the breakdown of mp2 into smaller nanoplastics fig s6 s7 with similar nanoscale sizes as the virus at the nanoscale the effects of brownian diffusion might have a strong impact on both the virus and the aged mp2 leading to the more frequent collision of these particles liu 2010 since the adsorption of viruses onto microplastics is only a reversible physical process driven by electrostatic force the frequent collision between viruses and the aged mp2 particles might lead to the desorption of viruses thus reducing the maximum virus adsorption rate thirdly the results showed that uv aging altered the shape of microplastics and roughen their surface while the increase in the degree of the surface roughness was found to be associated with the increased capacity of phage to adhere dika et al 2013 lastly the aging of microplastics might reduce the surface functional groups on microplastics mao et al 2020 wu et al 2020 which results in alterations in the virus adsorption affinity of microplastics due to altered electrostatic interaction in summary the aging of microplastics could enhance their virus adsorption capacity due to the changes in physicochemical properties of aged microplastics 4 4 adsorption of viruses onto microplastics prolongs virus survival the survivals of human pathogens are critical for the exposure and contamination on humans and processes such as the environmental transmission of viruses are involved a variety of viruses including hepatitis a sars cov 1 and sars cov 2 can survive on immobile plastic surfaces for days or even weeks rzezutka and cook 2004 sobsey et al 1987 moreover the survival of viruses was found to be increased after being adsorbed onto surfaces and soil particles hurst et al 1980 vasickova et al 2010 after desorption the adsorbed viral particles mostly remain infectious rzezutka and cook 2004 our results indicate that the adsorption onto microplastic significantly enhanced the survival of viruses and aged microplastics showed better protection of the viruses in comparison to pristine microplastics the survival of viruses in the environment could increase their risk of environmental transmission even capable of causing an outbreak colenutt et al 2020 therefore the findings of this research indicate that microplastics can be served as an alternative pathway for transmission of viral disease which might increase the risk of environmental dissemination of waterborne human pathogenic viruses 4 5 environmental implications the microplastics in the environment can be transmitted to humans through the ingestion of contaminated water or the consumption of contaminated aquatic livfe rist et al 2018 in particular plastic debris was detected in 33 of sampled shellfish rochman et al 2015 and up to 10 5 plastic particles could be detected in each gram of shellfish li et al 2015 it is estimated that a maximum annual amount of 11 000 microplastic particles can be taken up by each european shellfish consumer van cauwenberghe and janssen 2014 considering the common preparation method of shellfish is insufficient to inactivate the potential biological substances adsorbed on microplastics the consumption of shellfish containing biologically contaminated microplastics could be associated with food borne illnesses and outbreaks indeed 31 and 9 seafood borne outbreaks of norovirus and hepatitis a virus have been documented in the u s from 1973 to 2006 which accounted for 32 of the total seafood associated illnesses during that period iwamoto et al 2010 these viral contaminations of shellfish mostly occurred in areas contaminated with wastewater desenclos et al 1991 and the largest recorded outbreak infected almost 300 000 persons in china in 1988 potasman et al 2002 according to our findings in this study the virus microplastic electrostatic interactions are the primary factor affecting the adsorption of viruses onto microplastics given the prevalence of both microplastics sun et al 2019 and viruses corpuz et al 2020 in aquatic environments microplastics in the environment may be associated with the adsorption of a broad range of virus types for small particles such as viruses brownian motion is usually significant to maintain their dispersed phase in aquatic environments however the adsorption of viruses onto larger particles such as microplastics will promote the sedimentation of viruses together with the microplastics due to the effect of gravity kröger and vermant 2000 considering microplastics have been ubiquitously found in zoobenthos such as mussels oysters and scallops dawson et al 2021 the microplastic facilitated virus sedimentation will largely increase the likelihood of viruses migrating to zoobenthos moreover our results indicate that microplastics could significantly prolong the survival of viruses after adsorption even under elevated temperatures therefore microplastics may play important roles in water borne viral infections and outbreaks e g norovirus and hepatitis a virus in aquatic environments where the contamination of microplastics sun et al 2019 and viruses corpuz et al 2020 may co occur furthermore microplastic facilitated virus migration may also alter the fate and the spatial distribution of viruses in aquatic systems the movements of microplastics have been recorded across various aquatic environments li et al 2018 and microplastics were found even in the world s deepest oceanic trenches peng et al 2018 viruses may hitchhike on microplastics and retain their infectivity alongside their environmental migrations thereby expanding the environmental distribution of viruses and altering the intrinsic viral communities therefore when monitoring the virus in aquatic environments such as wastewater based epidemiology of sars cov 2 it is essential to consider the effects of microplastic adsorption and the subsequent virus protection on the fate of the virus 5 conclusions by using polystyrene microplastics as the carrier and the t4 phage as the virus model this study reported that microplastics can facilitate adsorption where these interactions can occur with viruses in freshwater environments investigating the mechanisms involved indicated that electrostatic interaction is the primary adsorption mechanism associated with virus adsorption onto microplastics this study also found that uv aging could enhance the virus adsorption capacity of microplastics and prolong the survival of viruses after being adsorbed onto microplastics even under elevated temperatures therefore the findings collectively suggest that as a type of emerging anthropogenic adsorbent microplastics are associated with the biological risks of water borne viral infections by facilitating the migration and survival of viruses in aquatic environments it is of both human and environmental health concerns to further evaluate the actual risk of virus transmission mediated by microplastics in aquatic environments such as in the downstream to wwtps where microplastics and viral pollutions coexist it is also necessary to take microplastic facilitated virus migration into account when conducting the modeling and evaluation of the viruses in aquatic environments such as wastewater based epidemiology

15423,microplastics are emerging contaminants in various aquatic environments leading to human and environmental health concerns viruses have also been ubiquitously detected in aquatic environments and there is an unknown risk of microplastics mediated virus migration through adsorption this study applied polystyrene microplastics as the carrier and the t4 bacteriophage or phage as the virus model and a violet side scatter green fluorescence double gated flow cytometry approach to investigate the adsorption capacity of viruses on microplastics our results show that up to 98 6 0 2 of the dosed viruses can be adsorbed by microplastics and such adsorptions are dependent on size and surface functional groups both fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and fluorescence labelled confocal microscopy confirmed that the virus can successfully adsorb onto microplastics zeta potential characterisation revealed that the electrostatic interaction is the primary adsorption mechanism associated with the adsorption of viruses uv aging was found to enhance the adsorption capacities of viruses on microplastics both pristine and uv aged microplastics were found to significantly prolong the infectivity of the adsorbed viruses even under elevated temperatures collectively our findings highlight that microplastics are associated with the biological risks of water borne viral transmission through virus adsorption graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polystyrene microplastic virus freshwater adsorption mechanism uv aging virus survival 1 introduction with the growing manufacturing and application of an estimated worldwide mass of 6 300 million metric tons in 2015 geyer et al 2017 plastics have been detected in global aquatic environments as weathered derivative debris of various chemical compositions and sizes with polyethylene polypropylene and polystyrene as the most commonly detected plastic types erni cassola et al 2019 xu et al 2020 among these various fragments of plastic contaminants there have been increasing public and regulatory concerns with microplastics diameter from 1 to 1 000 μm hartmann et al 2019 since microplastics have been increasingly detected in human bodies cox et al 2019 even in placenta ragusa et al 2021 and various ecosystems to illustrate this microplastics can be released to downstream aquatic environments from wastewater treatment plants wwtps after secondary treatment with a concentration of up to 447 microplastic particles per liter simon et al 2018 after entering aquatic environments microplastics can be bio accumulated in aquatic life rist et al 2018 moreover microplastics can be further transmitted to freshwaters and even to drinking water novotna et al 2019 hence there is a risk of the environmental transfer of microplastics to humans via consuming contaminated aquatic lives van cauwenberghe and janssen 2014 or contaminated water novotna et al 2019 the direct health risks of microplastics to humans are unresolved in addition to the direct risks microplastics can also pose risks to humans as vectors of various chemical and biological contaminants botterell et al 2019 jin et al 2021 mao et al 2020 perveen et al 2022 for chemical contaminants various chemicals such as heavy metals mao et al 2020 antibiotics perveen et al 2022 and persistent organic contaminants yu et al 2019 have been observed to adsorb onto microplastic vectors however the detected levels of chemical contaminants on microplastics brennecke et al 2016 yu et al 2019 are usually a logarithmic lower than the effective concentration thresholds e g the minimum selective pressure for antibiotics to select for antibiotic resistance khan et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 that can cause a noticeable adverse effect compared to chemical contaminants less focus has been placed on the potential of microplastics to adsorb biological contaminants a limited number of literature reported that various microorganisms including algae bacteria protozoa and fungi could rapidly colonise on microplastic surfaces upon the release of microplastic into the aquatic systems lobelle and cunliffe 2011 mammo et al 2020 it should be noticed that the minimum infective dose for some pathogens is very low 102 cfu of shigella to successfully cause infection yezli and otter 2011 and the microplastics associated biological contaminants can proliferate on microplastics or inside the host organism after being taken up together with microplastics guo et al 2020 lobelle and cunliffe 2011 therefore compared with chemical contaminants the biological substances adsorbed on microplastics might be of larger concern to the health of humans and animals viruses can be adsorbed onto abiotic surfaces armanious et al 2016 and soil wong et al 2013 which might further facilitate their transmission for example sars cov 2 can survive on polystyrene plastic for over 92 h with only a 1 log10 drop of infectivity pastorino et al 2020 such a prolonged virus survival mediates the transmission of sars cov 2 via inanimate objects onakpoya et al 2021 compared to the bulk plastic surface it is still unclear whether and how viruses can be adsorbed onto microplastic surfaces if microplastics can adsorb viruses whether such adsorption can promote the environmental transmission of viruses by prolonging their survival is also unknown wwtps simultaneously discharge a large quantity of microplastics sun et al 2019 and a diversity of viruses corpuz et al 2020 to downstream aquatic environments and the coexistence of microplastics rochman et al 2015 and human viruses iwamoto et al 2010 have been frequently detected in aquatic animals including shellfish hence a comprehensive investigation is needed to evaluate the potential of microplastics to adsorb viruses and mediate the environmental transmission of viruses this study aims to investigate the potential of microplastics to adsorb viruses and reveal the adsorption mechanism to investigate this escherichia coli bacteriophage t4 was selected as a model virus for microplastic models polyethylene and polypropylene have densities below 1 g cm3 and are buoyant in aquatic environments in contrast polystyrene has a density of 1 04 1 11 g cm3 and can be submerged and suspended in water environments duis and coors 2016 therefore polystyrene microplastics were selected as vectors to evaluate the contributions of size concentration of microplastics and surface functional groups on the adsorption of viruses a violet side scatter vssc sybr green fluorescence double gated fluorescence activated cell sorting facs approach based on size and green fluorescence was applied together with plaque assay to quantify the adsorption of viruses the adsorption of viruses was confirmed by fourier transform infra red ftir spectroscopy analysis and confocal microscopy imaging the virus adsorption kinetics and isotherms were estimated and the adsorption mechanism was investigated by measuring the zeta potential the aging of microplastics was conducted by uv treatments and the virus adsorption capacity of aged microplastics was compared with pristine microplastics the survival of viruses being adsorbed onto microplastics was also evaluated under different temperatures 2 materials and methods 2 1 microplastics viruses and plaque assay in order to investigate whether and how microplastics are environmental carriers of viruses through adsorption this study used polystyrene microplastics as vectors to evaluate the potential of microplastics to carry viruses spherical shaped polystyrene microplastics with various sizes in diameter 2 μm namely mp2 20 μm namely mp20 and 100 μm namely mp100 and surface functional group modification both of 20 μm in diameter cooh namely mp20 cooh and nh2 namely mp20 nh2 were commercially purchased dongguan zhongzheng plastic china microplastics were suspended in milli q water 18 2 mω cm 1 and sonicated at 80 j for 5 min with alternating pulses and pauses of equal duration every second branson sonifier 450 to achieve a homogeneous suspension phase before each experiment escherichia coli bacteriophage phage t4 was purchased from american type culture collection atcc 11303 b4 as the target virus and e coli k 12 mg1655 was purchased from atcc 700926 as the bacterial host to enrich t4 phage e coli was grown in luria bertani lb broth at 37 c to reach a mid exponential growing phase od600 0 2 0 3 t4 phages with the multiplicity of infection of 1 were added to the e coli host and further incubated for 5 h at 37 c until clear lysate occurred then the t4 phages were separated from the e coli host by ultra centrifugation at 12 000 g for 10 min at 4 c and further purified by membrane filtration 0 22 μm sterivex afterward a plaque assay using a double layer agar plate method was used to assess the virus titer of the purified t4 phage suspensions bonilla et al 2016 2 2 batch adsorption desorption experiments and virus quantification by using a flow cytometer the adsorption of viruses onto microplastics was measured indirectly by quantifying the un adsorbed viruses in the experimental groups briefly t4 phage as the virus model was freshly prepared and diluted into desired concentrations the viruses were then equally divided into two groups into sealed static electricity neutralised 2 ml glass vials with one group without microplastic treatment and the other group added with microplastics ranging from 0 001 to 100 mg l to conduct the adsorption experiments for various durations at the end of the adsorption experiment 1 ml of the adsorption mixture was transferred to a 1 5 ml centrifuge tube and microplastics were precipitated by 12 000 g centrifuge at room temperature for 10 min to separate with the un adsorbed viruses and subjected to the quantification of the un adsorbed virus by plaque assay or flow cytometer detection fig 1a to calculate the adsorption rate of viruses the non microplastic added group was set as the control the treated groups were dosed with various types and concentrations of microplastics the percentage of adsorbed viruses was calculated by using the following equation 1 adsorption c c c t c c 100 where cc and ct are the concentrations of viruses with and without microplastic dosage at sampling time respectively to further validate the accuracy of the indirect quantification of virus adsorption rate by measuring the un adsorbed viruses desorption experiments were conducted to close the total quantity balance of adsorbed and un adsorbed viruses for the desorption experiment the precipitants from the previous step were resuspended in a final tween 80 concentration of 1 w v and sonicated for 10 min to desorb viruses followed by a high speed centrifuge to remove microplastics the desorption experiments were repeated 3 times to achieve maximum desorption of viruses fig 1a to quantify the virus a vssc sybr green fluorescence double gated facs approach was applied to detect virus particles based on both size 100 200 nm in length and green fluorescence from stained nucleic acids such a method can increase the detection resolution of the flow cytometer for small particles 500 nm while excluding the optical and electronic background generated by nucleic acids free unstained particles brittain et al 2019 in brief the collected viruses were stained with sybr green at 0 1 μm final concentration for 15 min at 80 c this was further validated by the double gated facs detection method and was analysed using a cytoflex flow cytometer beckman usa equipped with violet 405 nm and blue 488 nm laser excitation sources fig 1a the cytoflex flow cytometer was first calibrated using the 130 nm fluorescent megamix fs microbeads fig s1 beads emitting a fitc like fluorescent light at the size of 130 nm in diameter was used throughout all experiments to establish the best photodiode gains for fitc and vssc the gating windows obtained from the calibration using 130 nm fluorescent megamix fs microbeads were applied to distinguish the non virus containing background fig 1b and the virus particles fig 1c all signals were collected in log area mode with biological replicates n 3 afterward the accuracy of facs detection was further validated by comparing the facs results with the culture based plaque assay results the equilibrium time of the adsorption of viruses was evaluated by a time course experiment to illustrate 5 106 pfu ml viruses were divided into two groups with one group as untreated control and another group was added with mp20 cooh at a final concentration of 100 mg l then the adsorption rate of viruses was measured in a time course manner for 24 h with sampling time at various durations 0 10 min 20 min 30 min 40 min 50 min 1 h 2 h 4 h 8 h and 24 h after determining the maximum adsorption equilibrium time of viruses 50 min fig 1d further adsorption experiments were conducted for 50 min and facs detection was immediately conducted after reaching the maximum adsorption equilibrium time virus adsorption experiments were conducted with 1 000 pfu μl virus concentration and mixed with various microplastics types mp2 mp20 mp100 mp20 cooh and mp20 nh2 either pristine or uv aged at 100 mg l to investigate the parameters of microplastics that affect the virus adsorption with the non microplastic treated group as a control each experiment was conducted with biological triplicates at least n 3 2 3 ftir spectroscopy analysis the adsorption of viruses onto microplastics was confirmed chemically through the fourier transform infra red ftir spectroscopy analysis of the chemical composition of the microplastics before and after the adsorption of viruses by using a fourier transform infrared spectrometer tensor 27 bruker billerica the us the attenuated total reflection mode with a wavenumber in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 and step size of 2 cm 1 was used chemical bonding information of various microplastics before viruses adsorption was compared to those after viruses adsorption in addition ftir analysis was also conducted on uv aged microplastics to evaluate the changes in chemical properties of aged microplastics 2 4 assessment of virus adsorption and uv aging via confocal microscopy the size and morphology of various microplastics before and after phage adsorption or uv aging were determined by the conventional wide field fluorescence microscopy imaging on an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope zeiss lsm 710 axioobserver plan apochromat 40 1 4 oil dic m27 objective and 3 channel quasa spectral pmt array was equipped confocal microscope and zen2 3 software was used for image acquisition the acquisition was set up with 0 39 µs pixel time of green fluorescence at 488 nm excitation wavelength using a fluo led spectra x light source the images of viruses only microplastics only and microplastics adsorbed with viruses were taken with 1024 1024 pixels 2 5 transmission electron microscope imaging of virus after adsorption onto microplastics the orientations of the phage after adsorption onto the microplastics were analyzed under a jem 1010 transmission electron microscope jeol usa at 80 kv according to a previously described method lu et al 2020 which can also be found in supporting methods in si 2 6 microplastics size and zeta potentials analyses measurements of the size distribution of mp2 before and after uv aging and zeta potential of various polystyrene microplastics before and after virus adsorption or before and after uv aging were conducted using a zetasizer nano zsp laser particle analyzer malvern instruments ltd malvern the uk at 25 c at a 173 scattering angle with 4 mw he ne laser mps samples were prepared in 100 mg l concentration as stated in section 2 1 with sonication branson sonifier 450 and placed in standard malvern zeta potential disposable capillary cells and polystyrene cuvettes malvern instruments ltd malvern the uk for zeta potential and size measurements respectively all measurements were repeated at least three times 2 7 virus adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm in different water matrices the adsorption kinetics of viruses onto microplastics were estimated by fitting the experimental data to the pseudo first order model pseudo second order model elovich model and weber morris model until reaching the maximum adsorption equilibrium time 50 min the equations of all models can be found in supporting information the data best fit the pseudo second order model after evaluation table s2 therefore pseudo second order model 2 has been applied to investigate the adsorption kinetic of viruses onto microplastics 2 q t t 1 k 2 q 2 2 t q 2 where qt represents the detected amount of viruses adsorbed on microplastics at time t pfu mg q 2 mg g are the estimated adsorption capacities by the models k 2 g mg 1 min 1 corresponds to the kinetic constant t is the contact time min respectively virus adsorption was conducted in different water matrices milliq water and freshwater to evaluate the adsorption isotherm and to investigate the influence of the physicochemical properties of the water matrix on the adsorption of viruses for adsorption experiments of the viruses on microplastics in freshwater freshwater samples were collected in the pine river area brisbane queensland australia august 2021 27 353923 152 948871 into a glass container and were sterile filtered 0 22 μm sterivex to remove microorganisms and large particles from the sample viruses and microplastics were then suspended and mixed in the filtered fresh water to conduct the adsorption experiments the physicochemical properties of the freshwater matrix have been analysed and shown in table s1 the adsorption isotherms of viruses onto microplastics were estimated by fitting the experimental data to the langmuir henry temkin sips toth koble corrigan khan and fritz schluender adsorption isotherm models the equations of all models can be found in supporting information the data best fit the khan model after evaluation table s3 therefore khan isotherm model 3 has been applied to investigate the adsorption kinetic of viruses onto microplastics 3 q e q m k c e 1 k c e n where qe represents the detected amount of viruses adsorbed on microplastics at equilibrium pfu μg c e is the equilibrium concentration of viruses in the adsorption mixture pfu μl k is the isotherm constant and n represents the khan model exponent 2 8 microplastics uv aging treatment to obtain aged microplastics by mimicking uv irradiation microplastics of various types mp2 mp20 mp100 mp20 cooh and mp20 nh2 were placed in glass petri dishes uv aging experiments were performed using a xenon lamp 300 w equipped with an oriel cornerstone 260 1 4 m monochromator with intensity regulated using and sunlight filter to adjust the emission range between 320 and 420 nm irradiation was conducted at 24 2 c with an intensity of 500 w m2 for 28 days according to a previous publication mao et al 2020 2 9 stability of viruses adsorbed on microplastics the stability of the viruses after being adsorbed onto various microplastics was determined by incubating mixtures of viruses and microplastics at different temperatures 22 3 c and 30 c for 10 days firstly t4 phage was amplified using e coli strain as described in section 2 1 and diluted in milli q water to obtain an approximate concentration of 106 pfu ml then various microplastic types mp2 mp20 mp100 mp20 cooh and mp20 nh2 both original and uv aged were mixed with viruses to obtain a final microplastic concentration of 100 mg l with virus alone as the control group aliquots were stored in the dark at 24 2 c or 30 c for up to 10 days after 3 6 and 10 days aliquots were enumerated by using a plaque assay all experiments were conducted with biological triplicates 2 10 statistical analysis data analysis was used by spss 27 0 ibm armonk usa significant differences were performed by analysis of variance anova p values were corrected using the bonferroni correction vizcaíno et al 2016 and presented as padj a value of padj 0 05 was considered significant data were expressed as mean standard deviation 3 results 3 1 facs determination of virus adsorption the detection of viruses was conducted by a double gated facs detection method fig 1 which was further validated by plaque assay the results from the facs detection 3798 78 event μl were similar padj 0 05 to the values obtained from plaque assay 3912 110 event μl indicating the accuracy of facs detection the accuracy of indirect quantification on the adsorption of viruses was further validated by closing the total quantity balance of adsorbed and un adsorbed viruses after repeating the desorption process three times the total number of viruses quantified by such a method accounted for 99 6 0 2 of the total dosed viruses therefore the closed quantity balance further validated the double gated facs detection method the maximum adsorption equilibrium was attained at 50 min when a maximum of 15 6 of the total viruses were adsorbed onto the microplastics the adsorption rate of viruses started to decrease from 1 h indicating potential virus desorption after reaching adsorption equilibrium fig 1d 3 2 changes in ftir spectra with virus adsorption to confirm the adsorption of viruses onto microplastics the chemical properties of microplastic surfaces before and after adsorption were evaluated by comparing the ftir spectra firstly the ftir spectra of the five types of microplastics used in this study were measured before adsorption overall all five types of microplastics shared several conservative peaks in their ftir spectra at 690 720 cm 1 760 780 cm 1 1480 1500 cm 1 2850 2920 cm 1 and 3020 3030 cm 1 which have been observed among polystyrene microplastics fig s2 particularly the ftir spectrum of mp20 cooh showed unique absorption peaks in oxygen containing functional groups at 1720 cm 1 co and 3000 cm 1 oh which correspond to co and oh vibration stretches respectively similarly the ftir spectrum of mp20 nh2 also showed unique absorption peaks at 1650 1580 cm 1 and 3500 cm 1 indicating nh bending and stretching fig s2 the ftir spectra of microplastics were altered after the viruses were adsorbed suggesting that viruses can successfully adsorb onto microplastics compared with microplastics before adsorption more peaks at 1650 cm 1 or higher absorption intensity around 3000 2800 cm 1 were observed in ftir spectra of microplastics after adsorption fig 2a the vibrations around 3000 2800 cm 1 are assigned to the stretching of ch2 group which could be contributed by virus nucleic acids winder and goodacre 2004 in addition the peak at 1650 cm 1 was attributed to the cn stretching the region around 1700 1500 cm 1 is mainly derived from proteins and the bands from 1450 to 1200 cm 1 are due to the combination of free amino acids carboxylic groups of proteins and polysaccharides in addition to proteins and nucleic acids carbohydrates were also present with a typical region of 1200 900 cm 1 wavenumber therefore successful adsorption of viruses onto microplastics can be chemically confirmed by the alteration of ftir spectra 3 3 validation of virus adsorption by confocal microscopy to further confirm the adsorption of viruses onto microplastics by an optical approach images of microplastics before and after the adsorption of viruses were obtained from a confocal microscope microplastics alone did not show any green fluorescence due to the lack of lipid or nucleic acid content therefore they could not be stained with sybr fig 2b in contrast after the adsorption of viruses strong green fluorescences could be observed at the edge surface of the microplastic indicating the successful adsorption of multiple viruses onto the surface of the microplastic fig 2c moreover the asymmetrical distribution of green fluorescence signals demonstrated that the adsorption of viruses onto microplastics is not a homogenous process overall the successful adsorption of viruses onto microplastics was optically confirmed by a confocal microscope 3 4 effects of concentration size and functional groups of microplastics on the adsorption of viruses the influence of the physicochemical properties of microplastics on the adsorption of viruses was investigated on various microplastic types firstly virus adsorption onto microplastics is dependent on the concentration of microplastic no virus adsorption was detected at 0 001 mg l mp2 whereas when the adsorption of viruses started at 0 01 mg l mp2 5 6 3 4 the adsorption rate was significantly higher padj 0 05 from 0 1 mg l mp2 then the adsorption rate increased with increasing microplastics concentration and maximized at 100 mg l mp2 98 6 0 2 padj 0 01 fig 3a secondly virus adsorption onto microplastics is dependent on the size of the microplastic to illustrate this viruses at a concentration of 1 000 pfu μl were mixed with microplastics of different sizes 2 20 and 100 μm in diameter at 100 mg l the adsorption rates at adsorption equilibrium time were 98 6 0 2 padj 0 01 for 100 mg l mp2 83 6 0 8 padj 0 01 for 100 mg l mp20 and 73 7 2 1 padj 0 01 for 100 mg l mp100 overall virus adsorption rates decreased with increasing microplastic size fig 3b lastly the modification of functional groups on the microplastic surface affects the adsorption of viruses after mixing a concentration of 1000 pfu μl viruses with similarly sized 20 μm in diameter microplastics with different surface functional group modifications at 100 mg l the adsorption rate at adsorption equilibrium time was the highest 94 3 0 8 padj 0 01 for 100 mg l mp20 cooh in contrast the adsorption rate was 83 6 0 8 padj 0 01 for 100 mg l mp20 and it was the lowest 51 4 12 5 padj 0 01 for 100 mg l mp20 nh2 fig 3c 3 5 zeta potentials affect virus adsorption as the primary factor affecting the particle s adsorption capacity via electrostatic attraction zeta potential indicates the electrical potential exhibited by any particles savaji et al 2014 the negative zeta potential values of microplastics affected their virus adsorption capacity to illustrate this all five microplastic types showed negative zeta potential with decreasing microplastic sizes from 100 to 2 μm their net zeta potential values of microplastics increased fig 4a which was associated with an increased adsorption rate of viruses on smaller sized microplastics fig 3b in addition the absolute zeta potential values of microplastics with different functional groups modification were also correlated to their virus adsorption rate the microplastic type mp20 cooh that has the highest absolute zeta potential value also expressed the highest virus adsorption rate conversely mp20 nh2 has both the lowest absolute zeta potential and virus adsorption rate figs 4b and 3c moreover after virus adsorption all five types of microplastic showed an increase in absolute zeta potential fig 4 tem imaging demonstrated the orientation of t4 phages after being adsorbed onto microplastics with negatively charged capsids facing out and positively charged tail fibers facing towards the microplastic fig s3 which might be one of the causes of the increased overall absolute zeta potential after virus adsorption 3 6 virus adsorption kinetics in milli q water and freshwater to investigate virus adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherms adsorption equilibrium experiments were conducted by mixing viruses with mp2 at different ratios the adsorption kinetics of viruses onto microplastics in milli q water reaching the maximum adsorption equilibrium time 50 min have been fitted to the pseudo first order model pseudo second order model elovich and weber morris models fig s4 among all models pseudo second order model had the highest r 2 value r 2 0 96 table s2 suggesting that the adsorption kinetics of viruses onto microplastics in milli q water is best explained by the pseudo second order model the adsorption isotherms of viruses onto microplastics in milli q water at adsorption equilibrium time were estimated by fitting the experimental results to the langmuir freundlich henry temkin sips toth koble corrigan khan and fritz schluender adsorption isotherm models the r2 values of all the models except the henry model were high r 2 0 95 suggesting that the adsorption behaviors of viruses onto microplastics in milli q water can be explained by these adsorption isotherm models fig s5 nevertheless the khan adsorption isotherm model r 2 0 99 was the best fit to illustrate the virus adsorption behaviors in comparison to the other models table s3 the maximum adsorption capacity qmax of the viruses onto microplastics according to the khan adsorption isotherm model was 61 4 viruses per microgram of microplastics afterward the khan adsorption isotherm model was used to fit the parameters of the experimental results of virus adsorption onto mp2 in milli q water fig 5a and freshwater fig 5b respectively 3 7 effect of aging of microplastics on adsorption of viruses to investigate whether the aging of microplastics can affect their capabilities to adsorb viruses uv aged microplastics were prepared by a 28 day uv treatment to mimic the effect of natural uv irradiation the aging effect of uv treatment on the size and morphology of microplastics was investigated by confocal microscopy imaging fig 6a b and fig s6 before the uv treatment the pristine microplastics had smooth spherical shapes and sizes as indicated by the manufacturer fig 6a and fig s6a d after 28 day uv treatment the surfaces of the aged microplastics became rough their shapes became irregular and even started to break down into smaller microplastics and generated debris fig 6b fig s6e h most evidently the average size of 2 μm microplastic also reduced from 2 μm to less than 1 μm after uv aging fig s7 in addition uv aging significantly reduced the absolute zeta potential of mp2 and mp20 cooh while significantly increased the absolute zeta potential of mp100 and mp20 nh2 fig s8 such a reduction in zeta potential might be correlated with the changes in the surface chemistry of the microplastics after aging to illustrate this the co stretching peaks around 1715 could be found in both pristine and aged mp20 mp20 cooh and mp20 nh2 and aged mp100 fig s9b e but not in pristine or aged mp2 fig s9a compared with the pristine microplastics the adsorption of co stretching peaks increased for the uv aged mp20 mp20 nh2 and mp100 which indicated more carbonyl functional groups might have formed in those aged microplastics in contrast the adsorption of co stretching peaks reduced for the uv aged mp20 cooh likely indicating the corrosion of the microplastic surfaces and the consequent loss of the cooh surface chemical modification fig s9c more evidently the absolute zeta potential of uv aged mp20 cooh also decreased fig s8 which further suggested a loss of the negatively charged cooh functional group after aging the uv aging of microplastics enhanced the adsorption of viruses in terms of microplastics with various sizes aging of the microplastics with sizes 20 μm in diameter significantly padj 0 01 enhanced their virus adsorption capacities from 83 6 0 8 to 91 6 0 9 for 100 mg l mp20 and from 73 7 2 1 to 92 11 for 100 mg l mp100 respectively fig 6c in contrast uv aging significantly padj 0 01 decreased the virus adsorption capacities of 100 mg l mp2 from 98 6 0 2 to 91 0 0 6 fig 6c in terms of microplastics with different functional groups aging of the microplastics with nh2 groups modified significantly padj 0 01 enhanced its virus adsorption capacities from 51 4 12 5 to 75 1 5 7 in comparison uv aging significantly padj 0 01 decreased the virus adsorption capacities of 100 mg l mp20 cooh from 94 3 0 8 to 82 5 3 5 fig 6d overall the changes of virus adsorption capacities of uv aged microplastics correlate with their changes in zeta potential the increases in the absolute zeta potential fig s7 result in increases in virus adsorption rate fig 6 c d and vice versa 3 8 infectivity of viruses after adsorption onto microplastics to evaluate whether the adsorption onto microplastics can prolong the virus infectivity or survival rate viruses were mixed with various microplastic types mp2 mp20 mp100 mp20 cooh and mp20 nh2 both original and uv aged and stored in the dark at 24 2 c or 30 c for up to 10 days the initial virus concentration 1 000 pfu μl was set as 100 of the fraction and the loss of plaque forming ability of viruses with time was then estimated by comparing it with the initial concentration of viruses based on the plaque assay results a significant difference in the survival rate of the virus could be detected after 3 days of inoculation for the control group without microplastics the survival percentages of the virus after 3 days of inoculation at 24 2 c and 30 c were 15 6 0 6 and 0 65 0 04 respectively in comparison the survival rates of the virus after being absorbed onto either the pristine or uv aged microplastics were significantly higher p adj 0 05 p adj 0 01 than the control group without microplastics under both 24 2 c and 30 c the survival rate of the virus was the highest 91 8 4 4 after being adsorbed onto the pristine mp2 under 24 2 c in addition the survival rates of the virus after being adsorbed onto the uv aged microplastics were significantly higher p adj 0 05 p adj 0 01 than those groups that were adsorbed onto the pristine microplastics regardless of the inoculation temperature fig 7a b the overall survival rate of the virus decreased with the prolonged inoculation time to 10 days to illustrate this under 24 2 c the survival rate of the virus without adsorption onto microplastics showed a constant decrease in 10 days and only 0 25 0 02 of the viruses still retained their infectivity after 10 days in comparison after being adsorbed onto the pristine microplastics the survival rate of the virus was much higher than the control group where a maximum of 65 9 1 9 of the viruses still retained their infectivity after being adsorbed onto mp2 fig 7c the aging of microplastics enhanced their protective effects on virus survival when comparing to the effects of pristine microplastics for example 16 4 0 5 of viruses still retained their infectivity after being adsorbed onto uv aged mp20 for 10 days fig 7d in contrast only 1 3 0 2 of viruses survived after being adsorbed onto the pristine mp20 fig 7c moreover under 30 c the survival rate of the virus showed a fast decrease trend with a 4 log reduction in the amount of infectious virus only after 6 days of inoculation fig 7e and f adsorption onto either the pristine or aged microplastic prolonged the survival of viruses for the virus after being adsorbed onto the pristine mp2 microplastics 26 8 1 2 still retained their infectivity after 10 days fig 7e for viruses being adsorbed onto uv aged mp20 0 8 0 1 of the viruses still retained their infectivity after 10 days while no virus could be detected after being adsorbed onto the pristine mp20 after 6 days fig 7f 4 discussion 4 1 mps are potential carriers of viruses through adsorption based on the vssc sybr green fluorescence double gated facs approach using the model virus the t4 phage we demonstrated that microplastics can significantly adsorb viruses and reach the maximum adsorption equivalent within 50 min at room temperature this maximum adsorption equivalent time conforms with the adsorption equivalent time of another e coli phage λ at 20 c where over 95 of the phage λ was adsorbed onto e coli after 40 min moldovan et al 2007 the maximum virus adsorption capacity in this study was lower than the reported phage λ adsorption capacity with high host e coli cell density this was because the microplastics used in this study did not have phage receptors and thus the binding was reversible therefore the adsorption of viruses onto microplastic is only a physical process without subsequent biological host recognition and irreversible binding dennehy and abedon 2020 consequently the adsorbed viruses started to desorb from the microplastic and become mobile again after exceeding the maximum adsorption equivalent time moldovan et al 2007 in addition since the detection of viruses using a flow cytometer was conducted on freshly prepared t4 phage after 50 min of the adsorption the decay of the virus is minimal given that the virus can survive for more than 10 days at room temperature fig 7c therefore the decay of the virus did not affect the results of flow cytometer detection the successful virus adsorption was further confirmed chemically via ftir spectra and optically via a confocal microscope based on the ftir spectra new peaks generated from proteins nucleic acids and carbohydrates were observed after mixing the microplastics with viruses confirming the adsorption of viruses onto microplastics in addition according to the images obtained from a confocal microscope the green fluorescence distribution on microplastic surfaces generated from stained viruses showed agglomerated and heterogeneous distribution patterns indicating that the adsorption of viruses on microplastics is an inhomogeneous process the kinetics and isotherms of the adsorption of viruses onto microplastics were mainly investigated by the experiments based on ultrapure water to exclude other parameters that might affect the results e g presence of natural organic matter presence of ions and differences in conductivity the adsorption kinetics is best explained by the pseudo second order model indicating the adsorption is due to physicochemical interactions between viruses and microplastics and limited by the free surface on the microplastic the adsorption isotherm is best explained by the khan adsorption isotherm model which is representing both langmuir and freundlich models al ghouti and da ana 2020 besides investigating the mechanism involved we further conducted the adsorption experiment in real freshwater to demonstrate such adsorption can happen in real environments where other interferences exist the lower virus adsorption rate in freshwater may be affected by the soil or dissolved organic matter in the freshwater to illustrate this dissolved organic carbon and soil were found to inhibit the adsorption of the human adenovirus to polypropene containers wong et al 2013 in addition dissolved humic acid and other soluble organic matters reduce the adsorption of ms 2 phage in sand columns due to the competition for adsorption sites cao et al 2010 zhuang and jin 2003 moreover hydraulic conductivity distribution enhances the transport of viruses torkzaban et al 2019 therefore the higher conductivity in freshwater 458 μs cm table s1 than in ultrapure water 0 055 µs cm might promote the movement of viruses since the virus adsorption on microplastics is reversible the enhanced virus movement in freshwater might lead to the desorption of viruses from microplastics thereby resulting in a lower virus adsorption rate in freshwater than in ultrapure water 4 2 concentration size and surface functional group dependent adsorption profiles the virus adsorption capacity was concentration size and surface functional group dependent overall microplastics with smaller sizes higher concentrations and modified with cooh surface functional groups were found to have a higher virus adsorption capacity virus adhesion to plastics and other abiotic surfaces is primarily associated with the virus surface electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic forces that surround them armanious et al 2016 dika et al 2015 dika et al 2013 our results also found that the virus adsorption capacities of microplastics were associated with the electrostatic properties of the microplastics as reflected by their zeta potential parameters to illustrate this all five microplastic types showed a negative zeta potential which is similar to the negative electrostatic properties of bacteria cell outer membrane generated from the carboxylate substituents and ionized phosphoryl wilson et al 2001 more evidently microplastics with smaller particle sizes and cooh group surface modification showed higher negative zeta potential levels which was correlated with their higher adsorption capacities of viruses the increase in net zeta potential has been shown to be associated with a higher adsorption affinity for minerals in uv irradiated microplastic lee and hur 2020 in contrast the decrease in net zeta potential could result in an inhibition of virus adsorption dika et al 2015 lastly all microplastics showed increases in negative zeta potential after adsorption which also has been found after the adsorption of coliphage ms 2 and bacteriophage prd 1 onto silica particles chen et al 2006 the increase in the absolute zeta potential of microplastics after virus adsorption is likely due to the orientation of t4 phages which have negatively charged capsids facing out and positively charged tail fibers facing towards the microplastic as confirmed by tem imaging fig s3 consequently the bipolarity of t4 phage particles accumulated more negative charges on the outer layer of the microplastics resulting in an increase of negative zeta potential in summary the zeta potential of microplastics is positively correlated to their virus adsorption capacity 4 3 aging of microplastics enhances virus adsorption in the environment plastic wastes are decomposed into microplastics under the effects of chemical and or physical aging barnes et al 2009 the aging of microplastics can significantly improve their adsorption capacities of environmental pollutants such as heavy metals mao et al 2020 organic contaminants such as triclosan wu et al 2020 pharmaceuticals liu et al 2020 and antibiotic resistant bacteria yuan et al 2022 our results also indicate that uv aging of microplastics can significantly enhance their virus adsorption capacities which might be associated with the changes in chemical physical properties caused by aging effects first and most importantly uv aging led to changes in the absolute zeta potential of aged microplastics which was correlated with the changes in virus adsorption capacities secondly uv aging was found to cause the breakdown of microplastics into smaller debris uv aging might enhance the virus adsorption affinity of microplastics by reducing the particle sizes of microplastics in contrast the virus adsorption and protection effects of mp2 decreased such a decrease in virus adsorption capacity is likely associated with the breakdown of mp2 into smaller nanoplastics fig s6 s7 with similar nanoscale sizes as the virus at the nanoscale the effects of brownian diffusion might have a strong impact on both the virus and the aged mp2 leading to the more frequent collision of these particles liu 2010 since the adsorption of viruses onto microplastics is only a reversible physical process driven by electrostatic force the frequent collision between viruses and the aged mp2 particles might lead to the desorption of viruses thus reducing the maximum virus adsorption rate thirdly the results showed that uv aging altered the shape of microplastics and roughen their surface while the increase in the degree of the surface roughness was found to be associated with the increased capacity of phage to adhere dika et al 2013 lastly the aging of microplastics might reduce the surface functional groups on microplastics mao et al 2020 wu et al 2020 which results in alterations in the virus adsorption affinity of microplastics due to altered electrostatic interaction in summary the aging of microplastics could enhance their virus adsorption capacity due to the changes in physicochemical properties of aged microplastics 4 4 adsorption of viruses onto microplastics prolongs virus survival the survivals of human pathogens are critical for the exposure and contamination on humans and processes such as the environmental transmission of viruses are involved a variety of viruses including hepatitis a sars cov 1 and sars cov 2 can survive on immobile plastic surfaces for days or even weeks rzezutka and cook 2004 sobsey et al 1987 moreover the survival of viruses was found to be increased after being adsorbed onto surfaces and soil particles hurst et al 1980 vasickova et al 2010 after desorption the adsorbed viral particles mostly remain infectious rzezutka and cook 2004 our results indicate that the adsorption onto microplastic significantly enhanced the survival of viruses and aged microplastics showed better protection of the viruses in comparison to pristine microplastics the survival of viruses in the environment could increase their risk of environmental transmission even capable of causing an outbreak colenutt et al 2020 therefore the findings of this research indicate that microplastics can be served as an alternative pathway for transmission of viral disease which might increase the risk of environmental dissemination of waterborne human pathogenic viruses 4 5 environmental implications the microplastics in the environment can be transmitted to humans through the ingestion of contaminated water or the consumption of contaminated aquatic livfe rist et al 2018 in particular plastic debris was detected in 33 of sampled shellfish rochman et al 2015 and up to 10 5 plastic particles could be detected in each gram of shellfish li et al 2015 it is estimated that a maximum annual amount of 11 000 microplastic particles can be taken up by each european shellfish consumer van cauwenberghe and janssen 2014 considering the common preparation method of shellfish is insufficient to inactivate the potential biological substances adsorbed on microplastics the consumption of shellfish containing biologically contaminated microplastics could be associated with food borne illnesses and outbreaks indeed 31 and 9 seafood borne outbreaks of norovirus and hepatitis a virus have been documented in the u s from 1973 to 2006 which accounted for 32 of the total seafood associated illnesses during that period iwamoto et al 2010 these viral contaminations of shellfish mostly occurred in areas contaminated with wastewater desenclos et al 1991 and the largest recorded outbreak infected almost 300 000 persons in china in 1988 potasman et al 2002 according to our findings in this study the virus microplastic electrostatic interactions are the primary factor affecting the adsorption of viruses onto microplastics given the prevalence of both microplastics sun et al 2019 and viruses corpuz et al 2020 in aquatic environments microplastics in the environment may be associated with the adsorption of a broad range of virus types for small particles such as viruses brownian motion is usually significant to maintain their dispersed phase in aquatic environments however the adsorption of viruses onto larger particles such as microplastics will promote the sedimentation of viruses together with the microplastics due to the effect of gravity kröger and vermant 2000 considering microplastics have been ubiquitously found in zoobenthos such as mussels oysters and scallops dawson et al 2021 the microplastic facilitated virus sedimentation will largely increase the likelihood of viruses migrating to zoobenthos moreover our results indicate that microplastics could significantly prolong the survival of viruses after adsorption even under elevated temperatures therefore microplastics may play important roles in water borne viral infections and outbreaks e g norovirus and hepatitis a virus in aquatic environments where the contamination of microplastics sun et al 2019 and viruses corpuz et al 2020 may co occur furthermore microplastic facilitated virus migration may also alter the fate and the spatial distribution of viruses in aquatic systems the movements of microplastics have been recorded across various aquatic environments li et al 2018 and microplastics were found even in the world s deepest oceanic trenches peng et al 2018 viruses may hitchhike on microplastics and retain their infectivity alongside their environmental migrations thereby expanding the environmental distribution of viruses and altering the intrinsic viral communities therefore when monitoring the virus in aquatic environments such as wastewater based epidemiology of sars cov 2 it is essential to consider the effects of microplastic adsorption and the subsequent virus protection on the fate of the virus 5 conclusions by using polystyrene microplastics as the carrier and the t4 phage as the virus model this study reported that microplastics can facilitate adsorption where these interactions can occur with viruses in freshwater environments investigating the mechanisms involved indicated that electrostatic interaction is the primary adsorption mechanism associated with virus adsorption onto microplastics this study also found that uv aging could enhance the virus adsorption capacity of microplastics and prolong the survival of viruses after being adsorbed onto microplastics even under elevated temperatures therefore the findings collectively suggest that as a type of emerging anthropogenic adsorbent microplastics are associated with the biological risks of water borne viral infections by facilitating the migration and survival of viruses in aquatic environments it is of both human and environmental health concerns to further evaluate the actual risk of virus transmission mediated by microplastics in aquatic environments such as in the downstream to wwtps where microplastics and viral pollutions coexist it is also necessary to take microplastic facilitated virus migration into account when conducting the modeling and evaluation of the viruses in aquatic environments such as wastewater based epidemiology

15424,the deterioration in the water quality of urban water bodies through plastic contamination is emerging as a matter of serious concern microplastics mps and nanoplastics nps both affect the growth and productivity of aquatic flora however there have been a lot of variations in the reported studies which calls for revisiting the results with an analytical approach therefore this study was designed to systematically evaluate the publications based on prisma 2020 guidelines in this connection 43 eligible articles were selected for meta analysis followed by subgroup analysis to determine the impact of size concentration plastic polymers and effect of plant classes on several physiological and biochemical parameters growth chlorophyll a carotenoids protein and antioxidant enzymes the results indicated that the higher concentrations of plastics negatively affected the growth and also enhanced the protein content and antioxidative enzyme activity while nps were found to impart an inhibitory effect on pigment contents along with a significant increase in protein content and antioxidative enzyme activity among the plastic polymers dibutyl phthalate dbp showed a comparatively higher effect on growth whereas the photosynthetic pigments were disrupted to a greater extent in the presence of polyvinyl chloride pvc plastics moreover the growth parameters under plastic exposure were affected in the algal members to a greater extent in comparison to the other plant groups lastly several plants like komvophoron elodea myriophyllum nostoc raphidocelis scenedesmus utricularia dunaliella and lemna appeared to be more tolerant than others tolerance index 0 8 showing a significantly minimal effect on growth inhibition graphical abstarct image graphical abstract keywords aquatic plant meta analysis microplastic nanoplastic toxicity systematic review data availability the data has been made available through supplementary files 1 introduction in the last few years concerns regarding the amount of wastewater being produced by the industrial and agricultural sectors are constantly increasing the nearby discharge of wastewater into the neighbouring ponds rivers and lakes leads to the contamination of urban waters wang et al 2020 in this connection approximately 1 15 to 2 41 million tons of plastic waste have been known to enter the oceans through rivers lebreton et al 2017 in a recent study it was reported that near about 5 9 particles l of microplastics were detected in the water of red hills lake chennai india gopinath et al 2020 the exposition of microplastics mps and nanoplastics nps in the environment poses significant hazards to microorganisms humans animals and plants hanif et al 2021 mps and nps are plastic particles with diameters of 0 1 5 mm and 100 nm respectively feng et al 2020 primary sources of mps and nps include consumer products from the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries air blasting and textiles that reach the environment via wastewater disposal fendall and sewell 2009 lorenz et al 2011 hazards from plastic particles result mainly due to their ability to adsorb toxic chemicals on the surface rochman et al 2014 although the fundamental composition of the plastic particle varies mps and nps provide a hydrophobic surface that possibly absorbs or adsorbs persistent organic pollutants pops like polychlorinated biphenyls pcb dichlorodiphenyl dcdp trichloroethane tce and nonylphenol np ziccardi et al 2016 bhattacharya et al 2010 owing to their small size they have the propensity to effortlessly pass through biological barriers and pile up in the tissues and organs of the exposed organisms kashiwada 2006 von moos et al 2012 mattsson et al 2017 this triggers physiological distress metabolic disorders growth impediments hindered autotrophic capabilities diminished reproductive fitness and early mortality in aquatic organisms von moos et al 2012 the effect of plastic pollution has been mostly studied in algal members and it has been realized that mps and nps hinder algal photosynthesis and promote the generation of reactive oxygen species ros which affect their growth and viability bhattacharya et al 2010 similarly in several aquatic macrophytes like myriophyllum spicatum and elodea sp effect of plastic has been observed in the form of a reduction in shoot length van weert et al 2019 the management of the plastic menace presently seems to be improbable however several plants hyperaccumulating the mps and nps have shown promise to be used as an eco friendly as well as an economically feasible strategy rai et al 2018 2021 an investigation has revealed the strong adsorption of polyethylene mps by lemna minor without any disruption of growth and photosynthesis mateos cárdenas et al 2019 hydrocotyle vulgaris penny grass was also reported to bioaccumulate nanoscale polymer dots li et al 2020a however the number of studies describing the efficacy of aquatic plants in plastic accumulation seems to be limited in this connection the use of a systematic review followed by a meta analysis can be used to extract summarize and analyze all the available primary research to address this increasing problem reichelt et al 2020 dastogeer et al 2020 a recent systematic review based on 66 studies has identified crucial parameters of mps like particle concentration shape and size that could impart significant effects on aquatic organisms bucci et al 2020 in another study a similar systematic review based on 25 articles was conducted to study the effects of micro and nanoplastics on different plants azeem et al 2022 besides a few cited studies there exists a huge gap in identifying the factors affecting the responses of aquatic flora against mps and nps therefore in this study a systematic review approach was undertaken to examine the impact of mps and nps on the growth and physiological parameters of aquatic flora further the meta analysis of the published papers has been conducted to assess the factors that influence the propensity of mps and nps in effecting the growth and biochemical markers of different plant groups to the best of our knowledge this study is one of the first studies to encompass a meta analysis approach to interpreting the effects of mps and nps on freshwater flora that are generally known to harbor urban waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 literature search and selection of relevant studies the general guidelines of a systematic review proposed by preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analysis prisma 2020 were followed for extracting the data for our study we performed a literature search in the web of science scopus and pubmed databases and selected all the search results from 2012 onwards our search terms included microplastics and algae microplastics and aquatic plants microplastics and phytoplankton microplastics and macrophytes microplastics and microphytes microplastics and swamp nanoplastics and aquatic plants nanoplastics and phytoplankton nanoplastics and macrophytes nanoplastics and microphytes and nanoplastics and swamp a total of 664 articles excluding duplicates were initially obtained from the search results we developed and executed a very inflexible search strategy to set the inclusion criteria for screening the most suitable unique and reliable data sets all the papers were analyzed thoroughly based on our exclusion criteria and the papers that did not fit into the criteria were readily eliminated without any biases the initial research articles were narrowed down based on the following set of criteria i the study includes the application of plastic particles microplastics and or nanoplastics to freshwater aquatic plants and algae that are also known to harbor urban waters ii the experiments are either conducted under laboratory or field conditions iii a control set i e micro or nanoplastic free concentration was used in addition to one or several treatment groups iv the results are supported by reliable statistical analyses out of all the studies most were eliminated based on the mentioned criteria and the list was polished to 43 articles 2 2 data extraction for meta analysis from the selected articles we extracted data on plant growth photosynthetic pigment content chlorophyll a total carotenoids total protein content and antioxidative enzymes for assessing the plant growth any one of the parameters was considered inhibition percentage plant biomass root growth relative growth rate etc the studies where the mean values of control were missing were considered for normalization by converting them into fold change values irrespective of the concerned growth parameter while for the other studies where treatment sets were accompanied by additional control sets raw values were considered as the data points for the antioxidative enzyme parameter the values for the activity of different antioxidative enzymes e g catalase glutathione peroxidase superoxide dismutase and peroxidase were taken as raw data from the papers considered for meta analysis for the rest of the parameters the data were extracted in a raw form and the results reported in different units were uniformly converted to the same unit before analysis additionally the data extraction on the mentioned parameters was separately done concerning the type size and concentration of micro and nanoplastics the means sample sizes replications and standard deviations were recorded from each study often results were mentioned in the form of graphical diagrams for which we have used web plot digitizer version 4 5 https automeris io webplotdigitizer to digitize the values and for the studies bearing results in a tabulated format results were extracted manually 2 3 data endpoints we considered numerous observations as independent since this is thought to increase the statistical power of meta analysis multiple treatments were placed into three groups low 10 mg ml moderate 10 mg ml to 100 mg ml and high 100 mg ml based on the concentration of mps and or nps used in the study the types of plastics were placed in several groups based on the nature of the polymer ps polystyrene pe polyethylene pp polypropylene pvc polyvinyl chloride pet polyethylene terephthalate pmma polymethyl methacrylate and dbp dibutyl phthalate the growth and stress parameters were further extracted concerning the size of plastic particles microplastics and nanoplastics mps 1 µm nps 1 µm from the 43 selected research articles for meta analysis 83 studies have been obtained with different growth parameters pigment content total protein and antioxidative enzymes to examine the potential bias of publications with multiple observations we calculated the mean effect size of the dataset considering observations from each study and compared this with the effect size calculated with the whole dataset all the datasets were compiled into microsoft excel datasheets and further considered for meta analysis 2 4 meta analysis meta analysis was conducted using the meta package implemented in the r studio version 4 1 1 r foundation for statistical computing platform 2021 the effect size was calculated in terms of mean difference md for the preliminary study we selected a total of 49 studies from 43 research articles to evaluate the growth through meta analysis we compiled the mean growth results along with the standard deviation for both the control and treatment groups the analysis was performed by calculating the md between means implemented in the rma function the mean difference md can be defined as the difference in means between unstandardized raw data of two independent groups van kleunen et al 2010 xie et al 2014 in other terms the mean difference is the measure of the difference in the mean of group 1 x 1 and the mean of group 2 x 2 md x 1 x 2 this statistical entity was used to express the difference in the mean values of the pooled standard deviation and thus played a key role in meta analysis as it has a lower type i error rate for the systematic analysis a random effects model was chosen to examine multiple diverse studies based on different plants concentrations and types of plastic particles we assumed that both the sampling error and the random variation contributed to the variation among comparisons of studies the effect sizes were considered significant only when the 95 cis were represented with non zero values to estimate the heterogeneity and to assess the statistical heterogeneity higgin s i2 and cochran s q statistics were used respectively the i2 statistics can be interpreted as the ratio of true heterogeneity to total heterogeneity across the observed effect sizes the i2 values range from 0 to 100 and the values of 25 25 75 and 75 represent low moderate and high heterogeneity respectively higgins et al 2003 the q value represents the weighted deviations from the summary effect size that are due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error when the q statistics were found to be significant the data were treated to be heterogeneous mayerhofer et al 2013 2 5 analysis of publication bias publication bias analysis is the selection bias that could have occurred when the study has been conducted hak et al 2016 in our study the publication bias for all 49 studies was checked and the presence of asymmetry in the funnel plot was inspected in this connection we have used the trim and fill analysis and also performed the begg and mazumdar rank correlation tests based on kendall s tau to analyze the presence of any bias in the studies begg and mazumdar 1994 the trim and fill method is one of the most immensely used methods for evaluating the publication bias in meta analysis it is a commonly used method to detect any bias and is often used to resolve publication bias issues duval and tweedie 2000 shi and lin 2019 in our study the trim and fill analysis was performed through meta essentials https www erim eur nl research support meta essentials a software developed for the analysis of whether there is any bias in the publication of studies suurmond et al 2017 for the analysis the values of the standard error of individual studies the total number of observations total number of replicates used in control and treatment groups and the mean difference for each study were used as input the standard error of the individual studies was calculated as follows s t a n d a r d e r r o r s d c 2 n c s d t 2 n t where sdc standard deviation of the control group sdt standard deviation of the treatment group nc number of replicas for the control group and nt number of replicas for the treatment group the trim and fill method was followed by the generation of a funnel plot a standardized residual histogram a galbraith plot and a normal quantile plot for assessing the results after adjusting the publication bias 2 6 subgroup analyses subgroup analysis is done to specifically determine the influence of factors such as the size concentration and types of plastic materials and plant classes and whether they have any significant effect on the growth photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll a and carotenoids protein content and antioxidant enzymes for the subgroup analysis we calculated the effect size in terms of standardized mean difference smd in contrast to the mean differences md used for studying the study wise effect of plastic exposure on the growth pattern smd has an advantage over md because it can be taken as a comparison between studies even if some studies do not measure the outcome of interest using the same instruments here smd between groups expresses the difference between the two groups in terms of standard deviations this is calculated by dividing the raw mean of group 1 x 1 and the raw mean of group 2 x 2 with the pooled standard deviation spooled of both the groups s m d b e t w e e n x 1 x 2 s p o o l e d the overall effect size of subgroups was individually calculated using a random effects model here the variance of the summary effect for studies is estimated as v m s 2 n where n cumulative sample size across all studies s standard deviation borenstein et al 2013 some of the subgroups in our study were fixed such as the plant classes and types of plastic materials whereas some were converted from the quantitative data to 2 3 qualitative groups like plastic particle concentration and size of plastic particles for a factor to be included as a subgroup in the meta analysis it has to be included in more than 10 studies n 10 the details of the subgroups are presented below i concentration of plastic the concentration of mps and nps were categorized into three groups such as low 10 mg ml moderate 10 to 100 mg ml and high 100 mg ml ii size of plastic particles the size of plastic particles was subdivided into microplastics and nanoplastics mps 1 µm nps 1 µm iii types of plastic polymers plastic particle types were placed into eight groups based on the polymer type ps polystyrene polyacrylonitrile pan pe polyethylene pp polypropylene pvc polyvinyl chloride pet polyethylene terephthalate pmma polymethyl methacrylate and dbp dibutyl phthalate iv plant classes all the plants mentioned in our systematic review were sub grouped into 8 classes based on the fritsch s and apg iv system of classification chlorophyceae trebouxiophyceae cryptophyceae dinophyceae euglenaceae cyanophyceae polypodiopsida and magnoliopsida 2 7 principal component analysis and determination of tolerance index ti the principal component analysis pca and hierarchical clustering were applied to separate the studied plant members into clusters and to classify them based on responses to plastic induced phytotoxicity pca and hierarchical clustering were performed using r studio to determine the major contributing factors and for the visualization of the pca and clustering dendrogram the pheatmap r package was used to enhance the visibility of variables in the pca scatter plot the scaling function was set to 0 and repel function was set to true the determination of the tolerance index of aquatic plants subjected to water pollutants is least defined in the literature however recently zaghloul et al 2020 proposed a simple method to assess the tolerance level of plants based on their growth under controlled and polluted conditions according to them the tolerance index ti of plants subjected to pollutants can be quantified by the formula as follows t o l e r a n c e i n d e x t i g t g c where gt mean growth subject to plastic contamination gc mean growth in the control set however the study did not mention any threshold value of ti for ascribing the level of tolerance to plants in our study the calculation of gt and gc has been performed to assess the comprehensive tolerance level of plants across high moderate and low concentrations of plastic exposure in this connection the parameters were calculated by using the formulae as follows g t g t l g t m g t h n g c g c l g c m g c h n where gt l growth in the treatment set of lower concentration gt m growth in the treatment set of moderate concentration gt h growth in the treatment set of high concentration gc l growth in the control set of lower concentration gc m growth in the control set of moderate concentration gc h growth in the control set of high concentration n total number of studies in case of the individual plant species in some cases the growth parameters of all the concentrations low moderate or high were not available and therefore not counted as a study similarly multiple values for an individual concentration were counted as different studies the values of all the components have been presented in supplementary file 2 3 results 3 1 selection of papers for meta analysis following the prisma 2020 guidelines 664 research articles without duplicates were obtained from three different databases out of which 89 records were screened based on the relatability of the title of the paper and their abstracts fig 1 later only 58 of them were assessed as eligible papers for full text evaluation further out of these 15 papers were removed in the final round owing to their non relevant research aims absence of proper control and unavailability of required data therefore 43 papers were finally selected for meta analysis fig 2 the list of included and excluded articles during the different stages of this systematic review with the reasons for their exclusion and the plant group wise and genus wise number of papers have been presented in detail in the supplementary file 1 table st 1 5 3 2 study wise effect of mps nps on the growth pattern the study wise meta analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of plastic pollution on the growth patterns of different organisms the growth pattern was studied based on a relative increase or decrease in plant growth exposed to plastic mps nps when compared to the control set for the analysis the inhibition in growth was taken as positive values whereas the increase in growth was expressed as negative values a total number of 83 studies were initially considered for meta analysis from the final list of 43 articles among all the 83 studies only the most effective treatment per paper for an individual organism was considered for analyzing the study wise effect of mps nps on growth responses this resulted in a total number of 49 studies see supplementary file 1 table st 6 the 49 studies were finally evaluated on basis of mean difference md i e the difference in means between the control groups and the treatment groups which was used as a function of the effect size presented in a forest plot fig 3 the forest plot exhibited the occurrence of 7 studies showing a negative effect size md 0 which implied a minimal effect of plastic particles in fact indicating an increase in plant growth these studies involved six plants viz raphidocelis subcapitata md 0 62 and 0 12 chlamydomonas reinhardtii md 0 28 komvophoron sp md 0 39 scenedesmus obliquus md 0 15 myriophyllum spicatum md 0 004 and elodea sp md 0 01 while utricularia vulgaris md 2 05 scenedesmus armatus md 1 4 microcystis flos aquae md 1 26 chlorella pyrenoidosa md 1 12 microcystis aeruginosa md 0 93 showed relatively higher effect sizes implying the greater effect of plastic particles on their growth however some of the organisms like chlorella pyrenoidosa md 0 03 scenedesmus obliquus md 0 06 0 02 nostoc sp md 0 06 and lemna minor md 0 07 depicted a very negligible effect of the exposure to plastic particles the mean effect size of the study was 0 32 0 19 0 45 the weightage of all the studies was more or less similar to each other a p value of 0 0001 contributes to the significance of the outcome of this analysis moreover a high level of heterogeneity i2 99 76 has been calculated in the study which implies a higher degree of variation in the results depicted by the studies considered for the meta analysis 3 3 publication biases and correction the publication bias was evaluated and corrected using the trim and fill method and was accompanied by the begg and mazumdar rank correlation test on kendall s tau out of the 49 studies only 2 studies have been found to reflect some sort of publication bias that has been imputed and corrected using the trim and fill method a kendall s tau value of 0 07 depicts a very low relation among the studies and thus supports a higher level of heterogeneity among the studies the funnel plot remarkably supported the findings as the trim and fill method exhibited a minor adjustment in the mean effect size expressed as md i e from 0 32 to 0 28 implying that most of the studies were not biased fig 4 a the total heterogeneity value i2 was also adjusted from 99 76 to 98 90 depicting similar results as represented by the change in the mean effect size the standardized residual histogram also represented that the z scores of most of the studies were inside the range of the probability levels of the study area except for a few which were outside the probability level fig 4c this demonstrates that each of the studies was close to the range of our mean study results the galbraith plot again showed similar results with most of the studies present between the upper and lower levels of the confidence intervals fig 4b similarly the normal quantile plot displays that most of the study points overlapped with the regression line or were very close to it which contributes to a standard normal distribution of the data fig 4d 3 4 subgroup analysis the effects of mps and or nps on the growth pattern of aquatic plants including algae ferns and angiosperms were further evaluated through subgroup analysis based on five different physiological and biochemical criteria viz growth inhibition chlorophyll a total carotenoids protein content and antioxidative enzymes these subgroups comprised concentration size and type of plastic polymers along with different plant groups for the analysis the subgroup wise data were extracted from the eligible papers separately for individual growth and biochemical parameters which have been presented in supplementary file 2 moreover the heterogeneity statistics for all four subgroups were performed separately for growth chlorophyll a total carotenoids protein content and antioxidative enzyme activity table 1 3 4 1 effect of plastic size plastic particles were differentiated based on their sizes into two categories mps 1 µm and nps 1 µm mps and nps exhibited similar effects on plant growth fig 5 both mps and nps share a nearly indistinguishable size effect expressed in smd in case of subgroup analysis with the lower and upper bounds of confidence intervals i e smd 2 16 ci between 0 31 4 01 and smd 1 98 ci between 0 11 3 84 respectively however photosynthetic pigments showed distinctly variable effects as the effect size in the case of chlorophyll a content was higher in nps with an effect size of 2 53 0 38 4 67 than that of the mps treatment bearing an effect size of 0 88 0 67 2 43 fig 5 similarly in the case of carotenoid content the nps treatment showed a relatively higher effect size of 5 80 2 15 9 45 in comparison to the effect size of mps i e 2 26 0 33 4 20 fig 5 though they also exhibited some sort of overlapping confidence intervals revealing similar effects in some studies the effect of mps on protein content was almost negligible showing a very small effect size of 0 11 1 42 1 64 in comparison to the effect size of nps i e 0 83 2 50 0 84 fig 5 therefore the inhibiting effects of nps on protein content was are more prominent than that of the mps also the effect size of mps i e 1 42 3 12 0 28 on antioxidant enzymes was relatively less negative than that of nps fig 5 this depicts a higher activity of antioxidative enzymes in plants exposed to nps 3 4 2 effect of plastic concentration the subgroup analysis was also conducted for analyzing the effect of low 10 mg ml moderate 10 mg ml to 100 mg ml and high 100 mg ml concentrations of plastic fig 6 in general the increasing concentrations of mps nps irrespective of their size significantly decreased the growth of plants the subgroup analysis revealed that the effect size of low and moderate concentrations of plastic was 1 04 0 57 2 64 and 2 78 0 69 4 87 respectively the analysis also revealed that the effect size of a high concentration of plastic was significantly higher than that of the other two groups i e 3 39 1 01 5 77 as observed from the more or less similar confidence intervals it could be concluded that the extent of the negative effect of the moderate and high concentrations of plastic is more or less similar interestingly the chlorophyll a content was majorly affected by the moderate concentration of plastic particles as depicted by an effect size of 6 76 2 52 10 05 fig 6 in comparison the higher concentration was relatively tender to affect the chlorophyll a content as observed from its lesser effect size of 1 91 0 09 3 74 similar results were observed in the case of carotenoid content where the pigment contents were highly affected by a moderate concentration of plastic as observed from the effect size of 5 05 2 02 8 08 fig 6 this was relatively higher than that of the high and low concentrations of plastic 4 04 and 1 23 respectively however the effect size of the low concentration smd 0 18 1 33 1 70 and the moderate concentration of plastic smd 0 04 1 45 1 54 showed a negligible effect or influence on the changes in protein content though the high concentration of plastic contributed to the increase in protein content as observed from its negative effect size of 0 47 2 09 1 16 fig 6 similarly the high concentration of plastic affected the expression of antioxidative enzymes therefore showing a distinctly negative effect size of 0 72 2 37 0 94 fig 6 3 4 3 effect of plastic polymer type the dbp type of plastic showed the highest effect size of 4 74 1 62 7 86 implying its greater effect on plant growth pan pe and pet somehow showed a nearly similar levels of effect sizes smd 1 56 1 59 and 1 15 respectively fig 7 while pmma pp and pvc showed relatively higher effect sizes smd 3 95 2 98 and 4 25 respectively polystyrene ps the most studied plastic here shows an intermediate effect size among the studies plastic materials i e 2 21 0 32 4 10 all the plastic types exhibited a somewhat similar range of ci values predicting similar effects in some studies in case of chlorophyll a content ps showed the highest effect size of 6 29 2 56 10 03 while the effect size was moderate in case of pmma pp and pvc smd 0 53 1 53 and 3 07 respectively fig 7 however negative effects sizes have been observed in case of pe smd 0 55 2 18 1 08 and pet smd 0 42 1 76 0 93 in the case of total carotenoid content ps showed a significantly large effect size of 8 51 3 81 13 21 fig 7 the effect sizes of pmma pp and pvc were also more or less similar on the other hand pe and pet displayed effect sizes near zero smd 0 49 and 1 13 respectively indicating no effect on carotenoid content whereas pe showed a negative effect size the highest effect on protein content was conferred by pet showing an effect size of 2 26 0 21 4 30 fig 7 pvc and pmma also displayed similar effect sizes smd 0 86 and 1 04 respectively whereas the effects were nearly negligible in the cases of pan and ps smd 0 and 0 02 respectively negative effects sizes were calculated in case of pe and pp i e 1 80 3 70 0 09 and 3 72 6 36 1 07 respectively moreover the pe have shown a distinguishable and larger effect size of 4 95 1 72 8 18 in the case of antioxidant enzymes indicating a decline in the antioxidative activity fig 7 the rest of the plastic types showed smaller effect sizes smd 0 68 that proclaim an increase in the antioxidant enzyme activity 3 4 4 effect of plant groups to visualize the specific responses of plant groups towards plastic contamination the organisms were subdivided into 8 classes members of cryptophyceae exhibited the highest effect size of 8 15 3 43 13 58 befitting the most affected algal group in terms of growth when exposed to plastic fig 8 while the classes polypodipopsida and magnoliopsida have shown significantly smaller effect sizes smd 0 93 and 0 80 respectively among all the groups a moderate effect on growth was demonstrated by the rest of the plant groups on the other hand the members of chlorophyceae displayed the highest effect size of 10 41 4 31 16 51 in the case of chlorophyll a followed by trebouxiophyceae cyanophyceae polypodiopsida cryptophyceae and others fig 8 the smallest effect sizes were noted in magnoliopsida smd 0 06 and euglenaceae smd 0 88 indicating a negligible effect of plastic on chlorophyll a content trebouxiophyceae showed the smallest effect size of 0 49 2 12 1 13 while the rest of the plant groups showed a positive effect size in the case of carotenoid content fig 8 further cryptophyceae and polypodiopsida showed the highest effects sizes smd 3 46 and 3 42 respectively with more or less similar confidence intervals in the case of protein content dinophyceae showed the largest effect size of 9 84 4 05 15 63 indicating the significant effect of plastic on retarding protein biosynthesis fig 8 on the other hand chlorophyceae showed the smallest effect size of 2 16 4 18 0 15 in the case of antioxidative enzymes chlorophyceae alone elucidated a positive effect size of 0 30 1 31 1 91 fig 8 the rest of the plant groups showed negative effect sizes smd 1 26 the group magnoliopsida showed the smallest effect size of 3 04 4 71 1 38 implying an elevated antioxidant activity when exposed to plastic 3 5 principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering corresponds to the tolerance index of plant species pca analysis of the studied plant members exhibited the clustering of plant species based on the examined variables i e growth physiological and biochemical responses denoting that the responses of the plant members were markedly affected by the exposure to plastics fig 9 a the pca biplot showed a total variability of 72 3 with dim1 and dim2 accounting for 44 6 and 27 7 of the variability respectively between the studied plant groups and physio biochemical responses fig 9 the loading plot unveils that the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll a accessory pigment carotenoids protein and antioxidative activity were major contributors to the separation of microcystis and rhodomonas similarly photosynthetic pigments contributed to the separation of chlamydomonas and salvinia also gymnodinium and euglena were separated in the biplot based on protein content furthermore the pca analysis revealed that gymnodinium euglena chlorella and scenedesmus showed a positive correlation with protein on other hand a negative correlation was noted between microcystis rhodomonas chlamydomonas and salvinia with growth antioxidative activity and pigments moreover the hierarchical clustering of the studied plant members highlighted a strong relationship among the species like scenedesmus salvinia raphidocelis euglena lemna dunaliella nostoc elodea myriophyllum and komvophoron and thus separated into a distinct subset s1 fig 9b whereas plant members like gymnodinium chlamydomonas microcystis rhodomonas euglena and chlorella settled in diverse subsets in the dendrogram in the present study the tolerance index ti was determined solely on the growth response of the plant species to plastic exposure the assessment of the ti against plastic exposure displayed differential responses of the plant species as presented through the spider plot fig 9c out of the 18 plant species a total of 9 species showed a ti index of 0 8 indicating somewhat better performance in terms of physiological and biochemical responses these species except salvinia ti 0 79 correlated with the s1 subset of the dendrogram moreover the species such as komvophoron elodea myriophyllum and nostoc exhibited a ti score of 1 suggesting their comparatively higher tolerance within the species clubbed in the s1 subset on the other hand the species with a ti score of 0 7 indicated poor performance and coincided with the species poorly clubbed in a cluster in the dendrogram 4 discussion recent ecotoxicological studies have unveiled a significant increase in the release of toxic water pollutants among them plastics mps nps are shown to have an extensive impact on the aquatic plant groups mateos cárdenas et al 2021 currently plastics mps nps are emerging as a grievous concern in the social and scientific arena owing to their perpetuity toxicity and ubiquitous distribution across ecosystems green et al 2021 therefore the present study was undertaken to revisit the experimental findings concerning the effect of mps and nps on growth biochemical protein and antioxidative enzymes and photosynthetic chlorophyll a and carotenoids indices of aquatic microflora to date no comprehensive analyses have been performed including meta analysis to appraise the impact of plastic pollution on aquatic flora especially freshwater flora that harbours the urban waters in this connection the meta analysis approach has been employed to appraise the impact of plastic types concentrations and exposure time on aquatic flora some algal genera like anabaena nostoc chlorella scenedesmus euglena chlamydomonas etc and other macrophytes like elodea myriophyllum lemna spirodela salvinia etc predominantly inhabit the urban waters jafari and gunale 2006 zub et al 2019 therefore the present study will provide an insight into the effect of plastic contamination in the urban aquatic ecosystem the impact of plastic is known to be influenced by several factors like particle size polymer types surface charge and exposure durations rillig et al 2019 moreover the plastic particles incite variable responses in different plant species mateos cárdenas et al 2021 in terms of size plastic particles can be mainly categorized into two groups namely microplastics mps and nanoplastics nps that are found to float upon the surface water thereby creating a microlayer on the surface kalčíková 2020 eerkes medrano et al 2015 thereupon the plastic particles are known to majorly interact with the floating algal groups and aquatic macrophytes studies have confirmed that the small sized plastic particles are more attracted to the plant surface and get aggregated in the external tissues in greater amounts mateos cárdenas et al 2021 in this connection several researchers have previously demonstrated the negative impact of nps on several algal species in terms of growth inhibition casado et al 2013 besseling et al 2014 sjollema et al 2016 on the contrary several studies based on mps size 1 10 μm exhibited moderate to no toxicity in most of the cases bergami et al 2017 gambardella et al 2019 garrido et al 2019 moreover the mps with even larger particle sizes 100 μm generally exhibited no or minimal impact and were even found to increase algal growth canniff and hoang 2018 chae et al 2019 however the present study showed a positive and equivalent effect size of mps and nps on the studied plant models indicating an adverse effect of plastics on plant growth irrespective of their particle size on the contrary a much higher effect size of the nps on photosynthetic pigments was observed in comparison to the mps which may be directly responsible for the retardation of plant growth this is in agreement with the reports of yan et al 2021 where exposure of chlamydomonas reinhardtii to ps nps showed a reduction of 72 8 and 72 6 in the contents of total chlorophyll and carotenoids respectively when compared to the control set at the same time a much lower reduction of 26 5 and 22 9 in total chlorophyll and carotenoid were reported when treated with ps mps the study further confirmed that the increased dose of plastics and decreasing size of ps particles significantly reduced chlorophyll autofluorescence in the microalgal cells therefore it could be ascertained that the nps owing to their smaller particle size can impart greater toxicity to the aquatic flora however the study by yan et al 2021 also corroborated our findings where the activity of antioxidative enzymes gradually increased with the increase in the dosage of ps nps and ps mps plastics are also shown to impart phytotoxic effects such as hindrance in nutrient uptake decrease in the rate of respiration photosynthesis and growth of aquatic flora in a dose dependent manner kalcíková et al 2017 van weert et al 2019 rilling et al 2019 mateos cárdenas et al 2021 the present study showed a similar effect size of moderate and high doses of plastic treatment on the growth of studied plant groups this result is in agreement with the findings of tunali et al 2020 who have formerly reported a notable inhibition in the growth of chlorella vulgaris subjected to 50 1000 mg l 1 ps mps whereas a negligible effect of the same plastic material at lower concentrations i e at 1 and 5 mg l 1 was observed the study also reported that moderate to higher doses of ps mps strikingly reduced the photosynthetic pigments a similar response was also noted in the current meta analysis indicating that moderate 10 100 mg l 1 to higher doses 100 mg l 1 of mps and nps can effectively lower the biosynthesis of photosynthetic pigments which further gets augmented when the particle size was reduced this is also in agreement with the findings of yan et al 2021 who have previously reported a much higher reduction of chlorophyll a in chlamydomonas reinhardtii exposed to 500 mg l 1 mps nps when compared to the 50 mg l 1 treated plants moreover a recent study depicting the impact of ps nps on a freshwater macroalga anabaena sp exhibited a dynamic protein profile tamayo belda et al 2021 the report also provided insight into the differential expression profile of stress responsive genes oxidative stress photosynthesis metabolism carbon nitrogen and nucleic acid and signal related proteins in a dose dependent manner therefore it could be concluded that the dose or concentration of the plastics irrespective of the particle size imparts significant changes at the biochemical and molecular levels the effect of plastics on plant growth is also influenced by the type of plastic polymers to which it is exposed in this connection the present study depicted that the dbp polymers have the maximum effect size in terms of growth inhibition followed by pvc pmma and pe a previous study by zhu et al 2019 also suggested that the polymer of plastics like pvc employs more toxicity than pe and ps which was observed in terms of growth reduction by 29 25 3 and 24 7 respectively in the microalga skeletonema costatum exposed to 100 mg l 1 of the plastic particles these differences in the effects of plastic polymers on plant growth may also be correlated to the varying degree of charges present on the outer surface it has been emphasized by several researchers that plastic particles with a relatively positive or lesser negative charge on the surface greatly affect the growth of plants feng et al 2019 sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 in this context wang et al 2016 have shown that the dbp polymers exhibit a zeta potential of 20 to 25 mv at a ph of 4 7 comparatively the ps particles that exhibited a lesser effect on growth compared to dbp in our study have been shown to possess a relatively negative zeta potential 44 1 mv yasir et al 2022 this indicated that the lesser negative charges on the surface of plastic polymers significantly affect plant growth due to their greater interaction with the plant cell wall furthermore our results also showed that the ps polymers imparted the highest effect size in terms of reduction in pigment contents followed by pvc pmma and pp this is in agreement with the findings of wu et al 2019 who reported the reduction of fv fm fv fm and fv f0 values in two freshwater algae chlorella pyrenoidosa and microcystis flos aquae when exposed to pvc and pp this indicated that the accumulation of these plastic polymers could somehow disturb the efficiency of electron transmission and thereby inhibit the rate of photosynthesis the study further confirmed that pvc showed much greater toxicity than pp in terms of its effect on the thylakoid membrane another study unveiled that 1 mg l 1 ps mps exerted much higher toxicity in terms of growth inhibition and reduced photosynthetic pigment content in the freshwater microalga euglena gracilis in comparison to ps nps liao et al 2020 apart from these a recent study reported a noticeable increase in total soluble protein in chlamydomonas reinhardtii when exposed to 100 mg l 1 ps mps for 10 days li et al 2020b on the contrary pvc polymers imparted the maximum reduction in total protein content of acutodesmus obliquus when compared with the effect of pp and pvc when the plants were treated with 250 mg l 1 of the plastic materials ansari et al 2021 our study unveils that the dose and polymer type highly affect ros production and antioxidative responses in the studied plants while plastic size does not impart any significant contribution towards antioxidative responses this is in agreement with the results of song et al 2020 who reported that pet polymers can induce a maximum increase in superoxide dismutase activity in chlorella sp and phaeodactylum tricornutum followed by pe pvc and pp whereas all the studied polymers noticeably reduced catalase activity the present meta analysis also evaluated the variable responses of plant species to plastic exposure based on their systematic position among the studied plant groups the members of euglenaceae trebouxiophyceace and chlorophyceae were the most affected while the members of cryptophyceae along with polypodiopsida and magnoliopsida represented the least affected plant groups in terms of growth inhibition moreover on analysing the tolerance index ti of the plant species two cyanobacterial members komvophoron and nostoc showed a much higher ti 0 8 which also corroborated with the clustering analysis based on the studied physio biochemical markers along with the other macrophyte species our results are also in agreement with a recent study that established that the planktonic alga komvophoron and nostoc exhibited a much better performance in terms of growth and photosynthetic activity subjected to up to 100 µg l ps nps rowenczyk et al 2021 our results further indicated that the algal species are more susceptible to plastic contaminants this may be explained based on the surface morphology that tends to favor the attraction and retention of mps and nps due to the cellulosic composition and the electrostatic charge on the surface of most of the algal species bhattacharya et al 2010 on the other hand the roots of larger macrophytic members are known to be associated with various microorganisms and the exposure of mps nps has been found to enhance the rapid colonization of biofilm producing microbes which eventually helped in minimizing the adsorption of plastic on the root surface rummel et al 2017 kokalj et al 2019 the present study also revealed a much higher degree of impact on chlorophyll a of cyanophyceae followed by cryptophyceae bacillariophyceae chlorophyceae and other algal members while a negligible effect was observed in the members of polypodiopsida and magnoliopsida some previous studies have also revealed that the ps nps were found to significantly reduce the pigment content and photosynthetic yield of freshwater alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii while the aquatic macrophytes like lemna minor and spirodela polyrhiza exhibited a negligible effect in terms of photosynthetic pigments and yield yan et al 2021 kalcíková et al 2017 mateos cárdenas et al 2021 therefore this study presents the variable responses of the aquatic species toward plastic pollutants in freshwater the effect of which has been quantified in terms of tolerance index in this connection the present study also attempts to pinpoint the plant species that may be selectively grown in plastic contaminated freshwaters 5 limitations of the study and points for refinement the current investigation attempts to provide a systematic insight into the emerging issue of plastic pollution in the freshwater ecosystem during the present meta analysis we experienced various hurdles that have been enlisted below i a very small number of studies have evaluated the effect of mps nps on the flora of the freshwater ecosystem therefore the increasing number of studies on this topic will increase the robustness of such analysis in the future ii the studies on growth patterns plastic concentration size etc have been presented differently in the screened articles therefore it is desirable to form a consensus on the parameters to be studied for assessing the ecotoxicological impact of plastic particles iii the studies lack standardized experimental designs for the establishment of resistance or susceptibility indices therefore we have faced difficulty in quantifying the tolerance level of the individual species in our study iv the number of studies mentioning the effect on a particular plant species is also limited therefore it was not possible to ascertain the tolerance level of species with a high level of confidence considering the above mentioned points it could be realized that there is a need to form a consensus among the researchers working on the assessment of plastic pollution in the freshwater ecosystem we have observed with the studies on air pollution that the air pollution tolerance index apti and anticipated performance index api have been used effectively to assess the impact of air pollution on flora kaur and nagpal 2017 apti has been calculated by using the formula proposed by singh and rao 1983 a p t i a t p r 10 where a ascorbic acid content mg g p ph of leaf extract t total chlorophyll mg g and r relative water content of fresh leaves similarly the api value of an organism is based on the percentage score obtained by the organism the percentage score can be calculated as a p i s c o r e g r a d e s o b t a i n e d b y p l a n t s p e c i e s m a x i m u m p o s s i b l e g r a d e s f o r a n y p l a n t s in this context several biomarkers have been given utmost importance such as ph of the cell sap relative water content ascorbate and chlorophyll content therefore taking a cue from this several biomarkers can also be selected for the assessment of water pollution in aquatic flora in our study we have selected several attributes that have been mostly quantified in the articles selected for meta analysis and contribute majorly to the overall performance of the plants in plastic polluted waterbodies these parameters include total carotenoid content chlorophyll content antioxidative enzyme activity and protein content which exhibit their major contribution in the loading plot fig 9b and were responsible for the clustering of the species in the dendrogram fig 9c based on their overall performance this also corroborated with the tolerance index of species fig 9c that was calculated by taking growth response as a sole factor for future consideration several other parameters like cell sap ph electrolyte leakage and total chlorophyll can be considered to framework a universal scale for determining the tolerance level of species 6 conclusion and future perspectives even though there is a lesser number of studies available on the impact of mps and or nps on the primary producers of the freshwater ecosystem the present study attempts to present a comprehensive outlook on the consequences of plastic pollution on freshwater aquatic flora the present meta analysis revealed that the plastic size dose and polymer types inevitably impact plant growth both mps and nps can equally affect plant growth antioxidative enzymes pigments and protein content however most of the studies emphasized that the nps can affect plant members to a greater extent in terms of the studied physio biochemical parameters moreover among the studied plastic polymers pvc pmma and pe were found to induce more toxicity than pan pp ps and pet also the algal groups were more attenuated by plastic induced phytotoxicity when compared to the members of the cyanophyceae polypodiopsida and magnoliopsida in this connection the aquatic plant species like komvophoron elodea myriophyllum nostoc raphidocelis scenedesmus utricularia dunaliella and lemna demonstrated relatively higher tolerance against plastic induced toxicity and therefore could be preferably suggested for propagation in the urban waterbodies to restore water quality and balance of the ecosystem moreover this study has propounded a reliable method for the calculation of the tolerance index ti of species exposed to plastic particles which also reciprocated with the clustering of the species based on the studied biochemical parameters viz chlorophyll and carotenoid content protein content and activity of antioxidative enzymes therefore this study will help the researchers in framing the experimental design for properly assessing the level of tolerance of species with a greater degree of conformity credit authorship contribution statement dibakar ghosh data curation investigation

15424,the deterioration in the water quality of urban water bodies through plastic contamination is emerging as a matter of serious concern microplastics mps and nanoplastics nps both affect the growth and productivity of aquatic flora however there have been a lot of variations in the reported studies which calls for revisiting the results with an analytical approach therefore this study was designed to systematically evaluate the publications based on prisma 2020 guidelines in this connection 43 eligible articles were selected for meta analysis followed by subgroup analysis to determine the impact of size concentration plastic polymers and effect of plant classes on several physiological and biochemical parameters growth chlorophyll a carotenoids protein and antioxidant enzymes the results indicated that the higher concentrations of plastics negatively affected the growth and also enhanced the protein content and antioxidative enzyme activity while nps were found to impart an inhibitory effect on pigment contents along with a significant increase in protein content and antioxidative enzyme activity among the plastic polymers dibutyl phthalate dbp showed a comparatively higher effect on growth whereas the photosynthetic pigments were disrupted to a greater extent in the presence of polyvinyl chloride pvc plastics moreover the growth parameters under plastic exposure were affected in the algal members to a greater extent in comparison to the other plant groups lastly several plants like komvophoron elodea myriophyllum nostoc raphidocelis scenedesmus utricularia dunaliella and lemna appeared to be more tolerant than others tolerance index 0 8 showing a significantly minimal effect on growth inhibition graphical abstarct image graphical abstract keywords aquatic plant meta analysis microplastic nanoplastic toxicity systematic review data availability the data has been made available through supplementary files 1 introduction in the last few years concerns regarding the amount of wastewater being produced by the industrial and agricultural sectors are constantly increasing the nearby discharge of wastewater into the neighbouring ponds rivers and lakes leads to the contamination of urban waters wang et al 2020 in this connection approximately 1 15 to 2 41 million tons of plastic waste have been known to enter the oceans through rivers lebreton et al 2017 in a recent study it was reported that near about 5 9 particles l of microplastics were detected in the water of red hills lake chennai india gopinath et al 2020 the exposition of microplastics mps and nanoplastics nps in the environment poses significant hazards to microorganisms humans animals and plants hanif et al 2021 mps and nps are plastic particles with diameters of 0 1 5 mm and 100 nm respectively feng et al 2020 primary sources of mps and nps include consumer products from the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries air blasting and textiles that reach the environment via wastewater disposal fendall and sewell 2009 lorenz et al 2011 hazards from plastic particles result mainly due to their ability to adsorb toxic chemicals on the surface rochman et al 2014 although the fundamental composition of the plastic particle varies mps and nps provide a hydrophobic surface that possibly absorbs or adsorbs persistent organic pollutants pops like polychlorinated biphenyls pcb dichlorodiphenyl dcdp trichloroethane tce and nonylphenol np ziccardi et al 2016 bhattacharya et al 2010 owing to their small size they have the propensity to effortlessly pass through biological barriers and pile up in the tissues and organs of the exposed organisms kashiwada 2006 von moos et al 2012 mattsson et al 2017 this triggers physiological distress metabolic disorders growth impediments hindered autotrophic capabilities diminished reproductive fitness and early mortality in aquatic organisms von moos et al 2012 the effect of plastic pollution has been mostly studied in algal members and it has been realized that mps and nps hinder algal photosynthesis and promote the generation of reactive oxygen species ros which affect their growth and viability bhattacharya et al 2010 similarly in several aquatic macrophytes like myriophyllum spicatum and elodea sp effect of plastic has been observed in the form of a reduction in shoot length van weert et al 2019 the management of the plastic menace presently seems to be improbable however several plants hyperaccumulating the mps and nps have shown promise to be used as an eco friendly as well as an economically feasible strategy rai et al 2018 2021 an investigation has revealed the strong adsorption of polyethylene mps by lemna minor without any disruption of growth and photosynthesis mateos cárdenas et al 2019 hydrocotyle vulgaris penny grass was also reported to bioaccumulate nanoscale polymer dots li et al 2020a however the number of studies describing the efficacy of aquatic plants in plastic accumulation seems to be limited in this connection the use of a systematic review followed by a meta analysis can be used to extract summarize and analyze all the available primary research to address this increasing problem reichelt et al 2020 dastogeer et al 2020 a recent systematic review based on 66 studies has identified crucial parameters of mps like particle concentration shape and size that could impart significant effects on aquatic organisms bucci et al 2020 in another study a similar systematic review based on 25 articles was conducted to study the effects of micro and nanoplastics on different plants azeem et al 2022 besides a few cited studies there exists a huge gap in identifying the factors affecting the responses of aquatic flora against mps and nps therefore in this study a systematic review approach was undertaken to examine the impact of mps and nps on the growth and physiological parameters of aquatic flora further the meta analysis of the published papers has been conducted to assess the factors that influence the propensity of mps and nps in effecting the growth and biochemical markers of different plant groups to the best of our knowledge this study is one of the first studies to encompass a meta analysis approach to interpreting the effects of mps and nps on freshwater flora that are generally known to harbor urban waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 literature search and selection of relevant studies the general guidelines of a systematic review proposed by preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analysis prisma 2020 were followed for extracting the data for our study we performed a literature search in the web of science scopus and pubmed databases and selected all the search results from 2012 onwards our search terms included microplastics and algae microplastics and aquatic plants microplastics and phytoplankton microplastics and macrophytes microplastics and microphytes microplastics and swamp nanoplastics and aquatic plants nanoplastics and phytoplankton nanoplastics and macrophytes nanoplastics and microphytes and nanoplastics and swamp a total of 664 articles excluding duplicates were initially obtained from the search results we developed and executed a very inflexible search strategy to set the inclusion criteria for screening the most suitable unique and reliable data sets all the papers were analyzed thoroughly based on our exclusion criteria and the papers that did not fit into the criteria were readily eliminated without any biases the initial research articles were narrowed down based on the following set of criteria i the study includes the application of plastic particles microplastics and or nanoplastics to freshwater aquatic plants and algae that are also known to harbor urban waters ii the experiments are either conducted under laboratory or field conditions iii a control set i e micro or nanoplastic free concentration was used in addition to one or several treatment groups iv the results are supported by reliable statistical analyses out of all the studies most were eliminated based on the mentioned criteria and the list was polished to 43 articles 2 2 data extraction for meta analysis from the selected articles we extracted data on plant growth photosynthetic pigment content chlorophyll a total carotenoids total protein content and antioxidative enzymes for assessing the plant growth any one of the parameters was considered inhibition percentage plant biomass root growth relative growth rate etc the studies where the mean values of control were missing were considered for normalization by converting them into fold change values irrespective of the concerned growth parameter while for the other studies where treatment sets were accompanied by additional control sets raw values were considered as the data points for the antioxidative enzyme parameter the values for the activity of different antioxidative enzymes e g catalase glutathione peroxidase superoxide dismutase and peroxidase were taken as raw data from the papers considered for meta analysis for the rest of the parameters the data were extracted in a raw form and the results reported in different units were uniformly converted to the same unit before analysis additionally the data extraction on the mentioned parameters was separately done concerning the type size and concentration of micro and nanoplastics the means sample sizes replications and standard deviations were recorded from each study often results were mentioned in the form of graphical diagrams for which we have used web plot digitizer version 4 5 https automeris io webplotdigitizer to digitize the values and for the studies bearing results in a tabulated format results were extracted manually 2 3 data endpoints we considered numerous observations as independent since this is thought to increase the statistical power of meta analysis multiple treatments were placed into three groups low 10 mg ml moderate 10 mg ml to 100 mg ml and high 100 mg ml based on the concentration of mps and or nps used in the study the types of plastics were placed in several groups based on the nature of the polymer ps polystyrene pe polyethylene pp polypropylene pvc polyvinyl chloride pet polyethylene terephthalate pmma polymethyl methacrylate and dbp dibutyl phthalate the growth and stress parameters were further extracted concerning the size of plastic particles microplastics and nanoplastics mps 1 µm nps 1 µm from the 43 selected research articles for meta analysis 83 studies have been obtained with different growth parameters pigment content total protein and antioxidative enzymes to examine the potential bias of publications with multiple observations we calculated the mean effect size of the dataset considering observations from each study and compared this with the effect size calculated with the whole dataset all the datasets were compiled into microsoft excel datasheets and further considered for meta analysis 2 4 meta analysis meta analysis was conducted using the meta package implemented in the r studio version 4 1 1 r foundation for statistical computing platform 2021 the effect size was calculated in terms of mean difference md for the preliminary study we selected a total of 49 studies from 43 research articles to evaluate the growth through meta analysis we compiled the mean growth results along with the standard deviation for both the control and treatment groups the analysis was performed by calculating the md between means implemented in the rma function the mean difference md can be defined as the difference in means between unstandardized raw data of two independent groups van kleunen et al 2010 xie et al 2014 in other terms the mean difference is the measure of the difference in the mean of group 1 x 1 and the mean of group 2 x 2 md x 1 x 2 this statistical entity was used to express the difference in the mean values of the pooled standard deviation and thus played a key role in meta analysis as it has a lower type i error rate for the systematic analysis a random effects model was chosen to examine multiple diverse studies based on different plants concentrations and types of plastic particles we assumed that both the sampling error and the random variation contributed to the variation among comparisons of studies the effect sizes were considered significant only when the 95 cis were represented with non zero values to estimate the heterogeneity and to assess the statistical heterogeneity higgin s i2 and cochran s q statistics were used respectively the i2 statistics can be interpreted as the ratio of true heterogeneity to total heterogeneity across the observed effect sizes the i2 values range from 0 to 100 and the values of 25 25 75 and 75 represent low moderate and high heterogeneity respectively higgins et al 2003 the q value represents the weighted deviations from the summary effect size that are due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error when the q statistics were found to be significant the data were treated to be heterogeneous mayerhofer et al 2013 2 5 analysis of publication bias publication bias analysis is the selection bias that could have occurred when the study has been conducted hak et al 2016 in our study the publication bias for all 49 studies was checked and the presence of asymmetry in the funnel plot was inspected in this connection we have used the trim and fill analysis and also performed the begg and mazumdar rank correlation tests based on kendall s tau to analyze the presence of any bias in the studies begg and mazumdar 1994 the trim and fill method is one of the most immensely used methods for evaluating the publication bias in meta analysis it is a commonly used method to detect any bias and is often used to resolve publication bias issues duval and tweedie 2000 shi and lin 2019 in our study the trim and fill analysis was performed through meta essentials https www erim eur nl research support meta essentials a software developed for the analysis of whether there is any bias in the publication of studies suurmond et al 2017 for the analysis the values of the standard error of individual studies the total number of observations total number of replicates used in control and treatment groups and the mean difference for each study were used as input the standard error of the individual studies was calculated as follows s t a n d a r d e r r o r s d c 2 n c s d t 2 n t where sdc standard deviation of the control group sdt standard deviation of the treatment group nc number of replicas for the control group and nt number of replicas for the treatment group the trim and fill method was followed by the generation of a funnel plot a standardized residual histogram a galbraith plot and a normal quantile plot for assessing the results after adjusting the publication bias 2 6 subgroup analyses subgroup analysis is done to specifically determine the influence of factors such as the size concentration and types of plastic materials and plant classes and whether they have any significant effect on the growth photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll a and carotenoids protein content and antioxidant enzymes for the subgroup analysis we calculated the effect size in terms of standardized mean difference smd in contrast to the mean differences md used for studying the study wise effect of plastic exposure on the growth pattern smd has an advantage over md because it can be taken as a comparison between studies even if some studies do not measure the outcome of interest using the same instruments here smd between groups expresses the difference between the two groups in terms of standard deviations this is calculated by dividing the raw mean of group 1 x 1 and the raw mean of group 2 x 2 with the pooled standard deviation spooled of both the groups s m d b e t w e e n x 1 x 2 s p o o l e d the overall effect size of subgroups was individually calculated using a random effects model here the variance of the summary effect for studies is estimated as v m s 2 n where n cumulative sample size across all studies s standard deviation borenstein et al 2013 some of the subgroups in our study were fixed such as the plant classes and types of plastic materials whereas some were converted from the quantitative data to 2 3 qualitative groups like plastic particle concentration and size of plastic particles for a factor to be included as a subgroup in the meta analysis it has to be included in more than 10 studies n 10 the details of the subgroups are presented below i concentration of plastic the concentration of mps and nps were categorized into three groups such as low 10 mg ml moderate 10 to 100 mg ml and high 100 mg ml ii size of plastic particles the size of plastic particles was subdivided into microplastics and nanoplastics mps 1 µm nps 1 µm iii types of plastic polymers plastic particle types were placed into eight groups based on the polymer type ps polystyrene polyacrylonitrile pan pe polyethylene pp polypropylene pvc polyvinyl chloride pet polyethylene terephthalate pmma polymethyl methacrylate and dbp dibutyl phthalate iv plant classes all the plants mentioned in our systematic review were sub grouped into 8 classes based on the fritsch s and apg iv system of classification chlorophyceae trebouxiophyceae cryptophyceae dinophyceae euglenaceae cyanophyceae polypodiopsida and magnoliopsida 2 7 principal component analysis and determination of tolerance index ti the principal component analysis pca and hierarchical clustering were applied to separate the studied plant members into clusters and to classify them based on responses to plastic induced phytotoxicity pca and hierarchical clustering were performed using r studio to determine the major contributing factors and for the visualization of the pca and clustering dendrogram the pheatmap r package was used to enhance the visibility of variables in the pca scatter plot the scaling function was set to 0 and repel function was set to true the determination of the tolerance index of aquatic plants subjected to water pollutants is least defined in the literature however recently zaghloul et al 2020 proposed a simple method to assess the tolerance level of plants based on their growth under controlled and polluted conditions according to them the tolerance index ti of plants subjected to pollutants can be quantified by the formula as follows t o l e r a n c e i n d e x t i g t g c where gt mean growth subject to plastic contamination gc mean growth in the control set however the study did not mention any threshold value of ti for ascribing the level of tolerance to plants in our study the calculation of gt and gc has been performed to assess the comprehensive tolerance level of plants across high moderate and low concentrations of plastic exposure in this connection the parameters were calculated by using the formulae as follows g t g t l g t m g t h n g c g c l g c m g c h n where gt l growth in the treatment set of lower concentration gt m growth in the treatment set of moderate concentration gt h growth in the treatment set of high concentration gc l growth in the control set of lower concentration gc m growth in the control set of moderate concentration gc h growth in the control set of high concentration n total number of studies in case of the individual plant species in some cases the growth parameters of all the concentrations low moderate or high were not available and therefore not counted as a study similarly multiple values for an individual concentration were counted as different studies the values of all the components have been presented in supplementary file 2 3 results 3 1 selection of papers for meta analysis following the prisma 2020 guidelines 664 research articles without duplicates were obtained from three different databases out of which 89 records were screened based on the relatability of the title of the paper and their abstracts fig 1 later only 58 of them were assessed as eligible papers for full text evaluation further out of these 15 papers were removed in the final round owing to their non relevant research aims absence of proper control and unavailability of required data therefore 43 papers were finally selected for meta analysis fig 2 the list of included and excluded articles during the different stages of this systematic review with the reasons for their exclusion and the plant group wise and genus wise number of papers have been presented in detail in the supplementary file 1 table st 1 5 3 2 study wise effect of mps nps on the growth pattern the study wise meta analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of plastic pollution on the growth patterns of different organisms the growth pattern was studied based on a relative increase or decrease in plant growth exposed to plastic mps nps when compared to the control set for the analysis the inhibition in growth was taken as positive values whereas the increase in growth was expressed as negative values a total number of 83 studies were initially considered for meta analysis from the final list of 43 articles among all the 83 studies only the most effective treatment per paper for an individual organism was considered for analyzing the study wise effect of mps nps on growth responses this resulted in a total number of 49 studies see supplementary file 1 table st 6 the 49 studies were finally evaluated on basis of mean difference md i e the difference in means between the control groups and the treatment groups which was used as a function of the effect size presented in a forest plot fig 3 the forest plot exhibited the occurrence of 7 studies showing a negative effect size md 0 which implied a minimal effect of plastic particles in fact indicating an increase in plant growth these studies involved six plants viz raphidocelis subcapitata md 0 62 and 0 12 chlamydomonas reinhardtii md 0 28 komvophoron sp md 0 39 scenedesmus obliquus md 0 15 myriophyllum spicatum md 0 004 and elodea sp md 0 01 while utricularia vulgaris md 2 05 scenedesmus armatus md 1 4 microcystis flos aquae md 1 26 chlorella pyrenoidosa md 1 12 microcystis aeruginosa md 0 93 showed relatively higher effect sizes implying the greater effect of plastic particles on their growth however some of the organisms like chlorella pyrenoidosa md 0 03 scenedesmus obliquus md 0 06 0 02 nostoc sp md 0 06 and lemna minor md 0 07 depicted a very negligible effect of the exposure to plastic particles the mean effect size of the study was 0 32 0 19 0 45 the weightage of all the studies was more or less similar to each other a p value of 0 0001 contributes to the significance of the outcome of this analysis moreover a high level of heterogeneity i2 99 76 has been calculated in the study which implies a higher degree of variation in the results depicted by the studies considered for the meta analysis 3 3 publication biases and correction the publication bias was evaluated and corrected using the trim and fill method and was accompanied by the begg and mazumdar rank correlation test on kendall s tau out of the 49 studies only 2 studies have been found to reflect some sort of publication bias that has been imputed and corrected using the trim and fill method a kendall s tau value of 0 07 depicts a very low relation among the studies and thus supports a higher level of heterogeneity among the studies the funnel plot remarkably supported the findings as the trim and fill method exhibited a minor adjustment in the mean effect size expressed as md i e from 0 32 to 0 28 implying that most of the studies were not biased fig 4 a the total heterogeneity value i2 was also adjusted from 99 76 to 98 90 depicting similar results as represented by the change in the mean effect size the standardized residual histogram also represented that the z scores of most of the studies were inside the range of the probability levels of the study area except for a few which were outside the probability level fig 4c this demonstrates that each of the studies was close to the range of our mean study results the galbraith plot again showed similar results with most of the studies present between the upper and lower levels of the confidence intervals fig 4b similarly the normal quantile plot displays that most of the study points overlapped with the regression line or were very close to it which contributes to a standard normal distribution of the data fig 4d 3 4 subgroup analysis the effects of mps and or nps on the growth pattern of aquatic plants including algae ferns and angiosperms were further evaluated through subgroup analysis based on five different physiological and biochemical criteria viz growth inhibition chlorophyll a total carotenoids protein content and antioxidative enzymes these subgroups comprised concentration size and type of plastic polymers along with different plant groups for the analysis the subgroup wise data were extracted from the eligible papers separately for individual growth and biochemical parameters which have been presented in supplementary file 2 moreover the heterogeneity statistics for all four subgroups were performed separately for growth chlorophyll a total carotenoids protein content and antioxidative enzyme activity table 1 3 4 1 effect of plastic size plastic particles were differentiated based on their sizes into two categories mps 1 µm and nps 1 µm mps and nps exhibited similar effects on plant growth fig 5 both mps and nps share a nearly indistinguishable size effect expressed in smd in case of subgroup analysis with the lower and upper bounds of confidence intervals i e smd 2 16 ci between 0 31 4 01 and smd 1 98 ci between 0 11 3 84 respectively however photosynthetic pigments showed distinctly variable effects as the effect size in the case of chlorophyll a content was higher in nps with an effect size of 2 53 0 38 4 67 than that of the mps treatment bearing an effect size of 0 88 0 67 2 43 fig 5 similarly in the case of carotenoid content the nps treatment showed a relatively higher effect size of 5 80 2 15 9 45 in comparison to the effect size of mps i e 2 26 0 33 4 20 fig 5 though they also exhibited some sort of overlapping confidence intervals revealing similar effects in some studies the effect of mps on protein content was almost negligible showing a very small effect size of 0 11 1 42 1 64 in comparison to the effect size of nps i e 0 83 2 50 0 84 fig 5 therefore the inhibiting effects of nps on protein content was are more prominent than that of the mps also the effect size of mps i e 1 42 3 12 0 28 on antioxidant enzymes was relatively less negative than that of nps fig 5 this depicts a higher activity of antioxidative enzymes in plants exposed to nps 3 4 2 effect of plastic concentration the subgroup analysis was also conducted for analyzing the effect of low 10 mg ml moderate 10 mg ml to 100 mg ml and high 100 mg ml concentrations of plastic fig 6 in general the increasing concentrations of mps nps irrespective of their size significantly decreased the growth of plants the subgroup analysis revealed that the effect size of low and moderate concentrations of plastic was 1 04 0 57 2 64 and 2 78 0 69 4 87 respectively the analysis also revealed that the effect size of a high concentration of plastic was significantly higher than that of the other two groups i e 3 39 1 01 5 77 as observed from the more or less similar confidence intervals it could be concluded that the extent of the negative effect of the moderate and high concentrations of plastic is more or less similar interestingly the chlorophyll a content was majorly affected by the moderate concentration of plastic particles as depicted by an effect size of 6 76 2 52 10 05 fig 6 in comparison the higher concentration was relatively tender to affect the chlorophyll a content as observed from its lesser effect size of 1 91 0 09 3 74 similar results were observed in the case of carotenoid content where the pigment contents were highly affected by a moderate concentration of plastic as observed from the effect size of 5 05 2 02 8 08 fig 6 this was relatively higher than that of the high and low concentrations of plastic 4 04 and 1 23 respectively however the effect size of the low concentration smd 0 18 1 33 1 70 and the moderate concentration of plastic smd 0 04 1 45 1 54 showed a negligible effect or influence on the changes in protein content though the high concentration of plastic contributed to the increase in protein content as observed from its negative effect size of 0 47 2 09 1 16 fig 6 similarly the high concentration of plastic affected the expression of antioxidative enzymes therefore showing a distinctly negative effect size of 0 72 2 37 0 94 fig 6 3 4 3 effect of plastic polymer type the dbp type of plastic showed the highest effect size of 4 74 1 62 7 86 implying its greater effect on plant growth pan pe and pet somehow showed a nearly similar levels of effect sizes smd 1 56 1 59 and 1 15 respectively fig 7 while pmma pp and pvc showed relatively higher effect sizes smd 3 95 2 98 and 4 25 respectively polystyrene ps the most studied plastic here shows an intermediate effect size among the studies plastic materials i e 2 21 0 32 4 10 all the plastic types exhibited a somewhat similar range of ci values predicting similar effects in some studies in case of chlorophyll a content ps showed the highest effect size of 6 29 2 56 10 03 while the effect size was moderate in case of pmma pp and pvc smd 0 53 1 53 and 3 07 respectively fig 7 however negative effects sizes have been observed in case of pe smd 0 55 2 18 1 08 and pet smd 0 42 1 76 0 93 in the case of total carotenoid content ps showed a significantly large effect size of 8 51 3 81 13 21 fig 7 the effect sizes of pmma pp and pvc were also more or less similar on the other hand pe and pet displayed effect sizes near zero smd 0 49 and 1 13 respectively indicating no effect on carotenoid content whereas pe showed a negative effect size the highest effect on protein content was conferred by pet showing an effect size of 2 26 0 21 4 30 fig 7 pvc and pmma also displayed similar effect sizes smd 0 86 and 1 04 respectively whereas the effects were nearly negligible in the cases of pan and ps smd 0 and 0 02 respectively negative effects sizes were calculated in case of pe and pp i e 1 80 3 70 0 09 and 3 72 6 36 1 07 respectively moreover the pe have shown a distinguishable and larger effect size of 4 95 1 72 8 18 in the case of antioxidant enzymes indicating a decline in the antioxidative activity fig 7 the rest of the plastic types showed smaller effect sizes smd 0 68 that proclaim an increase in the antioxidant enzyme activity 3 4 4 effect of plant groups to visualize the specific responses of plant groups towards plastic contamination the organisms were subdivided into 8 classes members of cryptophyceae exhibited the highest effect size of 8 15 3 43 13 58 befitting the most affected algal group in terms of growth when exposed to plastic fig 8 while the classes polypodipopsida and magnoliopsida have shown significantly smaller effect sizes smd 0 93 and 0 80 respectively among all the groups a moderate effect on growth was demonstrated by the rest of the plant groups on the other hand the members of chlorophyceae displayed the highest effect size of 10 41 4 31 16 51 in the case of chlorophyll a followed by trebouxiophyceae cyanophyceae polypodiopsida cryptophyceae and others fig 8 the smallest effect sizes were noted in magnoliopsida smd 0 06 and euglenaceae smd 0 88 indicating a negligible effect of plastic on chlorophyll a content trebouxiophyceae showed the smallest effect size of 0 49 2 12 1 13 while the rest of the plant groups showed a positive effect size in the case of carotenoid content fig 8 further cryptophyceae and polypodiopsida showed the highest effects sizes smd 3 46 and 3 42 respectively with more or less similar confidence intervals in the case of protein content dinophyceae showed the largest effect size of 9 84 4 05 15 63 indicating the significant effect of plastic on retarding protein biosynthesis fig 8 on the other hand chlorophyceae showed the smallest effect size of 2 16 4 18 0 15 in the case of antioxidative enzymes chlorophyceae alone elucidated a positive effect size of 0 30 1 31 1 91 fig 8 the rest of the plant groups showed negative effect sizes smd 1 26 the group magnoliopsida showed the smallest effect size of 3 04 4 71 1 38 implying an elevated antioxidant activity when exposed to plastic 3 5 principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering corresponds to the tolerance index of plant species pca analysis of the studied plant members exhibited the clustering of plant species based on the examined variables i e growth physiological and biochemical responses denoting that the responses of the plant members were markedly affected by the exposure to plastics fig 9 a the pca biplot showed a total variability of 72 3 with dim1 and dim2 accounting for 44 6 and 27 7 of the variability respectively between the studied plant groups and physio biochemical responses fig 9 the loading plot unveils that the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll a accessory pigment carotenoids protein and antioxidative activity were major contributors to the separation of microcystis and rhodomonas similarly photosynthetic pigments contributed to the separation of chlamydomonas and salvinia also gymnodinium and euglena were separated in the biplot based on protein content furthermore the pca analysis revealed that gymnodinium euglena chlorella and scenedesmus showed a positive correlation with protein on other hand a negative correlation was noted between microcystis rhodomonas chlamydomonas and salvinia with growth antioxidative activity and pigments moreover the hierarchical clustering of the studied plant members highlighted a strong relationship among the species like scenedesmus salvinia raphidocelis euglena lemna dunaliella nostoc elodea myriophyllum and komvophoron and thus separated into a distinct subset s1 fig 9b whereas plant members like gymnodinium chlamydomonas microcystis rhodomonas euglena and chlorella settled in diverse subsets in the dendrogram in the present study the tolerance index ti was determined solely on the growth response of the plant species to plastic exposure the assessment of the ti against plastic exposure displayed differential responses of the plant species as presented through the spider plot fig 9c out of the 18 plant species a total of 9 species showed a ti index of 0 8 indicating somewhat better performance in terms of physiological and biochemical responses these species except salvinia ti 0 79 correlated with the s1 subset of the dendrogram moreover the species such as komvophoron elodea myriophyllum and nostoc exhibited a ti score of 1 suggesting their comparatively higher tolerance within the species clubbed in the s1 subset on the other hand the species with a ti score of 0 7 indicated poor performance and coincided with the species poorly clubbed in a cluster in the dendrogram 4 discussion recent ecotoxicological studies have unveiled a significant increase in the release of toxic water pollutants among them plastics mps nps are shown to have an extensive impact on the aquatic plant groups mateos cárdenas et al 2021 currently plastics mps nps are emerging as a grievous concern in the social and scientific arena owing to their perpetuity toxicity and ubiquitous distribution across ecosystems green et al 2021 therefore the present study was undertaken to revisit the experimental findings concerning the effect of mps and nps on growth biochemical protein and antioxidative enzymes and photosynthetic chlorophyll a and carotenoids indices of aquatic microflora to date no comprehensive analyses have been performed including meta analysis to appraise the impact of plastic pollution on aquatic flora especially freshwater flora that harbours the urban waters in this connection the meta analysis approach has been employed to appraise the impact of plastic types concentrations and exposure time on aquatic flora some algal genera like anabaena nostoc chlorella scenedesmus euglena chlamydomonas etc and other macrophytes like elodea myriophyllum lemna spirodela salvinia etc predominantly inhabit the urban waters jafari and gunale 2006 zub et al 2019 therefore the present study will provide an insight into the effect of plastic contamination in the urban aquatic ecosystem the impact of plastic is known to be influenced by several factors like particle size polymer types surface charge and exposure durations rillig et al 2019 moreover the plastic particles incite variable responses in different plant species mateos cárdenas et al 2021 in terms of size plastic particles can be mainly categorized into two groups namely microplastics mps and nanoplastics nps that are found to float upon the surface water thereby creating a microlayer on the surface kalčíková 2020 eerkes medrano et al 2015 thereupon the plastic particles are known to majorly interact with the floating algal groups and aquatic macrophytes studies have confirmed that the small sized plastic particles are more attracted to the plant surface and get aggregated in the external tissues in greater amounts mateos cárdenas et al 2021 in this connection several researchers have previously demonstrated the negative impact of nps on several algal species in terms of growth inhibition casado et al 2013 besseling et al 2014 sjollema et al 2016 on the contrary several studies based on mps size 1 10 μm exhibited moderate to no toxicity in most of the cases bergami et al 2017 gambardella et al 2019 garrido et al 2019 moreover the mps with even larger particle sizes 100 μm generally exhibited no or minimal impact and were even found to increase algal growth canniff and hoang 2018 chae et al 2019 however the present study showed a positive and equivalent effect size of mps and nps on the studied plant models indicating an adverse effect of plastics on plant growth irrespective of their particle size on the contrary a much higher effect size of the nps on photosynthetic pigments was observed in comparison to the mps which may be directly responsible for the retardation of plant growth this is in agreement with the reports of yan et al 2021 where exposure of chlamydomonas reinhardtii to ps nps showed a reduction of 72 8 and 72 6 in the contents of total chlorophyll and carotenoids respectively when compared to the control set at the same time a much lower reduction of 26 5 and 22 9 in total chlorophyll and carotenoid were reported when treated with ps mps the study further confirmed that the increased dose of plastics and decreasing size of ps particles significantly reduced chlorophyll autofluorescence in the microalgal cells therefore it could be ascertained that the nps owing to their smaller particle size can impart greater toxicity to the aquatic flora however the study by yan et al 2021 also corroborated our findings where the activity of antioxidative enzymes gradually increased with the increase in the dosage of ps nps and ps mps plastics are also shown to impart phytotoxic effects such as hindrance in nutrient uptake decrease in the rate of respiration photosynthesis and growth of aquatic flora in a dose dependent manner kalcíková et al 2017 van weert et al 2019 rilling et al 2019 mateos cárdenas et al 2021 the present study showed a similar effect size of moderate and high doses of plastic treatment on the growth of studied plant groups this result is in agreement with the findings of tunali et al 2020 who have formerly reported a notable inhibition in the growth of chlorella vulgaris subjected to 50 1000 mg l 1 ps mps whereas a negligible effect of the same plastic material at lower concentrations i e at 1 and 5 mg l 1 was observed the study also reported that moderate to higher doses of ps mps strikingly reduced the photosynthetic pigments a similar response was also noted in the current meta analysis indicating that moderate 10 100 mg l 1 to higher doses 100 mg l 1 of mps and nps can effectively lower the biosynthesis of photosynthetic pigments which further gets augmented when the particle size was reduced this is also in agreement with the findings of yan et al 2021 who have previously reported a much higher reduction of chlorophyll a in chlamydomonas reinhardtii exposed to 500 mg l 1 mps nps when compared to the 50 mg l 1 treated plants moreover a recent study depicting the impact of ps nps on a freshwater macroalga anabaena sp exhibited a dynamic protein profile tamayo belda et al 2021 the report also provided insight into the differential expression profile of stress responsive genes oxidative stress photosynthesis metabolism carbon nitrogen and nucleic acid and signal related proteins in a dose dependent manner therefore it could be concluded that the dose or concentration of the plastics irrespective of the particle size imparts significant changes at the biochemical and molecular levels the effect of plastics on plant growth is also influenced by the type of plastic polymers to which it is exposed in this connection the present study depicted that the dbp polymers have the maximum effect size in terms of growth inhibition followed by pvc pmma and pe a previous study by zhu et al 2019 also suggested that the polymer of plastics like pvc employs more toxicity than pe and ps which was observed in terms of growth reduction by 29 25 3 and 24 7 respectively in the microalga skeletonema costatum exposed to 100 mg l 1 of the plastic particles these differences in the effects of plastic polymers on plant growth may also be correlated to the varying degree of charges present on the outer surface it has been emphasized by several researchers that plastic particles with a relatively positive or lesser negative charge on the surface greatly affect the growth of plants feng et al 2019 sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 in this context wang et al 2016 have shown that the dbp polymers exhibit a zeta potential of 20 to 25 mv at a ph of 4 7 comparatively the ps particles that exhibited a lesser effect on growth compared to dbp in our study have been shown to possess a relatively negative zeta potential 44 1 mv yasir et al 2022 this indicated that the lesser negative charges on the surface of plastic polymers significantly affect plant growth due to their greater interaction with the plant cell wall furthermore our results also showed that the ps polymers imparted the highest effect size in terms of reduction in pigment contents followed by pvc pmma and pp this is in agreement with the findings of wu et al 2019 who reported the reduction of fv fm fv fm and fv f0 values in two freshwater algae chlorella pyrenoidosa and microcystis flos aquae when exposed to pvc and pp this indicated that the accumulation of these plastic polymers could somehow disturb the efficiency of electron transmission and thereby inhibit the rate of photosynthesis the study further confirmed that pvc showed much greater toxicity than pp in terms of its effect on the thylakoid membrane another study unveiled that 1 mg l 1 ps mps exerted much higher toxicity in terms of growth inhibition and reduced photosynthetic pigment content in the freshwater microalga euglena gracilis in comparison to ps nps liao et al 2020 apart from these a recent study reported a noticeable increase in total soluble protein in chlamydomonas reinhardtii when exposed to 100 mg l 1 ps mps for 10 days li et al 2020b on the contrary pvc polymers imparted the maximum reduction in total protein content of acutodesmus obliquus when compared with the effect of pp and pvc when the plants were treated with 250 mg l 1 of the plastic materials ansari et al 2021 our study unveils that the dose and polymer type highly affect ros production and antioxidative responses in the studied plants while plastic size does not impart any significant contribution towards antioxidative responses this is in agreement with the results of song et al 2020 who reported that pet polymers can induce a maximum increase in superoxide dismutase activity in chlorella sp and phaeodactylum tricornutum followed by pe pvc and pp whereas all the studied polymers noticeably reduced catalase activity the present meta analysis also evaluated the variable responses of plant species to plastic exposure based on their systematic position among the studied plant groups the members of euglenaceae trebouxiophyceace and chlorophyceae were the most affected while the members of cryptophyceae along with polypodiopsida and magnoliopsida represented the least affected plant groups in terms of growth inhibition moreover on analysing the tolerance index ti of the plant species two cyanobacterial members komvophoron and nostoc showed a much higher ti 0 8 which also corroborated with the clustering analysis based on the studied physio biochemical markers along with the other macrophyte species our results are also in agreement with a recent study that established that the planktonic alga komvophoron and nostoc exhibited a much better performance in terms of growth and photosynthetic activity subjected to up to 100 µg l ps nps rowenczyk et al 2021 our results further indicated that the algal species are more susceptible to plastic contaminants this may be explained based on the surface morphology that tends to favor the attraction and retention of mps and nps due to the cellulosic composition and the electrostatic charge on the surface of most of the algal species bhattacharya et al 2010 on the other hand the roots of larger macrophytic members are known to be associated with various microorganisms and the exposure of mps nps has been found to enhance the rapid colonization of biofilm producing microbes which eventually helped in minimizing the adsorption of plastic on the root surface rummel et al 2017 kokalj et al 2019 the present study also revealed a much higher degree of impact on chlorophyll a of cyanophyceae followed by cryptophyceae bacillariophyceae chlorophyceae and other algal members while a negligible effect was observed in the members of polypodiopsida and magnoliopsida some previous studies have also revealed that the ps nps were found to significantly reduce the pigment content and photosynthetic yield of freshwater alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii while the aquatic macrophytes like lemna minor and spirodela polyrhiza exhibited a negligible effect in terms of photosynthetic pigments and yield yan et al 2021 kalcíková et al 2017 mateos cárdenas et al 2021 therefore this study presents the variable responses of the aquatic species toward plastic pollutants in freshwater the effect of which has been quantified in terms of tolerance index in this connection the present study also attempts to pinpoint the plant species that may be selectively grown in plastic contaminated freshwaters 5 limitations of the study and points for refinement the current investigation attempts to provide a systematic insight into the emerging issue of plastic pollution in the freshwater ecosystem during the present meta analysis we experienced various hurdles that have been enlisted below i a very small number of studies have evaluated the effect of mps nps on the flora of the freshwater ecosystem therefore the increasing number of studies on this topic will increase the robustness of such analysis in the future ii the studies on growth patterns plastic concentration size etc have been presented differently in the screened articles therefore it is desirable to form a consensus on the parameters to be studied for assessing the ecotoxicological impact of plastic particles iii the studies lack standardized experimental designs for the establishment of resistance or susceptibility indices therefore we have faced difficulty in quantifying the tolerance level of the individual species in our study iv the number of studies mentioning the effect on a particular plant species is also limited therefore it was not possible to ascertain the tolerance level of species with a high level of confidence considering the above mentioned points it could be realized that there is a need to form a consensus among the researchers working on the assessment of plastic pollution in the freshwater ecosystem we have observed with the studies on air pollution that the air pollution tolerance index apti and anticipated performance index api have been used effectively to assess the impact of air pollution on flora kaur and nagpal 2017 apti has been calculated by using the formula proposed by singh and rao 1983 a p t i a t p r 10 where a ascorbic acid content mg g p ph of leaf extract t total chlorophyll mg g and r relative water content of fresh leaves similarly the api value of an organism is based on the percentage score obtained by the organism the percentage score can be calculated as a p i s c o r e g r a d e s o b t a i n e d b y p l a n t s p e c i e s m a x i m u m p o s s i b l e g r a d e s f o r a n y p l a n t s in this context several biomarkers have been given utmost importance such as ph of the cell sap relative water content ascorbate and chlorophyll content therefore taking a cue from this several biomarkers can also be selected for the assessment of water pollution in aquatic flora in our study we have selected several attributes that have been mostly quantified in the articles selected for meta analysis and contribute majorly to the overall performance of the plants in plastic polluted waterbodies these parameters include total carotenoid content chlorophyll content antioxidative enzyme activity and protein content which exhibit their major contribution in the loading plot fig 9b and were responsible for the clustering of the species in the dendrogram fig 9c based on their overall performance this also corroborated with the tolerance index of species fig 9c that was calculated by taking growth response as a sole factor for future consideration several other parameters like cell sap ph electrolyte leakage and total chlorophyll can be considered to framework a universal scale for determining the tolerance level of species 6 conclusion and future perspectives even though there is a lesser number of studies available on the impact of mps and or nps on the primary producers of the freshwater ecosystem the present study attempts to present a comprehensive outlook on the consequences of plastic pollution on freshwater aquatic flora the present meta analysis revealed that the plastic size dose and polymer types inevitably impact plant growth both mps and nps can equally affect plant growth antioxidative enzymes pigments and protein content however most of the studies emphasized that the nps can affect plant members to a greater extent in terms of the studied physio biochemical parameters moreover among the studied plastic polymers pvc pmma and pe were found to induce more toxicity than pan pp ps and pet also the algal groups were more attenuated by plastic induced phytotoxicity when compared to the members of the cyanophyceae polypodiopsida and magnoliopsida in this connection the aquatic plant species like komvophoron elodea myriophyllum nostoc raphidocelis scenedesmus utricularia dunaliella and lemna demonstrated relatively higher tolerance against plastic induced toxicity and therefore could be preferably suggested for propagation in the urban waterbodies to restore water quality and balance of the ecosystem moreover this study has propounded a reliable method for the calculation of the tolerance index ti of species exposed to plastic particles which also reciprocated with the clustering of the species based on the studied biochemical parameters viz chlorophyll and carotenoid content protein content and activity of antioxidative enzymes therefore this study will help the researchers in framing the experimental design for properly assessing the level of tolerance of species with a greater degree of conformity credit authorship contribution statement dibakar ghosh data curation investigation
