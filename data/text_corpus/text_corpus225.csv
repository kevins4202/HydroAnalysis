1125,water dependent ecosystems are highly vulnerable to climate change and human induced alterations this is especially true for ecosystems of urban catchments where aquatic habitats are already being degraded this study examines prospective impacts of future climate change and anticipated urbanization on water quantity and quality in the urbanized torrens catchment south australia the eco hydrological model swat has been applied to simulate flow total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp for the following scenarios 1 scenarios based on future precipitation and temperature patterns for the period from 2021 to 2050 by means of two representative pathways rcps of six downscaled global circulation models 2 a scenario on the hypothetical urbanization of the torrens catchment over the next 30 years based on the projected population growth in the region scenario 1 suggests there will be a declining monthly flow due to increased temperature and decreased precipitation and consequently reduced tn and tp loads in contrast scenario 2 predicts a higher monthly flow and tp loads resulting from extended impermeable areas due to urbanization but lower tn loads due to the shrinking grassland taken over by urban land use the combination of both scenarios shows the offset of their effects on the flow and tp loads along with decreasing tn loads the results of this study suggest that in the long term urbanization is of greater concern for the torrens catchment than future climate change management decisions have to take into account the enhanced vulnerability of urban

implemented in this study to address three scenarios climate change urbanization and a combined scenario of climate change and urbanization fig 2 the climate change scenario was based on the projected climate data of six global climate models gcm under two emission scenario rcps in addition to the two rcps three of the 100 realizations of each of the gcms were selected for scenario runs these realizations were selected from the 10th 50th and 90th percentiles of the projected annual precipitation of each gcm see fig 2 while data from the same selected realization of precipitation were selected for other climate variables as a result a total of 36 climate scenarios 6 climate models 2 emissions scenarios and 3 realizations were created to test the calibrated swat model other model inputs were fixed during the climate change scenario simulation for the urbanization scenario the study assumes that the urban land budget will not change significantly i e the overall percentage of the developed area remains constant while the urban population density is expected to triple according to the 30 year plan for greater adelaide report dplg 2010 this was modelled by preserving the relative percentages of land uses and adjusting the land use classification of residential which accounts for 38 6 of the total land budget from low residential into high residential categories this change resulted in the increase of the fraction of total impervious areas fimp of the residential land use from 0 12 to 0 60 neitsch et al 2011 and the overall increase of catchment impermeable area from all urban lands from 16 7 to 35 2 see fig 2 to conform to the climate scenarios the baseline and future urbanization scenarios were run with historical climate data from six global climate models rather than with the climate data of the calibration and validation periods the combined scenario of urbanization and climate change was tested by integrating the inputs of both the climate change projections and those of the urbanization scenario in order to analyze the results the relative change in percentage between the results of each scenario and those of the baseline scenario were calculated for flow tn and tp 3 results and discussion 3 1 patterns of future climate change the climate data projected by an ensemble of gcms that are summarized in table 1 show an overall decrease in the annual precipitation from 3 5 to 6 7 and an increase in the annual temperature from 1 1 to 1 4 c averaged from six gcms under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively the high emission scenario rcp 8 5 resulted in a greater increase in projected temperature and a greater decline in projected precipitation over the period from 2021 to 2050 see table 1 there were variations across the projection ranges for precipitation and temperature changes across the six gcms overall an increasing trend was observed in all the scenarios regarding temperature while agreement on the overall trend was lower for precipitation with one of the six models showing an opposite trend 3 2 impacts of climate change on flow and nutrient loads 3 2 1 impacts on flow fig 3 displays flows simulated by each gcm with two emission scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 of the ensemble model the changes in runoff under these climate change scenarios reflected the dominant effect of precipitation in comparison to temperature decreases in precipitation resulted in the decrease of the evapotranspiration which accounted for approximately 61 of water loss from the urban torrens catchment and the decrease in the overall water yield meanwhile a higher air temperature caused a remarkable increase in the pet but did not result in an increase of the evapotranspiration ratio due to the water shortage from precipitation as a result the annual flow decreased on average by 8 0 and 13 6 under scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively this range is comparable with the projections by shrestha et al 2017 and westra et al 2014 which used the same climate projection input from the silo source to predict the climate impacts on the flow of a nearby catchment rcp 8 5 produced a lower flow than rcp 4 5 for all months of the year according to the output of the ensemble climate model in particular the decrease in flow fluctuated from 1 8 to 13 7 and 5 7 to 23 4 under scenarios rcp 4 5 and 8 5 seasonally the most extreme declines are observed in spring and summer fig 3 table 2 which are already dry seasons in this catchment rebbeck et al 2007 there is a shift in the monthly patterns of the results across different climate models while the gfdl esm2m and ipsl cm5blr models showed consistent agreement with the results of the ensemble modelling other models indicated a slight increase in monthly runoff mostly in autumn and winter seasons in particular the canesm2 scenario indicated an increase in flow for all the winter months ranging from 3 4 to 13 8 under rcp 4 5 and 0 5 to 18 4 under the rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively this pattern was closely correlated with the relative change in seasonal rainfall which indicated that rainfall is one of the most important factors affecting the catchment hydrology nassif and wilson 1975 martinez mena et al 1998 a comparative analysis among the predicted results produced by six single gcms suggested an uncertainty across the different climate projections and that it is important to analyze the ensemble modelling approach in climate studies e g feyen and dankers 2009 hovenga et al 2016 3 2 2 impacts on nutrient loads monthly distributions of tn and tp loads simulated by six gcms and an ensemble of gcms are presented in figs 4 and 5 flow predictions deriving from the ensemble model suggested an overall decline for both tn and tp over the period of thirty years and that this would be most notable in the spring and summer months figs 4 and 5 table 2 declining tn and tp loads were more pronounced for rcp 8 5 i e at 21 2 and 28 9 on an average annual time step similar to the ensemble model the results of the single gcms showed significant reductions in tn and tp loads when compared with the historical data the drop in the annual average projected tn and tp loads at the catchment outlet were most significant for the gfdl esm2m scenario up to 26 2 and 34 respectively while a lower decrease belonged to the canesm2 scenario up to 18 5 and 29 2 respectively following the pattern of flow reductions the fluctuations in the predicted monthly values of different climate projections were notable too with some months of increasing nutrient loads mostly in the wet periods of autumn and winter 3 2 3 uncertainty in climate change projections the deviation in projected monthly values in comparison with the historical simulated data was remarkable across the different gcms for climate change scenarios for all three model outputs flow tn and tp loads which confirmed the importance of considering an ensemble approach for the climate impact studies however the uncertainty of each gcm projection which was represented in this study by the simulated results using the median realization versus the combination of 10th 50th and 90th realizations of the climate data inputs was low fig 6 the variance in the projected flow using single and sets of three realizations of climate input data from six gcms was minor 0 26 and 0 21 for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively the deviations for the tp load simulations were on average less than 1 for two emission scenarios and less than 1 5 for the tn load predictions this suggests that the use of a median realization or a set of realizations from the same climate model may not cause important differences in the climate change projections 3 3 impacts of urbanization on flow and nutrient loads the impacts of future urbanization on the torrens river catchment were addressed in the present study using the historical climate data of 1976 2005 as a baseline period rather than the calibrated period of 2011 2013 this study suggests that future urbanization may result in an overall increase of 26 9 in monthly flow which corresponds to an increase of approximately 20 in the impervious surface of the study area the discovered streamflow patterns affected by urbanization correspond well with findings from previous studies such as those by richards et al 2008 qiu and wang 2014 and sch√ºtte and schulze 2017 the tp loads followed the same pattern as the streamflow with a higher load of 44 4 released from the catchment on an annual basis under future urbanization in comparison with the historical period the largest increases in the tp load of 51 5 occurred during winter due to the increase in precipitation and surface flow and can be explained by the fact that phosphorus is primarily transported by sediments in the surface streamflow increases in streamflow caused an increase in the sediment yield primarily from soil erosion of permeable grassland areas and partially from sediment accumulated on the expanded areas of impermeable surface of residential land uses this corresponded to the increase in annual organic phosphorous and soluble phosphorous in the surface flow at a rate of 9 and 41g ha year respectively in the case of the tn load the model predicted an opposite pattern the tn decreased annually by 9 7 fig 7 but increased during wet autumn and winter months by 18 3 and 17 9 respectively table 2 the overall decrease in the annual tn load is mostly affected by the loss of sources of nitrogen due to leaching from fertilizer applied on grasslands when the grasslands were converted to impermeable urban lands and nitrogen loss from groundwater together the rate of annual nitrogen loss from the two sources was recorded as 20g ha year during the wet seasons in autumn and winter however the increase in both tn and tp loads reflects the fact that a large amount of pollutants in this urban catchment are released to river catchments during intensive rainfall periods ilman and gell 1998 clark et al 2015 alongside this it is also important to mention that the sewage system in the study area is separated from the stormwater drainage network thus future urbanization will not necessarily drive an increase in waste water releases to the surface flow 3 4 combined impacts of climate change and urbanization on flow and nutrient loads coupling of future climate change and urbanization scenarios was simulated for each gcm and the results of an ensemble of six gcms as shown in fig 7 the results of this study showed an offsetting effect from the opposite trends of climate change and urbanization scenario projections on the flow and tp variables while the trend was further strengthened by the combined scenario for the tn variable due to cumulative effects this trend is consistent with previous studies on the topic of climate and land use changes e g teshager et al 2016 shrestha et al 2017 wang and kalin 2018 the results of this study also suggested that the flow characteristics in the torrens river catchment is affected by both climate climate change land use and land use change through development policy in particular the results of the study showed the dominant effects of the urbanization scenario over the climate change scenario which agrees with the review by grimmond 2007 while there was a decrease in average annual flow under the ensemble climate change scenario the increased area of impervious surfaces contributed to a decrease in water infiltration and caused an increase of 15 6 and 11 5 in annual water yield for the combined scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively fig 7 the variation of tp followed the flow trend as well with an overall increase of 17 0 and 12 0 in the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively in the case of tn the decrease in tn loads by 7 3 under the climate change scenario did not affect the overall increasing trend of tn loads by 14 0 for the combined scenario during winter periods while the decrease of tn loads under sole urbanization and climate change scenarios by 9 7 and 21 2 respectively in the case of rcp 8 5 resulted in an overall decrease of 32 6 in the average annual tn loads in the combined scenario these results suggest that in an already dry climate the effects of global climate change are not as serious as the effects of local urbanization this finding is of particular importance for pollution control and mitigation considering the increased pattern of both flow and nutrient loads during the winter months from may to july 4 conclusions impacts of climate change and urbanization on the flow and nutrient loads of the torrens river catchment have been forecast for the period from 2021 to 2050 by feeding outputs of six gcms into the swat model the results indicated that 1 a future drier climate may lead to a decline in both flow and nutrient loads with the most remarkable decrease being projected for the spring and summer seasons under the high emission scenario rcp 8 5 the deviation of the simulation data caused by selecting a median realization or a combination of several realizations of each gcm was not noticeable when compared with the uncertainty in projected results across different gcms 2 future urbanization may cause higher flow and tp loads while the tn loads are expected to decrease as a result of the impact of increased impermeable areas on grasslands 3 even though climate change plays an important role in catchment conditions urbanization is expected to have predominant control over the eco hydrological state of the torrens river catchment in particular during the winter months the study currently applies the default configuration of urban dat in swat for the static representation of land use changes thus what if scenarios on urbanization focus currently at the extremes of possible impacts on the catchment in order to reveal tipping points in transitional effects of urbanization future work will apply the concept of dynamic land use changes e g wagner et al 2016 besides unlike climate change which cannot be controlled on a local scale urban development should aim to sustain aquatic habitats minimizing the impacts of urbanization on the hydrology and water quality of catchments may mitigate the stresses on the already degraded condition of aquatic

implemented in this study to address three scenarios climate change urbanization and a combined scenario of climate change and urbanization fig 2 the climate change scenario was based on the projected climate data of six global climate models gcm under two emission scenario rcps in addition to the two rcps three of the 100 realizations of each of the gcms were selected for scenario runs these realizations were selected from the 10th 50th and 90th percentiles of the projected annual precipitation of each gcm see fig 2 while data from the same selected realization of precipitation were selected for other climate variables as a result a total of 36 climate scenarios 6 climate models 2 emissions scenarios and 3 realizations were created to test the calibrated swat model other model inputs were fixed during the climate change scenario simulation for the urbanization scenario the study assumes that the urban land budget will not change significantly i e the overall percentage of the developed area remains constant while the urban population density is expected to triple according to the 30 year plan for greater adelaide report dplg 2010 this was modelled by preserving the relative percentages of land uses and adjusting the land use classification of residential which accounts for 38 6 of the total land budget from low residential into high residential categories this change resulted in the increase of the fraction of total impervious areas fimp of the residential land use from 0 12 to 0 60 neitsch et al 2011 and the overall increase of catchment impermeable area from all urban lands from 16 7 to 35 2 see fig 2 to conform to the climate scenarios the baseline and future urbanization scenarios were run with historical climate data from six global climate models rather than with the climate data of the calibration and validation periods the combined scenario of urbanization and climate change was tested by integrating the inputs of both the climate change projections and those of the urbanization scenario in order to analyze the results the relative change in percentage between the results of each scenario and those of the baseline scenario were calculated for flow tn and tp 3 results and discussion 3 1 patterns of future climate change the climate data projected by an ensemble of gcms that are summarized in table 1 show an overall decrease in the annual precipitation from 3 5 to 6 7 and an increase in the annual temperature from 1 1 to 1 4 c averaged from six gcms under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively the high emission scenario rcp 8 5 resulted in a greater increase in projected temperature and a greater decline in projected precipitation over the period from 2021 to 2050 see table 1 there were variations across the projection ranges for precipitation and temperature changes across the six gcms overall an increasing trend was observed in all the scenarios regarding temperature while agreement on the overall trend was lower for precipitation with one of the six models showing an opposite trend 3 2 impacts of climate change on flow and nutrient loads 3 2 1 impacts on flow fig 3 displays flows simulated by each gcm with two emission scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 of the ensemble model the changes in runoff under these climate change scenarios reflected the dominant effect of precipitation in comparison to temperature decreases in precipitation resulted in the decrease of the evapotranspiration which accounted for approximately 61 of water loss from the urban torrens catchment and the decrease in the overall water yield meanwhile a higher air temperature caused a remarkable increase in the pet but did not result in an increase of the evapotranspiration ratio due to the water shortage from precipitation as a result the annual flow decreased on average by 8 0 and 13 6 under scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively this range is comparable with the projections by shrestha et al 2017 and westra et al 2014 which used the same climate projection input from the silo source to predict the climate impacts on the flow of a nearby catchment rcp 8 5 produced a lower flow than rcp 4 5 for all months of the year according to the output of the ensemble climate model in particular the decrease in flow fluctuated from 1 8 to 13 7 and 5 7 to 23 4 under scenarios rcp 4 5 and 8 5 seasonally the most extreme declines are observed in spring and summer fig 3 table 2 which are already dry seasons in this catchment rebbeck et al 2007 there is a shift in the monthly patterns of the results across different climate models while the gfdl esm2m and ipsl cm5blr models showed consistent agreement with the results of the ensemble modelling other models indicated a slight increase in monthly runoff mostly in autumn and winter seasons in particular the canesm2 scenario indicated an increase in flow for all the winter months ranging from 3 4 to 13 8 under rcp 4 5 and 0 5 to 18 4 under the rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively this pattern was closely correlated with the relative change in seasonal rainfall which indicated that rainfall is one of the most important factors affecting the catchment hydrology nassif and wilson 1975 martinez mena et al 1998 a comparative analysis among the predicted results produced by six single gcms suggested an uncertainty across the different climate projections and that it is important to analyze the ensemble modelling approach in climate studies e g feyen and dankers 2009 hovenga et al 2016 3 2 2 impacts on nutrient loads monthly distributions of tn and tp loads simulated by six gcms and an ensemble of gcms are presented in figs 4 and 5 flow predictions deriving from the ensemble model suggested an overall decline for both tn and tp over the period of thirty years and that this would be most notable in the spring and summer months figs 4 and 5 table 2 declining tn and tp loads were more pronounced for rcp 8 5 i e at 21 2 and 28 9 on an average annual time step similar to the ensemble model the results of the single gcms showed significant reductions in tn and tp loads when compared with the historical data the drop in the annual average projected tn and tp loads at the catchment outlet were most significant for the gfdl esm2m scenario up to 26 2 and 34 respectively while a lower decrease belonged to the canesm2 scenario up to 18 5 and 29 2 respectively following the pattern of flow reductions the fluctuations in the predicted monthly values of different climate projections were notable too with some months of increasing nutrient loads mostly in the wet periods of autumn and winter 3 2 3 uncertainty in climate change projections the deviation in projected monthly values in comparison with the historical simulated data was remarkable across the different gcms for climate change scenarios for all three model outputs flow tn and tp loads which confirmed the importance of considering an ensemble approach for the climate impact studies however the uncertainty of each gcm projection which was represented in this study by the simulated results using the median realization versus the combination of 10th 50th and 90th realizations of the climate data inputs was low fig 6 the variance in the projected flow using single and sets of three realizations of climate input data from six gcms was minor 0 26 and 0 21 for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively the deviations for the tp load simulations were on average less than 1 for two emission scenarios and less than 1 5 for the tn load predictions this suggests that the use of a median realization or a set of realizations from the same climate model may not cause important differences in the climate change projections 3 3 impacts of urbanization on flow and nutrient loads the impacts of future urbanization on the torrens river catchment were addressed in the present study using the historical climate data of 1976 2005 as a baseline period rather than the calibrated period of 2011 2013 this study suggests that future urbanization may result in an overall increase of 26 9 in monthly flow which corresponds to an increase of approximately 20 in the impervious surface of the study area the discovered streamflow patterns affected by urbanization correspond well with findings from previous studies such as those by richards et al 2008 qiu and wang 2014 and sch√ºtte and schulze 2017 the tp loads followed the same pattern as the streamflow with a higher load of 44 4 released from the catchment on an annual basis under future urbanization in comparison with the historical period the largest increases in the tp load of 51 5 occurred during winter due to the increase in precipitation and surface flow and can be explained by the fact that phosphorus is primarily transported by sediments in the surface streamflow increases in streamflow caused an increase in the sediment yield primarily from soil erosion of permeable grassland areas and partially from sediment accumulated on the expanded areas of impermeable surface of residential land uses this corresponded to the increase in annual organic phosphorous and soluble phosphorous in the surface flow at a rate of 9 and 41g ha year respectively in the case of the tn load the model predicted an opposite pattern the tn decreased annually by 9 7 fig 7 but increased during wet autumn and winter months by 18 3 and 17 9 respectively table 2 the overall decrease in the annual tn load is mostly affected by the loss of sources of nitrogen due to leaching from fertilizer applied on grasslands when the grasslands were converted to impermeable urban lands and nitrogen loss from groundwater together the rate of annual nitrogen loss from the two sources was recorded as 20g ha year during the wet seasons in autumn and winter however the increase in both tn and tp loads reflects the fact that a large amount of pollutants in this urban catchment are released to river catchments during intensive rainfall periods ilman and gell 1998 clark et al 2015 alongside this it is also important to mention that the sewage system in the study area is separated from the stormwater drainage network thus future urbanization will not necessarily drive an increase in waste water releases to the surface flow 3 4 combined impacts of climate change and urbanization on flow and nutrient loads coupling of future climate change and urbanization scenarios was simulated for each gcm and the results of an ensemble of six gcms as shown in fig 7 the results of this study showed an offsetting effect from the opposite trends of climate change and urbanization scenario projections on the flow and tp variables while the trend was further strengthened by the combined scenario for the tn variable due to cumulative effects this trend is consistent with previous studies on the topic of climate and land use changes e g teshager et al 2016 shrestha et al 2017 wang and kalin 2018 the results of this study also suggested that the flow characteristics in the torrens river catchment is affected by both climate climate change land use and land use change through development policy in particular the results of the study showed the dominant effects of the urbanization scenario over the climate change scenario which agrees with the review by grimmond 2007 while there was a decrease in average annual flow under the ensemble climate change scenario the increased area of impervious surfaces contributed to a decrease in water infiltration and caused an increase of 15 6 and 11 5 in annual water yield for the combined scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively fig 7 the variation of tp followed the flow trend as well with an overall increase of 17 0 and 12 0 in the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively in the case of tn the decrease in tn loads by 7 3 under the climate change scenario did not affect the overall increasing trend of tn loads by 14 0 for the combined scenario during winter periods while the decrease of tn loads under sole urbanization and climate change scenarios by 9 7 and 21 2 respectively in the case of rcp 8 5 resulted in an overall decrease of 32 6 in the average annual tn loads in the combined scenario these results suggest that in an already dry climate the effects of global climate change are not as serious as the effects of local urbanization this finding is of particular importance for pollution control and mitigation considering the increased pattern of both flow and nutrient loads during the winter months from may to july 4 conclusions impacts of climate change and urbanization on the flow and nutrient loads of the torrens river catchment have been forecast for the period from 2021 to 2050 by feeding outputs of six gcms into the swat model the results indicated that 1 a future drier climate may lead to a decline in both flow and nutrient loads with the most remarkable decrease being projected for the spring and summer seasons under the high emission scenario rcp 8 5 the deviation of the simulation data caused by selecting a median realization or a combination of several realizations of each gcm was not noticeable when compared with the uncertainty in projected results across different gcms 2 future urbanization may cause higher flow and tp loads while the tn loads are expected to decrease as a result of the impact of increased impermeable areas on grasslands 3 even though climate change plays an important role in catchment conditions urbanization is expected to have predominant control over the eco hydrological state of the torrens river catchment in particular during the winter months the study currently applies the default configuration of urban dat in swat for the static representation of land use changes thus what if scenarios on urbanization focus currently at the extremes of possible impacts on the catchment in order to reveal tipping points in transitional effects of urbanization future work will apply the concept of dynamic land use changes e g wagner et al 2016 besides unlike climate change which cannot be controlled on a local scale urban development should aim to sustain aquatic habitats minimizing the impacts of urbanization on the hydrology and water quality of catchments may mitigate the stresses on the already degraded condition of aquatic

1126,downstream migration dynamics of silver phase eels have traditionally been documented using fisheries catch data however improved monitoring protocols and more comprehensive analyses are needed because of widespread declines in anguillid eel stocks therefore daily catches of silver phase european eel anguilla anguilla were recorded at an eel fishing weir on the lower river erne in northwest ireland in parallel eels detected downstream with an acoustic didson camera were surveyed and the results were compared with catch data obtained at the eel weir the principal objective was to evaluate the use of the acoustic camera to monitor migration patterns and eel swimming behaviour in a regulated river a highly significant relationship between the acoustic camera eel counts and fishing weir catches was observed p 0 001 this indicates that fisheries independent estimates of eel spawner biomass escapement will be possible in the future using acoustic cameras acoustic camera observations on eel swimming behaviour indicated significantly more eels swimming downstream when discharge was continuous through the night p 0 05 on nights with no discharge more eels were observed swimming upstream p 0 05 the swimming speeds of eels differed significantly p 0 05 between continuous and low discharge conditions european rivers are increasingly affected by anthropogenic control of discharge to facilitate hydropower generation flood control and navigation and this affects natural patterns of eel migration the results of this study demonstrate the potential use of acoustic cameras for monitoring eel migration dynamics and for behavioural analyses of eel migration in such regulated rivers keywords silver phase eel population dynamics didson swimming behaviour hydropower swimming speeds 1 introduction the worldwide decline of anguillid eels and especially the better researched temperate species e g haro et al 2000 has resulted in serious concerns about the status of these stocks in the case of the european eel anguilla anguilla l recruitment levels and fishery yield statistics show that since the 1980s the species has undergone a dramatic decline throughout its range moriarty and dekker 1997 anthropogenic obstacles for hydropower generation or other river regulation purposes that adversely affect downstream migrating silver phase eels e g winter et al 2006 jansen et al 2007 piper et al 2015 are among the factors thought to have reduced eel spawning stocks delayed spawning migration and mortality at hydropower dams through impingement on trash screens or during turbine passage have been frequently documented e g winter et al 2006 calles et al 2010 pedersen et al 2012 piper et al 2013 ireland like other european union member states has implemented conservation measures that are intended to contribute to the restoration of the european eel stock in line with the eu regulation ec no 1100 2007 closure of eel fisheries and measures to reduce adverse effects of hydropower dams are among the major elements of the irish national eel management plan dcenr 2008 as a short to medium term measure silver phase eels are caught in three river basins the rivers shannon erne and lee and released below hydropower dams mccarthy et al 2014 macnamara and mccarthy 2014 monitoring and evaluation of these trap and transport programmes is undertaken on an annual basis this presents good research opportunities for analysis of the seaward migrations of eels and for the development of new monitoring methods downstream migration has traditionally been quantified based on catch data haro 2003 but reliable catch data is not always available acoustic cameras for example dual frequency identification sonar didson are increasingly being used for fisheries management as they are fast quantitative and non invasive foote 2009 martignac et al 2015 acoustic cameras have been used in previous studies to analyse fish migrations maxwell and gove 2004 baumgartner et al 2006 crossman et al 2011 and may provide a robust means of assessing the downstream migration of eels acoustic cameras have the ability to provide good quality images in the dark and turbid waters which typify the nocturnal downstream migrations of eels while species identification is a known limitation of acoustic cameras eels are easily identifiable from their sinusoidal movement and elongate morphology webb 1982 as well as providing quantitative data on eel abundance acoustic cameras can provide qualitative information on eel behaviour such as swimming direction or speed martignac et al 2015 the aims of the present study were 1 to establish the relationship between the number of eels counted using a dual frequency identification sonar didsontm acoustic camera and nightly catches at a fishing weir on the river erne and to evaluate the potential of acoustic camera surveys in future monitoring of silver phase eel escapement and 2 to use the acoustic camera to investigate behavioural responses of silver phase eels to changes in the regulated discharge of the river 2 study area the river erne fig 1 system is located in the north western international river basin district of ireland and drains an area of 4374 km2 mccarthy et al 2014 there are two hydropower dams cliff hps and cathaleen s fall hps located in the lowermost section of the river system fig 1 above which there is a total wetted area of 26 197 ha mccarthy et al 2014 discharge on the river which is regulated for flood control navigation and power generation varies from 10 m3 s 1 to 382 m3 s 1 with a mean annual discharge of 92 m3 s 1 mccarthy et al 2014 discharge is regulated at the hydropower dams and at portora regulation weir fig 1 the two hydropower dams are separated by the man made assaroe lake 235 ha fig 1 the fishing weir monitored in this study is located at roscor bridge 750 m downstream from the outflow of lower lough erne fig 1 54 28 32 n 8 01 16 w while the acoustic camera was mounted on a pontoon 5 km further downstream at a site on the river 54 28 48 n 8 05 49 w adjacent to the town of belleek 3 methods downstream migrating silver phase european eels were caught at the roscor bridge fishing weir by an experienced fishing crew on 84 nights between 29 09 16 and 08 02 17 the site was fished using three nets attached to the bridge nets were set at dusk and lifted at dawn the acoustic camera didson 300 m soundmetrics corp http www soundmetrics com was used to count migrating silver phase eels and to investigate the response of these eels to changes in discharge the acoustic camera was attached to a floating pontoon which was secured to the river bed and bank with anchored chains the acoustic camera unit was held on a custom made frame which could be lowered in and out of the water on pivoting bars when submerged the acoustic camera unit was facing perpendicular to the flow of the river in this study the sonar was set to operate at low frequency 1 1 mhz which has lower resolution images but a greater range despite a reduction in resolution eels were still easily distinguished based on their swimming behavior and distinctive morphology the insonified field of view was a conical frustum and was programmed to start at 6 m from the unit and extend a further 20 m in water ranging in depth from 6 5 m to 7 6 m it was possible that eels could pass above or below the conical beam undetected a primary aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between eel counts relative to eel weir catch and absolute eel counts were not required the objective of establishing a good index of eel numbers did however require that the methodology was consistent the acoustic camera recorded continuously from the 21 11 2016 until 3 2 2017 n 74 nights except for three nights due to a power outage corresponding catch data was available for 42 nights during this period nightly discharge data for the sampling period was recorded at cliff dam the discharge for nights with corresponding catch and acoustic camera data n 42 was assigned to three distinct categories 1 continuous n 22 2 interrupted n 14 and 3 no discharge n 6 continuous discharge can be either high 150 m3 s 1 mccarthy et al 2014 or low discharge 150 m3 s 1 and remains reasonably constant throughout the night interrupted discharge was characterized by continuous flow for a portion of the night followed by a rapid drop to near zero m3 s 1 linear regression analysis was used to compare acoustic camera eel counts with catch from the roscor bridge fishing weir n 42 following this linear regression analyses were conducted comparing acoustic camera eel counts with catch for each discrete discharge category using the acoustic camera s software didson v5 21 soundmetrics corp acoustic survey data was manually analysed to count eels only nocturnal hours were analysed to coincide with the time when nets were set the impact of variable discharge patterns on the swimming direction of silver phase eels was investigated using the acoustic camera data the mean number of eels observed moving upstream and downstream during each of the three discharge categories were compared using independent samples t tests the timing of cessation of downstream migration during nights with interrupted discharge compared to nights of continuous discharge was also evaluated to establish the impact of interruption of discharge on eel swimming behaviour the acoustic camera was also used to calculate swimming speed of eels moving both downstream and upstream in the presence and absence of discharge swimming speed was defined as the distance covered by an eel divided by the time taken m s 1 in excess of the water velocity distance was calculated as the length between the points where the eel entered and exited the acoustic camera s insonified field of view swimming speed was calculated at various distances along the insonified cone ranging from 7 7 m to 20 0 m swimming path distance ranged from 5 5 m to 10 1 m and times taken ranged from 13 2 s to 25 3 s allowing enough time to calculate swimming speeds using stratified random sampling 4 groups of 20 eels were selected for analyses of downstream and upstream swimming speeds in continuous and no discharge conditions n 80 groups were initially compared using a kruskal wallace test to investigate if significant differences existed between groups and a post hoc games howell test was then used to confirm where differences occurred 4 results over the entire fishing season 5050 kg of eels was caught at the fishing weir with 4249 kg caught during acoustic camera deployment during the main silver phase eel migration period starting in autumn 2016 mean discharge was 77 53 m3 s 1 the daily maximum recorded was 337 m3 s 1 size frequencies produced from weir catch revealed that 78 1 of eels were female eels with total length lt 440 mm mccarthy et al 2014 a total of 587 eels were observed during acoustic camera observations with swimming direction recorded for each it took approximately 105 h to process the 42 nights of data of these 303 52 were observed swimming downstream and 284 48 were observed swimming upstream 280 92 of the downstream swimming eels and 91 32 of the upstream swimming eels were observed during continuous discharge conditions 20 7 of the downstream swimming eels were observed during nights with interrupted discharge while 57 20 of the upstream swimming eels were observed the remaining 3 1 downstream swimming eels were observed during no discharge conditions while 136 47 upstream swimming eels were observed direction of swimming was shown to differ with discharge conditions fisher s exact test p 0 0001 acoustic camera counts and weir catch were highly significantly and positively related r 2 0 905 n 42 p 0 001 nights with continuous discharge n 22 accounted for 98 5 of the catch during acoustic camera deployment analysis of this subset of data indicated that acoustic camera counts and weir catch were more highly significantly related r 2 0 962 n 22 p 0 001 fig 2 the relationship between acoustic camera counts and catch for nights with interrupted discharge r 2 0 247 n 14 p 0 05 and no discharge r 2 0 021 n 6 p 0 05 were not significant these catch categories when combined only accounted for 1 5 of the total season catch significantly more eels moved downstream during continuous discharge than upstream p 0 05 fig 3 when discharge was interrupted being continuous for only a part of the night before dropping rapidly to near zero m3 s 1 there was no significant difference in the mean number of eels moving downstream or upstream p 0 05 fig 3 however during nights with no discharge the mean number of eels moving upstream was significantly higher compared to the mean number moving downstream p 0 05 fig 3 it was observed repeatedly when comparing the number of downstream migrating eels on nights with interrupted discharge and continuous discharge that eels stopped migrating downstream as soon as discharge dropped nearly to zero while eels continued to move downstream throughout the night during continuous flow fig 4 a summary of the mean swimming speeds of eels can be found in table 1 there was a significant difference in the swimming speed of eels between groups p 0 05 the swimming speed of eels moving downstream in continuous discharge was significantly different to the other groups p 0 05 while eels swimming upstream in continuous discharge and those swimming upstream and downstream in no discharge conditions were not significantly different from each other p 0 05 5 discussion conservation measures aiming to aid in the recovery of eel stocks frequently rely on fisheries catch data to quantify production and escapement amilhat et al 2008 macnamara and mccarthy 2014 charrier et al 2011 there are limitations associated with the use of catch data e g bilotta et al 2011 biases can be introduced when the fishing season does not cover the entire migration period of eels or when catch data otherwise is missing thus leading to discontinuities in catch datasets used in the calculation of production and escapement poole et al 2018 due to such limitations production and escapement estimates are increasingly based on models aprahamian et al 2007 prigge et al 2013 however there remains a need for a quantitative data source to calibrate and validate these models bilotta et al 2011 in this study on the river erne we demonstrated that acoustic camera eel counts can enable fisheries independent estimates of spawner biomass escapement the role of increasing discharge in stimulating silver eels to migrate is well established tesch and white 2008 v√∏llestad et al 1986 cullen and mccarthy 2003 in this study regulated variation in discharge impacted on the swimming direction and speed of eels which may have implications for timing of eel migration from the river system under continuous discharge conditions the majority of eels migrated downstream with only a few individuals swimming upstream this is the most natural behaviour associated with seaward migrating eels with large numbers of individuals moving downstream during migration peaks bruijs and durif 2009 the upstream movement of eels during high discharge may reflect the failure of individuals to successfully pass the dam located 750 m downstream of the acoustic camera which was also observed by calles et al 2010 or the response of eels to altered flow fields around the entrance to dams piper et al 2015 on nights with interrupted discharge eels were observed swimming downstream until discharge ceased fig 4 when discharge dropped to near zero m3 s 1 eels began to move upstream with very few individuals observed swimming downstream some eels were observed swimming into the acoustic camera s field of view hesitating and swimming back in the direction they came eels are known to actively search before choosing a route calles et al 2010 this behaviour has previously been referred to as recurrence jansen et al 2007 behrmann godel and eckmann 2003 noted that eels approaching a dam in discharge conditions less than 200 m3 s 1 tended to exhibit circling behaviour and escaped upstream as an avoidance behaviour this might explain the occurrence of some eels swimming upstream during times of continuous discharge as they attempt to avoid the dam 750 m downstream the mean swimming speed x 1 10 m s 1 of eels migrating downstream during continuous discharge conditions in this study falls within the range of swimming speeds observed in previous riverine studies tesch 1994 haro 2003 mccarthy et al 2008 barry et al 2016 the mean swimming speed of eels moving upstream x 0 71 m s 1 in continuous discharge conditions was below the expected range reported by tesch 1994 mean swimming speeds for eels moving upstream 0 53 m s 1 and downstream 0 58 m s 1 during no discharge conditions were also lower than the range described by tesch 1994 van den thillart et al 2009 estimated that eels swim 4 6 times more efficiently than salmonids given their remarkably low levels of energy use it seems likely that eels swimming in no discharge conditions while making no progress towards the sea are wasting little energy swimming speeds calculated using the acoustic camera agreed with existing calculations based on various other methods such as telemetry barry et al 2016 and other forms of hydroacoustic technology mccarthy et al 2008 as well as estimated from swim tunnels van den thillart et al 2009 this suggests that didson provides a robust means of calculating fish swimming speed discharge patterns on the river erne are regulated for hydropower generation navigation and flood control at roscor bridge during times when discharge is low fishing is sometimes not possible as the process is inefficient or because fishing nets become entangled conversely in previous fishing seasons on the river shannon during times of flooding fishing became a hazard and had to be abandoned for safety reasons macnamara and mccarthy 2014 in both scenarios and particularly for the latter valuable catch data is unavailable for calculations of silver phase production and escapement as this study shows acoustic camera can provide estimates of spawner biomass escapement in such times lower lough erne upstream of the acoustic camera deployment site acts as a sink in which debris gathers as well as this there is another conservation fishing site located at the outlet of this lake which effectively filters out all debris therefore in this study there was little risk of debris damaging the acoustic camera or reducing the quality of data collected during flood conditions acoustic cameras didson have now been used for a variety of uses in the field of fisheries including aquaculture han et al 2009 investigations on fishing gear selectivity and efficiency rakowitz et al 2012 ecology such as analysis of size abundances and behaviour boswell et al 2008 and interactions with both natural and man made interfaces like turbines viehman and zydlewski 2015 acoustic cameras have also been successfully used in studies on the migration of several eel species baumgartner et al 2006 mccarthy et al 2014 macnamara and mccarthy 2014 egg et al 2017 however acoustic cameras like didson have limitations martignac et al 2015 high initial capital investment means that acoustic cameras such as didson are unlikely to be widely used in monitoring programmes at present bilotta et al 2011 however as this study and others e g bilotta et al 2011 baumgartner et al 2006 have demonstrated there are advantages to using acoustic cameras instead of traditional netting methods once acoustic camera counts are validated they provides a means of quantifying abundance validating models but also provides a means of directly observing silver eel behaviour it took approximately 105 h to process the data generated over 42 nights there is currently no robust means of automatically counting fish using didson rakowitz 2009 which means that manually processing the data remains the best option in the future the procedure may become fully or semi automated which will significantly reduce the labour associated with this methodology some limitations associated with the methodology described in this study do remain unless fish are prevented from returning in the opposite direction there is no way to ensure the same fish is not counted more than once as described by the multi transit hypothesis brehmer et al 2006 the methodology described here for estimating spawner biomass escapement from acoustic camera surveys should be applicable to an array of migratory fish species including other anguillid species however the relationship described in this study will not be directly applicable to other river systems meaning that an initial means of quantifying catch will be required against which the acoustic camera counts can be calibrated large scale studies on eel population dynamics are traditionally very reliant on data obtained from commercial fisheries however the extensive analyses of seaward migrating eel populations and estimation of spawner biomass required by eel management plans emps are often not possible due to the absence of or limited extent of silver eel fishing this has led to increased reliance on population modeling in many european countries acoustic cameras like didson can provide a direct means of assessing migration dynamics of silver eels quantification of spawner biomass and validation of models is also enabled when calibration of didson population counts relative to catch data is possible acoustic camera observations on eel swimming behaviour can also provide valuable information for conservation and management of migrating eel populations 6 conclusion quantification of the downstream migrations of eels has traditionally relied on silver eel catch data however eel fishing does not always cover the entire eel migration season which can lead to biases when calculating production and escapement in this study we investigated the potential use of an acoustic camera to monitor the downstream migration patterns and swimming behaviour of european eels a anguilla linear regression analysis of daily eel counts from an acoustic camera survey and eel catch from a nearby fishing weir revealed a highly significant relationship such a strong relationship can enable fisheries independent estimates of spawner biomass escapement in the absence of continuous eel catch datasets the acoustic camera survey also showed that regulation of river discharge impacted on the swimming behaviour of eels when discharge was continuous the majority of eels were observed swimming downstream however when discharge ceased eels were observed swimming back upstream delays to migration caused by alteration of discharge could have consequences for the timing of eel spawning acoustic cameras have limitations primarily high initial cost and the generation of large amounts of data to process however this study shows that acoustic cameras have

1126,downstream migration dynamics of silver phase eels have traditionally been documented using fisheries catch data however improved monitoring protocols and more comprehensive analyses are needed because of widespread declines in anguillid eel stocks therefore daily catches of silver phase european eel anguilla anguilla were recorded at an eel fishing weir on the lower river erne in northwest ireland in parallel eels detected downstream with an acoustic didson camera were surveyed and the results were compared with catch data obtained at the eel weir the principal objective was to evaluate the use of the acoustic camera to monitor migration patterns and eel swimming behaviour in a regulated river a highly significant relationship between the acoustic camera eel counts and fishing weir catches was observed p 0 001 this indicates that fisheries independent estimates of eel spawner biomass escapement will be possible in the future using acoustic cameras acoustic camera observations on eel swimming behaviour indicated significantly more eels swimming downstream when discharge was continuous through the night p 0 05 on nights with no discharge more eels were observed swimming upstream p 0 05 the swimming speeds of eels differed significantly p 0 05 between continuous and low discharge conditions european rivers are increasingly affected by anthropogenic control of discharge to facilitate hydropower generation flood control and navigation and this affects natural patterns of eel migration the results of this study demonstrate the potential use of acoustic cameras for monitoring eel migration dynamics and for behavioural analyses of eel migration in such regulated rivers keywords silver phase eel population dynamics didson swimming behaviour hydropower swimming speeds 1 introduction the worldwide decline of anguillid eels and especially the better researched temperate species e g haro et al 2000 has resulted in serious concerns about the status of these stocks in the case of the european eel anguilla anguilla l recruitment levels and fishery yield statistics show that since the 1980s the species has undergone a dramatic decline throughout its range moriarty and dekker 1997 anthropogenic obstacles for hydropower generation or other river regulation purposes that adversely affect downstream migrating silver phase eels e g winter et al 2006 jansen et al 2007 piper et al 2015 are among the factors thought to have reduced eel spawning stocks delayed spawning migration and mortality at hydropower dams through impingement on trash screens or during turbine passage have been frequently documented e g winter et al 2006 calles et al 2010 pedersen et al 2012 piper et al 2013 ireland like other european union member states has implemented conservation measures that are intended to contribute to the restoration of the european eel stock in line with the eu regulation ec no 1100 2007 closure of eel fisheries and measures to reduce adverse effects of hydropower dams are among the major elements of the irish national eel management plan dcenr 2008 as a short to medium term measure silver phase eels are caught in three river basins the rivers shannon erne and lee and released below hydropower dams mccarthy et al 2014 macnamara and mccarthy 2014 monitoring and evaluation of these trap and transport programmes is undertaken on an annual basis this presents good research opportunities for analysis of the seaward migrations of eels and for the development of new monitoring methods downstream migration has traditionally been quantified based on catch data haro 2003 but reliable catch data is not always available acoustic cameras for example dual frequency identification sonar didson are increasingly being used for fisheries management as they are fast quantitative and non invasive foote 2009 martignac et al 2015 acoustic cameras have been used in previous studies to analyse fish migrations maxwell and gove 2004 baumgartner et al 2006 crossman et al 2011 and may provide a robust means of assessing the downstream migration of eels acoustic cameras have the ability to provide good quality images in the dark and turbid waters which typify the nocturnal downstream migrations of eels while species identification is a known limitation of acoustic cameras eels are easily identifiable from their sinusoidal movement and elongate morphology webb 1982 as well as providing quantitative data on eel abundance acoustic cameras can provide qualitative information on eel behaviour such as swimming direction or speed martignac et al 2015 the aims of the present study were 1 to establish the relationship between the number of eels counted using a dual frequency identification sonar didsontm acoustic camera and nightly catches at a fishing weir on the river erne and to evaluate the potential of acoustic camera surveys in future monitoring of silver phase eel escapement and 2 to use the acoustic camera to investigate behavioural responses of silver phase eels to changes in the regulated discharge of the river 2 study area the river erne fig 1 system is located in the north western international river basin district of ireland and drains an area of 4374 km2 mccarthy et al 2014 there are two hydropower dams cliff hps and cathaleen s fall hps located in the lowermost section of the river system fig 1 above which there is a total wetted area of 26 197 ha mccarthy et al 2014 discharge on the river which is regulated for flood control navigation and power generation varies from 10 m3 s 1 to 382 m3 s 1 with a mean annual discharge of 92 m3 s 1 mccarthy et al 2014 discharge is regulated at the hydropower dams and at portora regulation weir fig 1 the two hydropower dams are separated by the man made assaroe lake 235 ha fig 1 the fishing weir monitored in this study is located at roscor bridge 750 m downstream from the outflow of lower lough erne fig 1 54 28 32 n 8 01 16 w while the acoustic camera was mounted on a pontoon 5 km further downstream at a site on the river 54 28 48 n 8 05 49 w adjacent to the town of belleek 3 methods downstream migrating silver phase european eels were caught at the roscor bridge fishing weir by an experienced fishing crew on 84 nights between 29 09 16 and 08 02 17 the site was fished using three nets attached to the bridge nets were set at dusk and lifted at dawn the acoustic camera didson 300 m soundmetrics corp http www soundmetrics com was used to count migrating silver phase eels and to investigate the response of these eels to changes in discharge the acoustic camera was attached to a floating pontoon which was secured to the river bed and bank with anchored chains the acoustic camera unit was held on a custom made frame which could be lowered in and out of the water on pivoting bars when submerged the acoustic camera unit was facing perpendicular to the flow of the river in this study the sonar was set to operate at low frequency 1 1 mhz which has lower resolution images but a greater range despite a reduction in resolution eels were still easily distinguished based on their swimming behavior and distinctive morphology the insonified field of view was a conical frustum and was programmed to start at 6 m from the unit and extend a further 20 m in water ranging in depth from 6 5 m to 7 6 m it was possible that eels could pass above or below the conical beam undetected a primary aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between eel counts relative to eel weir catch and absolute eel counts were not required the objective of establishing a good index of eel numbers did however require that the methodology was consistent the acoustic camera recorded continuously from the 21 11 2016 until 3 2 2017 n 74 nights except for three nights due to a power outage corresponding catch data was available for 42 nights during this period nightly discharge data for the sampling period was recorded at cliff dam the discharge for nights with corresponding catch and acoustic camera data n 42 was assigned to three distinct categories 1 continuous n 22 2 interrupted n 14 and 3 no discharge n 6 continuous discharge can be either high 150 m3 s 1 mccarthy et al 2014 or low discharge 150 m3 s 1 and remains reasonably constant throughout the night interrupted discharge was characterized by continuous flow for a portion of the night followed by a rapid drop to near zero m3 s 1 linear regression analysis was used to compare acoustic camera eel counts with catch from the roscor bridge fishing weir n 42 following this linear regression analyses were conducted comparing acoustic camera eel counts with catch for each discrete discharge category using the acoustic camera s software didson v5 21 soundmetrics corp acoustic survey data was manually analysed to count eels only nocturnal hours were analysed to coincide with the time when nets were set the impact of variable discharge patterns on the swimming direction of silver phase eels was investigated using the acoustic camera data the mean number of eels observed moving upstream and downstream during each of the three discharge categories were compared using independent samples t tests the timing of cessation of downstream migration during nights with interrupted discharge compared to nights of continuous discharge was also evaluated to establish the impact of interruption of discharge on eel swimming behaviour the acoustic camera was also used to calculate swimming speed of eels moving both downstream and upstream in the presence and absence of discharge swimming speed was defined as the distance covered by an eel divided by the time taken m s 1 in excess of the water velocity distance was calculated as the length between the points where the eel entered and exited the acoustic camera s insonified field of view swimming speed was calculated at various distances along the insonified cone ranging from 7 7 m to 20 0 m swimming path distance ranged from 5 5 m to 10 1 m and times taken ranged from 13 2 s to 25 3 s allowing enough time to calculate swimming speeds using stratified random sampling 4 groups of 20 eels were selected for analyses of downstream and upstream swimming speeds in continuous and no discharge conditions n 80 groups were initially compared using a kruskal wallace test to investigate if significant differences existed between groups and a post hoc games howell test was then used to confirm where differences occurred 4 results over the entire fishing season 5050 kg of eels was caught at the fishing weir with 4249 kg caught during acoustic camera deployment during the main silver phase eel migration period starting in autumn 2016 mean discharge was 77 53 m3 s 1 the daily maximum recorded was 337 m3 s 1 size frequencies produced from weir catch revealed that 78 1 of eels were female eels with total length lt 440 mm mccarthy et al 2014 a total of 587 eels were observed during acoustic camera observations with swimming direction recorded for each it took approximately 105 h to process the 42 nights of data of these 303 52 were observed swimming downstream and 284 48 were observed swimming upstream 280 92 of the downstream swimming eels and 91 32 of the upstream swimming eels were observed during continuous discharge conditions 20 7 of the downstream swimming eels were observed during nights with interrupted discharge while 57 20 of the upstream swimming eels were observed the remaining 3 1 downstream swimming eels were observed during no discharge conditions while 136 47 upstream swimming eels were observed direction of swimming was shown to differ with discharge conditions fisher s exact test p 0 0001 acoustic camera counts and weir catch were highly significantly and positively related r 2 0 905 n 42 p 0 001 nights with continuous discharge n 22 accounted for 98 5 of the catch during acoustic camera deployment analysis of this subset of data indicated that acoustic camera counts and weir catch were more highly significantly related r 2 0 962 n 22 p 0 001 fig 2 the relationship between acoustic camera counts and catch for nights with interrupted discharge r 2 0 247 n 14 p 0 05 and no discharge r 2 0 021 n 6 p 0 05 were not significant these catch categories when combined only accounted for 1 5 of the total season catch significantly more eels moved downstream during continuous discharge than upstream p 0 05 fig 3 when discharge was interrupted being continuous for only a part of the night before dropping rapidly to near zero m3 s 1 there was no significant difference in the mean number of eels moving downstream or upstream p 0 05 fig 3 however during nights with no discharge the mean number of eels moving upstream was significantly higher compared to the mean number moving downstream p 0 05 fig 3 it was observed repeatedly when comparing the number of downstream migrating eels on nights with interrupted discharge and continuous discharge that eels stopped migrating downstream as soon as discharge dropped nearly to zero while eels continued to move downstream throughout the night during continuous flow fig 4 a summary of the mean swimming speeds of eels can be found in table 1 there was a significant difference in the swimming speed of eels between groups p 0 05 the swimming speed of eels moving downstream in continuous discharge was significantly different to the other groups p 0 05 while eels swimming upstream in continuous discharge and those swimming upstream and downstream in no discharge conditions were not significantly different from each other p 0 05 5 discussion conservation measures aiming to aid in the recovery of eel stocks frequently rely on fisheries catch data to quantify production and escapement amilhat et al 2008 macnamara and mccarthy 2014 charrier et al 2011 there are limitations associated with the use of catch data e g bilotta et al 2011 biases can be introduced when the fishing season does not cover the entire migration period of eels or when catch data otherwise is missing thus leading to discontinuities in catch datasets used in the calculation of production and escapement poole et al 2018 due to such limitations production and escapement estimates are increasingly based on models aprahamian et al 2007 prigge et al 2013 however there remains a need for a quantitative data source to calibrate and validate these models bilotta et al 2011 in this study on the river erne we demonstrated that acoustic camera eel counts can enable fisheries independent estimates of spawner biomass escapement the role of increasing discharge in stimulating silver eels to migrate is well established tesch and white 2008 v√∏llestad et al 1986 cullen and mccarthy 2003 in this study regulated variation in discharge impacted on the swimming direction and speed of eels which may have implications for timing of eel migration from the river system under continuous discharge conditions the majority of eels migrated downstream with only a few individuals swimming upstream this is the most natural behaviour associated with seaward migrating eels with large numbers of individuals moving downstream during migration peaks bruijs and durif 2009 the upstream movement of eels during high discharge may reflect the failure of individuals to successfully pass the dam located 750 m downstream of the acoustic camera which was also observed by calles et al 2010 or the response of eels to altered flow fields around the entrance to dams piper et al 2015 on nights with interrupted discharge eels were observed swimming downstream until discharge ceased fig 4 when discharge dropped to near zero m3 s 1 eels began to move upstream with very few individuals observed swimming downstream some eels were observed swimming into the acoustic camera s field of view hesitating and swimming back in the direction they came eels are known to actively search before choosing a route calles et al 2010 this behaviour has previously been referred to as recurrence jansen et al 2007 behrmann godel and eckmann 2003 noted that eels approaching a dam in discharge conditions less than 200 m3 s 1 tended to exhibit circling behaviour and escaped upstream as an avoidance behaviour this might explain the occurrence of some eels swimming upstream during times of continuous discharge as they attempt to avoid the dam 750 m downstream the mean swimming speed x 1 10 m s 1 of eels migrating downstream during continuous discharge conditions in this study falls within the range of swimming speeds observed in previous riverine studies tesch 1994 haro 2003 mccarthy et al 2008 barry et al 2016 the mean swimming speed of eels moving upstream x 0 71 m s 1 in continuous discharge conditions was below the expected range reported by tesch 1994 mean swimming speeds for eels moving upstream 0 53 m s 1 and downstream 0 58 m s 1 during no discharge conditions were also lower than the range described by tesch 1994 van den thillart et al 2009 estimated that eels swim 4 6 times more efficiently than salmonids given their remarkably low levels of energy use it seems likely that eels swimming in no discharge conditions while making no progress towards the sea are wasting little energy swimming speeds calculated using the acoustic camera agreed with existing calculations based on various other methods such as telemetry barry et al 2016 and other forms of hydroacoustic technology mccarthy et al 2008 as well as estimated from swim tunnels van den thillart et al 2009 this suggests that didson provides a robust means of calculating fish swimming speed discharge patterns on the river erne are regulated for hydropower generation navigation and flood control at roscor bridge during times when discharge is low fishing is sometimes not possible as the process is inefficient or because fishing nets become entangled conversely in previous fishing seasons on the river shannon during times of flooding fishing became a hazard and had to be abandoned for safety reasons macnamara and mccarthy 2014 in both scenarios and particularly for the latter valuable catch data is unavailable for calculations of silver phase production and escapement as this study shows acoustic camera can provide estimates of spawner biomass escapement in such times lower lough erne upstream of the acoustic camera deployment site acts as a sink in which debris gathers as well as this there is another conservation fishing site located at the outlet of this lake which effectively filters out all debris therefore in this study there was little risk of debris damaging the acoustic camera or reducing the quality of data collected during flood conditions acoustic cameras didson have now been used for a variety of uses in the field of fisheries including aquaculture han et al 2009 investigations on fishing gear selectivity and efficiency rakowitz et al 2012 ecology such as analysis of size abundances and behaviour boswell et al 2008 and interactions with both natural and man made interfaces like turbines viehman and zydlewski 2015 acoustic cameras have also been successfully used in studies on the migration of several eel species baumgartner et al 2006 mccarthy et al 2014 macnamara and mccarthy 2014 egg et al 2017 however acoustic cameras like didson have limitations martignac et al 2015 high initial capital investment means that acoustic cameras such as didson are unlikely to be widely used in monitoring programmes at present bilotta et al 2011 however as this study and others e g bilotta et al 2011 baumgartner et al 2006 have demonstrated there are advantages to using acoustic cameras instead of traditional netting methods once acoustic camera counts are validated they provides a means of quantifying abundance validating models but also provides a means of directly observing silver eel behaviour it took approximately 105 h to process the data generated over 42 nights there is currently no robust means of automatically counting fish using didson rakowitz 2009 which means that manually processing the data remains the best option in the future the procedure may become fully or semi automated which will significantly reduce the labour associated with this methodology some limitations associated with the methodology described in this study do remain unless fish are prevented from returning in the opposite direction there is no way to ensure the same fish is not counted more than once as described by the multi transit hypothesis brehmer et al 2006 the methodology described here for estimating spawner biomass escapement from acoustic camera surveys should be applicable to an array of migratory fish species including other anguillid species however the relationship described in this study will not be directly applicable to other river systems meaning that an initial means of quantifying catch will be required against which the acoustic camera counts can be calibrated large scale studies on eel population dynamics are traditionally very reliant on data obtained from commercial fisheries however the extensive analyses of seaward migrating eel populations and estimation of spawner biomass required by eel management plans emps are often not possible due to the absence of or limited extent of silver eel fishing this has led to increased reliance on population modeling in many european countries acoustic cameras like didson can provide a direct means of assessing migration dynamics of silver eels quantification of spawner biomass and validation of models is also enabled when calibration of didson population counts relative to catch data is possible acoustic camera observations on eel swimming behaviour can also provide valuable information for conservation and management of migrating eel populations 6 conclusion quantification of the downstream migrations of eels has traditionally relied on silver eel catch data however eel fishing does not always cover the entire eel migration season which can lead to biases when calculating production and escapement in this study we investigated the potential use of an acoustic camera to monitor the downstream migration patterns and swimming behaviour of european eels a anguilla linear regression analysis of daily eel counts from an acoustic camera survey and eel catch from a nearby fishing weir revealed a highly significant relationship such a strong relationship can enable fisheries independent estimates of spawner biomass escapement in the absence of continuous eel catch datasets the acoustic camera survey also showed that regulation of river discharge impacted on the swimming behaviour of eels when discharge was continuous the majority of eels were observed swimming downstream however when discharge ceased eels were observed swimming back upstream delays to migration caused by alteration of discharge could have consequences for the timing of eel spawning acoustic cameras have limitations primarily high initial cost and the generation of large amounts of data to process however this study shows that acoustic cameras have advantages over traditional netting methods which where possible warrants their inclusion in silver eel monitoring programmes conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that

1127,the regulation of anthropogenic pollution inputs into large rivers is an important aspect of ecological resilience of aquatic systems and river pollution management the current study examined the relationship between contamination loads hydrological and morphological patterns and the distribution of macroinvertebrates and epipelic diatoms in the middle paran√° river system to form part of the development of a pollution monitoring framework seven sampling sites were selected over three main river areas predominantly impacted by sewage effluent and agriculture activities the sampling areas were the paran√° colastin√© and las conchas rivers in order to prevent dilution of pollutants and macroinvertebrate drift sampling was performed during the base flow period of 2015 to determine pollution contaminated stretches of the river system results indicated that metals have been accumulated in river bottom sediments as a consequence of anthropogenic land use activities macroinvertebrate and epipelic diatom assemblages as bioindicators of anthropogenic pollution were evident downstream of urban sewage effluent discharges causing higher concentrations of cr as and ni than the permitted threshold levels for bottom sediment keywords bioindicators anthropogenic biotopes hydrology large rivers 1 introduction numerous biological assessment tools have been developed for different types of aquatic ecosystems and for various monitoring purposes bain et al 2000 simon 2000 a large proportion of these tools are aimed at monitoring the ecological integrity of the respective systems resh 2008 aquatic organisms like macroinvertebrates and epipelic diatoms have been used as monitoring tools due to the fact that these organisms are able to reflect a long term integrated state of their respective ecosystems rodrigues cap√≠tulo et al 2001 matthews et al 2010 oberholster et al 2005 2013 cochero et al 2014 2016 these tools are based on the assumption that anthropogenic impacts will result in changes in the community structure abundance or diversity of these biota de klerk 2016 while riverine biomonitoring studies are routine the majority of them are focused on relatively small rivers li et al 2010 similar studies in large rivers are still scarce probably for the reason that it requires a great technical effort due to the strong current and great water depths however there are certain exceptions e g marchese and ezcurra de drago 1999 2006 the distinctive hydrological and morphological patterns of rivers create specific sites or habitats for biota assemblages defining habitat patches or biotopes at different scales wadeson 1994 these biotopes in turn could be heavily subjected to anthropogenic pollutants andr√®s et al 1999 for example several studies have demonstrated that sandy bedforms act as sinks for contaminants e g ladd et al 1998 ciszewski 2004 nevertheless further research is needed in order to explore the relationships between hydro morphological variability and pollution impacts on ecology at different biotopes in large rivers according to marino and ronco 2005 sayds pna unlp 2007 ronco et al 2008 2016 and peluso et al 2013 certain tributaries of the paran√° river are significantly contaminated by pollution due to urban industrial and agricultural land use activities in their catchment areas however metal concentrations in the bottom sediments of the paran√° river have been scantily explored pasquini and depetris 2012 additionally little is still known regarding the associations between contamination loads hydrological and morphological patterns and ecology of organisms inhabiting the paran√° river in this regard the aim of the current study was to explore a diversity of sampling sites and their morphological units as potential sinks for contaminants and its effect on the ecology of macroinvertebrate and epipelic diatom assemblage in the middle paran√° river system the objective of the current study was to identify polluted stretches in the middle parana river system using the relationship between contamination loads hydrological and morphological patterns and the distribution of macroinvertebrate and epipelic diatom assemblage to form part of the development of a greater pollution monitoring framework 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the paran√° river is a mega river with a catchment area of 2 8 106 km2 and a mean discharge of 18 000 m3 s 1 latrubesse 2008 its sandy mobile bed where fine and medium grain sizes prevail is transported principally by saltation and in suspension drago 2007 the main channel of the middle paran√° river is typically braided and composes of a sequence of wide segments that are characterized by two or more branches with lateral erosion and sedimentation activities where bars and dunes are usually present szupiany et al 2009 along its main channel the middle paran√° river has built a wide floodplain with a surface area of about 20 000 km2 iriondo et al 2007 and anabranching planform pattern latrubesse 2008 the percent rate of change of the paran√° discharges was amplified when compared to the corresponding rate of change of average precipitation on the basin berbery and barros 2002 this feature can be attributed partially to deforestation and land use change that resulted in increased runoff collinshon et al 2001 in addition episodes of heavy rainfall are becoming more frequent as a result of the regional climate trend barros et al 2006 in this study area the predominant land use activities were agriculture activities discharge of untreated or partially treated domestic and industrial wastewater fig 1 2 2 location seven sampling sites were selected over three main areas with sewage effluent and agriculture activities as the main source of point and diffuse pollution these areas were the 1 main channel of the paran√° river 2 the colastin√© river a major secondary channel of the paran√° river and 3 the las conchas river a minor tributary of the paran√° river although it is ideal to sample during high and low flows to capture all ecological changes in the river system as part of the development of a pollution monitoring framework for the middle paran√° river the current study was performed in late summer 2015 during a flow period with a mean low water level 3 2 m paran√° city gauging station this period was chosen to avoid dilution of pollutants and macroinvertebrate drift fig 1 shows the study area and the location of the defined sampling stations 2 3 physical and chemical variables in order to characterize the water quality the following physical and chemical variables were recorded in situ transparency secchi disk m electric conductivity Œºs cm 1 water temperature c ph total dissolved solids mg l 1 and dissolved oxygen mg l 1 using a hach sension mm156 portable multi parameter meter loveland usa additional duplicate bed sediment samples for granulometric analysis by dry sieving were taken at the same sampling sites 2 4 benthic macroinvertebrates sampling triplicate random benthic sediment samples were taken at each sampling site using a tamura bottom dredge rigosha co 322 cm2 surface of extraction the dredge was lowered into the water column by means of an electric winch fitted with a steel cable each benthic sample was filtered through a 200 Œºm sieve and fixed with 5 formaldehyde in the field in the laboratory the samples were stained with erythrosin to facilitate the sorting of the macroinvertebrates the macroinvertebrates were hand picked in the laboratory and stored in a 70 ethanol solution all benthic taxa were identified and counted under an upright microscope nikon eclipse e100 led 40 60 magnification taxonomical determinations were made at species and genus levels using the following taxonomic keys brinkhurst and marchese 1992 for oligochaeta paggi 2001 trivinho strixino 2011 for diptera chironomidae spinelli and wirth 1993 for diptera and ceratopogonidae dom√≠nguez et al 1994 for ephemeroptera dom√≠nguez and fern√°ndez 2009 for other taxa 2 5 diatom sampling epipelic diatoms samples were taken at the same sampling sites used to sample macroinvertebrates triplicate bottom sediment samples were taken with a tamura bottom dredge rigosha co while the first 3 cm of the upper bottom sediment of each sample were remove and preserved with 2 glutaraldehyde solution for microscopic analyses the lack of cell content in the diatom cells was determined to verify the ratio of dead diatoms in the samples before they were acid cleaned beninger et al 2008 the diatom samples were cleared of organic matter by heating it in a potassium dichromate and sulphuric acid solution and the cleared material was rinsed diluted and mounted in pleurax medium for microscopic examination diatoms were identified using a compound microscope at 1250 magnification according to the taxonomic keys of metzeltin et al 2005 the samples were sedimented in a sedgewick rafter sedimentation chamber and were analysed using the strip count method apha awwa wpcf 1992 the concentration cell cm 2 was estimated by multiplying the number of valves from each taxon by a conversion factor according to the methods of hermany et al 2006 the numerical indicators for general grouping of the abundance of diatom taxa at each sampling site were categorised as follows 1 50 rare 2 51 250 scarce 3 251 1000 common 4 1001 5000 abundant and 5 5001 25 000 predominant cells cm2 only live diatoms containing chlorophyll were counted 2 6 bottom sediment metal analyses the total concentrations of a selection of metals and other elements were quantified in composite sediment samples consisting of three random grab samples collected per sampling site the samples were maintained on ice and at 4 c during storage and transportation and digested in a nitric acid hydrogen peroxide solution prior to analysis a thermo icap 6300 icp aes

ti and v 2 7 bathymetric and three dimensional flow the river bed morphology and three dimensional flow velocities were surveyed using a 1200 khz teledyne rdi acoustic doppler current profiler adcp coupled to a global positioning system gps deployed on the boat at each selected site flow measurements were made providing details of the flow structure characteristics in order to obtain representative values of the time averaged three dimensional velocities at each site a series of 4 replicate transect lines were performed and subsequently averaged according to szupiany et al 2007 the velocity mapping toolbox parsons et al 2013 was employed to process velocity data primary pv and secondary sv flow structures around the studied sites were analysed according to the rozovskii definition the latter method essentially identifies the primary velocity direction for each profile as the depth integrated flow vector and the secondary currents were then obtained by the differences from this average vector within the profile this procedure effectively identifies individual secondary planes at each vertical profile across a given section thus allowing for identification of helical motion within a section without distorting the secondary flow results cf szupiany et al 2007 2009 for methodological details following this methodology we were able to determine discharge m 3 s 1 flow direction and primary and secondary velocities m s 1 the sampling area located nearby the junction between the paran√° and las conchas rivers was selected for bathymetric and three dimensional current surveys see fig 1c 2 8 statistical analysis a canonical analysis of principal coordinates cap anderson 2003 was employed to find spatial patterns of similarity in the composition

water ph values at all sampling sites ranged between 7 1 and 7 9 while the highest total dissolved solids 150 mg l 1 and conductivity 290 ¬µs cm 1 were measured at sampling site lc3 in comparison to the other sampling sites the first axis of the pca explained 70 6 of the environment variations while the second axis explained 15 fig 3 and table 3 according to this analysis sampling sites c1 lc1 and pmc remained clearly separated from the other sampling sites showing the lowest concentration of metals in the bottom sediments on the contrary sites c2 and c3 located downstream the sewage effluent in the colastin√© river were associated with the highest concentration of metals lc1 was located in between both previous groups of sampling sites in the plot suggesting intermediate concentrations of bottom sediment metals the latter site was characterized by a relatively high amount of fine sediments in the sampled bedform particularly clay according to table 4 sampling sites c2 and c3 were clearly the most polluted sites particularly as cr and ni were recorded at much higher concentrations at these sites than the sediment quality guidelines prescribed by burton 2002 it was evident that the urban wastewater effluent from the city of santa fe into the colastin√© river increased the metal concentrations of cr as and ni at these sites in comparison to the other sampling sites however as noted by sosa and datta 2015 and sosa et al 2017 as concentrations have been attributed to natural geochemical and sedimentological processes while cr and ni indicate anthropogenic inputs the highest concentrations of bottom sediment metals were recorded at sampling stations c2 and c3 cu pb zn al ba b co fe k li mg mn p se sr and v fig 3 and table 4 indicating that both sites

the results obtained by cap indicated that several sampling sites had different macroinvertebrate assemblages p 0 001 fig 2 the analysis of variances anova and ulterior lsd fisher test performed with scores of the cap axis 1 confirmed significant differences in macroinvertebrate composition between sampling sites c1 c2 and c3 colastin√© river table 1 however analyses did show that sampling sites c2 and c3 differ in their macroinvertebrate assemblages between each other on the other hand there were no differences observed between sampling sites c1 lc2 and pmc which possibly suggest that similar benthic macroinvertebrate and diatom assemblages inhabited these sites furthermore sampling site lc3 did show dissimilarity with regard to all the other sampling sites table 2 shows that the diatom aulacoseira granulata was absent at sampling site c2 and c3 where higher concentration of sediment metals were recorded in the current study it is noteworthy to mention that fallacia monoculata achnanthes lanceolata craticula accomoda and eolimna minima were exclusively present at sampling site c2 table 2 the macroinvertebrate species narapa bonettoi and myoretronectes paranaensis were present in high densities at sampling sites c1 lc2 and pmc fig 2 these sites were characterized by sandy bottom sediments and very low concentration of bottom sediment metals in comparison to the other sampling sites on the other hand the macroinvertebrate species pristina americana naididae did only occurred at sampling site c2 3 3 bathymetric and three dimensional flow fig 4a shows the bathymetry and flow configuration at the cross section of sampling site lc1 immediately downstream of the confluence between the las conchas river and a short secondary channel of the paran√° river herein named as iris channel a reduction in water velocity was observed where both currents of the two different rivers joined together with this velocity reduction a secondary cell movement was recorded near to the bottom surface see direction and magnitude of the sv vectors this particular hydraulic configuration did create a depositional area characterized by fine bed material 45 silt and 29 clay over this full cross section a discharge of 363 m3 s 1 and a mean primary velocity pv of 0 63 m s 1 were observed however the local pv over the sampling site was around 0 4 m s 1 over the cross section lc2 the local maximum pv ranged between 0 5 and 0 55 m s 1 being smaller than at sampling site lc1 the discharge over this cross section las conchas river was only 50 5 m3 s 1 with a mean pv of 0 39 m s 1 fig 4b a large sand dune with its trough 4 5 m deeper than the crest was recorded and sampled at pmc station 4 discussion it is known that the growth of diatoms can be inhibited by a low supply of silica however the si concentrations recorded in the current study were significantly above average values sufficient for diatom reproduction willen 1991 therefore the sparse diatom flora observed at the entire sampling sites can possibly be related to the occurrence of suspended solids and basic inorganic materials that decreased the water column transparency this environment condition favoured low light intensity diatoms like a granulata that prevail at most of the sampling sites a granulata was widely recorded at sampling sites c1 lc1 lc2 lc3 and pmc and was only absent at sites c2 and c3 sites located downstream of the urban sewage effluent table 2 this species is an r strategist species adapted to variations in turbulence and light intensity typically present in the main channel of the paran√° river with relatively good water quality zalocar de domitrovic et al 2007 according to zalocar de domitrovic and maidana 1997 and devercelli 2010 the diatom a granulata is the most important species in the parana river system followed by the diatom c meneghiniana only presents in c3 station according to the classification by reynolds et al 2002 a granulata belongs to the functional group p while c meneghiniana belong to the functional group c which is a colonizer species sensitive to light depletion with a rapid reproduction rate the only occurrence of the diatom craticula accomoda at sampling site c2 was in association with a previous report by taylor et al 2007 that shows that this species is found in strongly organically polluted waters in particular effluent from sewage treatment works with a scattered occurrence in oligo to eutrophic water the higher bottom sediment metal concentrations recorded in the colastin√© river c2 and c3 were possibly related to the point source pollution downstream of the urban sewage effluence fig 3 and table 3 in a previous study oberholster et al 2013 reported that the ecological impact and changes in phytoplankton assemblage downstream of the riverview wastewater treatment plant in the upper olifants river was visible over a distance of 40 km in the current study ecological indicator differences were also observed among the latter polluted sites c2 and c3 fig 2 and table 1 benthic diatoms were clearly more abundant and diverse at site c2 in comparison to site c3 this phenomenon was possibly related to the fact that certain pollution tolerant epipelic diatoms become more abundant where water systems are impacted by anthropogenic pollution bate et al 2004 the genus achnanthes observed at site c2 has previously been recorded in the paran√° river under environmental conditions of low light penetration almost anoxic conditions and high nitrate and phosphate concentrations devercelli et al 2014 according to these authors species of this genus are probably mixotrophic regarding their capacity to grow in extremely poor light intensities and tolerate very low oxygen contents the only occurrence of the macroinvertebrate species pristina americana naididae at sampling site c2 impacted by sewage effluent relates with findings of petsch et al 2015 who reported that the abundance of p americana occurred under environmental conditions with high values of organic matter and low dissolved oxygen which is symptomatic of surface waters impacted by sewage effluent although literature generally suggests that metal content increases when sediment grain size decreases this relation of metal content to particle size was not clear in the current study fig 3 spearman rank correlations however indicated silt content as a predictor of increased metal concentrations whereas sand and clay content were not du laing et al 2007 performed an in depth assessment of metal contamination in the sediments of the severe polluted freshwater tidal zone system of the scheldt river belgium and the netherlands as part of the investigation the silt clay sand organic matter among other factors were characterized and applied in predictive modelling using stepwise regression equations maslennikova et al 2012 suggested that content and distribution of metals and organic matter were defined not only by particle size of sediments but also by conditions of its accumulation particularly the ecological state and climatic parameters ciszewski 2004 found changes in metal concentrations related to transport of river bed material dead water zones and bed morphology in the mala panew river specifically in this study the confluence zone of site lc1 possibly act as a deposit area playing an important role as sink for fine and metal polluted sediments fig 4a although the concentration of metals at this sampling site was below the threshold level according to burton 2002 it was higher in comparison to sampling sites pmc and lc2 the origin of the polluted sediment from site lc1 is not clear since it could be related to contaminants coming from the paran√° river main channel or on the contrary from las conchas river the bed sediment sizes recorded at lc1 45 silt and around 30 clay is closely related to that of the fine sediment transported in suspension in the paran√° river amsler and drago 2009 this observation suggests two possible explanations firstly that the suspended sediments coming from the paran√° river main channel was deposited at site lc1 together with metals transported by the fine suspended sediments being accumulated gradually at relatively low concentrations this possibility conforms with mugetti 2004 observations who reported an association between heavy metals and suspended material in the paran√° river secondly it is recognized that metals have natural or anthropogenic sources in aquatic environments based on this fact it may be inferred that metals deposited at lc1 originated in sites upstream the sampling area from both types of sources on one hand the paran√° river exhibits thick beds of marine and continental sedimentary rocks as well as outcrops of metamorphic rocks along with volcanic rocks of quaternary age which could be a source of metals pasquini and depetris 2012 on the other hand metals induced by human activities is a true possibility in the paran√° river peluso et al 2013 since large human settlements and factories of argentina and paraguay extend along the banks and nearby areas of its main channel and tributaries discharging point and nonpoint sources of waste and sewage effluent from domestic as well as industrial origin high concentrations of ammonium nitrates and phosphates as well as metals agrochemicals and biphenyl poly chlorines have also been found near to urban areas of this river system un water wwap 2007 peluso et al 2013 ronco et al 2016 in contrast distinctive ecological features macroinvertebrate composition and relative abundance were observed at sampling sites c1 lc2 and pmc fig 2 and table 1 these sites were predominantly colonized by n bonettoi m paranaensis and lopescladius sp table 2 according to ezcurra de drago et al 2007 and blettler et al 2012 the presence of these species which integrate the so called active bed assemblage indicate good water quality conditions and a bottom substrate composed essentially by medium and coarse sands fig 3 and table 3 macroinvertebrate species from this assemblage typically inhabiting interstitial spaces between sand grains of sandy rivers blettler et al 2008 amsler et al 2009 have a very low biomass which results in poor energy resources for higher trophic levels ezcurra de drago et al 2007 it should be noted that the dune trough at site pmc did not accumulate pollutants as expected fig 3 even when a reduction of bed hydraulic forces occur in alluvial dunes as is widely known e g kostaschuk et al 2004 best 2005 amsler et al 2009 it was not enough as to generate a sink area for metal polluted sediments in the main channel in this case two possible explanations for this fact are i the current in the central strip of the main channel was too strong as to cause any deposition of pollutants in the dune trough and ii the sandy sediment of the dune 93 8 sand prevented metal accumulation due to vertical dune packing and porosity this finding is of ecological relevance because dune troughs where a reduced disturbance of bed particles exists due to the smaller bed shear stresses were described as refuge areas for macroinvertebrate community by amsler et al 2009 and blettler et al 2012 regarding the quality of bottom sediments in the paran√° river tributaries and in its main channel the concentrations of some metals cr mn and fe were significantly higher than those reported by peluso et al 2013 whereas the concentrations of cd pb hg and zn were lower the differences could be related with the influence of channel morphology on flow configuration e g confluences may create point regions where velocity reduces favoring the deposition of fine and metal polluted sediments increasing concentrations in bottom sediments this type of process gives rise to a non homogeneous distribution pattern of metal content in bed sediments 5 conclusions results of the current study showed that point source sewage effluence as in site c2 was one of the major sources for metal accumulation in bottom sediments of the middle parana river thus this type of sites should be included as part of a pollution monitoring framework in the future changes in macroinvertebrate and epipelic diatom assemblages as bioindicators of anthropogenic pollution were also evident downstream of urban sewage effluents in comparison to the other sampling sites furthermore apparently the only occurrence of the species pristina americana and the larger numbers of the pollution tolerant diatom craticula accomoda as revealed results at site c2 justify their future use as potential indicators of sewage pollution impacted bottom sediments in the middle parana river moreover results indicate that pollutants would not be homogenously distributed in the bottom sediments but in specific sites such as confluences where depositional areas occur due to velocity reductions as a consequence of the particular configuration of flow confluences would be important point sinks for fine and metal polluted sediments other typical flow phenomenon as the decrement in local bed hydraulic forces over the trough of alluvial dunes which are ubiquitous on the bed of the main parana river channel would not be enough as to accumulate metals in those bottom regions these observations concerning the diverse flow configurations in a large alluvial river like the paran√° are important factors that should be taken into consideration when selecting samplings sites for the development of a pollution

1127,the regulation of anthropogenic pollution inputs into large rivers is an important aspect of ecological resilience of aquatic systems and river pollution management the current study examined the relationship between contamination loads hydrological and morphological patterns and the distribution of macroinvertebrates and epipelic diatoms in the middle paran√° river system to form part of the development of a pollution monitoring framework seven sampling sites were selected over three main river areas predominantly impacted by sewage effluent and agriculture activities the sampling areas were the paran√° colastin√© and las conchas rivers in order to prevent dilution of pollutants and macroinvertebrate drift sampling was performed during the base flow period of 2015 to determine pollution contaminated stretches of the river system results indicated that metals have been accumulated in river bottom sediments as a consequence of anthropogenic land use activities macroinvertebrate and epipelic diatom assemblages as bioindicators of anthropogenic pollution were evident downstream of urban sewage effluent discharges causing higher concentrations of cr as and ni than the permitted threshold levels for bottom sediment keywords bioindicators anthropogenic biotopes hydrology large rivers 1 introduction numerous biological assessment tools have been developed for different types of aquatic ecosystems and for various monitoring purposes bain et al 2000 simon 2000 a large proportion of these tools are aimed at monitoring the ecological integrity of the respective systems resh 2008 aquatic organisms like macroinvertebrates and epipelic diatoms have been used as monitoring tools due to the fact that these organisms are able to reflect a long term integrated state of their respective ecosystems rodrigues cap√≠tulo et al 2001 matthews et al 2010 oberholster et al 2005 2013 cochero et al 2014 2016 these tools are based on the assumption that anthropogenic impacts will result in changes in the community structure abundance or diversity of these biota de klerk 2016 while riverine biomonitoring studies are routine the majority of them are focused on relatively small rivers li et al 2010 similar studies in large rivers are still scarce probably for the reason that it requires a great technical effort due to the strong current and great water depths however there are certain exceptions e g marchese and ezcurra de drago 1999 2006 the distinctive hydrological and morphological patterns of rivers create specific sites or habitats for biota assemblages defining habitat patches or biotopes at different scales wadeson 1994 these biotopes in turn could be heavily subjected to anthropogenic pollutants andr√®s et al 1999 for example several studies have demonstrated that sandy bedforms act as sinks for contaminants e g ladd et al 1998 ciszewski 2004 nevertheless further research is needed in order to explore the relationships between hydro morphological variability and pollution impacts on ecology at different biotopes in large rivers according to marino and ronco 2005 sayds pna unlp 2007 ronco et al 2008 2016 and peluso et al 2013 certain tributaries of the paran√° river are significantly contaminated by pollution due to urban industrial and agricultural land use activities in their catchment areas however metal concentrations in the bottom sediments of the paran√° river have been scantily explored pasquini and depetris 2012 additionally little is still known regarding the associations between contamination loads hydrological and morphological patterns and ecology of organisms inhabiting the paran√° river in this regard the aim of the current study was to explore a diversity of sampling sites and their morphological units as potential sinks for contaminants and its effect on the ecology of macroinvertebrate and epipelic diatom assemblage in the middle paran√° river system the objective of the current study was to identify polluted stretches in the middle parana river system using the relationship between contamination loads hydrological and morphological patterns and the distribution of macroinvertebrate and epipelic diatom assemblage to form part of the development of a greater pollution monitoring framework 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the paran√° river is a mega river with a catchment area of 2 8 106 km2 and a mean discharge of 18 000 m3 s 1 latrubesse 2008 its sandy mobile bed where fine and medium grain sizes prevail is transported principally by saltation and in suspension drago 2007 the main channel of the middle paran√° river is typically braided and composes of a sequence of wide segments that are characterized by two or more branches with lateral erosion and sedimentation activities where bars and dunes are usually present szupiany et al 2009 along its main channel the middle paran√° river has built a wide floodplain with a surface area of about 20 000 km2 iriondo et al 2007 and anabranching planform pattern latrubesse 2008 the percent rate of change of the paran√° discharges was amplified when compared to the corresponding rate of change of average precipitation on the basin berbery and barros 2002 this feature can be attributed partially to deforestation and land use change that resulted in increased runoff collinshon et al 2001 in addition episodes of heavy rainfall are becoming more frequent as a result of the regional climate trend barros et al 2006 in this study area the predominant land use activities were agriculture activities discharge of untreated or partially treated domestic and industrial wastewater fig 1 2 2 location seven sampling sites were selected over three main areas with sewage effluent and agriculture activities as the main source of point and diffuse pollution these areas were the 1 main channel of the paran√° river 2 the colastin√© river a major secondary channel of the paran√° river and 3 the las conchas river a minor tributary of the paran√° river although it is ideal to sample during high and low flows to capture all ecological changes in the river system as part of the development of a pollution monitoring framework for the middle paran√° river the current study was performed in late summer 2015 during a flow period with a mean low water level 3 2 m paran√° city gauging station this period was chosen to avoid dilution of pollutants and macroinvertebrate drift fig 1 shows the study area and the location of the defined sampling stations 2 3 physical and chemical variables in order to characterize the water quality the following physical and chemical variables were recorded in situ transparency secchi disk m electric conductivity Œºs cm 1 water temperature c ph total dissolved solids mg l 1 and dissolved oxygen mg l 1 using a hach sension mm156 portable multi parameter meter loveland usa additional duplicate bed sediment samples for granulometric analysis by dry sieving were taken at the same sampling sites 2 4 benthic macroinvertebrates sampling triplicate random benthic sediment samples were taken at each sampling site using a tamura bottom dredge rigosha co 322 cm2 surface of extraction the dredge was lowered into the water column by means of an electric winch fitted with a steel cable each benthic sample was filtered through a 200 Œºm sieve and fixed with 5 formaldehyde in the field in the laboratory the samples were stained with erythrosin to facilitate the sorting of the macroinvertebrates the macroinvertebrates were hand picked in the laboratory and stored in a 70 ethanol solution all benthic taxa were identified and counted under an upright microscope nikon eclipse e100 led 40 60 magnification taxonomical determinations were made at species and genus levels using the following taxonomic keys brinkhurst and marchese 1992 for oligochaeta paggi 2001 trivinho strixino 2011 for diptera chironomidae spinelli and wirth 1993 for diptera and ceratopogonidae dom√≠nguez et al 1994 for ephemeroptera dom√≠nguez and fern√°ndez 2009 for other taxa 2 5 diatom sampling epipelic diatoms samples were taken at the same sampling sites used to sample macroinvertebrates triplicate bottom sediment samples were taken with a tamura bottom dredge rigosha co while the first 3 cm of the upper bottom sediment of each sample were remove and preserved with 2 glutaraldehyde solution for microscopic analyses the lack of cell content in the diatom cells was determined to verify the ratio of dead diatoms in the samples before they were acid cleaned beninger et al 2008 the diatom samples were cleared of organic matter by heating it in a potassium dichromate and sulphuric acid solution and the cleared material was rinsed diluted and mounted in pleurax medium for microscopic examination diatoms were identified using a compound microscope at 1250 magnification according to the taxonomic keys of metzeltin et al 2005 the samples were sedimented in a sedgewick rafter sedimentation chamber and were analysed using the strip count method apha awwa wpcf 1992 the concentration cell cm 2 was estimated by multiplying the number of valves from each taxon by a conversion factor according to the methods of hermany et al 2006 the numerical indicators for general grouping of the abundance of diatom taxa at each sampling site were categorised as follows 1 50 rare 2 51 250 scarce 3 251 1000 common 4 1001 5000 abundant and 5 5001 25 000 predominant cells cm2 only live diatoms containing chlorophyll were counted 2 6 bottom sediment metal analyses the total concentrations of a selection of metals and other elements were quantified in composite sediment samples consisting of three random grab samples collected per sampling site the samples were maintained on ice and at 4 c during storage and transportation and digested in a nitric acid hydrogen peroxide solution prior to analysis a thermo icap 6300 icp aes

coupled to a global positioning system gps deployed on the boat at each selected site flow measurements were made providing details of the flow structure characteristics in order to obtain representative values of the time averaged three dimensional velocities at each site a series of 4 replicate transect lines were performed and subsequently averaged according to szupiany et al 2007 the velocity mapping toolbox parsons et al 2013 was employed to process velocity data primary pv and secondary sv flow structures around the studied sites were analysed according to the rozovskii definition the latter method essentially identifies the primary velocity direction for each profile as the depth integrated flow vector and the secondary currents were then obtained by the differences from this average vector within the profile this procedure effectively identifies individual secondary planes at each vertical profile across a given section thus allowing for identification of helical motion within a section without distorting the secondary flow results cf szupiany et al 2007 2009 for methodological details following this methodology we were able to determine discharge m 3

site c2 has previously been recorded in the paran√° river under environmental conditions of low light penetration almost anoxic conditions and high nitrate and phosphate concentrations devercelli et al 2014 according to these authors species of this genus are probably mixotrophic regarding their capacity to grow in extremely poor light intensities and tolerate very low oxygen contents the only occurrence of the macroinvertebrate species pristina americana naididae at sampling site c2 impacted by sewage effluent relates with findings of petsch et al 2015 who reported that the abundance of p americana occurred under environmental conditions with high values of organic matter and low dissolved oxygen which is symptomatic of surface waters impacted by sewage effluent although literature generally suggests that metal content increases when sediment grain size decreases this relation of metal content to particle size was not clear in the current study fig 3 spearman rank correlations however indicated silt content as a predictor of increased metal concentrations whereas sand and clay content were not du laing et al 2007 performed an in depth assessment of metal contamination in the sediments of the severe polluted freshwater tidal zone system of the scheldt river belgium and the netherlands as part of the investigation the silt clay sand organic matter among other factors were characterized and applied in predictive modelling using stepwise regression equations maslennikova et al 2012 suggested that content and distribution of metals and organic matter were defined not only by particle size of sediments but also by conditions of its accumulation particularly the ecological state and climatic parameters ciszewski 2004 found changes in metal concentrations related to transport of river bed material dead water zones and bed morphology in the mala panew river specifically in this study the confluence zone of site lc1 possibly act as a deposit area playing an important role as sink for fine and metal polluted sediments fig 4a although the concentration of metals at this sampling site was below the threshold level according to burton 2002 it was higher in comparison to sampling sites pmc and lc2 the origin of the polluted sediment from site lc1 is not clear since it could be related to contaminants coming from the paran√° river main channel or on the contrary from las conchas river the bed sediment sizes recorded at lc1 45 silt and around 30 clay is closely related to that of the fine sediment transported in suspension in the paran√° river amsler and drago 2009 this observation suggests two possible explanations firstly that the suspended sediments coming from the paran√° river main channel was deposited at site lc1 together with metals transported by the fine suspended sediments being accumulated gradually at relatively low concentrations this possibility conforms with mugetti 2004 observations who reported an association between heavy metals and suspended material in the paran√° river secondly it is recognized that metals have natural or anthropogenic sources in aquatic environments based on this fact it may be inferred that metals deposited at lc1 originated in sites upstream the sampling area from both types of sources on one hand the paran√° river exhibits thick beds of marine and continental sedimentary rocks as well as outcrops of metamorphic rocks along with volcanic rocks of quaternary age which could be a source of metals pasquini and depetris 2012 on the other hand metals induced by human activities is a true possibility in the paran√° river peluso et al 2013 since large human settlements and factories of argentina and paraguay extend along the banks and nearby areas of its main channel and tributaries discharging point and nonpoint sources of waste and sewage effluent from domestic as well as industrial origin high concentrations of ammonium nitrates and phosphates as well as metals agrochemicals and biphenyl poly chlorines have also been found near to urban areas of this river system un water wwap 2007 peluso et al 2013 ronco et al 2016 in contrast distinctive ecological features macroinvertebrate composition and relative abundance were observed at sampling sites c1 lc2 and pmc fig 2 and table 1 these sites were predominantly colonized by n bonettoi m paranaensis and lopescladius sp table 2 according to ezcurra de drago et al 2007 and blettler et al 2012 the presence of these species which integrate the so called active bed assemblage indicate good water quality conditions and a bottom substrate composed essentially by medium and coarse sands fig 3 and table 3 macroinvertebrate species from this assemblage typically inhabiting interstitial spaces between sand grains of sandy rivers blettler et al 2008 amsler et al 2009 have a very low biomass which results in poor energy resources for higher trophic levels ezcurra de drago et al 2007 it should be noted that the dune trough at site pmc did not accumulate pollutants as expected fig 3 even when a reduction of bed hydraulic forces occur in alluvial dunes as is widely known e g kostaschuk et al 2004 best 2005 amsler et al 2009 it was not enough as to generate a sink area for metal polluted sediments in the main channel in this case two possible explanations for this fact are i the current in the central strip of the main channel was too strong as to cause any deposition of pollutants in the dune trough and ii the sandy sediment of the dune 93 8 sand prevented metal accumulation due to vertical dune packing and porosity this finding is of ecological relevance because dune troughs where a reduced disturbance of bed particles exists due to the smaller bed shear stresses were described as refuge areas for macroinvertebrate community by amsler et al 2009 and blettler et al 2012 regarding the quality of bottom sediments in the paran√° river tributaries and in its main channel the concentrations of some metals cr mn and fe were significantly higher than those reported by peluso et al 2013 whereas the concentrations of cd pb hg and zn were lower the differences could be related with the influence of channel morphology on flow configuration e g confluences may create point regions where velocity reduces favoring the deposition of fine and metal polluted sediments increasing concentrations in bottom sediments this type of process gives rise to a non homogeneous distribution pattern of metal content in bed sediments 5 conclusions results of the current study showed that point source sewage effluence as in site c2 was one of the major sources for metal accumulation in bottom sediments of the middle parana river thus this type of sites should be included as part of a pollution monitoring framework in the future changes in macroinvertebrate and epipelic diatom assemblages as bioindicators of anthropogenic pollution were also evident downstream of urban sewage effluents in comparison to the other sampling sites furthermore apparently the only occurrence of the species pristina americana and the larger numbers of the pollution tolerant diatom craticula accomoda as revealed results at site c2 justify their future use as potential indicators of sewage pollution impacted bottom sediments in the middle parana river moreover results indicate that pollutants would not be homogenously distributed in the bottom sediments but in specific sites such as confluences where depositional areas occur due to velocity reductions as a consequence of the particular configuration of flow confluences would be important point sinks for fine and metal polluted sediments other typical flow phenomenon as the decrement in local bed hydraulic forces over the trough of alluvial dunes which are ubiquitous on the bed of the main parana river channel would not be enough as to accumulate metals in those bottom regions these observations concerning the diverse flow configurations in a large alluvial river like the paran√° are important factors that should be taken into consideration when selecting samplings sites for the development of a pollution

modeling interface setmi geli and neale 2012 the tseb model used a landsat 8 satellite image covering the study area with three different plant cover sugarcane planted forest and native forest fig 3 for each month of the two hydrological years of this study 24 images collected from april 2013 to march 2015 inputs for the estimation of et for each date by tseb requires the ingestion of land cover information which is provided via the setmi interface this input includes landsat 8 bands 3 4 and 5 converted to reflectance and atmospherically corrected surface temperature band 10 of landsat 8 and the meteorological data of the study region the meteorological information was obtained by interpolating observations from brazilian national institute of meteorology inmet observations which have temporal resolution of 15min to the hour and minute of the satellite s passage fig 4 land cover was classified using segmentation and visual identification of the targets with subsequent verification of the errors using the kappa index presented by bosquilia et al 2018 to estimate monthly et we derived a reference evapotranspiration eto for the satellite s day of passage using meteorological data provided by inmet applying the penman monteith method pm monteith 1965 and then multiplying by the mean kcs crop coefficients in the study area which was 0 783 and the number of days of the particular month bosquilia 2016 this used the reference evapotranspiration calculator refet allen 2008 as adapted by allen et al 1994 from allen et al 1989 this method is presently used by fao this multiplication of the estimated daily et values by the number of days of each month was also performed for the estimation of et via satellite image thus the monthly et estimates were obtained for the regional et estimate et was derived for each land class and multiplied by its area the monthly values of et estimated by penman monteith method were divided by the monthly values of et tseb obtaining a mean coefficient for all months of the study representing the relationship between the two methods of et estimation classical estimation via penman monteith and new estimation via tseb this coefficient was used to adjust all the monthly tseb et values thus these values now corrected and extrapolated from a single day of a given month were more adequate for that monthly estimate a digital terrain model dtm band x derived from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm with 30 m resolution was used to segment the region into 6 altitude classes less than 600m 600 700m 700 800m 800 900m 900 1000m and greater than 1000m the dtm was also used to derive slope into 5 classes 0 3 3 6 6 12 12 18 and greater than 18 following the methodology used by pereira 2000 and mello et al 2006 to estimate terrain exposure to solar radiation a map was generated for only 5 classes flat north south east and west with the following angles of the compass rose represented by each class north 315 45 east 45 135 south 135 225 and west 225 315 the total and relative areas of each altitude class are presented by bosquilia 2016 the monthly et estimates were then separated by vegetation type sugarcane planted forest and native forest and crossed with maps containing relief parameters altitude slope exposure and biomes cerrado and atlantic forest to spatially evaluate the et estimate for each plant cover 2 3 data analysis multivariate statistical techniques were applied to a data matrix containing each phytophysiognomy sugarcane planted forest and native forest considering altitude slope and terrain exposure for each of the two biomes these matrices were made up of 18 lines 16 topographic variations two biomes and 24 columns variables made up of the evapotranspiration evaluations in 24

was applied using euclidean squared distance as a measure of similarity dissimilarity once the groups were obtained a discriminant analysis was performed via fisher s linear discriminant method welling 2005 kilca et al 2015 aiming to classify evapotranspiration in the respective groups formed in the three phytophysiognomies studied and to evaluate the percentage of correct classification within them the analyses were performed using spss ibm corporation 2011 software 3 results and discussion the analysis classified the evapotranspiration of sugarcane planted forest and native forest formations into three distinct groups fig 5a c in the sugarcane areas fig 5a group 1 included evapotranspiration occurring at lower altitudes up to 700m and lower declivities up to 12 for all exposures flat north east south and west and in both phytogeographic formations cerrado and atlantic forest group 2 included evapotranspiration at medium elevations from 700 to 900m group 3 included evapotranspiration at higher altitudes and higher declivities in the area with planted forest fig 5b group 1 represented evapotranspiration at lower altitudes up to 700m in the atlantic forest formation group 2 included evapotranspiration at medium altitudes 700 800m and low to medium declivities up to 18 for all exposures flat north east south and west in the cerrado phytogeographic formation group 3 included higher altitudes 900m and higher declivities 18 in the case of native forest fig 5c group 1 classified evapotranspiration at lower altitudes up to 800m and lower declivities up to 12 for all exposures flat north east south and west and in both phytogeographic formations cerrado and atlantic forest group 2 included evapotranspiration at higher altitudes 800m and higher declivities 12 group 3 classified evapotranspiration from flat sites fig 5 and verified by fig 8 show that evapotranspiration was significantly different between altitudes and declivities topography influenced evapotranspiration independent of exposure north east south and west plant cover and biome type there was a clear separation between evapotranspiration at lower altitudes and declivities at medium altitudes and declivities and at higher altitudes and declivities especially in sugarcane and planted forest areas most of them with species of the genus eucalyptus and some with pinus in the area with native forest there was separation of a group in the flatlands that presented less evapotranspiration for the three land cover types one group included evapotranspiration at higher altitudes 900m in sugarcane and planted forest and 800m in native forest and larger declivities 12 in sugarcane and native forest and 18 in planted forest a second group was comprised of low altitude 700m in the sugarcane and 800m in planted forest and native forest and low declivity sites 12 in sugarcane and native forest and 18 in planted forest a third group of evapotranspiration was formed by the medium elevations 700 900m in sugarcane and planted forest and flatlands in native forest evapotranspiration was greater at higher altitudes and declivities than for lower altitudes and declivities fig 6 this is consistent with the results of costa et al 2010 and goulden et al 2012 the amount of water and the speed with which it circulates in the different phases of the hydrological cycle are influenced by several factors such as plant cover altitude topography temperature soil type and geology carvalho et al 2007 the slope and exposure is an important ecological factor that controls thermal effects for example in the southern hemisphere it is generally assumed that north facing slopes receive more direct radiation than south facing slopes fu and rich 1999 evapotranspiration was always higher in the summer in all areas this is due to higher temperatures fig 7 between september and april evaporation was also greater at higher altitudes and greater terrain declivities fig 7 shows that the greatest evapotranspiration occurred in the spring and summer months in all areas the direct influence of solar radiation on evapotranspiration was also verified in the research studies of jensen and haise 1963 goward and hope 1989 samani 2000 garatuza payan et al 2001 irmak et al 2003 bois et al 2008 and valipour 2015 the highest evapotranspiration rates occurred between september and april summer and spring with greater intensity in february and december fig 7 the values were 140mm month for the area with sugarcane 170mm month for the area with planted forest and 150mm month for the native forest area evapotranspiration was higher in the area with planted forest followed by the native forest area which was slightly higher than the area with sugarcane almeida and soares 2003 carried out an intensive hydrological monitoring since 1994 in a microbasin in the municipality of aracruz es brazil in eucalyptus grandis plantations and in a native atlantic forest for comparison estimates show that evapotranspiration and soil water use in eucalyptus plantations compare to that of native forest the discriminant analysis showed that for the sugarcane area showed a difference between the collections of february 2015 and october 2014 p 0 001 it also selected two fisher s linear discriminant functions to represent 100 of the explained variance the first function already represents 92 of the variance the classification was 100 correct fig 8a for the planted forest the discriminant analysis selected four groups the collections of april 2014 october 2013 march 2015 and may 2013 p 0 001 it also selected two fisher s linear discriminant functions to represent 100 of the explained variance the first function represents 84 4 of the variance and the second function 15 6 the classification was 100 correct fig 8b for the native forest area the discriminant analysis selected nine groups august 2013 september 2013 march 2014 december 2013 june 2013 february 2015 september 2014 october 2014 and march 2014 p 0 001 it also selected two fisher s linear discriminant functions to represent 100 of the explained variance the first function already represents 99 9 of the variance the classification was 100 correct fig 8c group 3 flat sites was distant from the other groups showing that evapotranspiration of flat sites is quite different from inclined sites group 1 locations with lower altitudes and lower declivities and group 2 higher altitudes and higher declivities were similar all observations of the groups are very close to the centroids not appearing in the figure demonstrating that the values of evapotranspiration observations are homogeneous throughout the year 4 conclusions we found that 1 three evapotranspiration groups were formed by multivariate statistics in the study area one at the highest altitudes and declivities where there is greater evapotranspiration another at medium altitudes and declivities and a third at low altitudes and declivities 2 in the area with native forest there was the formation of a group in the flatlands where there is less evapotranspiration 3 the highest rates of evapotranspiration occurred in the summer and spring when temperatures are higher 4 evapotranspiration was higher in planted forests but not much beyond that of native forests 5 multivariate techniques were efficient in the classification of evapotranspiration as a function of local topography conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards

always higher in the summer in all areas this is due to higher temperatures fig 7 between september and april evaporation was also greater at higher altitudes and greater terrain declivities fig 7 shows that the greatest evapotranspiration occurred in the spring and summer months in all areas the direct influence of solar radiation on evapotranspiration was also verified in the research studies of jensen and haise 1963 goward and hope 1989 samani 2000 garatuza payan et al 2001 irmak et al 2003 bois et al 2008 and valipour 2015 the highest evapotranspiration rates occurred between september and april summer and spring with greater intensity in february and december fig 7 the values were 140mm month for the area with sugarcane 170mm month for the area with planted forest and 150mm month for the native forest area evapotranspiration was higher in the area with planted forest followed by the native forest area which was slightly higher than the area with sugarcane almeida and soares 2003 carried out an intensive hydrological monitoring since 1994 in a microbasin in the municipality of aracruz es brazil in eucalyptus grandis plantations and in a native atlantic forest for comparison estimates show that evapotranspiration and soil water use in eucalyptus plantations compare to that of native forest the discriminant analysis showed that for the sugarcane area showed a

9 of the variance the classification was 100 correct fig 8c group 3 flat sites was distant from the other groups showing that evapotranspiration of flat sites is quite different from inclined sites group 1 locations with lower altitudes and lower declivities and group 2 higher altitudes and higher declivities were similar all observations of the groups are very close to the centroids not appearing in the figure demonstrating that the values of evapotranspiration observations are homogeneous throughout the year 4 conclusions we found that 1 three evapotranspiration groups were formed by multivariate statistics in the study area one at the highest altitudes and declivities where there is greater evapotranspiration another at medium altitudes and declivities and a third at low altitudes and declivities 2 in the area with native forest there was the formation of a group in the flatlands where there is less evapotranspiration 3 the highest rates of evapotranspiration occurred in the summer and spring when temperatures are higher 4 evapotranspiration was higher in planted forests but not much beyond that of native forests 5 multivariate techniques were efficient in the

1129,this study used a long term monitoring data to analyse the abundance seasonal dynamics spatial distribution and catchment export of total organic carbon toc in one of the largest undisturbed peatland river catchment in central europe mean annual toc concentrations in the narew river basin were higher than 10 11mgcl 1 which is similar to nemoral or baltic rivers the maximal monthly toc concentrations occurred in may with a one month delay from the spring maximum of water outflow high toc concentrations were accompanied by naturally increased organic nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations resulting in decreased water quality class despite the anthropogenic pressure is low mean annual export of toc from the narew river catchment amounted to 2 15gcm 2 which is nearly 25 higher than for the vistula river the recipient toc export form the analysed river basin in dry years was 30 lower and 50 higher in wet years than the multiannual average the primary cause of high toc concentrations in the narew river catchment and high toc export is the occurrence of biogeochemically active wetlands functioning not only thanks to spring flooding of the valleys but also based on permanent intensive groundwaters supply from surrounding plateaus this emphasises the importance of basin hydrology in the regulation of carbon cycling in the temperate lowland catchments our results also indicate that in environmental zonation of europe narew river catchment should be classified as belonging to the baltic province nemoral environmental zone rather then to continental zone this is because it is characterized with high riverine toc concentrations and natural water oxygen depletion in summers thus environmental stratification of europe developed for environmental statistics and

chemical and biochemical functions in an ecosystem particularly important for microorganisms and protozoans mann and wetzel 1995 pagano et al 2014 river poc forms constitute food for filtering animals shredders and detritivores wetzel 2009 most of river ecosystems functioning concepts point out two basic factors playing an important role in the development of river habitat the first one is the hydrological regime determining the qualitative and quantitative seasonality of water flux it results not only from the morphological parameters of the catchment but also from the hydroclimatic conditions of the area and size of the catchment together they can be synthetically determinated as water vector defined as a water volume and time of catchment flushing an increasing role of the water vector expressed in unitary runoff or runoff index in the catchment contributes in the increased water supply and thickness of the ectohumus layer of soils as well as increased range of peat soils and other hydrogenic soils wetlands such a situation occurs in boreal forests and in tropical catchments with strongly maritime climate there the river waters are rich in organic matter where toc concentrations largely exceed 10 15mgcdm 3 and annual toc export in the catchment exceeds 3 4gcm 2 de wit et al 2016 the highest abundance of toc in flowing waters is related to the initial or maximum flux in rivers as particularly observed in mountain catchments partially fed by melting glaciers rodriguez murillo et al 2015 a decrease in the value of the water vector in the catchment occurs in the temperate climate zone of mixed forests and in tundra periods of reduced water supply to the catchment stimulate the processes of mineralisation of soil organic matter and as a consequence cause a decrease in export of organic matter from the catchments raymond et al 2016 fluvial toc transport in the temperate climatic zone is particularly distinguished from that of the mediterranean zone and savannas where seasonality is observed schleslinger 1981 meyback 1982 in the tropical zone the structure of transported organic matter is unlike to other zones poc prevails over doc lu et al 2012 and not the other way round as it is observed in other climatic zones on earth anthropogenic transformations of the organic carbon circulation in aquatic ecosystems occur in every landscape on earth although with variable intensity and direction supply of untreated sewage leads to increased toc concentration in rivers deforestation urbanisation processes and other changes of land use generally reduce the abundance of organic matter in waters and change toc quality stanley et al 2012 lauriane et al 2015 a change in the hydrological regime resulting from melioration hydrotechnical measures or water retention in reservoirs leads to versatile changes in the toc resources worrall et al 2012 repeated estimates of the organic matter reserves in world s rivers meyback 1982 schleslinger 1981 ludwig et al 1996 gives the actual image at the global scale battin et al 2009 determined that only a part of the activated river load of toc reaches oceans because approximately 44 is subject to direct utilization in river ecosystems supplying a considerable load of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere so far investigations concerning the specificity of fluvial transport of organic matter have been largely documented in boreal areas raike et al 2016 de wit et al 2016 or in a few tropical rivers and regions with monsoon climate araujo et al 2014 central europe was usually omitted in the analyses at the continental scale and based on outdated state for the vistula river catchment niemirycz 1997 too far to the current situation therefore the objective of this paper was to determine the aboundance and dynamics of toc in river waters of a central european catchment with a high contribution of riverine wetlands with relatively low anthropogenic transformations based on long term monitoring the paper presents the spatial and seasonal variability of fluvial transport of organic matter and a forecast of changes considering the progressing climate changes 2 study area the narew river is the largest lowland right bank tributary of the vistula river flowing from the east towards south west in its lower course it is fed by the waters of the bug river partly located on loess plateaus or peaty plains of polesie region narew as a main river is frequently presented in hydrological studies as one catchment together with the bug river due to evident differences in the landscape and climate however this paper applies the term narew river catchment as specifically referring to the area of the narew river catchment upstream the mouth of the bug river currently upstream lake zegrzy≈Ñskie fig 1 both the bug and narew rivers have their sources outside of the territory of poland in ukraine and belarus respectively and they are both cross border rivers in its upper course the narew river only drains middle pleistocene plateaus and in its middle and lower course areas of the vistulian glaciation with loamy moraine plateaus or sandy glaciofluvial plains the spatially diverse fluvial system results from the dominance of the right bank part of the catchment with rivers flowing out of lakes over the left bank part with rivers less abundant in water the narew river valley also has variable width and character with alternating sections of a multi channel river including anastomosing and meandering river with a variable width of flood terraces 1 10km sections with a character of gorges are present on the course of the main river in the upper course the river valley has a character of interconnected extensive oval depressions and in its middle and lower course downstream the biebrza river inflow it is considerably deeper incised into the surrounding plateaus with an increasing number of oxbow lakes as a consequence of occurrence of numerous and extensive depressions the narew river basin is characterised by the highest contribution of wetlands both in poland and in central europe peatlands are dominating in main river valley bottom as well as in biebrza river where organic soils occupied more than 15 of total basin area arable lands account for over 60 of basin and forests nearly 30 in part growing on peat or fluvisols and gley soils in the biebrza and narew rivers valleys exist specific spatial hydro pedological schemes typical for natural central european rivers conditioning the biogeochemical relations between river hydrological regime soil formation and corresponding plants communities wassen and joosten 1996 the extensive range of protected areas in the catchment and satisfactory ecological state of the wetlands result from inconsiderable anthropogenic transformations of the historical cross border areas of poland and lithuania or former prussia the narew river catchment differs from other larger tributaries of the vistula river in terms of small population low level of fertilization of arable land gie≈Çczewski 2003 and inconsiderable air pollution the occurring climatic conditions are typical of humid climate dbf temperate with cold winters according to the classification by k√∂ppen geiger peel et al 2007 with mean annual air temperature 6 5 c and total precipitations varying from 550 to 700mm g√≥rniak 2000 due to the progressing global climate changes the contribution of snowfall in winter precipitation systematically decreases the duration of the vegetative period increases to approximately 200 210 days and the frequency and duration of periods with no precipitation increases the narew river and its tributaries have rainfall snowmelt regime with a spring maximum of fluxes and minimum fluxes in early autumn fig 2 in the period 2000 2014 the mean flux of the rivers of the analysed catchment was considerably higher than the value for the multiannual 1951 1995 due to high discharges in summer 2010 and winter 2011 fig 3 then a flood occurred on the upper and middle vistula river majewski 2013 early spring snowmelt flood events were often noted in the narew river valley up to the end of 70s in xx century and with the last spring flood in year 1981 the remains of such spring floods in the narew catchment are currently observed only in the biebrza river valley and are thus less frequent okruszko et al 2006 catchments of lakeland rivers pisa biebrza and omulew 8 7 2 5 2 3 of lake area in basins respectively are characterised by higher water resources than catchments of rivers located on plateaus and outwash plain as shown by different values of runoff table 1 unit specific outflow from the analysed rivers in a wet year 2011 was more than twice higher than in a dry year 2003 fig 3 the hydrological diversity of rivers of the catchment is accurately reflected by the relationship between the highest and lowest mean monthly discharge in the narew omulew and supra≈õl rivers it amounted to 10 12 in biebrza river more than 30 and in the pisa and czarna rivers it was twice as low as in the main river table 1 3 methods the basic hydrochemical data were obtained from the data base of the national monitoring of polish rivers for the period 2000 2014 by the inspectorates of environmental protection in bia≈Çystok and warsaw the collected data base covers data from 4 stations n1 n4 distributed along the course of the narew river with increasing order and four measurement sites on direct tributaries of the narew river supra≈õl s biebrza b pisa p omulew o as well as the 3rd order czarna river tributary of supra≈õl c located at a small distance from the mouth to the main river narew fig 1 the bondary station n1 was located approximately 1km downstream the polyhumic hypertrophic water reservoir siemian√≥wka g√≥rniak et al 2002 the discussed data set is the first multiannual series of direct measurements of toc in polish rivers moreover the study applies data from a 5 year period 2005 2209 for 3 4 order rivers feeding the narew river in its lower course namely r√≥≈º r szkwa sz rozoga ro orzyc or and orz o fig 1 water samples for the analyses were taken from a surface 1m depth layer from the central part of river with the highest flow velocity measurements of temperature ph electrolytic conductivity ec of river waters as well as determination of oxygen concentration by means of the electrometric method were performed in the field at mainly monthly intervals more frequent sampling programme 2 or 3 per month was used in stations n4 in years 2000 2007 toc concentration was determined at a laboratory by the method of high temperature combustion in a shiatzu apparatus in accordance with norm pn en 1484 direct toc determinations for a part of stations only commenced in 2004 except for station n4 where direct toc analyses were made therefore toc values for years 2000 2004 were supplemented from the correlation between permanganate oxidability codmn and toc concentration calculated for each station from simultaneous measurements of both of the parameters over a period of 4 years after 2004 similarly as it had been done by kortelainen 1993 or worrall and burt 2007 calculated regressions have a high correlation r 2 0 7 and p 0 001 fig 4 from period 2005 2009 as well as from years 2000 to 2004 n4 station in narew river when codmn and toc were done simultaneously fig 4c the conducted analyses indicated that in the years 2000 2004 the relationship between codmn and toc was similar to that in later years and the applied calculation procedure ensures data comparability g√≥rniak 2017 in the case of lack of unitary measurements in the measurement series toc values were supplemented by the arithmetic mean from the contiguous measurements hydrological data in calendar years used in the calculations of toc export were obtained from daily measurements performed by the institute of meteorology and water management imgw at the same stations as sample collection for chemical analyses on the pu≈Çtusk station n4 mean monthly fluxes in the narew river were calculated based on measurements from the zambski ko≈õcielne station located approximately 10km upstream the water sampling site with consideration of the catchment expansion monthly toc load were calculated as multiplication of mean monthly toc concentrations and average of monthly flow and annual toc loads were sum of monthly flux in a given profile this procedure gives similar results as nutrients load calculation suggested by helcom or ospar commissions g√≥rniak 2017 in the case of breaks in measurements for a given station annual loads were calculated from the linear correlation between mean annual flux and toc load they were always characterised by values r 2 of more than 0 68 p 0 001 as shown by example correlations for two rivers from analysed basin fig 5 additionally annual average toc concentrations were normalised using a monthly flow according to methods described in hope et al 1997 statistical analyses were performed by means of the past v 3 14 software hammer et al 2001 with the application of the pearson s correlation analysis and mann kendall trend test 4 results 4 1 toc concentrations the range of toc concentrations recorded during 15 years of research on all rivers of the narew river catchment was from 2 8mgcdm 3 to 69 7mgcdm 3 whereas the minimum and maximum concentrations were recorded in the same river supra≈õl table 2 the mean toc concentration expressed in flux mean weight flow in the narew river decreased from the mouth of the pisa river and gradually increased in the lower course the biebrza szkwa and rozoga rivers showed the highest mean toc concentrations and the lowest rivers flowing into the middle and lower course of the narew river from the areas formed under last glacial period pisa orzyc orz r√≥≈º tables 2 and 3 in the annual cycle two periods with higher toc concentrations are distinguished in the spring period with a maximum in april and in a part of tributaries in july and august during spring floods toc concentrations increased by approximately 20 25 and in the summer period they decreased by 10 15 fig 6 summer heavy rainfalls caused an increase in toc concentrations and in tributaries of the narew river they reached values higher than those recorded during spring floods therefore the coefficients of variability of toc in july and august were the highest in a year in the main narew river and szkwa river maximum annual concentrations occur during spring snowmelts and mean monthly toc concentrations for the summer period were considerably lower than those in spring also summer periodical increase of toc concentrations in rivers is connected with decrease of oxygen saturation in water sometimes below 45 or lower this situation presents an example from biebrza river in year 2009 fig 7 in the analysed rivers the highest spring toc concentrations occurred with a one or two month delay in relation to the highest monthly discharge fig 8 multiannual changes in toc concentrations in the analysed rivers of the narew river catchment were of variable character at a part of sites a statistically significant increase in mean annual toc concentrations was recorded and confirmed by mann kendall statistical tests supra≈õl p 0 017 pisa p 0 038 fig 9 in the rest analysed stations multiannual toc fluctuations were noted without significant trends 4 2 export of toc in the period 2000 1014 the mean annual export of toc from the narew river catchment n4 amounted to 2 15gcm 2 with values in dry years 30 lower than the multiannual mean and in wet years 50 higher than the mean value the highest annual export of toc of more than 2gcm 2 was also recorded in the upper narew river n1 and in the tributaries biebrza and szkwa catchments with a larger area were characterised by mean annual export of 1 6 1 7gcm 2 tables 2 and 3 and in smaller catchments draining outwash plains annual export of toc was lower by 1 3 table 3 the load of organic carbon transported in rivers of the narew catchment shows evident seasonality over a period of 4 months from february to may rivers transported from 45 to 55 of the annual load from the river and less from the supra≈õl and czarna river catchments namely from 40 to 43 the lowest monthly export of toc at an annual scale occurred in september and october and constituted only 8 12 of the annual load fig 10 5 discussion the presence of organic carbon in running waters is an indicator of the abundance of organic matter in soils in the catchment and the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems aufdenkampe et al 2011 it is subject to considerable regulation by hydroclimatic conditions anthropogenic transformations of catchments usually cause an increase in toc concentrations as a result of supply of untreated sewage sachse et al 2005 therefore one of the criteria for assessment of good ecological state is a low level of mean toc concentrations accompanied with low water colouration the presented data strongly suggest that in the narew river catchment with a relatively low level of anthropopressure toc concentrations were high exceeding acceptable levels for unpolluted rivers and significantly different than the toc concentrations in other central european rivers simultaneously the results were similar to those of rivers of the boreal zone raike et al 2016 and lower than in tropical catchments table 4 the primary cause for the increased but natural toc concentrations in the narew river catchment is the occurrence of wetlands and particularly holocene peatlands subject to a low level of anthropogenic transformations in the analysed rivers no evident autumn increase in toc concentrations was recorded which is typically associated with falling leaves in catchments of the temperate climate zone with mixed and deciduous forests of western europe tockner et al 2009 or eastern united states freeman et al 2001 stets and striegl 2012 causes for this are linked to relatively dry continental autumn periods and winter ice phenomena on rivers in the narew river catchment in comparison to catchments with more oceanic climate g√≥rniak 2017 therefore forest floor does not contribute much as a source of organic matter into waters due to a limited or unencountered overland flow and lack of increased supply of groundwaters by soil waters in that period peat forming processes result in continuous release of water soluble organic compounds to soil solution and then to rivers the continuity and load of organic matter to waters is a result of continuous anaerobic and incomplete decomposition of detritus developing in the productive wetland systems with dominance of fulvic acids and development of geochemically labile complexes with iron and manganese tranvik and von wachenfeldt 2010 the hydrological system of river valleys plays an important role in ensuring the active peat forming process and continuous supply of organic matter to rivers in the narew river catchment the specificity of the system involves stable water persistence in the valleys owing to the active drainage of groundwaters the abundance of groundwater supply to the valleys as well as the snowmelt precipitation hydrological regime of rivers and the extensive flooding of the river valleys ensures the permanence of the peat forming process this ecohydrological system is unique at the european scale following the ecological rivers classification european environment agency http www eea europa eu data and maps figures ecoregions for rivers and lakes a considerable abundance of organic matter in running waters is a feature of rivers typical for the fenno scandian shield sensu illies 1967 as well as the neighbouring baltic province therefore considering the obtained results the narew river should be included in the baltic province due to similar biogeochemical processes occurring in waters with increased toc concentrations if it concerns the more recent environmental classification of europe metzger et al 2005 the studied parameter of running waters is very common to nemoral environmental zone of europe thus the south western boundary of the nemoral ecoregion should run in poland far more to the south from the currently determined boundaries also summer oxygen depletion in humic rivers is similar phenomenon in both zones the presented study identifies the phenomenon of a delay of the spring maximum toc concentration in relation to the maximum fluxes irrespective to river size the near monthly period of data sampling have not impacted the findings because spring high water in rivers persists for a long period of time and it has been observed by the author in many other rivers in this region data not presented previous studies focused on processes in mountain rivers or lowland small catchment rivers alvarez cobelas et al 2012 where short time of water retention in the catchment is related to the short time of organic matter flux activated with surface or soil hypodermic flow in the valleys of narew and biebrza rivers and their tributaries extensive peatland terraces with a considerable width two or more km exist they are flooded usually in spring analyses with the application of satellite techniques show such floods usually last for more than three months fluet chouinard et al 2015 therefore the prolonged water retention and possibility of longer transfer of organic matter from peatland soils to flood waters results in a delayed increase in toc resources in running waters another ecohydrological aspect in the water circulation of organic matter in peatland catchments is the hydrology of peatlands the rate of water infiltration in hydrated lowland peats is inconsiderable in comparison to mineral soils e g fluvisols or cambisols active water exchange in peat soils primarily occurs through macropores holden 2005 and particularly concerns the uppermost peat layer of 20 30cm acrotelm sensu ivanov 1948 after holden 2005 with the most intensive transformation of organic matter particularly in the presence of oxygen this results in an intensified migration of poc and doc from peatlands during spring floods in larger portions of peatland valleys and in the conditions of channel runoff primarily doc is exported from peatlands blodau 2002 also the investigated basin contains large areas with soils with high ratio c to n where higher organic flux is noted aitkenhead and mcdowell 2000 high toc concentrations in the rivers of the narew catchment were accompanied with the increased catchment export of toc with mean annual values ranging from 1 6gcm 2 to 2 3gcm 2 i e being in the upper range of values recorded for european rivers tockner et al 2009 such values are observed in boreal rivers with considerably lower mean annual air temperature higher annual precipitation and more than 2 3 times higher water runoff from the catchment in the studied case the presence of valley peatlands is the primary cause of increased catchment export of toc the system of municipal and industrial waste management functioning at present ensures the elimination of the load of organic matter of anthropogenic origin in more than 90 statistical yearbook of environment 2016 the results show that beginning from the fifth stream order section stream order according to strahler that is below station n2 the catchment load of toc is gradually reduced in the narew river section from the confluence with biebrza river downstream station n2 to the confluence with pisa river station n3 toc decreased by 1 8mtc per year and between stations n3 and n4 by 8 18mtc yr 1 this is the equivalent to a reduction of 18 4 103 tc and 7 1 103 tc per one km of the river length respectively this confirms the phenomenon of active limitation of export of organic carbon from terrestrial ecosystems through the fluvial system cole et al 2007 it is also in accordance with the pulse shunt concept pointing out the important role of stream order in the reduction of the river load of organic carbon raymond et al 2016 the recorded decrease in toc transport in the lower section of the analysed fluvial system also suggests a low level of transformation of the environmental conditions of the narew river valley permitting natural elimination of a part of the catchment load of toc due to the existence of spring and more seldom summer flooding of the peatland floor of the valleys the load of organic matter transported in rivers particularly originates from peatlands located near rivers the toc load supplied from sandy loamy plateaus to the river bottom is considerably lower than the total load of organic carbon exported from the catchment similar situations do not occur in the mountain and upland landscape due to a different system of water supply to the river channel and valley the specificity of the valleys of the narew biebrza and supra≈õl rivers also involves constant groundwater supply to the valleys through abundant aquifers with a regional range originating from deep and large area circulation nowicki and sadurski 2010 these groundwater bodies as understood by water framework directive in lowland part of poland play a significant role in water management these provide for permanent water persistence in valley peatlands and export of organic carbon also from the deep organic matter resources in addition to the toc load from the surface peat layer the overlapping hydrological effect and presence of the large area of valley peatlands in the analysed catchment becomes the primary cause of naturally increased abundance of toc in rivers and catchment export therefore hydrochemical parameters of low order tributaries are radically missed because water quality modification by wetlands biogeochemistry is considerable increased transport of waters within valley floors surface and underground flow provides a similar effect of an increase in catchment export of toc as recorded in the catchments of boreal rivers in ireland and great britain where large water runoff is a result of local climatic conditions the hydrochemical consequence of the existing ecohydrological system is also the fact of occurrence of increased concentrations of organic forms of nitrogen and phosphorus but not resulting from extensive agricultural production or supply of untreated sewage it is understandable because the molecules of humic substances constituting the primary component of toc also contain nitrogen and phosphorus and have the ability of complexing on their surface considerable amounts of organic and ionic forms of n and p tranvik and von wachenfeldt 2010 therefore an inherent element of increased catchment export of toc is also increased loads of substances commonly considered as indicators of anthropogenic eutrophication of waters according to unpublished data g√≥rniak unpubl in the analysed rivers the presence of 1mg of organic carbon corresponds with the occurrence of 0 3mg norg and 7 11Œºg tp in one litre of water this results only from the occurrence of natural organic matter transported in river waters in the conditions of toc concentrations of more than 10mgcdm 3 and neutral reaction the recorded concentrations of organic forms of n and p automatically reduce the class of water cleanliness in spite of the lack of substantial anthropogenic sources therefore in rivers where natural enrichment in organic matter occurs considerably higher levels of concentrations of organic nitrogen and tp should be adopted for classes of the chemical state in comparison to those adopted currently to sum up in rivers with extensive peatland valleys the hydrological factor plays an important role in the development of the abundance of toc in surface waters the forecasted hydrological effects in the rivers of central europe resulting from global climate changes will also cover transformations of the water cycle and organic carbon circulation in water ecosystems pagano et al 2014 lower winter precipitation in the form of snow reducing the amount and range of spring flooding of valleys will be a factor reducing the resources and catchment export of toc similarly as effects of long term droughts zieli≈Ñski et al 2009 summer periodical heavy rainfalls can only locally contribute to an increase in the activation of catchment toc load which due to natural processes will be limited in the valleys of rivers of 6 7 order the forecasted climate changes in the described types of rivers will limit the abundance and load of toc exported from the catchment as a consequence this may change the functional correlations in the structure of hydrobionts including the ichthyofauna community conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards

1129,this study used a long term monitoring data to analyse the abundance seasonal dynamics spatial distribution and catchment export of total organic carbon toc in one of the largest undisturbed peatland river catchment in central europe mean annual toc concentrations in the narew river basin were higher than 10 11mgcl 1 which is similar to nemoral or baltic rivers the maximal monthly toc

concentrations resulting in decreased water quality class despite the anthropogenic pressure is low mean annual export of toc from the narew river catchment amounted to 2 15gcm 2 which is nearly 25 higher than for the vistula river the recipient toc export form the analysed river basin in dry years was 30 lower and 50 higher in wet years than the multiannual average the primary cause of high toc

shredders and detritivores wetzel 2009 most of river ecosystems functioning concepts point out two basic factors playing an important role in the development of river habitat the first one is the hydrological regime determining the qualitative and quantitative seasonality of water flux it results not only from the morphological parameters of the catchment but also from the hydroclimatic conditions of the area and size of the catchment together they can be synthetically determinated as water vector defined as a water volume and time of catchment flushing an increasing role of the water vector expressed in unitary runoff or runoff index in the catchment contributes in the increased water supply and thickness of the ectohumus layer of soils as well as increased range of peat soils and other hydrogenic soils wetlands such a situation occurs in boreal forests and in tropical catchments with strongly maritime climate there the river waters are rich in organic matter where toc concentrations largely exceed 10 15mgcdm 3 and annual toc export in the catchment exceeds 3 4gcm 2 de wit et al 2016 the highest abundance of toc in flowing waters is related to the initial or maximum flux in rivers as particularly observed in mountain catchments partially fed by melting glaciers rodriguez murillo et al 2015 a decrease in the value of the water vector in the catchment occurs in the temperate climate zone of mixed forests and in tundra periods of reduced water supply to the catchment stimulate the processes of mineralisation of soil organic matter and as a consequence cause a decrease in export of organic matter from the catchments raymond et al 2016 fluvial toc transport in the temperate climatic zone is particularly distinguished from that of the mediterranean zone and savannas where seasonality is observed schleslinger 1981 meyback 1982 in the tropical zone the structure of transported organic matter is unlike to other zones poc prevails over doc lu et al 2012 and not the other way round as it is observed in other climatic zones on earth anthropogenic transformations of the organic carbon circulation in aquatic ecosystems occur in every landscape on earth although with variable intensity and direction supply of untreated sewage leads to increased toc concentration in rivers deforestation urbanisation processes and other changes of land use generally reduce the abundance of organic matter in waters and change toc quality stanley et al 2012 lauriane et al 2015 a change in the hydrological regime resulting from melioration hydrotechnical measures or water retention in reservoirs leads to versatile changes in the toc resources worrall et al 2012 repeated estimates of the organic matter reserves in world s rivers meyback 1982 schleslinger 1981 ludwig et al 1996 gives the actual image at the global scale battin et al 2009 determined that only a part of the activated river load of toc reaches oceans because approximately 44 is subject to direct utilization in river ecosystems supplying a considerable load of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere so far investigations concerning the specificity of fluvial transport of organic matter have been largely documented in boreal areas raike et al 2016 de wit et al 2016 or in a few tropical rivers and regions with monsoon climate araujo et al 2014 central europe was usually omitted in the analyses at the continental scale and based on outdated state for the vistula river catchment niemirycz 1997 too far to the current situation therefore the objective of this paper was to determine the aboundance and dynamics of toc in river waters of a central european catchment with a high contribution of riverine wetlands with relatively low anthropogenic transformations based on long term monitoring the paper presents the spatial and seasonal variability of fluvial transport of organic matter and a forecast of changes considering the progressing climate changes 2 study area the narew river is the largest lowland right bank tributary of the vistula river flowing from the east towards south west in its lower course it is fed by the waters of the bug river partly located on loess plateaus or peaty plains of polesie region narew as a main river is frequently presented in hydrological studies as one catchment together with the bug river due to evident differences in the landscape and climate however this paper applies the term narew river catchment as specifically referring to the area of the narew river catchment upstream the mouth of the bug river currently upstream lake zegrzy≈Ñskie fig 1 both the bug and narew rivers have their sources outside of the territory of poland in ukraine and belarus respectively and they are both cross border rivers in its upper course the narew river only drains middle pleistocene plateaus and in its middle and lower course areas of the vistulian glaciation with loamy moraine plateaus or sandy glaciofluvial plains the spatially diverse fluvial system results from the dominance of the right bank part of the catchment with rivers flowing out of lakes over the left bank part with rivers less abundant in water the narew river valley also has variable width and character with alternating sections of a multi channel river including anastomosing and meandering river with a variable width of flood terraces 1 10km sections with a character of gorges are present on the course of the main river in the upper course the river valley has a character of interconnected extensive oval depressions and in its middle and lower course downstream the biebrza river inflow it is considerably deeper incised into the surrounding plateaus with an increasing number of oxbow lakes as a consequence of occurrence of numerous and extensive depressions the narew river basin is characterised by the highest contribution of wetlands both in poland and in central europe peatlands are dominating in main river valley bottom as well as in biebrza river where organic soils occupied more than 15 of total basin area arable lands account for over 60 of basin and forests nearly 30 in part growing on peat or fluvisols and gley soils in the biebrza and narew rivers valleys exist specific spatial hydro pedological schemes typical for natural central european rivers conditioning the biogeochemical relations between river hydrological regime soil formation and corresponding plants communities wassen and joosten 1996 the extensive range of protected areas in the catchment and satisfactory ecological state of the wetlands result from inconsiderable anthropogenic transformations of the historical cross border areas of poland and lithuania or former prussia the narew river catchment differs from other larger tributaries of the vistula river in terms of small population low level of fertilization of arable land gie≈Çczewski 2003 and inconsiderable air pollution the occurring climatic conditions are typical of humid climate dbf temperate with cold winters according to the classification by k√∂ppen geiger peel et al 2007 with mean annual air temperature 6 5 c and total precipitations varying from 550 to 700mm g√≥rniak 2000 due to the progressing global climate changes the contribution of snowfall in winter precipitation systematically decreases the duration of the vegetative period increases to approximately 200 210 days and the frequency and duration of periods with no precipitation increases the narew river and its tributaries have rainfall snowmelt regime with a spring maximum of fluxes and minimum fluxes in early autumn fig 2 in the period 2000 2014 the mean flux of the rivers of the analysed catchment was considerably higher than the value for the multiannual 1951 1995 due to high discharges in summer 2010 and winter 2011 fig 3 then a flood occurred on the upper and middle vistula river majewski 2013 early spring snowmelt flood events were often noted in the narew river valley up to the end of 70s in xx century and with the last spring flood in year 1981 the remains of such spring floods in the narew catchment are currently observed only in the biebrza river valley and are thus less frequent okruszko et al 2006 catchments of lakeland rivers pisa biebrza and omulew 8 7 2 5 2 3 of lake area in basins respectively are characterised by higher water resources than catchments of rivers located on plateaus and outwash plain as shown by different values of runoff table 1 unit specific outflow from the analysed rivers in a wet year 2011 was more than twice higher than in a dry year 2003 fig 3 the hydrological diversity of rivers of the catchment is accurately reflected by the relationship between the highest and lowest mean monthly discharge in the narew omulew and supra≈õl rivers it amounted to 10 12 in biebrza river more than 30 and in the pisa and czarna rivers it was twice as low as in the main river table 1 3 methods the basic hydrochemical data were obtained from the data base of the national monitoring of polish rivers for the period 2000 2014 by the inspectorates of environmental protection in bia≈Çystok and warsaw the collected data base covers data from 4 stations n1 n4 distributed along the course of the narew river with increasing order and four measurement sites on direct tributaries of the narew river supra≈õl s biebrza b pisa p omulew o as well as the 3rd order czarna river tributary of supra≈õl c located at a small distance from the mouth to the main river narew fig 1 the bondary station n1 was located approximately 1km downstream the polyhumic hypertrophic water reservoir siemian√≥wka g√≥rniak et al 2002 the discussed data set is the first multiannual series of direct measurements of toc in polish rivers moreover the study applies data from a 5 year period 2005 2209 for 3 4 order rivers feeding the narew river in its lower course namely r√≥≈º r szkwa sz rozoga ro orzyc or and orz o fig 1 water samples for the analyses were taken from a surface 1m depth layer from the central part of river with the highest flow velocity measurements of temperature ph electrolytic conductivity ec of river waters as well as determination of oxygen concentration by means of the electrometric method were performed in the field at mainly monthly intervals more frequent sampling programme 2 or 3 per month was used in stations n4 in years 2000 2007 toc concentration was determined at a laboratory by the method of high temperature combustion in a shiatzu apparatus in accordance with norm pn en 1484 direct toc determinations for a part of stations only commenced in 2004 except for station n4 where direct toc analyses were made therefore toc values for years 2000 2004 were supplemented from the correlation between permanganate oxidability codmn and toc concentration calculated for each station from simultaneous measurements of both of the parameters over a period of 4 years after 2004 similarly as it had been done by kortelainen 1993 or worrall and burt 2007 calculated regressions have a high correlation r 2 0 7 and p 0 001 fig 4 from period 2005 2009 as well as from years 2000 to 2004 n4 station in narew river when codmn and toc were done simultaneously fig 4c the conducted analyses indicated that in the years 2000 2004 the relationship between codmn and toc was similar to that in later years and the applied calculation procedure ensures data comparability g√≥rniak 2017 in the case of lack of unitary measurements in the measurement series toc values were supplemented by the arithmetic mean from the contiguous measurements hydrological data in calendar years used in the calculations of toc export were obtained from daily measurements performed by the institute of meteorology and water management imgw at the same stations as sample collection for chemical analyses on the pu≈Çtusk station n4 mean monthly fluxes in the narew river were calculated based on measurements from the zambski ko≈õcielne station located approximately 10km upstream the water sampling site with consideration of the catchment expansion monthly toc load were calculated as multiplication of mean monthly toc concentrations and average of monthly flow and annual toc loads were sum of monthly flux in a given profile this procedure gives similar results as nutrients load calculation suggested by helcom or ospar commissions g√≥rniak 2017 in the case of breaks in measurements for a given station annual loads were calculated from the linear correlation between mean annual flux and toc load they were always characterised by values r 2 of more than 0 68 p 0 001 as shown by example correlations for two rivers from analysed basin fig 5 additionally annual average toc concentrations were normalised using a monthly flow according to methods described in hope et al 1997 statistical analyses were performed by means of the past v 3 14 software hammer et al 2001 with the application of the pearson s correlation analysis and mann kendall trend test 4 results 4 1 toc concentrations the range of toc concentrations recorded during 15 years of research on all rivers of the narew river catchment was from 2 8mgcdm 3 to 69 7mgcdm 3 whereas the minimum and maximum concentrations were recorded in the same river supra≈õl table 2 the mean toc concentration expressed in flux mean weight flow in the narew river decreased from the mouth of the pisa river and gradually increased in the lower course the biebrza szkwa and rozoga rivers showed the highest mean toc concentrations and the lowest rivers flowing into the middle and lower course of the narew river from the areas formed under last glacial period pisa orzyc orz r√≥≈º tables 2 and 3 in the annual cycle two periods with higher toc concentrations are distinguished in the spring period with a maximum in april and in a part of tributaries in july and august during spring floods toc concentrations increased by approximately 20 25 and in the summer period they decreased by 10 15 fig 6 summer heavy rainfalls caused an increase in toc concentrations and in tributaries of the narew river they reached values higher than those recorded during spring floods therefore the coefficients of variability of toc in july and august were the highest in a year in the main narew river and szkwa river maximum annual concentrations occur during spring snowmelts and mean monthly toc concentrations for the summer period were considerably lower than those in spring also summer periodical increase of toc concentrations in rivers is connected with decrease of oxygen saturation in water sometimes below 45 or lower this situation presents an example from biebrza river in year 2009 fig 7 in the analysed rivers the highest spring toc concentrations occurred with a one or two month delay in relation to the highest monthly discharge fig 8 multiannual changes in toc concentrations in the analysed rivers of the narew river catchment were of variable character at a part of sites a statistically significant increase in mean annual toc concentrations was recorded and confirmed by mann kendall statistical tests supra≈õl p 0 017 pisa p 0 038 fig 9 in the rest analysed stations multiannual toc fluctuations were noted without significant trends 4 2 export of toc in the period 2000 1014 the mean annual export of toc from the narew river catchment n4 amounted to 2 15gcm 2 with values in dry years 30 lower than the multiannual mean and in wet years 50 higher than the mean value the highest annual export of toc of more than 2gcm 2 was also recorded in the upper narew river n1 and in the tributaries biebrza and szkwa catchments with a larger area were characterised by mean annual export of 1 6 1 7gcm 2 tables 2 and 3 and in smaller catchments draining outwash plains annual export of toc was lower by 1 3 table 3 the load of organic carbon transported in rivers of the narew catchment shows evident seasonality over a period of 4 months from february to may rivers transported from 45 to 55 of the annual load from the river and less from the supra≈õl and czarna river catchments namely from 40 to 43 the lowest monthly export of toc at an annual scale occurred in september and october and constituted only 8 12 of the annual load fig 10 5 discussion the presence of organic carbon in running waters is an indicator of the abundance of organic matter in soils in the catchment and the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems aufdenkampe et al 2011 it is subject to considerable regulation by hydroclimatic conditions anthropogenic transformations of catchments usually cause an increase in toc concentrations as a result of supply of untreated sewage sachse et al 2005 therefore one of the criteria for assessment of good ecological state is a low level of mean toc concentrations accompanied with low water colouration the presented data strongly suggest that in the narew river catchment with a relatively low level of anthropopressure toc concentrations were high exceeding acceptable levels for unpolluted rivers and significantly different than the toc concentrations in other central european rivers simultaneously the results were similar to those of rivers of the boreal zone raike et al 2016 and lower than in tropical catchments table 4 the primary cause for the increased but natural toc concentrations in the narew river catchment is the occurrence of wetlands and particularly holocene peatlands subject to a low level of anthropogenic transformations in the analysed rivers no evident autumn increase in toc concentrations was recorded which is typically associated with falling leaves in catchments of the temperate climate zone with mixed and deciduous forests of western europe tockner et al 2009 or eastern united states freeman et al 2001 stets and striegl 2012 causes for this are linked to relatively dry continental autumn periods and winter ice phenomena on rivers in the narew river catchment in comparison to catchments with more oceanic climate g√≥rniak 2017 therefore forest floor does not contribute much as a source of organic matter into waters due to a limited or unencountered overland flow and lack of increased supply of groundwaters by soil waters in that period peat forming processes result in continuous release of water soluble organic compounds to soil solution and then to rivers the continuity and load of organic matter to waters is a result of continuous anaerobic and incomplete decomposition of detritus developing in the productive wetland systems with dominance of fulvic acids and development of geochemically labile complexes with iron and manganese tranvik and von wachenfeldt 2010 the hydrological system of river valleys plays an important role in ensuring the active peat forming process and continuous supply of organic matter to rivers in the narew river catchment the specificity of the system involves stable water persistence in the valleys owing to the active drainage of groundwaters the abundance of groundwater supply to the valleys as well as the snowmelt precipitation hydrological regime of rivers and the extensive flooding of the river valleys ensures the permanence of the peat forming process this ecohydrological system is unique at the european scale following the ecological rivers classification european environment agency http www eea europa eu data and maps figures ecoregions for rivers and lakes a considerable abundance of organic matter in running waters is a feature of rivers typical for the fenno scandian shield sensu illies 1967 as well as the neighbouring baltic province therefore considering the obtained results the narew river should be included in the baltic province due to similar biogeochemical processes occurring in waters with increased toc concentrations if it concerns the more recent environmental classification of europe metzger et al 2005 the studied parameter of running waters is very common to nemoral environmental zone of europe thus the south western boundary of the nemoral ecoregion should run in poland far more to the south from the currently determined boundaries also summer oxygen depletion in humic rivers is similar phenomenon in both zones the presented study identifies the phenomenon of a delay of the spring maximum toc concentration in relation to the maximum fluxes irrespective to river size the near monthly period of data sampling have not impacted the findings because spring high water in rivers persists for a long period of time and it has been observed by the author in many other rivers in this region data not presented previous studies focused on processes in mountain rivers or lowland small catchment rivers alvarez cobelas et al 2012 where short time of water retention in the catchment is related to the short time of organic matter flux activated with surface or soil hypodermic flow in the valleys of narew and biebrza rivers and their tributaries extensive peatland terraces with a considerable width two or more km exist they are flooded usually in spring analyses with the application of satellite techniques show such floods usually last for more than three months fluet chouinard et al 2015 therefore the prolonged water retention and possibility of longer transfer of organic matter from peatland soils to flood waters results in a delayed increase in toc resources in running waters another ecohydrological aspect in the water circulation of organic matter in peatland catchments is the hydrology of peatlands the rate of water infiltration in hydrated lowland peats is inconsiderable in comparison to mineral soils e g fluvisols or cambisols active water exchange in peat soils primarily occurs through macropores holden 2005 and particularly concerns the uppermost peat layer of 20 30cm acrotelm sensu ivanov 1948 after holden 2005 with the most intensive transformation of organic matter particularly in the presence of oxygen this results in an intensified migration of poc and doc from peatlands during spring floods in larger portions of peatland valleys and in the conditions of channel runoff primarily doc is exported from peatlands blodau 2002 also the investigated basin contains large areas with soils with high ratio c to n where higher organic flux is noted aitkenhead and mcdowell 2000 high toc concentrations in the rivers of the narew catchment were accompanied with the increased catchment export of toc with mean annual values ranging from 1 6gcm 2 to 2 3gcm 2 i e being in the upper range of values recorded for european rivers tockner et al 2009 such values are observed in boreal rivers with considerably lower mean annual air temperature higher annual precipitation and more than 2 3 times higher water runoff from the catchment in the studied case the presence of valley peatlands is the primary cause of increased catchment export of toc the system of municipal and industrial waste management functioning at present ensures the elimination of the load of organic matter of anthropogenic origin in more than 90 statistical yearbook of environment 2016 the results show that beginning from the fifth stream order section stream order according to strahler that is below station n2 the catchment load of toc is gradually reduced in the narew river section from the confluence with biebrza river downstream station n2 to the confluence with pisa river station n3 toc decreased by 1 8mtc per year and between stations n3 and n4 by 8 18mtc yr 1 this is the equivalent to a reduction of 18 4 103 tc and 7 1 103 tc per one km of the river length respectively this confirms the phenomenon of active limitation of export of organic carbon from terrestrial ecosystems through the fluvial system cole et al 2007 it is also in accordance with the pulse shunt concept pointing out the important role of stream order in the reduction of the river load of organic carbon raymond et al 2016 the recorded decrease in toc transport in the lower section of the analysed fluvial system also suggests a low level of transformation of the environmental conditions of the narew river valley permitting natural elimination of a part of the catchment load of toc due to the existence of spring and more seldom summer flooding of the peatland floor of the valleys the load of organic matter transported in rivers particularly originates from peatlands located near rivers the toc load supplied from sandy loamy plateaus to the river bottom is considerably lower than the total load of organic carbon exported from the catchment similar situations do not occur in the mountain and upland landscape due to a different system of water supply to the river channel and valley the specificity of the valleys of the narew biebrza and supra≈õl rivers also involves constant groundwater supply to the valleys through abundant aquifers with a regional range originating from deep and large area circulation nowicki and sadurski 2010 these groundwater bodies as understood by water framework directive in lowland part of poland play a significant role in water management these provide for permanent water persistence in valley peatlands and export of organic carbon also from the deep organic matter resources in addition to the toc load from the surface peat layer the overlapping hydrological effect and presence of the large area of valley peatlands in the analysed catchment becomes the primary cause of naturally increased abundance of toc in rivers and catchment export therefore hydrochemical parameters of low order tributaries are radically missed because water quality modification by wetlands biogeochemistry is considerable increased transport of waters within valley floors surface and underground flow provides a similar effect of an increase in catchment export of toc as recorded in the catchments of boreal rivers in ireland and great britain where large water runoff is a result of local climatic conditions the hydrochemical consequence of the existing ecohydrological system is also the fact of occurrence of increased concentrations of organic forms of nitrogen and phosphorus but not resulting from extensive agricultural production or supply of untreated sewage it is understandable because the molecules of humic substances constituting the primary component of toc also contain nitrogen and phosphorus and have the ability of complexing on their surface considerable amounts of organic and ionic forms of n and p tranvik and von wachenfeldt 2010 therefore an inherent element of increased catchment export of toc is also increased loads of substances commonly considered as indicators of anthropogenic eutrophication of waters according to unpublished data g√≥rniak unpubl in the analysed rivers the presence of 1mg of organic carbon corresponds with the occurrence of 0 3mg norg and 7 11Œºg tp in one litre of water this results only from the occurrence of natural organic matter transported in river waters in the conditions of toc concentrations of more than 10mgcdm 3 and neutral reaction the recorded concentrations of organic forms of n and p automatically reduce the class of water cleanliness in spite of the lack of substantial anthropogenic sources therefore in rivers where natural enrichment in organic matter occurs considerably higher levels of concentrations of organic nitrogen and tp should be adopted for classes of the chemical state in comparison to those adopted currently to sum up in rivers with extensive peatland valleys the hydrological factor plays an important role in the development of the abundance of toc in surface waters the forecasted hydrological effects in the rivers of central europe resulting from global climate changes will also cover transformations of the water cycle and organic carbon circulation in water ecosystems pagano et al 2014 lower winter precipitation in the form of snow reducing the amount and range of spring flooding of valleys will be a factor reducing the resources and catchment export of toc similarly as effects of long term droughts zieli≈Ñski et al 2009 summer periodical heavy rainfalls can only locally contribute to an increase in the activation of catchment toc load which due to natural processes will be limited in the valleys of rivers of 6 7 order the forecasted climate changes in the described types of rivers will limit the abundance and load of toc exported from the catchment as a consequence this may change the functional correlations in the structure of hydrobionts including the ichthyofauna community conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards
