shipbuilding simulation are one of the most difficult issues in dynamic analysis the existing collision programs are not appropriate to be applied in this domain because the model has unclosed meshes and very sharp edges therefore this study proposed a position difference method to detect collision between unclosed meshes this method calculates the intersection between the previous and current positions of the two meshes moreover because the shape of the colliding body in the shipbuilding industry has too many meshes it takes too much time to detect collision between two bodies to increase performance this study adopted a boundary volume hierarchy which is a kind of space partitioning algorithm and exclusion boxes which exclude meshes inside boxes for the collision response this study derived a force based method based on the non interpenetration constraint to calculate the collision normal and tangential forces this method can be applied to the multibody system and to consider material properties such as restitution coefficient and softness as a result it is successfully applied to the dynamic analysis of lpg tank erection by using a floating crane the collision force between the tank and the hull structure is calculated due to the motion of the floating crane induced by environmental loads graphical abstract image 1 keywords collision multibody system block lifting position difference method non interpenetration constraint 1 introduction as shown in fig 1 there are several examples that require dynamic analysis including collision in the production and installation of ships and offshore structures those examples show that bodies such as the lpg liquefied petroleum gas tank the module offshore structures and subsea equipment is lifted by the crane in common during the erecting or lifting operation the collision might happen between the lifting body and the sub structure due to the motion of the body induced by the environmental loads such as winds currents and waves therefore the dynamic analysis including the collision detection and response should be performed in advance to decide whether the operation is sufficiently safe or not more specifically the engineer in shipbuilding and offshore installation usually wants to calculate two results from the dynamic analysis one result is collision positions due to the dynamic motion of the lifting body the other result is collision forces acting at the collision positions the collision forces can be used for the input values for structural analysis or structural reinforcement however the existing studies had the following limitations ham et al 2015 calculated the motion of the heavy load suspended by the floating crane similarly ming et al 2017 analyzed the motion of the offshore wind turbine during the installation the studies mentioned above did not consider the collision in their dynamic analyses meanwhile lee et al 2016 only calculated collision between the body and the wire rope during the turn over operation jeong et al 2016 considered collision detection and response of the subsea equipment on the deck of the offshore support vessel however they could not calculate collision force because it simply used the impulse based method which changes velocity after direct collision in conclusion collision detection and response algorithms suitable for shipbuilding and offshore installation are required existing dynamic analysis libraries including collision detection and response such as physx bullet and ode coumans 2012 nvidia 2012 smith 2012 were tested with complex mesh models we found that those libraries were not suitable to calculate collision positions and forces the objectives of this study are to develop collision detection and response algorithms suitable for shipbuilding and offshore industries several strategies such as the position difference method space partitioning and exclusion boxes are adapted to increase the performance during collision detection collision response algorithm using non interpenetration constraint method is derived theoretical backgrounds of the collision detection and response proposed in this study will be explained in the following sections 2 collision detection collision detection algorithms were widely studied in computer graphics and dynamic analysis jiménez et al 2001 grouped the collision detection algorithms into four approaches space time volume intersection cameron 1990 swept volume interference foisy and hayward 1995 multiple interference detection gilbert and foo 1990 and trajectory parameterization canny 1986 while some approaches are related to a particular collision situation multiple interference detection has been the most widely used multiple interference detection sampled object trajectories and repeatedly applied a static interference test this study analyzed the previous studies carefully and adopted the concept of the collision detection algorithm collision detection is to find the mesh pair and the penetration depth when two bodies collide collision detection is generally composed of two stages as shown in fig 2 one is a broad phase stage which checks collisions between two bounding boxes the other is a narrow phase stage which checks collisions between the meshes there are mainly two specialized problems in the shipbuilding and offshore industries during the collision detection the first problem is that the shape is not a polyhedron but contains unenclosed meshes fig 3 shows the example of meshes which are not enclosed in this case the well known collision detection algorithms ehmann and lin 2001 gilbert et al 1988 mirtich 1997 which are suitable to convex and concave shapes cannot be applied secondly there are too many meshes in one body shape which is exported from the ship cad computer aided design system fig 4 shows a lpg tank model in which the number of vertices is 57 696 and the number of triangular meshes is 19 232 therefore it takes a lot of time to detect the collision to solve the first problem we propose the position difference method which checks an intersection using the line segment made by the two vertices or the trigonal prism consisting of the two triangular meshes at time t and t 1 to solve the second problem we must reduce the number of meshes therefore space partitioning and exclusion boxes are adopted in the following sub sections the methods to solve those problems will be explained 2 1 position difference method the position difference method pdm uses the positions of the meshes at time t and t 1 therefore it is only available in dynamic analysis this method is very similar to continuous collision detection which is derived from polyhedra redon et al 2002 van den bergen 1999 this method is divided into two states such as vertex mesh collision and edge edge collision pdm for vertex mesh collision is further divided into three cases according to the colliding position and the existence of movement the first case is that a colliding vertex on the moving body body2 moves into the fixed body body1 as shown in fig 5 at time t 0 body1 and body2 do not collide however the vertex p passes through the mesh on the top of body1 at time t 1 the first step is to find p 0 and p 1 which are the positions of the vertex p at times t 0 and t 1 respectively the next step is to draw a line segment p 0 p 1 the last step is to check whether or not p 0 p 1 intersects with one of the meshes the penetration depth is the minimum distance from p 1 to the mesh the sequence is summarized in the pseudocode below image 2 however this algorithm has a problem even though we apply the first algorithm collision at the corner cannot be detected as shown in fig 6 therefore the second case of pdm for the vertex mesh collision is that a colliding vertex on the fixed body body1 moves into the moving body body2 as shown in fig 7 at time t 0 the vertex p of body1 is located outside body2 however the vertex p is located inside body2 at time t 1 the first step is to find mesh 0 and mesh 1 at times t 0 and t 1 the next step is to make a trigonal prism connecting vertices at time t 0 and t 1 the last step is to check that p is located inside the trigonal prism it is done by five plane equations the penetration depth is the minimum distance from p to mesh 1 the sequence is summarized in the pseudo code below image 3 even though both the first and second algorithms are applied there is still a problem when both bodies are moving as shown in fig 8 it is because both the vertex and the mesh are moved and the line segment p 0 p 1 unfortunately gets out of mesh 1 at time t 1 as shown in fig 9 therefore we modify the first and second algorithm a little bit to solve this problem we call this the third case of pdm for vertex mesh collision basically the first algorithm uses p 0 at time t 0 and p 1 mesh 1 at time t 1 in the third algorithm mesh 0 is used for collision detection instead of mesh 1 see fig 10 1 besides the second algorithm uses mesh 0 at time t 0 and p 1 mesh 1 at time t 1 in the third algorithm p 0 is used instead of p 1 see fig 10 2 pdm for edge edge collision is further divided into two cases like pdm for vertex mesh collision the first case is that a colliding edge on the moving body body2 moves into the fixed body body1 as shown in fig 11 at time t 0 body1 and body2 do not collide however the edge e 0 passes through the edge of body1 at time t 1 the first step is to find e 0 and e 1 which are the edges at times t 0 and t 1 the next step is to draw a rectangle using e 0 and e 1 the last step is to check whether or not the rectangle intersects with one of the edges of body1 the penetration depth is the minimum distance from e 1 to the intersected edge the sequence is summarized in the pseudocode below image 4 if both bodies are moving the edge edge collision algorithm has the same problem compared to the vertex mesh collision algorithm as shown in fig 8 instead of the edge of body1 at time t 1 e 1 body1 the edge of body1 at time t 0 e 0 body1 is used to solve this problem see fig 12 1 as an alternative the edge of body2 at time t 0 e 0 body2 is used instead of the edge of body2 at time t 1 e 1 body2 see fig 12 2 2 2 space partitioning pdm requires a lot of computational costs if the shape contains many meshes space partitioning is the process of dividing a space into two or more non overlapping regions there are many kinds of space partitioning techniques in this study boundary volume hierarchy bvh is adopted bauszat et al 2010 klosowski et al 1998 larsson and akenine möller 2006 weller 2013 bvh is a tree structure on a set of geometric shapes all geometric shapes are wrapped in bounding volumes that form the leaf nodes of a tree the procedure to build bvh is depicted in fig 13 the first step is to organize the centroids of meshes in the ascending order the next step is to split the centroids into left and right sides these two steps are repeated for the different axis until the bound volume is a leaf bvh can dramatically reduce the computational costs of the collision detection bounding boxes of bvh are used instead of calculating collision detection between the meshes of the two bodies fig 14 shows a method demonstrating how to use bvh during the collision detection at first top level bounding volume bv0 is used to detect the collision if the detection is noticed the next level of bound volume bv11 bv12 is used to check the detection this procedure is repeated until the leaf bounding volume is found finally the meshes inside the leaf nodes are used to calculate collision detection 2 3 exclusion box even though space partitioning reduces a lot of computational costs it still takes a long time to detect the collision if there are too many meshes if we take a close look there are also many meshes which are not involved in the collision from the beginning however it is not easy to erase unnecessary meshes before the simulation using third party programs sometimes meshes which belong to a different part of the body want to be excluded according to the simulation conditions therefore we developed exclusion boxes to exclude meshes inside boxes dynamically in the program fig 15 shows several examples of exclusion boxes applied to the lpg tank 3 collision response collision response is to find the forces acting at the collision position or velocities of bodies directly after the collision the classification of the collision response and the method we choose in this study will be explained in the following sub sections 3 1 classification of collision response there are basically two methods to describe the collision response schmucker et al 2007 one is an impulse based method which directly modifies the velocity as a result of impulse this method is very simple however it is not applicable when two bodies collide at multiple points it also makes the system unstable because the direct change of the velocity after solving the equations of motion violates kinematic constraints in other words it is not applicable to a multibody system the other is a force based method which is further divided into two methods such as a spring damper method and a non interpenetration constraint method the spring damper method exerts the collision force modeled by a spring damper at the collision position unlike the impulse based method the spring damper method is applicable when two bodies collide at the multiple points and it does not compulsively violate the kinematic constraint because the collision force is also solved together when the equations of motion are solved numerically however it is not easy to select the proper parameters such as the exponent of the penetration depth n spring and damping coefficient k d which vary according to material properties the weight the number of contact points and so on the non interpenetration constraint method exerts a collision force modeled by the constraint this method has the same advantages as the spring damper method moreover the collision force can be determined automatically reflecting material properties such as restitution and softness therefore we choose the non interpenetration constraint method for the collision response classification of the collision response is summarized in fig 16 3 2 non interpenetration constraint method there are three statuses such as no collision exact contact and interpenetration between two bodies as shown in fig 17 φ1 and φ2 are the shape functions of the body surfaces which are continuously differentiable non interpenetration constraint equation can be expressed mathematically as follows anitescu and potra 2002 stewart 2000 1 g c o l l i s i o n φ 1 φ 2 0 if two bodies violate the non interpenetration constraint the collision normal force is acting on the bodies the collision force can be expressed by the constraint jacobian g collision which is the direction and the lagrange multiplier λ which is the magnitude 2 f c o l l i s i o n g c o l l i s i o n t λ g c o l l i s i o n t g c o l l i s i o n q t however it is not easy to represent the body surface as continuously differentiable functions therefore we derive a simple non interpenetration constraint equation between a vertex and a plane as shown in fig 18 e r p c means that the vector direction is from point c to p and the reference frame is the inertial frame e xyz the starting point can be omitted if the origin of the reference frame and the starting point are the same e r a e r b since two bodies are separated the line segment p q should be larger than or equal to zero this constraint and constraint jacobian can be expressed as follows 3 g c o l l i s i o n p q 0 p q n e r p c e n e r p e r c e n e r a e r p a e r b e r c b e 4 g c o l l i s i o n t n e r p a e n e n e r p e r b e n e using eq 4 the collision force is calculated as follows 5 f c o l l i s i o n g c o l l i s i o n t λ n e r p a e n e n e r p e r b e n e λ n e λ r p a e n e λ n e λ r p e r b e n e λ meanwhile there are not only the normal force but also the frictional force at the collision position the magnitude of the frictional force f friction is simply proportional to the normal force f normal and the direction is the opposite of the projected relative velocity e v rel on the plane as shown in fig 19 therefore the frictional force is calculated as follows 6 f f r i c t i o n μ v r e l e v r e l e λ μ t e λ where e t is the unit vector which is obtained by projection of the relative velocity at the collision position on the plane and μ is a frictional coefficient finally we obtain the collision force including both the normal and frictional forces by replacing the normal vector e n with e n μ e t in eq 4 7 f c o l l i s i o n g c o l l i s i o n t λ n e μ t e r p a e n e μ t e n e μ t e r p e r b e n e μ t e λ so far we explained the non interpenetration constraint equation between a vertex and a plane this equation can also be extended to the collision response between two bodies by using the collision pair which is obtained from the collision detection there are two types of collision pairs one is the mesh and the vertex which are obtained from vertex mesh collision detection algorithm as shown in fig 20 the mesh becomes the plane and p becomes the vertex the other type of collision pair is two edges from edge edge collision detection algorithm as shown in fig 21 the closest point p from e 1 body1 becomes the vertex the other closest point q becomes the point on the plane and the normalized vector from p to q becomes the normal vector of the plane 4 dynamic analysis including collision detection and response this section explains how to conduct the dynamic analysis including collision detection and response algorithms proposed in the previous sections 4 1 discrete euler lagrange equation the equations of motion classically mean the newton euler equation which is simply expressed as f m x if there are constraints between the bodies it is not easy to find collision forces in this case the formulation of multibody dynamics is used among several multibody dynamic formulations we adopt the discrete euler lagrange equation dele suggested by lacoursiere 2007 and servin et al 2007 the final form of dele is as follows 8 m g k t g k γ 4 ε h 2 v k 1 λ k 1 m v k h v q k h f q k v k 4 γ h g k γ g k v k where h is the time step m is the mass matrix v is the generalized velocity q is the generalized coordinate v is the potential energy g k is the constraint equations g k is the constraint jacobian λ is lagrange multiplier ε is the regularization terms and γ is the stabilization terms the derivation of dele and the meanings of parameters and variables in eq 8 are well described in ham et al 2015 meanwhile the floating crane is forced by the waves which are called hydrodynamic forces to consider the hydrodynamic forces in the time domain we adopted cummins equation cummins 1962 the hydrodynamic forces are composed of radiation and exciting forces as follows 9 f r a d i a t i o n a v t 0 b σ v t σ d σ 10 f e x c i t i n g f ω cos ω t ε where a is added mass at infinite frequency b σ is retardation function and f ε is force rao response amplitude operator at frequency domain substituting these two terms in f q k v k of eq 8 we can obtain the following equations 11 m g k t g k γ 4 ε h 2 v k 1 λ k 1 m v k h v q k h f r a d i a t i o n f e x c i t i n g f o t h e r s 4 γ h g k γ g k v k 12 m g k t g k γ 4 ε h 2 v k 1 λ k 1 m v k h v q k h a v k 1 h a v k h 0 b σ v t σ d τ f e x c i t i n g f o t h e r s 4 γ h g

for dynamic analysis including collision detection and response at first we solve the equations of motion expressed by dele then we obtain a position attitude velocity and acceleration of the bodies by the time integration these results are used to calculate external forces for the next time at the same time the collision detection which is composed of two stages broad phase and narrow phase is conducted then the collision response is executed using the collision pair data the results from the collision response are used to formulate the constraint equation g k and jacobian g k in the equations of motion this procedure is repeated until the dynamic analysis is finished 4 3 consideration of material properties in section 3 1 we insist that one of the advantages using a non interpenetration constraint method is to consider material properties such as restitution and softness this advantage is closely related to dele eq 8 which is adopted for our equations of motion the second row of dele is rewritten as follows 14 g k v k 1 γ 4 ε h 2 λ k 1 4 γ h g k γ g k v k if the right side of eq 14 is transposed to the left side we obtain the following equation 15 g k v k 1 γ g k v k γ 4 ε h 2 λ k 1 4 γ h g k 0 16 g k v k 1 γ v k 4 γ h ε λ k 1 h g k 0 eq 16 is an identical equation therefore the first and the second terms inside the bracket should be zero 17 v k 1 γ v k 0 18 ε λ k 1 h g k 0 the stabilization term γ in eq 17 is the ratio between the velocity before and after the collision which is known as the restitution coefficient if the regularization term ε in eq 18 is zero the constraint is strictly satisfied in other words ε allows the violation of the constraint and decide the softness of the material when two bodies collide the collision force is automatically obtained from dele with respect to γ and ε in spring damper methods the response motion after the collision is determined by the spring force therefore it is not easy to be satisfied with the material properties such as softness and restitution actually the softness which means the penetration and the restitution which means the ratio of the velocities before and after collision should be considered at the same time if we use the spring damper method furthermore the spring coefficient should be changed according to the properties of the body such as mass inertia velocity and so on these are the limitation of the spring damper method on the other hand non interpenetration constraint method can control the restitution and softness separately by using the stabilization and regularization terms respectively in addition even though the body properties are changed we don t need to change any values to control the collision response therefore we can conclude that the proposed method is much easier to apply material properties than selecting spring damper coefficients 5 case studies this section presents several case studies of the dynamic analysis including collision detection and response 5 1 collision for multibody system it was explained in section 3 1 that the impulse based method which directly changes the velocity was not applicable to the multibody system which has a kinematic constraint in contrast to the impulse based method the force based method is applicable to the multibody system for the test two bodies link a link b are connected by ball joints and the small box hits link b as shown in fig 23 when the box hits link b the kinematic constraint between link a and link b is violated because the velocity of link b is compulsively changed see fig 24 1 therefore the enormous constraint force is exerted to fix the kinematic constraint and the system diverges see fig 24 2 meanwhile in case of using the force based method it is successfully simulated without divergence of the system as shown in fig 25 5 2 performance tests of collision detection the first test is to check the collision between two bunny models as shown in fig 26 the bunny model contains 292 meshes and 148 vertices the computing time is compared with and without applying bvh the results are summarized in table 1 we set the leaf node of bvh which has less than eight meshes as a result the computing time for the one time step decreased about 95 total computing time is also decreased about 77 total computing time and one time step are not the same because total computing time includes the time when the collision between two bunnies does not occur furthermore total cost benchmarking test for collision detection proposed by bergen 2003 and suaib et al 2013 is performed total cost benchmarking test function is as follows 19 t n u c u n v c v n p c p c o where t total cost function for interference detection n v number of bounding volume pair overlap tests c v cost of testing a pair of bounding volumes for overlap n p is the number primitive pairs tested for interference c p cost of testing a pair of primitives for interference n u number of bounding volumes updated c u cost of average bounding volume update c o indicates cost for one time processing in this case the construction cost in this case the collision detection between primitive pairs is not considered the total cost for collision detection is summarized in table 2 it shows that total cost of collision detection without bvh is much larger than total cost with bvh the second test is to drop two bunny models on the plane in this case the meshes of right bunny model staying out of the collision is excluded using the exclusion box the right bunny model contains 172 meshes and 87 vertices as shown in fig 27 we compared the computing time with and without applying the exclusion box the results are summarized in table 3 the result shows that the computing time for a one time step is also reduced about 57 as the number of meshes is reduced to about 60 total computing time is also decreased by 33 the total cost benchmarking is also performed to the second test and is summarized in table 4 the third test is to drop the lpg tank model on the plane to check the performance using both the exclusion box and the bvh at the same time as shown in fig 28 the original lpg tank model contains 19 232 meshes and 57 696 vertices the results including computing time and total cost are summarized in table 5 when applying only bvh the computing time is reduced by 62 as the number of meshes is reduced the computing time is also reduced from 75 to 98 in conclusion both bvh and the exclusion box are effective to increase the performance of the collision detection 5 3 collision between complex shapes the model exported from the ship cad system has very complex shapes as shown in fig 29 and fig 30 both lpg tank and hull structure models have many unenclosed meshes furthermore stiffeners attached to the side shell is very sharp we simply drop the lpg tank inside the hull structure two simulations are conducted in the case that the tank was not tilted and the case that it was tilted for 20 as shown in fig 31 in spite of the unenclosed meshes and very sharp edges the collision detection and response between two models are successfully performed 5 4 collision according to material properties it was explained in section 4 3 that dele using non interpenetration constraint could consider material properties such as the restitution coefficient and softness at first the box drops on the plane according to different restitution coefficients as shown in fig 32 we choose the restitution coefficient as 0 0 perfectly inelasticity 0 5 and 1 0 perfectly elasticity the results are depicted as graphs in fig 33 when the restitution coefficient is zero the velocity is directly changed to zero right after the collision when the restitution coefficient is 0 5 the velocity is reduced to half after the collision when the restitution coefficient is one the velocity before and after the collision is almost the same 6 lpg tank erection this section presents the dynamic analysis of the lpg tank erection inside the hull structure by the floating crane fig 34 shows the modeling result all of the bodies are connected from the barge of the floating crane to the lpg tank by joints and wire ropes therefore the motion of the floating crane affects the motion of the lpg tank and vice versa the floating crane has four block loaders which are composed of four hooks and equalizers each block loader is connected to the lpg tank with five wire ropes there are ten bodies four hooks four equalizers one lpg tank one floating crane and 32 wire ropes including eight mooring lines in total the equations of motion of these models are automatically composed using eq 8 the main particulars are summarized in table 6 ku et al 2013 the left right sides and the bottom of lpg tank and the hull structure participate in the collision therefore unnecessary meshes are ignored by using the exclusion boxes as shown in fig 35 the number of meshes of lpg tank and the hull structure is reduced to 1 352 and 2 916 respectively inside the hull structure there is about 2 m of free space the collision detection and response between the lpg tank and the hull structure are applied according to various wave conditions the wave conditions are summarized in table 7 the heading angle is fixed to 90ο which is marked in fig 34 the wave periods are selected based on the floating crane rao as shown in fig 36 from cases 1 to 4 we will check the occurrence of the collision according to wave periods from cases 3 5 and 6 we will check the occurrence of the collision according to wave heights the maximum motion of the floating crane is expected around 8 or 10 s however as we can check the sway motion of the lpg tank before entering the hull structure shown in fig 37 the sway motion of case 4 only exceeds the free space which is about 2 m it is because the mooring lines prevent the motion of the floating crane and the excitation with a longer period has more influence on the motion of the suspended lpg tank therefore there is no collision between the lpg tank and the hull structure when the wave period is less than 10 s as shown in fig 38 when the wave period is more than 12 s case 4 the collision occurs as shown in fig 39 meanwhile when the wave height is changed from 1 0 m to more than 1 5 m cases 5 and 6 the collision also occurs from these results we can find safe environmental conditions which are that the wave period is less than 10 s and the wave height is less than 1 0 m fig 40 shows the graphs of the maximum collision force which is the maximum value among collision forces acting at several collision positions there is no collision force in cases 1 2 and 3 the collision forces in cases 4 5 and 6 are measured as 38 648 kn 41 167 kn and 66 930 kn respectively these results can be used as one of the parameters to design guide bumpers between the lpg tank and the hull structure 7 conclusions and future works this study dealt with special issues in collision detection and response because the shape exported from the ship cad system contains unenclosed meshes we proposed the position difference method which checks an intersection using the line segment made by the two vertices or the trigonal prism consisting of the two triangular meshes at time t 0 and t 1 furthermore bvh and exclusion boxes were adopted to increase the performance for collision response non interpenetration constraint method between a vertex and a plane was derived this method is applicable when two bodies collide at the multiple points and it does not compulsively violate the kinematic constraint because the collision force is also solved together when the equations of motion are solved numerically moreover the collision force can be determined automatically reflecting material properties such as restitution and softness however it is not easy to represent the body surfaces as continuously differentiable functions therefore we derive a simple non interpenetration constraint equation between a vertex and a plane this equation can also be extended to the collision response between two bodies by using the collision pair which is obtained from the collision detection for verification several case studies were conducted using the proposed collision detection and response algorithms the collision between the multibody system and a box was successfully performed without divergence of the system the computing time was dramatically reduced to more than 70 95 using bvh and exclusion boxes even though the shape contained unenclosed meshes and very sharp edges the collision detection and response between two models are successfully performed finally the collision detection and response between the lpg tank and the hull structure are applied according to various wave conditions as the wave period was increased from 6 to 12 s and the wave height was also changed from 1 0 m to 2 0 m we checked whether or not the collision was detected we could find safe environmental conditions which were that the wave period is less than 10 s and the wave height was less than 1 0 m among the simulation cases we obtained the maximum collision forces 6 822 ton when the wave period was 12 s and the wave height is 2 0 m in the future the developed code will be optimized to increase the performance in addition we have a plan to analyze the effects according to the type of materials and to validate the results by experiments because it is not easy to erase the unnecessary meshes which are never participated in the collision detection the computational cost optimization will be performed by implementing bvh acknowledgements this work was partially supported by a competency

and research institute of marine systems engineering seoul national university 1 gwanak ro gwanak gu seoul 08826 republic of korea collision detection and response between the block model in shipbuilding simulation are one of the most difficult issues in dynamic analysis the existing collision programs are not appropriate to be applied in this domain because the model has unclosed meshes and very sharp edges therefore this study proposed a position difference method to detect collision between unclosed meshes this method calculates the intersection between the previous and current positions of the two meshes moreover because the shape of the colliding body in the shipbuilding industry has too many meshes it takes too much time to detect collision between two bodies to increase performance this study adopted a boundary volume hierarchy which is a kind of space partitioning algorithm and exclusion boxes which exclude meshes inside boxes for the collision response this study derived a force based method based on the non interpenetration constraint to calculate the collision normal and tangential forces this method can be applied to the multibody system and to consider material properties such as restitution coefficient and softness as a result it is successfully applied to the dynamic analysis of lpg tank erection by using a floating crane the collision force between the tank and the hull structure is calculated due to the motion of the floating crane induced by environmental loads graphical abstract image 1 keywords collision multibody system block lifting position difference method non interpenetration constraint 1 introduction as shown in fig 1 there are several examples that require dynamic analysis including collision in the production and installation of ships and offshore structures those examples show that bodies such as the lpg liquefied petroleum gas tank the module offshore structures and subsea equipment is lifted by the crane in common during the erecting or lifting operation the collision might happen between the lifting body and the sub structure due to the motion of the body induced by the environmental loads such as winds currents and waves therefore the dynamic analysis including the collision detection and response should be performed in advance to decide whether the operation is sufficiently safe or not more specifically the engineer in shipbuilding and offshore installation usually wants to calculate two results from the dynamic analysis one result is collision positions due to the dynamic motion of the lifting body the other result is collision forces acting at the collision positions the collision forces can be used for the input values for structural analysis or structural reinforcement however the existing studies had the following limitations ham et al 2015 calculated the motion of the heavy load suspended by the floating crane similarly ming et al 2017 analyzed the motion of the offshore wind turbine during the installation the studies mentioned above did not consider the collision in their dynamic analyses meanwhile lee et al 2016 only calculated collision between the body and the wire rope during the turn over operation jeong et al 2016 considered collision detection and response of the subsea equipment on the deck of the offshore support vessel however they could not calculate collision force because it simply used the impulse based method which changes velocity after direct collision in conclusion collision detection and response algorithms suitable for shipbuilding and offshore installation are required existing dynamic analysis libraries including collision detection and response such as physx bullet and ode coumans 2012 nvidia 2012 smith 2012 were tested with complex mesh models we found that those libraries were not suitable to calculate collision positions and forces the objectives of this study are to develop collision detection and response algorithms suitable for shipbuilding and offshore industries several strategies such as the position difference method space partitioning and exclusion boxes are adapted to increase the performance during collision detection collision response algorithm using non interpenetration constraint method is derived theoretical backgrounds of the collision detection and response proposed in this study will be explained in the following sections 2 collision detection collision detection algorithms were widely studied in computer graphics and dynamic analysis jiménez et al 2001 grouped the collision detection algorithms into four approaches space time volume intersection cameron 1990 swept volume interference foisy and hayward 1995 multiple interference detection gilbert and foo 1990 and trajectory parameterization canny 1986 while some approaches are related to a particular collision situation multiple interference detection has been the most widely used multiple interference detection sampled object trajectories and repeatedly applied a static interference test this study analyzed the previous studies carefully and adopted the concept of the collision detection algorithm collision detection is to find the mesh pair and the penetration depth when two bodies collide collision detection is generally composed of two stages as shown in fig 2 one is a broad phase stage which checks collisions between two bounding boxes the other is a narrow phase stage which checks collisions between the meshes there are mainly two specialized problems in the shipbuilding and offshore industries during the collision detection the first problem is that the shape is not a polyhedron but contains unenclosed meshes fig 3 shows the example of meshes which are not enclosed in this case the well known collision detection algorithms ehmann and lin 2001 gilbert et al 1988 mirtich 1997 which are suitable to convex and concave shapes cannot be applied secondly there are too many meshes in one body shape which is exported from the ship cad computer aided design system fig 4 shows a lpg tank model in which the number of vertices is 57 696 and the number of triangular meshes is 19 232 therefore it takes a lot of time to detect the collision to solve the first problem we propose the position difference method which checks an intersection using the line segment made by the two vertices or the trigonal prism consisting of the two triangular meshes at time t and t 1 to solve the second problem we must reduce the number of meshes therefore space partitioning and exclusion boxes are adopted in the following sub sections the methods to solve those problems will be explained 2 1 position difference method the position difference method pdm uses the positions of the meshes at time t and t 1 therefore it is only available in dynamic analysis this method is very similar to continuous collision detection which is derived from polyhedra redon et al 2002 van den bergen 1999 this method is divided into two states such as vertex mesh collision and edge edge collision pdm for vertex mesh collision is further divided into three cases according to the colliding position and the existence of movement the first case is that a colliding vertex on the moving body body2 moves into the fixed body body1 as shown in fig 5 at time t 0 body1 and body2 do not collide however the vertex p passes through the mesh on the top of body1 at time t 1 the first step is to find p 0 and p 1 which are the positions of the vertex p at times t 0 and t 1 respectively the next step is to draw a line segment p 0 p 1 the last step is to check whether or not p 0 p 1 intersects with one of the meshes the penetration depth is the minimum distance from p 1 to the mesh the sequence is summarized in the pseudocode below image 2 however this algorithm has a problem even though we apply the first algorithm collision at the corner cannot be detected as shown in fig 6 therefore the second case of pdm for the vertex mesh collision is that a colliding vertex on the fixed body body1 moves into the moving body body2 as shown in fig 7 at time t 0 the vertex p of body1 is located outside body2 however the vertex p is located inside body2 at time t 1 the first step is to find mesh 0 and mesh 1 at times t 0 and t 1 the next step is to make a trigonal prism connecting vertices at time t 0 and t 1 the last step is to check that p is located inside the trigonal prism it is done by five plane equations the penetration depth is the minimum distance from p to mesh 1 the sequence is summarized in the pseudo code below image 3 even though both the first and second algorithms are applied there is still a problem when both bodies are moving as shown in fig 8 it is because both the vertex and the mesh are moved and the line segment p 0 p 1 unfortunately gets out of mesh 1 at time t 1 as shown in fig 9 therefore we modify the first and second algorithm a little bit to solve this problem we call this the third case of pdm for vertex mesh collision basically the first algorithm uses p 0 at time t 0 and p 1 mesh 1 at time t 1 in the third algorithm mesh 0 is used for collision detection instead of mesh 1 see fig 10 1 besides the second algorithm uses mesh 0 at time t 0 and p 1 mesh 1 at time t 1 in the third algorithm p 0 is used instead of p 1 see fig 10 2 pdm for edge edge collision is further divided into two cases like pdm for vertex mesh collision the first case is that a colliding edge on the moving body body2 moves into the fixed body body1 as shown in fig 11 at time t 0 body1 and body2 do not collide however the edge e 0 passes through the edge of body1 at time t 1 the first step is to find e 0 and e 1 which are the edges at times t 0 and t 1 the next step is to draw a rectangle using e 0 and e 1 the last step is to check whether or not the rectangle intersects with one of the edges of body1 the penetration depth is the minimum distance from e 1 to the intersected edge the sequence is summarized in the pseudocode below image 4 if both bodies are moving the edge edge collision algorithm has the same problem compared to the vertex mesh collision algorithm as shown in fig 8 instead of the edge of body1 at time t 1 e 1 body1 the edge of body1 at time t 0 e 0 body1 is used to solve this problem see fig 12 1 as an alternative the edge of body2 at time t 0 e 0 body2 is used instead of the edge of body2 at time t 1 e 1 body2 see fig 12 2 2 2 space partitioning pdm requires a lot of computational costs if the shape contains many meshes space partitioning is the process of dividing a space into two or more non overlapping regions there are many kinds of space partitioning techniques in this study boundary volume hierarchy bvh is adopted bauszat et al 2010 klosowski et al 1998 larsson and akenine möller 2006 weller 2013 bvh is a tree structure on a set of geometric shapes all geometric shapes are wrapped in bounding volumes that form the leaf nodes of a tree the procedure to build bvh is depicted in fig 13 the first step is to organize the centroids of meshes in the ascending order the next step is to split the centroids into left and right sides these two steps are repeated for the different axis until the bound volume is a leaf bvh can dramatically reduce the computational costs of the collision detection bounding boxes of bvh are used instead of calculating collision detection between the meshes of the two bodies fig 14 shows a method demonstrating how to use bvh during the collision detection at first top level bounding volume bv0 is used to detect the collision if the detection is noticed the next level of bound volume bv11 bv12 is used to check the detection this procedure is repeated until the leaf bounding volume is found finally the meshes inside the leaf nodes are used to calculate collision detection 2 3 exclusion box even though space partitioning reduces a lot of computational costs it still takes a long time to detect the collision if there are too many meshes if we take a close look there are also many meshes which are not involved in the collision from the beginning however it is not easy to erase unnecessary meshes before the simulation using third party programs sometimes meshes which belong to a different part of the body want to be excluded according to the simulation conditions therefore we developed exclusion boxes to exclude meshes inside boxes dynamically in the program fig 15 shows several examples of exclusion boxes applied to the lpg tank 3 collision response collision response is to find the forces acting at the collision position or velocities of bodies directly after the collision the classification of the collision response and the method we choose in this study will be explained in the following sub sections 3 1 classification of collision response there are basically two methods to describe the collision response schmucker et al 2007 one is an impulse based method which directly modifies the velocity as a result of impulse this method is very simple however it is not applicable when two bodies collide at multiple points it also makes the system unstable because the direct change of the velocity after solving the equations of motion violates kinematic constraints in other words it is not applicable to a multibody system the other is a force based method which is further divided into two methods such as a spring damper method and a non interpenetration constraint method the spring damper method exerts the collision force modeled by a spring damper at the collision position unlike the impulse based method the spring damper method is applicable when two bodies collide at the multiple points and it does not compulsively violate the kinematic constraint because the collision force is also solved together when the equations of motion are solved numerically however it is not easy to select the proper parameters such as the exponent of the penetration depth n spring and damping coefficient k d which vary according to material properties the weight the number of contact points and so on the non interpenetration constraint method exerts a collision force modeled by the constraint this method has the same advantages as the spring damper method moreover the collision force can be determined automatically reflecting material properties such as restitution and softness therefore we choose the non interpenetration constraint method for the collision response classification of the collision response is summarized in fig 16 3 2 non interpenetration constraint method there are three statuses such as no collision exact contact and interpenetration between two bodies as shown in fig 17 φ1 and φ2 are the shape functions of the body surfaces which are continuously differentiable non interpenetration constraint equation can be expressed mathematically as follows anitescu and potra 2002 stewart 2000 1 g c o l l i s i o n φ 1 φ 2 0 if two bodies violate the non interpenetration constraint the collision normal force is acting on the bodies the collision force can be expressed by the constraint jacobian g collision which is the direction and the lagrange multiplier λ which is the magnitude 2 f c o l l i s i o n g c o l l i s i o n t λ g c o l l i s i o n t g c o l l i s i o n q t however it is not easy to represent the body surface as continuously differentiable functions therefore we derive a simple non interpenetration constraint equation between a vertex and a plane as shown in fig 18 e r p c means that the vector direction is from point c to p and the reference frame is the inertial frame e xyz the starting point can be omitted if the origin of the reference frame and the starting point are the same e r a e r b since two bodies are separated the line segment p q should be larger than or equal to zero this constraint and constraint jacobian can be expressed as follows 3 g c o l l i s i o n p q 0 p q n e r p c e n e r p e r c e n e r a e r p a e r b e r c b e 4 g c o l l i s i o n t n e r p a e n e n e r p e r b e n e using eq 4 the collision force is calculated as follows 5 f c o l l i s i o n g c o l l i s i o n t λ n e r p a e n e n e r p e r b e n e λ n e λ r p a e n e λ n e λ r p e r b e n e λ meanwhile there are not only the normal force but also the frictional force at the collision position the magnitude of the frictional force f friction is simply proportional to the normal force f normal and the direction is the opposite of the projected relative velocity e v rel on the plane as shown in fig 19 therefore the frictional force is calculated as follows 6 f f r i c t i o n μ v r e l e v r e l e λ μ t e λ where e t is the unit vector which is obtained by projection of the relative velocity at the collision position on the plane and μ is a frictional coefficient finally we obtain the collision force including both the normal and frictional forces by replacing the normal vector e n with e n μ e t in eq 4 7 f c o l l i s i o n g c o l l i s i o n t λ n e μ t e r p a e n e μ t e n e μ t e r p e r b e n e μ t e λ so far we explained the non interpenetration constraint equation between a vertex and a plane this equation can also be extended to the collision response between two bodies by using the collision pair which is obtained from the collision detection there are two types of collision pairs one is the mesh and the vertex which are obtained from vertex mesh collision detection algorithm as shown in fig 20 the mesh becomes the plane and p becomes the vertex the other type of collision pair is two edges from edge edge collision detection algorithm as shown in fig 21 the closest point p from e 1 body1 becomes the vertex the other closest point q becomes the point on the plane and the normalized vector from p to q becomes the normal vector of the plane 4 dynamic analysis including collision detection and response this section explains how to conduct the dynamic analysis including collision detection and response algorithms proposed in the previous sections 4 1 discrete euler lagrange equation the equations of motion classically mean the newton euler equation which is simply expressed as f m x if there are constraints between the bodies it is not easy to find collision forces in this case the formulation of multibody dynamics is used among several multibody dynamic formulations we adopt the discrete euler lagrange equation dele suggested by lacoursiere 2007 and servin et al 2007 the final form of dele is as follows 8 m g k t g k γ 4 ε h 2 v k 1 λ k 1 m v k h v q k h f q k v k 4 γ h g k γ g k v k where h is the time step m is the mass matrix v is the generalized velocity q is the generalized coordinate v is the potential energy g k is the constraint equations g k is the constraint jacobian λ is lagrange multiplier ε is the regularization terms and γ is the stabilization terms the derivation of dele and the meanings of parameters and variables in eq 8 are well described in ham et al 2015 meanwhile the floating crane is forced by the waves which are called hydrodynamic forces to consider the hydrodynamic forces in the time domain we adopted cummins equation cummins 1962 the hydrodynamic forces are composed of radiation and exciting forces as follows 9 f r a d i a t i o n a v t 0 b σ v t σ d σ 10 f e x c i t i n g f ω cos ω t ε where a is added mass at infinite frequency b σ is retardation function and f ε is force rao response amplitude operator at frequency domain substituting these two terms in f q k v k of eq 8 we can obtain the following equations 11 m g k t g k γ 4 ε h 2 v k 1 λ k 1 m v k h v q k h f r a d i a t i o n f e x c i t i n g f o t h e r s 4 γ h g k γ g k v k 12 m g k t g k γ 4 ε h 2 v k 1 λ k 1 m v k h v q k h a v k 1 h a v k h 0 b σ v t σ d τ f e x c i t i n g f o t h e r s 4 γ h g

for dynamic analysis including collision detection and response at first we solve the equations of motion expressed by dele then we obtain a position attitude velocity and acceleration of the bodies by the time integration these results are used to calculate external forces for the next time at the same time the collision detection which is composed of two stages broad phase and narrow phase is conducted then the collision response is executed using the collision pair data the results from the collision response are used to formulate the constraint equation g k and jacobian g k in the equations of motion this procedure is repeated until the dynamic analysis is finished 4 3 consideration of material properties in section 3 1 we insist that one of the advantages using a non interpenetration constraint method is to consider material properties such as restitution and softness this advantage is closely related to dele eq 8 which is adopted for our equations of motion the second row of dele is rewritten as follows 14 g k v k 1 γ 4 ε h 2 λ k 1 4 γ h g k γ g k v k if the right side of eq 14 is transposed to the left side we obtain the following equation 15 g k v k 1 γ g k v k γ 4 ε h 2 λ k 1 4 γ h g k 0 16 g k v k 1 γ v k 4 γ h ε λ k 1 h g k 0 eq 16 is an identical equation therefore the first and the second terms inside the bracket should be zero 17 v k 1 γ v k 0 18 ε λ k 1 h g k 0 the stabilization term γ in eq 17 is the ratio between the velocity before and after the collision which is known as the restitution coefficient if the regularization term ε in eq 18 is zero the constraint is strictly satisfied in other words ε allows the violation of the constraint and decide the softness of the material when two bodies collide the collision force is automatically obtained from dele with respect to γ and ε in spring damper methods the response motion after the collision is determined by the spring force therefore it is not easy to be satisfied with the material properties such as softness and restitution actually the softness which means the penetration and the restitution which means the ratio of the velocities before and after collision should be considered at the same time if we use the spring damper method furthermore the spring coefficient should be changed according to the properties of the body such as mass inertia velocity and so on these are the limitation of the spring damper method on the other hand non interpenetration constraint method can control the restitution and softness separately by using the stabilization and regularization terms respectively in addition even though the body properties are changed we don t need to change any values to control the collision response therefore we can conclude that the proposed method is much easier to apply material properties than selecting spring damper coefficients 5 case studies this section presents several case studies of the dynamic analysis including collision detection and response 5 1 collision for multibody system it was explained in section 3 1 that the impulse based method which directly changes the velocity was not applicable to the multibody system which has a kinematic constraint in contrast to the impulse based method the force based method is applicable to the multibody system for the test two bodies link a link b are connected by ball joints and the small box hits link b as shown in fig 23 when the box hits link b the kinematic constraint between link a and link b is violated because the velocity of link b is compulsively changed see fig 24 1 therefore the enormous constraint force is exerted to fix the kinematic constraint and the system diverges see fig 24 2 meanwhile in case of using the force based method it is successfully simulated without divergence of the system as shown in fig 25 5 2 performance tests of collision detection the first test is to check the collision between two bunny models as shown in fig 26 the bunny model contains 292 meshes and 148 vertices the computing time is compared with and without applying bvh the results are summarized in table 1 we set the leaf node of bvh which has less than eight meshes as a result the computing time for the one time step decreased about 95 total computing time is also decreased about 77 total computing time and one time step are not the same because total computing time includes the time when the collision between two bunnies does not occur furthermore total cost benchmarking test for collision detection proposed by bergen 2003 and suaib et al 2013 is performed total cost benchmarking test function is as follows 19 t n u c u n v c v n p c p c o where t total cost function for interference detection n v number of bounding volume pair overlap tests c v cost of testing a pair of bounding volumes for overlap n p is the number primitive pairs tested for interference c p cost of testing a pair of primitives for interference n u number of bounding volumes updated c u cost of average bounding volume update c o indicates cost for one time processing in this case the construction cost in this case the collision detection between primitive pairs is not considered the total cost for collision detection is summarized in table 2 it shows that total cost of collision detection without bvh is much larger than total cost with bvh the second test is to drop two bunny models on the plane in this case the meshes of right bunny model staying out of the collision is excluded using the exclusion box the right bunny model contains 172 meshes and 87 vertices as shown in fig 27 we compared the computing time with and without applying the exclusion box the results are summarized in table 3 the result shows that the computing time for a one time step is also reduced about 57 as the number of meshes is reduced to about 60 total computing time is also decreased by 33 the total cost benchmarking is also performed to the second test and is summarized in table 4 the third test is to drop the lpg tank model on the plane to check the performance using both the exclusion box and the bvh at the same time as shown in fig 28 the original lpg tank model contains 19 232 meshes and 57 696 vertices the results including computing time and total cost are summarized in table 5 when applying only bvh the computing time is reduced by 62 as the number of meshes is reduced the computing time is also reduced from 75 to 98 in conclusion both bvh and the exclusion box are effective to increase the performance of the collision detection 5 3 collision between complex shapes the model exported from the ship cad system has very complex shapes as shown in fig 29 and fig 30 both lpg tank and hull structure models have many unenclosed meshes furthermore stiffeners attached to the side shell is very sharp we simply drop the lpg tank inside the hull structure two simulations are conducted in the case that the tank was not tilted and the case that it was tilted for 20 as shown in fig 31 in spite of the unenclosed meshes and very sharp edges the collision detection and response between two models are successfully performed 5 4 collision according to material properties it was explained in section 4 3 that dele using non interpenetration constraint could consider material properties such as the restitution coefficient and softness at first the box drops on the plane according to different restitution coefficients as shown in fig 32 we choose the restitution coefficient as 0 0 perfectly inelasticity 0 5 and 1 0 perfectly elasticity the results are depicted as graphs in fig 33 when the restitution coefficient is zero the velocity is directly changed to zero right after the collision when the restitution coefficient is 0 5 the velocity is reduced to half after the collision when the restitution coefficient is one the velocity before and after the collision is almost the same 6 lpg tank erection this section presents the dynamic analysis of the lpg tank erection inside the hull structure by the floating crane fig 34 shows the modeling result all of the bodies are connected from the barge of the floating crane to the lpg tank by joints and wire ropes therefore the motion of the floating crane affects the motion of the lpg tank and vice versa the floating crane has four block loaders which are composed of four hooks and equalizers each block loader is connected to the lpg tank with five wire ropes there are ten bodies four hooks four equalizers one lpg tank one floating crane and 32 wire ropes including eight mooring lines in total the equations of motion of these models are automatically composed using eq 8 the main particulars are summarized in table 6 ku et al 2013 the left right sides and the bottom of lpg tank and the hull structure participate in the collision therefore unnecessary meshes are ignored by using the exclusion boxes as shown in fig 35 the number of meshes of lpg tank and the hull structure is reduced to 1 352 and 2 916 respectively inside the hull structure there is about 2 m of free space the collision detection and response between the lpg tank and the hull structure are applied according to various wave conditions the wave conditions are summarized in table 7 the heading angle is fixed to 90ο which is marked in fig 34 the wave periods are selected based on the floating crane rao as shown in fig 36 from cases 1 to 4 we will check the occurrence of the collision according to wave periods from cases 3 5 and 6 we will check the occurrence of the collision according to wave heights the maximum motion of the floating crane is expected around 8 or 10 s however as we can check the sway motion of the lpg tank before entering the hull structure shown in fig 37 the sway motion of case 4 only exceeds the free space which is about 2 m it is because the mooring lines prevent the motion of the floating crane and the excitation with a longer period has more influence on the motion of the suspended lpg tank therefore there is no collision between the lpg tank and the hull structure when the wave period is less than 10 s as shown in fig 38 when the wave period is more than 12 s case 4 the collision occurs as shown in fig 39 meanwhile when the wave height is changed from 1 0 m to more than 1 5 m cases 5 and 6 the collision also occurs from these results we can find safe environmental conditions which are that the wave period is less than 10 s and the wave height is less than 1 0 m fig 40 shows the graphs of the maximum collision force which is the maximum value among collision forces acting at several collision positions there is no collision force in cases 1 2 and 3 the collision forces in cases 4 5 and 6 are measured as 38 648 kn 41 167 kn and 66 930 kn respectively these results can be used as one of the parameters to design guide bumpers between the lpg tank and the hull structure 7 conclusions and future works this study dealt with special issues in collision detection and response because the shape exported from the ship cad system contains unenclosed meshes we proposed the position difference method which checks an intersection using the line segment made by the two vertices or the trigonal prism consisting of the two triangular meshes at time t 0 and t 1 furthermore bvh and exclusion boxes were adopted to increase the performance for collision response non interpenetration constraint method between a vertex and a plane was derived this method is applicable when two bodies collide at the multiple points and it does not compulsively violate the kinematic constraint because the collision force is also solved together when the equations of motion are solved numerically moreover the collision force can be determined automatically reflecting material properties such as restitution and softness however it is not easy to represent the body surfaces as continuously differentiable functions therefore we derive a simple non interpenetration constraint equation between a vertex and a plane this equation can also be extended to the collision response between two bodies by using the collision pair which is obtained from the collision detection for verification several case studies were conducted using the proposed collision detection and response algorithms the collision between the multibody system and a box was successfully performed without divergence of the system the computing time was dramatically reduced to more than 70 95 using bvh and exclusion boxes even though the shape contained unenclosed meshes and very sharp edges the collision detection and response between two models are successfully performed finally the collision detection and response between the lpg tank and the hull structure are applied according to various wave conditions as the wave period was increased from 6 to 12 s and the wave height was also changed from 1 0 m to 2 0 m we checked whether or not the collision was detected we could find safe environmental conditions which were that the wave period is less than 10 s and the wave height was less than 1 0 m among the simulation cases we obtained the maximum collision forces 6 822 ton when the wave period was 12 s and the wave height is 2 0 m in the future the developed code will be optimized to increase the performance in addition we have a plan to analyze the effects according to the type of materials and to validate the results by experiments because it is not easy to erase the unnecessary meshes which are never participated in the collision detection the computational cost optimization will be performed by implementing bvh acknowledgements this work was partially supported by a competency

22241,based on the rans equation and the vof two phase flow model numerical simulations were conducted about the air layer on the lower surface of a large ship model with and without propeller the influence of air injection on the propulsion performance of the propeller is investigated by comparing of thrust and torque of propeller numerical results indicate that the air does not enter the propeller working area directly for the design bottom cavity in this paper the average of the axial speed at the propeller disk surface would increase and the average wake fraction decrease with air injection under the same inflow velocity and rotation of the propeller the bottom air injection would make the propeller thrust and torque become smaller so the k t and k q decrease the air injection reduces the resistance of the ship model and the ship s self propelled point would change therefore the studies of the effect of the air injection on the propeller propulsion performance require to be analyzed at the new self propelled point keywords air layer viscous flow propeller average wake thrust torque 1 introduction air lubrication drag reduction is a promising engineering method for reducing ship fuel consumption the frictional resistance is one of the main drag components for large and low speed displacement vessels therefore it would be useful if lower friction drag was achieved to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and saving fuel costs air lubrication drag reduction is divided into bubble drag reduction bdr air layer drag reduction aldr and partial cavity drag reduction pcdr a large number of scholars have carried out numerous experimental and numerical studies on it for the bdr scholars mainly focus on the principle and mechanism of bubble for friction reduction the interaction between micro bubbles and a turbulent boundary layer flow was investigated with numerical method by rawat et al 2019 the results shows that the bubble effect in both mass and momentum equations plays a main role in the modification of the flow structures in the near wall layer which explains that a great rate of drag reduction obtained at the of wall of the air injection elghobashi 2019 summed up the significant progress has been made during the past 20 years on direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows laden with droplets or bubbles the drag reduction on the upper and lower walls of channel due to air injection through a porous coating was investigated and the effect of static pressure on reduction of turbulent friction was studied by evseev 2018 2019 jha et al 2019 conducted an experimentally study about the air lubrication drag reduction in the turbulent channel the measurements of drag modification and bubble dynamics were introduced in the article the study shows a maximum of about 60 drag reduction in wall over the entire range of conditions investigated park et al 2016 2018 and 2019 designed a model ship with transparent flat bottom plate to investigate the drag reduction by air injection the result show that the drag reduction of the ship model is up to 30 at an average void fraction of 5 inside the turbulent boundary layer murai 2014 reviewed basic experimental studies on bubble drag reduction in recent years and pointed that the progress in air lubricated drag reduction relies on recent advances in measurement techniques for complex bubbly two phase flow structures kumagai et al 2010 2015 developed a device to reduce the friction resistance of a ship s hull using small bubbles though experimental study the results of a series of full scale on the equipment indicate that air lubrication drag reduction can produce a net power saving of 5 15 for ships it has been shown that the aldr and pcdr can reduce the friction resistance greatly than bdr ceccio 2010 elbing et al 2013 mäkiharju et al 2013a in particular the air layer shape of the ship bottom plays an important role in drag reduction matveev 2003 2007 solved

the distance is 6 0 times of the diameter of the propeller from the model s aft to the outlet which is set as the pressure outlet boundary condition the sides surface of the computational domain are all free slip wall boundary condition in order to improve the efficiency of calculation the propeller calculation domain is divided into an external region and an internal region the external region

computational domain are all free slip wall boundary condition in order to improve the calculation efficiency half of the calculation domain is used to calculate the ship model resistance and the bottom air layer without propeller fig 6 shows the mesh of the computation domain and the surface mesh on the ship hull when it comes to the effects of the propeller the entire computation grid is used fig 7 shows the entire computational mesh ship model surface and propeller surface mesh the air injection is located at the bow part of the air cavity and the air is ejected towards the air cavity bottom vertically in the calculation the water and air are set to incompressible fluid due to the continuous supply of air the air liquid stratified flow formed at the bottom cavity of the ship as the air flows to the tail of the cavity the air is spilled due to buoyancy of air bubble in order to accurately capture the stratified flow of air liquid mesh refinement was performed in the vicinity of the ship bottom cavity the governing equations are discretized by a second order upwind scheme and the coupling of speed and pressure is the simpelc algorithm in the process of convergence accuracy of 10 4 calculation the flow field in the non air injection state is first solved after the flow field is stabilized the air injection is opened and injected into the air until a stable air layer formed 4 verification and validation for cfd simulation the accuracy of numerical computation is strongly dependent on the selection of parameters such as grid quality and time step size it is very important to choose a suitable size of domain firstly which affects the solution accuracy and calculation cost too large domain will increase the computational time and cost on the other hand a small domain would adversely influence the solution the uncertainty analysis method proposed by stern 2006 which was used to evaluate the uncertainty of the numerical calculation results and verify the reliability of the numerical calculation method dimensionless parameters in present study are mainly the froude number f r and air flow coefficient c q which are defined as following 6 f r v g l 7 c q q v b h where g is the gravity acceleration l is the length of ship h is the air cavity depth b is the air cavity width v is the flow velocity and q is the air flow respectively total resistance reduction ratio η is defined as following 8 η r cavity without air r cavity with air r cavity without air where r cavity without air is the total resistance without ejected air r cavity with air is the total resistance with ejected air in the bottom air cavity the results of the open water performance of the propeller and the ship s self propulsion can be obtained by the following formula 9 k t

efficiency t is the propeller thrust and q b is the propeller torque n is the propeller revolution ρ is the fresh water density 997 kg m3 d is the propeller diameter 4 1 verification verification studies were carried out to assess the numerical uncertainty u sn both for the ship resistance and the propeller in the open water a situation that the air layer completely covered the bottom of the ship were selected for the verification study when fr 0 155 cq 0 112 the verification parameters are the total resistance reduction ratio η and the percentage that area covered by air layer in the bottom cavity ς a i r for the ship resistance when comes to the propeller select j 0 5 for the numerical verification study the verification parameters are the propeller thrust coefficient k t torque coefficient k q and the quasi propulsive efficiency η 0 for the selected numerical calculation conditions the verification process includes the verification of the convergence of the grid and the convergence of the time step the grid convergence study was carried out on a small time step t 1 400 with three calculations in which the grid size was systematically coarsened by a uniform refinement ratio of r g 2 in each direction while the time step convergence study was carried out with a time step refinement ratio of r t 2 on the fine grid the medium and coarse mesh was generated by changing the base size of grid according to the mesh refinement ratio meanwhile the size of prism layers around the ship was kept fixed so the values of y plus on the ship surface remained the same for different mesh configurations the majority of y plus on the ship hull is between 0 and 50 as shown in fig 8 and the y plus distribution on the propeller is less than 10 as shown in fig 9 the final coarse medium and fine grid numbers are illustrated in table 4 the final coarse medium and fine meshes around the mid ship are shown in fig 10 in order to capture the air layer shape in the bottom cavity the grid is encrypted at the bottom boundary layer of the ship the results of the grid and time step convergence studies for the ship resistance are shown in tables 5 and 6 the grid convergence study for the propeller in the open water is shown in table 7 r g is the grid ratio s1 s2 and s3 represent the numerical results of fine grids medium grids and coarse grids r g is the convergence factor of numerical results in the mesh convergence study s c is the corrected simulation value δ is the corrected value u c is the corrected uncertainty as shown in tables 5 and 6 monotonic convergence was achieved for η and ς a i r the grid uncertainty u g 4 32 and the time step uncertainty u t 4 62 are relatively large for the ς a i r however these values reduce to 3 35 and 3 68 respectively when the corrected uncertainties u gc and u tc are estimated the time step uncertainties u t for η and ς a i r are generally smaller than those of the grid uncertainties u g which implies that the numerical results are relatively more sensitive to the grid resolution as shown in table 7 the grid uncertainty u g and the time step uncertainty u t are relatively small for both k t and k q 4 2 validation fig 11 provides a comparison of the calculated and the experimental of the ship s drag reduction with bottom air layer at fr 0 155 it can be seen that the drag reduction effect of the ship model with air layer by the vof model can be accurately predicted with the maximum error within 4 5 therefore validity of this numerical method is approved on the basis of the confirmation of the numerical calculation method the following numerical calculation uses the fine mesh fig 12 shows the comparison of air layer shape under the bottom cavity of the ship model between numerical calculations and experimental conditions at fr 0 155 and cq 0 112 it can be seen that the air layer can cover the cavity at the bottom of the ship both in the numerical calculation and experiment the air overflow from both sides of the bottom cavity which indicate that vof model can simulate the shape of air layer effectively fig 13 shows the experimental value of the open water performance for the propeller compared with the calculated value with fine mesh it can be seen that the calculated value has little error with the experimental value the maximum error is 4 46 5 08 and 3 8 for the k t k q and η 0 which is indicated that the calculation result is reasonable and reliable on the basis of the verification and validation of the numerical calculation method the following numerical calculation uses the fine mesh the time step t 0 0025 was selected when it comes to the self propulsion calculation of the ship model and propeller the mesh for the entire computation is close to 4 1 million including the ship hull and propeller domain 5 analysis of flow field around the hull without propeller 5 1 analysis of the air layer shape fig 14 shows the shape of air layer in the bottom cavity of the ship and air water distribution on the hull surface at different airflow when fr 0 155 it can be seen that the air layer extends to the whole cavity with the continuing ejection of air at the bow part of bottom cavity and some air would overflow from the end of air cavity the air injection would affect the flow field near the tail shaft as the air flow increases the phenomenon of air overflows from the stern cavity aggravates even if the air flow is small the air layer would completely cover the bottom cavity for example when cq 0 056 only the coverage in the local area is not very good 5 2 analysis of the flow field at the tail of the ship fig 15 shows the flow field velocity map of the propeller disk at different air flow when fr 0 155 it can be seen that the bottom air injection would change the wake field at the stern axis of ship model fig 16 shows the axial velocity of the propeller disk at different radius in the circumferential direction when fr 0 155 0 takes the upper part of the propeller disk as the reference as can be seen from figs 15 and 16 the air injection would change the flow field around the hull and increase the axial average speed at the stern propeller surface which means that the average wake at the propeller disk surface is reduced and the air injection would make the flow at the paddle surface more uniform a reasonable explanation is as follows there is a continuous air injection in the bottom cavity of the ship and some air overflow at the tail of the bottom cavity due to the buoyancy of the bubbles the air moves backward along the surface of the ship hull causing the boundary layer of the ship hull in the working area of the propeller to change thus the velocity of axial direction at the surface of the propeller becomes more uniform 6 propeller characteristics with air layer 6 1 numerical self propulsion calculation process in the numerical calculation of the ship model self propulsion by continuously changing the propeller speed the thrust generated by the propeller is equal to the ship model resistance and the corresponding propeller speed is the self travel point of the model the corresponding thrust and resistance values differ by less than 2 fig 17 shows the comparison of numerical calculations and experiments for the air layer shape in the bottom cavity with fr 0 155 cq 0 112 propeller n 73 rad s it is can be seen that the air overflows from the slopes on both sides of the stern cavity and the air does not directly enter the working area of the propeller the air layer shape of numerical calculation agrees well with the experiment from the comparative analysis of the bottom air layer shape with propeller and without propeller in fig 17a it is found that the propeller has a suction effect on the air layer and the air layer would extend a certain distance to the stern and the coverage area of the air layer would become larger 6 2 analysis of the air layer and performance of propeller fig 18 shows the air layer shape and the air overflow in the stern of cavity under different speeds with its self propulsion point the air flow rate is 10 m3 h as can be seen from fig 18 the air does not enter the propeller working area directly for the scheme of ship model and bottom cavity calculated in this paper because there are two slopes set in both sides of the bottom cavity see fig 2 the air overflows at the slopes and no large bubble directly enters the propeller area the bubble that overflows from the slopes changes the boundary layer structure at the surface of the ship hull which indirectly affects the performance of the propeller table 8 shows comparison of the propeller thrust and torque in calculation without air and with air flow rate is 10 m3 h under different speed the rotate listed in table 3 are the calculated result of the ship model self propulsion point when there is no air it can be seen from table 8 that the bottom air injection would make the propeller thrust and torque become smaller the reason is that air injection would increases the axial velocity at the disk surface of the propeller the average wake fraction decreases so the k t and k q decrease under the same rotation it is worth noting that the total resistance of the ship model is reduced with air injection the propeller self propulsion point will change and the propulsion efficiency will also change therefore the studies of the influence of the air injection on propeller propulsion performance need to be analyzed at the new self propulsion point this is a question that should be depth studied in the future 7 conclusions based on the rans equation and the vof two phase flow model numerical simulations were conducted about the air layer on the lower surface of a large ship model with and without propeller accordingly the following conclusions can be drawn from the numerical analysis 1 air layer shape in the bottom cavity can be accurately simulated based on the rans equations and vof two phase flow model calculation method and the drag reduction with air injection of the ship model can be effectively predicted 2 the air does not enter the propeller working area directly for the design bottom cavity in model ship of this paper the average of the axial speed at the propeller disk surface would increase and the average wake fraction decrease with air injection under the same inflow velocity and rotation of the propeller the bottom air injection would make the propeller thrust and torque become smaller so the k t and k q decrease whether the same effect can be achieved at the actual scale ship requires further research 3 the air injection reduces the resistance of the ship model and the ship s self propelled point would change therefore the studies of the effect of the air injection on the propeller propulsion performance require to be analyzed at the new self propelled point which is a question that should be depth studied in the future

22241,based on the rans equation and the vof two phase flow model numerical simulations were conducted about the air layer on the lower surface of a large ship model with and without propeller the influence of air injection on the propulsion performance of the propeller is investigated by comparing of thrust and torque of propeller numerical results indicate that the air does not enter the propeller working area directly for the design bottom cavity in this paper the average of the axial speed at the propeller disk surface would increase and the average wake fraction decrease with air injection under the same inflow velocity and rotation of the propeller the bottom air injection would make the propeller thrust and torque become smaller so the k t and k q decrease the air injection reduces the resistance of the ship model and the ship s self propelled point would change therefore the studies of the effect of the air injection on the propeller propulsion performance require to be analyzed at the new self propelled point keywords air layer viscous flow propeller average wake thrust torque 1 introduction air lubrication drag reduction is a promising engineering method for reducing ship fuel consumption the frictional resistance is one of the main drag components for large and low speed displacement vessels therefore it would be useful if lower friction drag was

reduction the interaction between micro bubbles and a turbulent boundary layer flow was investigated with numerical method by rawat et al 2019 the results shows that the bubble effect in both mass and momentum equations plays a main role in the modification of the flow structures in the near wall layer which explains that a great rate of drag reduction obtained at the of wall of the air injection elghobashi 2019 summed up the significant progress has been made during the past 20 years on direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows laden with droplets or bubbles the drag reduction on the

investigate the drag reduction by air injection the result show that the drag reduction of the ship model is up to 30 at an average void fraction of 5 inside the turbulent boundary layer murai 2014 reviewed basic experimental studies on bubble drag reduction in recent years and pointed that the progress in air lubricated drag reduction relies on recent advances in measurement techniques for complex bubbly two phase flow structures kumagai et al 2010 2015 developed a device to reduce the friction resistance of a ship s hull using small bubbles though experimental study the results of a

adapco 2017 3 2 boundary conditions and meshes fig 4 shows the regional division and grid for calculation of propeller in the open water the velocity inlet is 8 times of the diameter of the propeller the distance is 6 0 times of the diameter of the propeller from the model s aft to the outlet which is set as the pressure outlet boundary condition the sides surface of the computational domain are all free slip wall boundary condition in order to improve the efficiency of calculation the propeller calculation domain is divided into an external region and an internal region the external region adopts a fully structured grid and the internal region adopts an unstructured region and which is set as a rotation domain the rotation center is the propeller center the interface between the two regions is set to interfaces fig 5 shows the regional division and the boundary conditions for the ship model based on the two phase flow theory the boundary conditions of present problem are set as follows the inlet is 0 8 times ship model length which is corresponding to the velocity inlet boundary condition the distance is 2 0 times ship length from the model s aft to the outlet which is set as the outflow boundary condition the distance of side walls the top and bottom to the ship model are 1 0l 0 5l and 1 25l l is the length of the ship model the top bottom and side surface of the computational domain are all free slip wall boundary condition in order to improve the calculation efficiency half of the calculation domain is used to calculate the ship model resistance and the bottom air layer without propeller fig 6 shows the mesh of the computation domain and the surface mesh on the ship hull when it comes to the effects of the propeller the entire computation grid is used fig 7 shows the entire computational mesh ship model surface and propeller surface mesh the air injection is located at the bow part of the air cavity and the air is ejected towards the air cavity bottom vertically in the calculation the water and air are set to incompressible fluid due to the continuous supply of air the air liquid stratified flow formed at the bottom cavity of the ship as the air flows to the tail of the cavity the air is spilled due to buoyancy of air bubble in order to accurately capture the stratified flow of air liquid mesh refinement was performed in the vicinity of the ship bottom cavity the governing equations are discretized by a second order upwind scheme and the coupling of speed and pressure is the simpelc algorithm in the process of convergence accuracy of 10 4 calculation the flow field in the non air injection state is first solved after the flow field is stabilized the air injection is opened and injected into the air until a stable air layer formed 4 verification and validation for cfd simulation the accuracy of numerical computation is strongly dependent on the selection of parameters such as grid quality and time step size it is very important to choose a suitable size of domain firstly which affects the solution accuracy and calculation cost too large domain will increase the computational time and cost on the other hand a small domain would adversely influence the solution the uncertainty analysis method proposed by stern 2006 which was used to evaluate the uncertainty of the numerical calculation results and verify the reliability of the numerical calculation method dimensionless parameters in present study are mainly the froude number f r and air flow coefficient c q which are defined as following 6 f r v g l 7 c q q v b h where g is the gravity acceleration l is the length of ship h is the air cavity depth b is the air cavity width v is the flow velocity and q is the air flow respectively total resistance reduction ratio η is defined as following 8 η r cavity without air r cavity with air r cavity without air where r cavity without air is the total resistance without ejected air r cavity with air is the total resistance with ejected air in the bottom air cavity the results of the open water performance of the propeller and the ship s self propulsion can be obtained by the following formula 9 k t

efficiency t is the propeller thrust and q b is the propeller torque n is the propeller revolution ρ is the fresh water density 997 kg m3 d is the propeller diameter 4 1 verification verification studies were carried out to assess the numerical uncertainty u sn both for the ship resistance and the propeller in the open water a situation that the air layer completely covered the bottom of the ship were selected for the verification study when fr 0 155 cq 0 112 the verification parameters are the total resistance reduction ratio η and the percentage that area covered by air layer in the bottom cavity ς a i r for the ship resistance when comes to the propeller select j 0 5 for the numerical verification study the verification parameters are the propeller thrust coefficient k t torque coefficient k q and the quasi propulsive efficiency η 0 for the selected numerical calculation conditions the verification process includes the verification of the convergence of the grid and the convergence of the time step the grid convergence study was carried out on a small time step t 1 400 with three calculations in which the grid size was systematically coarsened by a uniform refinement ratio of r g 2 in each direction while the time step convergence study was carried out with a time step refinement ratio of r t 2 on the fine grid the medium and coarse mesh was generated by changing the base size of grid according to the mesh refinement ratio meanwhile the size of prism layers around the ship was kept fixed so the values of y plus on the ship surface remained the same for different mesh configurations the majority of y plus on the ship hull is between 0 and 50 as shown in fig 8 and the y plus distribution on the propeller is less than 10 as shown in fig 9 the final coarse medium and fine grid numbers are illustrated in table 4 the final coarse medium and fine meshes around the mid ship are shown in fig 10 in order to capture the air layer shape in the bottom cavity the grid is encrypted at the bottom boundary layer of the ship the results of the grid and time step convergence studies for the ship resistance are shown in tables 5 and 6 the grid convergence study for the propeller in the open water is shown in table 7 r g is the grid ratio s1 s2 and s3 represent the numerical results of fine grids medium grids and coarse grids r g is the convergence factor of numerical results in the mesh convergence study s c is the corrected simulation value δ is the corrected value u c is the corrected uncertainty as shown in tables 5 and 6 monotonic convergence was achieved for η and ς a i r the grid uncertainty u g 4 32 and the time step uncertainty u t 4 62 are relatively large for the ς a i r however these values reduce to 3 35 and 3 68 respectively when the corrected uncertainties u gc and u tc are estimated the time step uncertainties u t for η and ς a i r are generally smaller than those of the grid uncertainties u g which implies that the numerical results are relatively more sensitive to the grid resolution as shown in table 7 the grid uncertainty u g and the time step uncertainty u t are relatively small for both k t and k q 4 2 validation fig 11 provides a comparison of the calculated and the experimental of the ship s drag reduction with bottom air layer at fr 0 155 it can be seen that the drag reduction effect of the ship model with air layer by the vof model can be accurately predicted with the maximum error within 4 5 therefore validity of this numerical method is approved on the basis of the confirmation of the numerical calculation method the following numerical calculation uses the fine mesh fig 12 shows the comparison of air layer shape under the bottom cavity of the ship model between numerical calculations and experimental conditions at fr 0 155 and cq 0 112 it can be seen that the air layer can cover the cavity at the bottom of the ship both in the numerical calculation and experiment the air overflow from both sides of the bottom cavity which indicate that vof model can simulate the shape of air layer effectively fig 13 shows the experimental value of the open water performance for the propeller compared with the calculated value with fine mesh it can be seen that the calculated value has little error with the experimental value the maximum error is 4 46 5 08 and 3 8 for the k t k q and η 0 which is indicated that the calculation result is reasonable and reliable on the basis of the verification and validation of the numerical calculation method the following numerical calculation uses the fine mesh the time step t 0 0025 was selected when it comes to the self propulsion calculation of the ship model and propeller the mesh for the entire computation is close to 4 1 million including the ship hull and propeller domain 5 analysis of flow field around the hull without propeller 5 1 analysis of the air layer shape fig 14 shows the shape of air layer in the bottom cavity of the ship and air water distribution on the hull surface at different airflow when fr 0 155 it can be seen that the air layer extends to the whole cavity with the continuing ejection of air at the bow part of bottom cavity and some air would overflow from the end of air cavity the air injection would affect the flow field near the tail shaft as the air flow increases the phenomenon of air overflows from the stern cavity aggravates even if the air flow is small the air layer would completely cover the bottom cavity for example when cq 0 056 only the coverage in the local area is not very good 5 2 analysis of the flow field at the tail of the ship fig 15 shows the flow field velocity map of the propeller disk at different air flow when fr 0 155 it can be seen that the bottom air injection would change the wake field at the stern axis of ship model fig 16 shows the axial velocity of the propeller disk at different radius in the circumferential direction when fr 0 155 0 takes the upper part of the propeller disk as the reference as can be seen from figs 15 and 16 the air injection would change the flow field around the hull and increase the axial average speed at the stern propeller surface which means that the average wake at the propeller disk surface is reduced and the air injection would make the flow at the paddle surface more uniform a reasonable explanation is as follows there is a continuous air injection in the bottom cavity of the ship and some air overflow at the tail of the bottom cavity due to the buoyancy of the bubbles the air moves backward along the surface of the ship hull causing the boundary layer of the ship hull in the working area of the propeller to change thus the velocity of axial direction at the surface of the propeller becomes more uniform 6 propeller characteristics with air layer 6 1 numerical self propulsion calculation process in the numerical calculation of the ship model self propulsion by continuously changing the propeller speed the thrust generated by the propeller is equal to the ship model resistance and the corresponding propeller speed is the self travel point of the model the corresponding thrust and resistance values differ by less than 2 fig 17 shows the comparison of numerical calculations and experiments for the air layer shape in the bottom cavity with fr 0 155 cq 0 112 propeller n 73 rad s it is can be seen that the air overflows from the slopes on both sides of the stern cavity and the air does not directly enter the working area of the propeller the air layer shape of numerical calculation agrees well with the experiment from the comparative analysis of the bottom air layer shape with propeller and without propeller in fig 17a it is found that the propeller has a suction effect on the air layer and the air layer would extend a certain distance to the stern and the coverage area of the air layer would become larger 6 2 analysis of the air layer and performance of propeller fig 18 shows the air layer shape and the air overflow in the stern of cavity under different speeds with its self propulsion point the air flow rate is 10 m3 h as can be seen from fig 18 the air does not enter the propeller working area directly for the scheme of ship model and bottom cavity calculated in this paper because there are two slopes set in both sides of the bottom cavity see fig 2 the air overflows at the slopes and no large bubble directly enters the propeller area the bubble that overflows from the slopes changes the boundary layer structure at the surface of the ship hull which indirectly affects the performance of the propeller table 8 shows comparison of the propeller thrust and torque in calculation without air and with air flow rate is 10 m3 h under different speed the rotate listed in table 3 are the calculated result of the ship model self propulsion point when there is no air it can be seen from table 8 that the bottom air injection would make the propeller thrust and torque become smaller the reason is that air injection would increases the axial velocity at the disk surface of the propeller the average wake fraction decreases so the k t and k q decrease under the same rotation it is worth noting that the total resistance of the ship model is reduced with air injection the propeller self propulsion point will change and the propulsion efficiency will also change therefore the studies of the influence of the air injection on propeller propulsion performance need to be analyzed at the new self propulsion point this is a question that should be depth studied in the future 7 conclusions based on the rans equation and the vof two phase flow model numerical simulations were conducted about the air layer on the lower surface of a large ship model with and without propeller accordingly the following conclusions can be drawn from the numerical analysis 1 air layer shape in the bottom cavity can be accurately simulated based on the rans equations and vof two phase flow model calculation method and the drag reduction with air injection of the ship model can be effectively predicted 2 the air does not enter the propeller working area directly for the design bottom cavity in model ship of this paper the average of the axial speed at the propeller disk surface would increase and the average wake fraction decrease with air injection under the same inflow velocity and rotation of the propeller the bottom air injection would make the propeller thrust and torque become smaller so the k t and k q decrease whether the same effect can be achieved at the actual scale ship requires further research 3 the air injection reduces the resistance of the ship model and the ship s self propelled point would change therefore the studies of the effect of the air injection on the propeller propulsion performance require to be analyzed at the new self propelled point which is a question that should be depth studied in the future

22242,this paper presents a quantitative method for evaluating tidal energy extraction in uldolmok strait located in the southwestern part of the korean peninsula which is well known for having an impressively fast tidal current speed up to 6 m s the advantages of this method are expressed by maximizing the power captured by all the turbines deployed in a tidal farm and by optimizing the array layout size with twelve different configurations the energy yield of the proposed designs is evaluated based on flow data for the hydrodynamic model used impacts of sea depth device installation constraints and wake effects between the turbines on the farm the results show that staggered layouts achieve higher efficiency for energy extraction than centered arrangements in all cases moreover an array configuration with 48 turbines is least efficient for tidal farming as it suffers the highest energy losses caused by the wake effects in comparison with other designs when considering the optimum energy yield and cost of energy for tidal farming the small scale farm could be the most satisfactory selection because it ensures the capital cost of the entire tidal project as well as minimizes the negative effects on the marine environments in uldolmok keywords uldolmok strait tidal array optimization wake interactions tidal current turbines 1 introduction recently the demand for new renewable energy sources has been rising due to growing concerns about climate change a global reduction in greenhouse effects and dependence on fossil fuels from human power consumption among the new renewable energy sources tidal power has many advantages because of its higher energy density and reliability which makes it highly attractive from a grid management perspective for renewable electricity production tidal turbines are a competitive and promising option due to the increasing cost of energy however any projects of tidal farms installed with many tidal energy converters tec must be considered carefully especially minimizing the costs of turbine installation and subsea cabling moreover the optimization of tidal turbine arrangement on a farm to obtain the highest tidal energy extraction is a complicated and challenging process where to deploy the tidal turbines within a real site and how to optimize a tidal farm performance should be considered carefully in other words finding an ideal layout is crucial because it could considerably affect the amount of energy captured and determine the economic feasibility of a tidal project due to the difficulties in installing the observation equipment inside the real tidal farms carrying out an evaluation of the effectiveness of these farms using the scaled down models in the experimental flumes or numerical methods could be seen as a feasible solution myers et al 2005a 2005b and mycek et al 2014a 2014b have conducted several scaled experimental tests this assessment approach of tidal array performance in the experimental flumes has highlighted advantages such as relatively accurate replication of fluid turbine interaction and the ambient turbulence intensity effect on the stream turbines in the layout nevertheless testing the tidal stream array in the flumes exists several limitations on the quantity of the turbines installed and the reynolds number resemblance ottavio et al 2016 the numerical method or computational fluid dynamics cfd is a substitutive solution in this case kolekar et al 2015 goundar et al 2013 lee et al 2012 jo et al 2010 building the tidal turbines based on blade element momentum theory bemt or actual disk theory adt can be evaluated as initially common methods for the purpose of tidal farm optimization whelan et al 2009 masters et al 2011 harrison et al 2010 malki et al 2014 bai et al 2013 hunter et al 2015 it can be said that these methods have not fully considered other important factors of the surrounding environment especially the variation of tidal flow direction water surface elevation or complexity of seabed topography therefore the researchers have been developing and applying other tools to the tidal farming process to give more comprehensive and efficient assessments a few quantitative studies which have similar approaches to the wind farm applications javier et al 2010 chen et al 2013 pillai et al 2017 have aimed to investigate ideal array layouts for the greatest power generation for example a study has been conducted using telemac for a tidal current turbine farm in paimpol bréhat pham et al 2009 this project optimized layouts based on different constraints such as the natural conditions of the site uneven beds and water flow sea surface and ground clearance features the spacing between devices and tidal current direction however the study did not mention losses in tidal energy extraction due to wake effects in the proposed array layouts there has also been a study done on energy extraction via tidal turbines in an idealized channel implemented in the regional ocean modeling system roms by thyng et al 2013 this study s methodology allowed to produce a more realistic result and assessed the impact of tidal turbines on the hydrographical system however the power assessment methodologies used mainly focused on turbine effects on flow features and site characterization without performing a detailed evaluation of the energy yield of the proposed arrays to optimize power extraction besides that funke et al 2014 carried out a study on tidal array layout optimization using an adjoint approach in their work configurations for tidal turbine farms were formulated as optimization problems constrained by partial differential equations describing the flow however tidal layout optimization using gradient based adjoint models can be difficult due to complexity as they involve differentiating to find the solution of a partial differential equation martin et al 2018 have investigated the flow characteristics of tidal turbine arrays using a three dimensional openfoam model the wake formations of all the turbines in the tidal arrays have well constructed in this study however further improvements of the wake characteristic prediction are required in summary each method to simulate the tidal array layouts and optimize the power generation of the tidal farm as mentioned above has its own strong points and existing drawbacks so far however those studies have considerably contributed to the development of tidal energy harvest in the future uldolmok strait is famous for its strong tidal flows with a maximum current speed of over 6 m s measured using adcp since 2002 by kang et al 2006 byun et al 2013 have also evaluated uldolmok as one of the highest annual energy density sites in the southwestern part of the korean peninsula according to the results of a study on tidal current energy resource estimates this channel is located between jindo island and haenam county in addition the uldolmok strait has an average depth of 15 20 m and the width of the narrowest part is about 250 m lee et al 2009 as shown in fig 1 in this paper we present a numerical method for optimizing turbine arrangement within the tidal farms of uldolmok and maximizing power extraction of tidal turbines in an array configuration based on a finite element coastal ocean model that provides tidal currents across sites twelve different designs for tidal farm layouts including six centered and six staggered formations have been constructed based on tidal device installation constraints tidal device characteristics ambient turbulence intensities and power laws via a reference location tidal stream speed and direction and water depth in this study for tidal array layout optimization in uldolmok a large number of layout configurations with different numbers of turbines have been designed and tested the array designs presented are the most typical patterns selected to compare tidal energy extraction annual energy yield is used to evaluate the power output extracted from the turbines in the tidal farms energy yield also takes into account energy loss due to wake effects which helps evaluate more accurately the annual energy yield of the various array layouts the energy yield of the selected array designs has been compared so that an optimal tidal array configuration for the uldolmok strait can be found 2 optimization process in this study a comprehensive assessment of tidal farming optimization for the uldolmok strait has been carried out using commercial code software tidalfarmer which is an array planning and analysis tool used to predict the energy capture of a turbine array the power generation prediction for a tidal farm is derived by evaluating turbines interactions and the potential effect an array layout will have on energy yield this evaluation has been achieved through the development of rationalized modeling methods which involves reducing incredibly complex interactions between tidal turbines and the surrounding flow field into a series of distinct physical processes namely coastal basin array scale and device scale that can be simplified and modeled fig 2 diagrams the energy yield analysis used to optimize tidal farming total array energy extracted is the sum of all individual turbines nguyen et al 2016 and expressed as follows 1 e a r r a y k 1 n d i r i 1 n v j 1 n t p i k j f i k where e array is the total energy output extracted by the farm definitions of the remaining terms in equation 1 are interpreted as below p i k j is the average power output f ik is the frequency of occurrence of the power output in the specified period j is a turbine index n t is the total number of turbines in the farm i is a tidal stream velocity index concerning the speed bin for example 1 5 m s under consideration n v is the total number of tidal speeds in the long term flow velocity distribution for each flow direction k is a flow direction index n dir is the total number of flow speed directions as depicted in fig 2 a two dimensional depth averaged flow field extracted from the tidal modeling model has been being extrapolated to generate a model with a three dimensional flow field this model has been designed in the frequency region through a binning process by adding the tidal flow field results from a hydrodynamic model into speed bins the simulation process of a tidal farming optimization used in this paper is similar to that presented by nguyen et al 2016 for tidal farming in jangjuk channel south korea after interpolating the 3 d flow field a combination of several important input parameters is executed such as the incident flow characteristics ambient turbulence intensity boundary layer height tidal flow speeds and direction during flood tides and ebb tides and wake prediction models in order to correlate the spatial variability of the flow speed across a site with the long term frequency distribution to perform an energy yield calculation the long term resource data must be added the long term resource data or long term reference points contains the speed bin centers the bin widths and then a list of the probability frequency for each direction and flow speed bin this probability for all directions and all speed bins sums to unity the ambient flow for a tidal stream is considered as turbulent therefore the eddy viscosity in the wake cannot be wholly described by the shear contribution and an ambient term is required ambient turbulence intensity this could be the rotor averaged or swept area turbulence intensity or the average turbulence over a multiple of the rotor diameter then information on the turbine characteristics every turbine s coordinates and installation constraints of these turbines considering a reduction of grid connection costs and negative interactions between the turbines in a specific array design should be added finally an energy yield extracted from all the turbines will be obtained throughout this process by analyzing the energy production the researchers and the project s investors could evaluate the array performance of the present arrangement which is effective or not this optimization process can be viewed as a fairly comprehensive approach to serving the tidal projects currently when analyzing energy yield production of the tidal arrays two main energy calculations for layout optimization were performed to allow for assessment of the efficiency of the proposed array layout designs including gross and net energy yield calculations the former was considered in a scenario where all turbines experienced bathymetry induced local speed changes without the upstream turbines wake effect the latter was calculated in the same situation adding the effect of wake losses there are three models included in the tidalfarmer tool in order to resolve the wake deficits downstream of operational devices these are the park model two dimensional 2 d eddy viscosity model three dimensional 3 d eddy viscosity model the eddy viscosity wake model is a calculation of the velocity deficit field using a finite difference solution to the thin shear layer equations of the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations in axisymmetric coordinates in the case of the 3 d eddy viscosity model the non axisymmetric development of a turbine wake makes it unfeasible to use a cylindrical coordinate system instead a cartesian coordinate system is proposed in this study the park model developed by jensen et al 1986 has been used to simulate wake effects which provides a semi empirical description of wake flow on the assumption that a wake is axisymmetric and unbounded the development of wakes was influenced by free stream conditions as well as interactions with other turbine wakes within the flow field in addition there were two other calculations for energy yield assessment including baseline energy yield and net energy yield with wake and blockage effects baseline energy yield was predicted for all turbines experiencing the same flow regime as at the reference location where power weighted speed was calculated using input power law profiles for net energy with wake and blockage effects all turbines within the site experienced bathymetry inducing local speed changes where wake losses were calculated and local blockage effects were modeled admittedly maximizing the energy yield of a particular tidal farm was a visible challenge while still ensuring the optimization of the cost of energy hence the aim of this quantitative method was to produce results that feed directly into calculations for the cost of energy optimization key assumptions and limitations of the numerical model consist of the thrust coefficient and wake decay rate are suitable parameters that can be used to determine the recovery rate of the centreline flow speed park model assumes axial symmetry of the wake however the wake flow will transition to a shallow water wake the blockage effect can be modeled purely by an increase in thrust and power coefficient and is achieved through the use of the blockage model the initial velocity deficit at the start of the far wake position is a function of the thrust coefficient and turbulence intensity the flowing shape at the near wake boundary can be approximated by a gaussian curve the current assumptions made within the numerical tool used in this research imply that the effect of energy extraction on the global flow is small and does not significantly alter the 2 d bathymetry driven flow field effectively this assumes that the momentum extracted by each turbine is small in comparison to the energy in the surrounding flow there will be a reduction in the momentum due to the extraction of energy and thus a resulting drop in free surface elevation downstream to accommodate this extraction however on a micro scale the energy extracted by the turbine will be replenished from the across stream flow and the effect on the downstream flow will be small 3 input data and setup parameters 3 1 pre processing site specific tidal prediction the requirements for site specific tidal flow field prediction include two modeling methods long term prediction of the temporal variation in tidal flow at the site and a model for spatial variation of flow pre processing methods were used to convert the results from a flow solver into spatial flow fields for each flow state these were then analyzed to calculate the resulting energy yield it was assumed that the momentum extracted was solely due to the energy extraction of the devices and not blockage effects that may have diverted flow upstream for small arrays it has been shown that this assumption is valid for larger arrays it may have been necessary to reduce the mass flux through the array to capture the two scale mixing problem 3 1 1 tidal modeling to investigate the characteristics of the tide and tidal current depth averaged numerical modeling two dimensional tidal modeling using an adcirc model was constructed around the uldolmok strait tidal currents in this area are extremely high because of the narrow channel width and relatively shallow depth tidal amplitudes of the dominant principal semi diurnal tide m2 and principal diurnal tide k1 in uldolmok have an average of 1 2 m and 0 31 m respectively as observed by kang et al 2012 and yum et al 2003 the maximum tidal range can be as large as approximately 4 m a fine unstructured grid resolution was used for the hydrodynamic model with element size varying from 20 m at the narrowest part of the channel to 100 m for sections near the ocean as shown in fig 3 the hydrodynamic model used consists of about 95 000 elements and 50 000 nodes in the horizontal plane bottom friction and a friction factor increase were set to 0 004 and 0 3333 respectively the wave continuity coefficient was set to 0 005 and a value for the lateral viscosity of 4 m2 s was used an open boundary condition for the model was specified near the uldolmok strait using eight harmonic tidal constituents k 1 m 2 n 2 o 1 s 2 p 1 q 1 and k 2 river inflows as well as density induced and wind driven currents were not considered in this study tidal modeling data for the uldolmok strait was validated against observations over one month a comparison of depth averaged current speed in the adcp data observed in 2002 by kang et al 2006 at t1 and calculations from the present study is illustrated in fig 4 other comparisons of depth averaged current speeds and tidal ranges for validation between the numerical results of the present study and the observed data were carried out however they are not shown in this paper 3 1 2 time series tidal energy resource calculation this resource calculation determined kinetic energy flux across the site as predicted using the current speed in a hydrodynamic model then these results indicated the best tidal energy resource when considering the position of the given tidal stream energy farm carballo et al 2009 and blunden et al 2006 presented a function of energy density ed wh m2 over a specified period t 2 e d 0 t p d d t where p d is power density w of a tidal stream representing the kinetic energy flux per unit square meter fig 5 shows the time series energy density map for the uldolmok strait based on equation 2 the results show that the highest energy density is concentrated near the narrowest part with over 40 kw m2 3 1 3 flow field data flow fields relate three dimensional currents through the array which are essential for tidal farming optimization in the uldolmok strait input data included long term resources and observed power law and turbulence intensity profiles many studies have been conducted using different power laws due to the impact of seabed surface roughness such as the 1 7th power law 1 10th power law and logarithm power law harrison et al 2010 tidal flow characteristics at uldolmok strait were investigated by ko et al 2017 the tidal current data were measured using an acoustic doppler current profiler model whws adcp 600 khz according to conclusions of that research the power law exponent n of tidal current was approximately 9 3 during ebb and 10 75 during the flood as shown in fig 7 in order to extrapolate a depth averaged flow field model into three dimensions the power law and turbulence intensity at different flow speed values are required the turbulence intensity input is a depth averaged value for each direction and flow speed value the approach adopted for the turbulence intensity parameters is to divide the depth averaged current speed by the flow profile through the vertical and then multiply by the turbulence intensity this gives a profile that mimics the turbulence intensity profile observed at real sites table 1 presents a summary of turbulence intensity inputs for the tidalfarmer based on the data collected by ko et al 2017 long term resource information and the tidal ellipse at a long term reference point are shown in fig 6 along the uldolmok strait the tidal rise is almost symmetric in terms of magnitude and direction the flow is bi directional with two main directions around 135 clockwise from the north during ebb tides i e south east and around 315 during high tides i e north west which means ebb and flood states produce nearly opposite angles in addition the numerical model showed that velocity was not uniform over the zone and can vary a great deal within distances of only hundreds of meters 3 2 array design and turbine installation constraints 3 2 1 tidal stream device parameters these variables describe a single tidal stream device which can be of arbitrary definition the parameters consist of the device geometry such as hub height rotor diameter as well as performance due to the limitations on the complexity of bathymetry as mentioned in above the averaged water depth is about 15 20 m while considering the viability of a tidal farming project a turbine with a 0 5 mw power output scale was used and device geometry parameters were set as shown in table 2 the turbine with three blades using s814 foil fig 8 was designed based on bemt blade element momentum theory and developed by the authors at the ocean fluid machinery lab of mokpo national maritime university the turbine was numerically tested at various tsrs tip speed ratio and compared to other models fig 8a conducted by bahaj et al 2007 tian et al 2016 and hu et al 2017 for this purpose a commercial cfd code ansys 17 0 was used fig 9 illustrates a comparison of power coefficient power output and torque between the authors design and other studies in general the present model showed a similar trend of power coefficient cp compared with the others more specifically the cp curve rises up quickly from tsr 3 the highest cp was obtained at tsr 5 about 43 corresponding to 530 kw power output fig 9b after that the cp curve falls down gradually up to tsr 9 3 2 2 device installation constraints device installation conditions defined the primary constraints such that deployment of tidal stream energy converters was realistic when considering the expected energy yield of a layout as described in fig 10 the planning area for turbine installation has a relatively small width about 60 m thus the number of turbines deployed in the lateral direction is a maximum of four when the lateral spacing is fixed at 2d d is a rotor diameter with this respect minimum lateral spacing is set between 2 and 2 5d if a device violated a constraint check it was eliminated for the energy yield calculation table 3 shows the device installation constraints used for this study the minimum lateral and longitudinal distances will be applied to a fixed value depending on tidal farm sizes 3 2 3 array layout configurations regarding the tidal farm size based on the total energy captured there are two scenarios used in this study including the farms with energy yield earray 5 mw small size and 5 mw earray 30 mw medium size for large scale farms earray 30 mw it is unsatisfactory due to the limitations of the seabed and terrain features in the uldolmok strait according to the turbine characteristics and device installation constraints as listed in tables 2 and 3 respectively six scenarios for the small scale tidal farm layouts were designed including three centered layouts as shown in fig 12a to c and three staggered layouts fig 12d to f efforts were made to minimize the period needed for testing each design to ensure that an optimum configuration for a tidal array layout was found tables 4 and 5 illustrate array design configurations for all simulation cases in this study as recommended by myers et al 2005 the most favorable lateral and longitudinal distances between two adjacent turbines in an array are 3d and 15d respectively however for the complexity of some real sites terrain this suggestion can be reconsidered to ensure the feasibility of the whole project indeed the uldolmok strait is a highlighted instance for this reason the spacing between two adjacent devices within the farm was chosen to maintain a minimum spacing from 2 5d laterally and 10d longitudinally so that none of the turbines were placed near the wake of an upstream device as shown in fig 11 the turbines are placed perpendicular to the tidal flow direction for the medium scale farm six array configurations were proposed consisting of 18 36 and 48 turbines with the same design parameters of the small scale farms except the minimum lateral spacing and longitudinal spacing of 2d and 5d between two adjacent turbines respectively instead of 2 5d and 10d as inputted for the small scale farms this selection is based on the geographical features of the uldolmok strait as mentioned above to solve to the problem of wake interactions between turbines in the tidal array this paper utilizes a park model jensen et al 1986 jensen 1983 for determining the wake deficit and its effects on the downstream turbines expressed by a factor called wake decay constant a detailed assessment of this factor s value and a comparison of the tidal array performance between the park and eddy viscosity models were analyzed by nguyen et al 2017 in the present study the park model was selected for the wake prediction because it has been commonly used since the 1980s and is simple robust and rather accurate in the case of calculating the wake losses on an annual energy yield alfredo et al 2016 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of energy absorption 4 1 1 for the small scale array layouts in this study an energy yield calculation was used to estimate the power output of devices installed in a particular area in the uldolmok strait with known flow characteristics and mapped bathymetry data this energy yield calculation can be used to obtain estimates for an idealized energy calculation spatial variability across a site and adverse impacts of wake flow increases in speed and net energy yield for all the tidal turbines within a farm were used to evaluate the energy yield capability of a tidal farm energy yield due to increases in speed was considered as gross energy which is the sum of the energy yield of all turbines without wake effects on the contrary net energy yield can be considered as a wake energy yield including the impact of wake effects on tidal power generation fig 13 fig 14 compares the net energy yields calculated from all array layouts between centered and staggered formations the horizontal axis shows the layout indices from layouts a to c for both centered and staggered configurations as seen in fig 14 it is evident that staggered arrangements show a higher efficiency for tidal energy extraction than centered ones in all cases of tidal array layouts differences in the net energy yield between the two configurations throughout layouts a to c were about 5 3 8 and 7 1 respectively it can be concluded that centered formations produce smaller energy yields than staggered designs because the turbines deployed in a centered arrangement may suffer increased energy losses due to wake effects by upstream devices an analysis of energy yield losses owing to wake effects was conducted and is illustrated in fig 15 moreover the relative superiority of annual energy yield from a staggered formation may be derived from the deployment of turbines benefited by high tidal energy density at the narrowest area in uldolmok as illustrated in fig 5 of the tidal energy resource assessment the narrowest part of the uldolmok strait has much higher energy density than other locations therefore turbines deployed to this area will harness more tidal current energy as well in this case to form staggered arrangements turbines no 1 and no 5 in the first row of layout b and turbines no 3 and no 7 in the first row of layout c were positioned closer to the highest energy density site thus in addition to lower energy yield losses from wake effects these turbines in the staggered arrangement generated more power than those in the centered layout the energy losses will be discussed further in the turbines wake interaction analysis fig 15 compares total energy yield losses due to wake effects and device installation constraints among all array configurations this loss has been calculated depending on net energy yield or wake energy yield for all turbines in the tidal farm and gross energy yield without wake effects as seen in fig 15 the arrangement of tidal turbines in centered layouts causes higher power losses than in staggered designs the maximum energy loss for staggered layout a with four turbines was about 2 1 of the total annual energy yield achieved by this farm corresponding to an approximately four times smaller loss than that of centered layout a with the same number of turbines it can be said that centered layout a showed the lowest performance in this study since it has the highest energy losses due to wake effects the discrepancy in energy production of layouts b and c was 3 41 and 1 93 respectively this also means that when deploying more turbines the energy losses induced by wake effects in staggered arrangements were slightly smaller than those of centered designs were in general the efficiency of power extraction by different array configurations can also be evaluated based on the average unit extractable power per turbine fig 16 shows a comparison of net energy yield per device due to wake effects among all array layout configurations it can be concluded that the average unit extractable power output of staggered arrangements is slightly higher than that of centered arrays the results also indicate that staggered layout b with six turbines shows a greater unit extractable power than others however it can be seen in figs 14 16 that the annual energy yield of layout c in staggered formation is about 2 and 1 6 times higher than that of layouts a and b respectively although energy losses due to wake effects in this arrangement are greater than others in other words the design with eight turbines can be regarded as better than other formations when considering optimization of energy yield for the small scale farms in uldolmok this design can produce high tidal energy extraction with a high density of tidal stream devices table 6 shows a comparison of individual turbines performance energy yield gwh yr in layout b with 6 turbines between the centered and staggered configurations as shown in fig 12 the turbines no 1 no 4 and no 5 of the centered layout b are positioned in the same coordinates as the turbines no 1 no 3 and no 5 of the staggered layout b respectively the results indicate that the individual turbines performance in the staggered is over 40 increase in net energy yield compared to the turbines located in the same position in the centered layout the reason is that the turbines in the staggered layout in this case are benefited by small effects of wake developments from the upstream turbines in both flood and ebb tides 4 1 2 for the medium scale array layouts fig 17 shows a comparison of the annual gross and net energy yields between the centered and staggered formations for the medium scale farms the statistical data from fig 17 indicates that the gross energy yield of the centered layouts is almost similar to that of the staggered arrangements it means that the locations of the tidal turbines within both the centered and staggered layouts have the same tidal energy resources besides that the net energy produced by the layout d is identical between the centered and staggered formations nevertheless in the cases of the layouts e and f the net energy yield of the centered configurations is about 3 gwh yr lower than that of the staggered formations in other words it is inferred that the wake flows of the upstream turbines impact on the downstream turbines in the centered layouts much more than those in the staggered designs concerning the energy losses in fig 18 the arrangement of tidal turbines in the centered layouts causes higher losses of power production than that in the staggered designs in most cases especially when deploying more turbines in the uldolmok strait the maximum energy losses of the centered 48 turbine farm are up to 35 3 of the total annual energy yield achieved by this farm corresponding to approximately 1 4 and 1 1 times higher than that of the centered 18 turbine and 36 turbine layouts respectively as well fig 19 shows that the energy yields extracted per device of the layouts e and f are much lower than that of the layout d in brief the layout d with 18 turbines installed in centered and staggered formations can be seen as the most effective configuration for the medium scale farms in the uldolmok strait 4 2 analysis of the turbines wake interactions an analysis of the wake interactions of all the turbines in the array scale was carried out for the layouts a b c and f as shown in figs 20 23 looking at the wake visualizations it is clearly seen that the wakes induced by the upstream turbines of the centered formation from the layout a to layout f superimpose on the downstream turbines especially in the farms with a larger number of turbines this phenomenon results in poor energy production of the downstream turbines in other words the total energy captured by the centered layouts in this case would be remarkably decreased on the contrary for the staggered layouts the effects of the upstream turbines wake on the downstream devices are virtually avoided it interprets the higher energy yield of the staggered layouts compared to the centered layouts as analyzed in section 4 1 above also seen from visualizations of wake prediction in figs 20 23 it is obvious that the turbines wake in ebb tides has more curved shapes than that in flood tides this feature is partly caused by the hydrodynamic characteristics of the tidal stream in the uldolmok strait as featured by kang et al 2012 along with the relatively complicated bathymetry topography solving the problem of layout optimization of the tidal array in the uldolmok strait could be more difficult without considering the wake interactions between turbines indeed the analytical method as presented in this paper supports appreciably the optimization process of the tidal array configurations by means of reducing the time in finding positions of the downstream turbine to avoid the wakes of the upstream turbines as a result the energy production of the array would be maximized relating to the medium scale farms including 48 turbines in fig 23 it shows that the superimposition of the upstream wake flows on the downstream turbines is much visibly stronger than that in the case of the small scale farms comparing the extractable power per device gwh yr the layout f with 48 turbines is about 30 and 38 lower than the layout a with 4 turbines and the layout c with eight turbines respectively in other words with a large number of turbines deployed in the uldolmok strait the energy losses caused by the wake effects can be evaluated as a noteworthy problem of optimizing the tidal array layout in the uldolmok strait because the structural loads on the turbine blades increases the fatigue life of the turbines would be noticeably decreased consequently the capital cost of the tidal project increases due to expansions of the operation and maintenance costs moreover environmental problems sediment transports marine life in this area are significantly affected as well for those reasons when considering the layout optimization of tidal arrays in the uldolmok strait the small scale farms could be the most satisfactory selection to obtain visualizations of accurate wake interactions between turbines and total power extracted in tidal farms as presented above the inputted data for the energy yield calculation tool should be carefully considered it means that the reliability and accuracy of the flow characteristics including tidal speed variations turbulence intensity and power law values and turbine specification data affected significantly the results of the tidal farming optimization therefore it can be seen that the preparation of inputted data and the optimization process of the approach used in this paper were relatively more complicated than other methods that analyzed fully calculations of turbine performance and flow field interactions around the turbines in addition the method showed the improvement of tidal array performance energy yield by manually changing the positions of turbines on the farm it can be said that the optimization of tidal farms in this paper required much experience and the intuitional selection of turbine location was difficult to form better configurations of the tidal farms consequently the optimization process could be time consuming such a manual manner of array optimization could also be considered as a drawback of the method used in this study however the purpose of the numerical tool in the paper is to provide the tidal stream energy industry with a comprehensive and definitive detailed assessment of the potential energy capture of tidal arrays within the geometric and environmental constraints of the site by combining the characteristics of tidal energy devices to be placed within the array the resource at the site in terms of a temporal and spatial flow field and other site specific characteristics which may impact on device interactions the optimization approach of the present study could give a comprehensive and definitive detailed assessment of the potential energy capture of tidal arrays 5 conclusions in this paper to study the effect of different turbine array configurations on extractable tidal energy at a real site a fine unstructured grid hydrodynamic model combined with an array planning and analysis tool was applied to the uldolmok strait south korea conclusions are given as follows 1 the current analytical method used supports appreciably the optimization process of the tidal array configurations by means of reducing the time in finding positions of the downstream turbine to avoid the wakes of the upstream turbines as a result the energy production of the array would be maximized 2 staggered array layouts show a greater performance for tidal energy extraction than the centered arrangements as they produce higher annual energy yield lower energy losses due to wake effects and higher unit extractable power than the centered formations 3 array configuration with 48 turbines is least efficient for tidal farming as it suffers the highest energy losses in comparison with other designs 4 when considering optimization of the energy yield and cost of energy for tidal farming the small scale farm could be the most satisfactory selection because it ensures the capital cost of the entire tidal project as well as minimizes the negative effects on the marine environments in the uldolmok strait declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this work was supported by a part of the project

22242,this paper presents a quantitative method for evaluating tidal energy extraction in uldolmok strait located in the southwestern part of the korean peninsula which is well known for having an impressively fast tidal current speed up to 6 m s the advantages of this method are expressed by maximizing the power captured by all the turbines deployed in a tidal farm and by optimizing the array layout size with twelve different configurations the energy yield of the proposed designs is evaluated based on flow data for the hydrodynamic model used impacts of sea depth device installation constraints and wake effects between the turbines on the farm the results show that staggered layouts achieve higher efficiency for energy extraction than centered arrangements in all cases moreover an array configuration with 48 turbines is least efficient for tidal farming as it suffers the highest energy losses caused by the wake effects in comparison with other designs when considering the optimum energy yield and cost of energy for tidal farming the small scale farm could be the most satisfactory selection because it ensures the capital cost of the entire tidal project as well as minimizes the negative effects on the marine environments in uldolmok keywords uldolmok strait tidal array optimization wake interactions tidal current turbines 1 introduction recently the demand for new renewable energy sources has been rising due to growing concerns about climate change a global reduction in greenhouse effects and dependence on fossil fuels from human power consumption among the new renewable energy sources tidal power has many advantages because of its higher energy density and reliability which makes it highly attractive from a grid management perspective for renewable electricity production tidal turbines are a competitive and promising option due to the increasing cost of energy however any projects of tidal farms installed with many tidal energy converters tec must be considered carefully especially minimizing the costs of turbine installation and subsea cabling moreover the optimization of tidal turbine arrangement on a farm to obtain the highest tidal energy extraction is a complicated and challenging process where to deploy the tidal turbines within a real site and how to optimize a tidal farm performance should be considered carefully in other words finding an ideal layout is crucial because it could considerably affect the amount of energy captured and determine the economic feasibility of a tidal project due to the difficulties in installing the observation equipment inside the real tidal farms carrying out an evaluation of the effectiveness of these farms using the scaled down models in the experimental flumes or numerical methods could be seen as a feasible solution myers et al 2005a 2005b and mycek et al 2014a 2014b have conducted several scaled experimental tests this assessment approach of tidal array performance in the experimental flumes has highlighted advantages such as relatively accurate replication of fluid turbine interaction and the ambient turbulence intensity effect on the stream turbines in the layout nevertheless testing the tidal stream array in the flumes exists several limitations on the quantity of the turbines installed and the reynolds number resemblance ottavio et al 2016 the numerical method or computational fluid dynamics cfd is a substitutive solution in this case kolekar et al 2015 goundar et al 2013 lee et al 2012 jo et al 2010 building the tidal turbines based on blade element momentum theory bemt or actual disk theory adt can be evaluated as initially common methods for the purpose of tidal farm optimization whelan et al 2009 masters et al 2011 harrison et al 2010 malki et al 2014 bai et al 2013 hunter et al 2015 it can be said that these methods have not fully considered other important factors of the surrounding environment especially the variation of tidal flow direction water surface elevation or complexity of seabed topography therefore the researchers have been developing and applying other tools to the tidal farming process to give more comprehensive and efficient assessments a few quantitative studies which have similar approaches to the wind farm applications javier et al 2010 chen et al 2013 pillai et al 2017 have aimed to investigate ideal array layouts for the greatest power generation for example a study has been conducted using telemac for a tidal current turbine farm in paimpol bréhat pham et al 2009 this project optimized layouts based on different constraints such as the natural conditions of the site uneven beds and water flow sea surface and ground clearance features the spacing between devices and tidal current direction however the study did not mention losses in tidal energy extraction due to wake effects in the proposed array layouts there has also been a study done on energy extraction via tidal turbines in an idealized channel implemented in the regional ocean modeling system roms by thyng et al 2013 this study s methodology allowed to produce a more realistic result and assessed the impact of tidal turbines on the hydrographical system however the power assessment methodologies used mainly focused on turbine effects on flow features and site characterization without performing a detailed evaluation of the energy yield of the proposed arrays to optimize power extraction besides that funke et al 2014 carried out a study on tidal array layout optimization using an adjoint approach in their work configurations for tidal turbine farms were formulated as optimization problems constrained by partial differential equations describing the flow however tidal layout optimization using gradient based adjoint models can be difficult due to complexity as they involve differentiating to find the solution of a partial differential equation martin et al 2018 have investigated the flow characteristics of tidal turbine arrays using a three dimensional openfoam model the wake formations of all the turbines in the tidal arrays have well constructed in this study however further improvements of the wake characteristic prediction are required in summary each method to simulate the tidal array layouts and optimize the power generation of the tidal farm as mentioned above has its own strong points and existing drawbacks so far however those studies have considerably contributed to the development of tidal energy harvest in the future uldolmok strait is famous for its strong tidal flows with a maximum current speed of over 6 m s measured using adcp since 2002 by kang et al 2006 byun et al 2013 have also evaluated uldolmok as one of the highest annual energy density sites in the southwestern part of the korean peninsula according to the results of a study on tidal current energy resource estimates this channel is located between jindo island and haenam county in addition the uldolmok strait has an average depth of 15 20 m and the width of the narrowest part is about 250 m lee et al 2009 as shown in fig 1 in this paper we present a numerical method for optimizing turbine arrangement within the tidal farms of uldolmok and maximizing power extraction of tidal turbines in an array configuration based on a finite element coastal ocean model that provides tidal currents across sites twelve different designs for tidal farm layouts including six centered and six staggered formations have been constructed based on tidal device installation constraints tidal device characteristics ambient turbulence intensities and power laws via a reference location tidal stream speed and direction and water depth in this study for tidal array layout optimization in uldolmok a large number of layout configurations with different numbers of turbines have been designed and tested the array designs presented are the most typical patterns selected to compare tidal energy extraction annual energy yield is used to evaluate the power output extracted from the turbines in the tidal farms energy yield also takes into account energy loss due to wake effects which helps evaluate more accurately the annual energy yield of the various array layouts the energy yield of the selected array designs has been compared so that an optimal tidal array configuration for the uldolmok strait can be found 2 optimization process in this study a comprehensive assessment of tidal farming optimization for the uldolmok strait has been carried out using commercial code software tidalfarmer which is an array planning and analysis tool used to predict the energy capture of a turbine array the power generation prediction for a tidal farm is derived by evaluating turbines interactions and the potential effect an array layout will have on energy yield this evaluation has been achieved through the development of rationalized modeling methods which involves reducing incredibly complex interactions between tidal turbines and the surrounding flow field into a series of distinct physical processes namely coastal basin array scale and device scale that can be simplified and modeled fig 2 diagrams the energy yield analysis used to optimize tidal farming total array energy extracted is the sum of all individual turbines nguyen et al 2016 and expressed as follows 1 e a r r a y k 1 n d i r i 1 n v j 1 n t p i k j f i k where e array is the total energy output extracted by the farm definitions of the remaining terms in equation 1 are interpreted as below p i k j is the average power output f ik is the frequency of occurrence of the power output in the specified period j is a turbine index n t is the total number of turbines in the farm i is a tidal stream velocity index concerning the speed bin for example 1 5 m s under consideration n v is the total number of tidal speeds in the long term flow velocity distribution for each flow direction k is a flow direction index n dir is the total number of flow speed directions as depicted in fig 2 a two dimensional depth averaged flow field extracted from the tidal modeling model has been being extrapolated to generate a model with a three dimensional flow field this model has been designed in the frequency region through a binning process by adding the tidal flow field results from a hydrodynamic model into speed bins the simulation process of a tidal farming optimization used in this paper is similar to that presented by nguyen et al 2016 for tidal farming in jangjuk channel south korea after interpolating the 3 d flow field a combination of several important input parameters is executed such as the incident flow characteristics ambient turbulence intensity boundary layer height tidal flow speeds and direction during flood tides and ebb tides and wake prediction models in order to correlate the spatial variability of the flow speed across a site with the long term frequency distribution to perform an energy yield calculation the long term resource data must be added the long term resource data or long term reference points contains the speed bin centers the bin widths and then a list of the probability frequency for each direction and flow speed bin this probability for all directions and all speed bins sums to unity the ambient flow for a tidal stream is considered as turbulent therefore the eddy viscosity in the wake cannot be wholly described by the shear contribution and an ambient term is required ambient turbulence intensity this could be the rotor averaged or swept area turbulence intensity or the average turbulence over a multiple of the rotor diameter then information on the turbine characteristics every turbine s coordinates and installation constraints of these turbines considering a reduction of grid connection costs and negative interactions between the turbines in a specific array design should be added finally an energy yield extracted from all the turbines will be obtained throughout this process by analyzing the energy production the researchers and the project s investors could evaluate the array performance of the present arrangement which is effective or not this optimization process can be viewed as a fairly comprehensive approach to serving the tidal projects currently when analyzing energy yield production of the tidal arrays two main energy calculations for layout optimization were performed to allow for assessment of the efficiency of the proposed array layout designs including gross and net energy yield calculations the former was considered in a scenario where all turbines experienced bathymetry induced local speed changes without the upstream turbines wake effect the latter was calculated in the same situation adding the effect of wake losses there are three models included in the tidalfarmer tool in order to resolve the wake deficits downstream of operational devices these are the park model two dimensional 2 d eddy viscosity model three dimensional 3 d eddy viscosity model the eddy viscosity wake model is a calculation of the velocity deficit field using a finite difference solution to the thin shear layer equations of the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations in axisymmetric coordinates in the case of the 3 d eddy viscosity model the non axisymmetric development of a turbine wake makes it unfeasible to use a cylindrical coordinate system instead a cartesian coordinate system is proposed in this study the park model developed by jensen et al 1986 has been used to simulate wake effects which provides a semi empirical description of wake flow on the assumption that a wake is axisymmetric and unbounded the development of wakes was influenced by free stream conditions as well as interactions with other turbine wakes within the flow field in addition there were two other calculations for energy yield assessment including baseline energy yield and net energy yield with wake and blockage effects baseline energy yield was predicted for all turbines experiencing the same flow regime as at the reference location where power weighted speed was calculated using input power law profiles for net energy with wake and blockage effects all turbines within the site experienced bathymetry inducing local speed changes where wake losses were calculated and local blockage effects were modeled admittedly maximizing the energy yield of a particular tidal farm was a visible challenge while still ensuring the optimization of the cost of energy hence the aim of this quantitative method was to produce results that feed directly into calculations for the cost of energy optimization key assumptions and limitations of the numerical model consist of the thrust coefficient and wake decay rate are suitable parameters that can be used to determine the recovery rate of the centreline flow speed park model assumes axial symmetry of the wake however the wake flow will transition to a shallow water wake the blockage effect can be modeled purely by an increase in thrust and power coefficient and is achieved through the use of the blockage model the initial velocity deficit at the start of the far wake position is a function of the thrust coefficient and turbulence intensity the flowing shape at the near wake boundary can be approximated by a gaussian curve the current assumptions made within the numerical tool used in this research imply that the effect of energy extraction on the global flow is small and does not significantly alter the 2 d bathymetry driven flow field effectively this assumes that the momentum extracted by each turbine is small in comparison to the energy in the surrounding flow there will be a reduction in the momentum due to the extraction of energy and thus a resulting drop in free surface elevation downstream to accommodate this extraction however on a micro scale the energy extracted by the turbine will be replenished from the across stream flow and the effect on the downstream flow will be small 3 input data and setup parameters 3 1 pre processing site specific tidal prediction the requirements for site specific tidal flow field prediction include two modeling methods long term prediction of the temporal variation in tidal flow at the site and a model for spatial variation of flow pre processing methods were used to convert the results from a flow solver into spatial flow fields for each flow state these were then analyzed to calculate the resulting energy yield it was assumed that the momentum extracted was solely due to the energy extraction of the devices and not blockage effects that may have diverted flow upstream for small arrays it has been shown that this assumption is valid for larger arrays it may have been necessary to reduce the mass flux through the array to capture the two scale mixing problem 3 1 1 tidal modeling to investigate the characteristics of the tide and tidal current depth averaged numerical modeling two dimensional tidal modeling using an adcirc model was constructed around the uldolmok strait tidal currents in this area are extremely high because of the narrow channel width and relatively shallow depth tidal amplitudes of the dominant principal semi diurnal tide m2 and principal diurnal tide k1 in uldolmok have an average of 1 2 m and 0 31 m respectively as observed by kang et al 2012 and yum et al 2003 the maximum tidal range can be as large as approximately 4 m a fine unstructured grid resolution was used for the hydrodynamic model with element size varying from 20 m at the narrowest part of the channel to 100 m for sections near the ocean as shown in fig 3 the hydrodynamic model used consists of about 95 000 elements and 50 000 nodes in the horizontal plane bottom friction and a friction factor increase were set to 0 004 and 0 3333 respectively the wave continuity coefficient was set to 0 005 and a value for the lateral viscosity of 4 m2 s was used an open boundary condition for the model was specified near the uldolmok strait using eight harmonic tidal constituents k 1 m 2 n 2 o 1 s 2 p 1 q 1 and k 2 river inflows as well as density induced and wind driven currents were not considered in this study tidal modeling data for the uldolmok strait was validated against observations over one month a comparison of depth averaged current speed in the adcp data observed in 2002 by kang et al 2006 at t1 and calculations from the present study is illustrated in fig 4 other comparisons of depth averaged current speeds and tidal ranges for validation between the numerical results of the present study and the observed data were carried out however they are not shown in this paper 3 1 2 time series tidal energy resource calculation this resource calculation determined kinetic energy flux across the site as predicted using the current speed in a hydrodynamic model then these results indicated the best tidal energy resource when considering the position of the given tidal stream energy farm carballo et al 2009 and blunden et al 2006 presented a function of energy density ed wh m2 over a specified period t 2 e d 0 t p d d t where p d is power density w of a tidal stream representing the kinetic energy flux per unit square meter fig 5 shows the time series energy density map for the uldolmok strait based on equation 2 the results show that the highest energy density is concentrated near the narrowest part with over 40 kw m2 3 1 3 flow field data flow fields relate three dimensional currents through the array which are essential for tidal farming optimization in the uldolmok strait input data included long term resources and observed power law and turbulence intensity profiles many studies have been conducted using different power laws due to the impact of seabed surface roughness such as the 1 7th power law 1 10th power law and logarithm power law harrison et al 2010 tidal flow characteristics at uldolmok strait were investigated by ko et al 2017 the tidal current data were measured using an acoustic doppler current profiler model whws adcp 600 khz according to conclusions of that research the power law exponent n of tidal current was approximately 9 3 during ebb and 10 75 during the flood as shown in fig 7 in order to extrapolate a depth averaged flow field model into three dimensions the power law and turbulence intensity at different flow speed values are required the turbulence intensity input is a depth averaged value for each direction and flow speed value the approach adopted for the turbulence intensity parameters is to divide the depth averaged current speed by the flow profile through the vertical and then multiply by the turbulence intensity this gives a profile that mimics the turbulence intensity profile observed at real sites table 1 presents a summary of turbulence intensity inputs for the tidalfarmer based on the data collected by ko et al 2017 long term resource information and the tidal ellipse at a long term reference point are shown in fig 6 along the uldolmok strait the tidal rise is almost symmetric in terms of magnitude and direction the flow is bi directional with two main directions around 135 clockwise from the north during ebb tides i e south east and around 315 during high tides i e north west which means ebb and flood states produce nearly opposite angles in addition the numerical model showed that velocity was not uniform over the zone and can vary a great deal within distances of only hundreds of meters 3 2 array design and turbine installation constraints 3 2 1 tidal stream device parameters these variables describe a single tidal stream device which can be of arbitrary definition the parameters consist of the device geometry such as hub height rotor diameter as well as performance due to the limitations on the complexity of bathymetry as mentioned in above the averaged water depth is about 15 20 m while considering the viability of a tidal farming project a turbine with a 0 5 mw power output scale was used and device geometry parameters were set as shown in table 2 the turbine with three blades using s814 foil fig 8 was designed based on bemt blade element momentum theory and developed by the authors at the ocean fluid machinery lab of mokpo national maritime university the turbine was numerically tested at various tsrs tip speed ratio and compared to other models fig 8a conducted by bahaj et al 2007 tian et al 2016 and hu et al 2017 for this purpose a commercial cfd code ansys 17 0 was used fig 9 illustrates a comparison of power coefficient power output and torque between the authors design and other studies in general the present model showed a similar trend of power coefficient cp compared with the others more specifically the cp curve rises up quickly from tsr 3 the highest cp was obtained at tsr 5 about 43 corresponding to 530 kw power output fig 9b after that the cp curve falls down gradually up to tsr 9 3 2 2 device installation constraints device installation conditions defined the primary constraints such that deployment of tidal stream energy converters was realistic when considering the expected energy yield of a layout as described in fig 10 the planning area for turbine installation has a relatively small width about 60 m thus the number of turbines deployed in the lateral direction is a maximum of four when the lateral spacing is fixed at 2d d is a rotor diameter with this respect minimum lateral spacing is set between 2 and 2 5d if a device violated a constraint check it was eliminated for the energy yield calculation table 3 shows the device installation constraints used for this study the minimum lateral and longitudinal distances will be applied to a fixed value depending on tidal farm sizes 3 2 3 array layout configurations regarding the tidal farm size based on the total energy captured there are two scenarios used in this study including the farms with energy yield earray 5 mw small size and 5 mw earray 30 mw medium size for large scale farms earray 30 mw it is unsatisfactory due to the limitations of the seabed and terrain features in the uldolmok strait according to the turbine characteristics and device installation constraints as listed in tables 2 and 3 respectively six scenarios for the small scale tidal farm layouts were designed including three centered layouts as shown in fig 12a to c and three staggered layouts fig 12d to f efforts were made to minimize the period needed for testing each design to ensure that an optimum configuration for a tidal array layout was found tables 4 and 5 illustrate array design configurations for all simulation cases in this study as recommended by myers et al 2005 the most favorable lateral and longitudinal distances between two adjacent turbines in an array are 3d and 15d respectively however for the complexity of some real sites terrain this suggestion can be reconsidered to ensure the feasibility of the whole project indeed the uldolmok strait is a highlighted instance for this reason the spacing between two adjacent devices within the farm was chosen to maintain a minimum spacing from 2 5d laterally and 10d longitudinally so that none of the turbines were placed near the wake of an upstream device as shown in fig 11 the turbines are placed perpendicular to the tidal flow direction for the medium scale farm six array configurations were proposed consisting of 18 36 and 48 turbines with the same design parameters of the small scale farms except the minimum lateral spacing and longitudinal spacing of 2d and 5d between two adjacent turbines respectively instead of 2 5d and 10d as inputted for the small scale farms this selection is based on the geographical features of the uldolmok strait as mentioned above to solve to the problem of wake interactions between turbines in the tidal array this paper utilizes a park model jensen et al 1986 jensen 1983 for determining the wake deficit and its effects on the downstream turbines expressed by a factor called wake decay constant a detailed assessment of this factor s value and a comparison of the tidal array performance between the park and eddy viscosity models were analyzed by nguyen et al 2017 in the present study the park model was selected for the wake prediction because it has been commonly used since the 1980s and is simple robust and rather accurate in the case of calculating the wake losses on an annual energy yield alfredo et al 2016 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of energy absorption 4 1 1 for the small scale array layouts in this study an energy yield calculation was used to estimate the power output of devices installed in a particular area in the uldolmok strait with known flow characteristics and mapped bathymetry data this energy yield calculation can be used to obtain estimates for an idealized energy calculation spatial variability across a site and adverse impacts of wake flow increases in speed and net energy yield for all the tidal turbines within a farm were used to evaluate the energy yield capability of a tidal farm energy yield due to increases in speed was considered as gross energy which is the sum of the energy yield of all turbines without wake effects on the contrary net energy yield can be considered as a wake energy yield including the impact of wake effects on tidal power generation fig 13 fig 14 compares the net energy yields calculated from all array layouts between centered and staggered formations the horizontal axis shows the layout indices from layouts a to c for both centered and staggered configurations as seen in fig 14 it is evident that staggered arrangements show a higher efficiency for tidal energy extraction than centered ones in all cases of tidal array layouts differences in the net energy yield between the two configurations throughout layouts a to c were about 5 3 8 and 7 1 respectively it can be concluded that centered formations produce smaller energy yields than staggered designs because the turbines deployed in a centered arrangement may suffer increased energy losses due to wake effects by upstream devices an analysis of energy yield losses owing to wake effects was conducted and is illustrated in fig 15 moreover the relative superiority of annual energy yield from a staggered formation may be derived from the deployment of turbines benefited by high tidal energy density at the narrowest area in uldolmok as illustrated in fig 5 of the tidal energy resource assessment the narrowest part of the uldolmok strait has much higher energy density than other locations therefore turbines deployed to this area will harness more tidal current energy as well in this case to form staggered arrangements turbines no 1 and no 5 in the first row of layout b and turbines no 3 and no 7 in the first row of layout c were positioned closer to the highest energy density site thus in addition to lower energy yield losses from wake effects these turbines in the staggered arrangement generated more power than those in the centered layout the energy losses will be discussed further in the turbines wake interaction analysis fig 15 compares total energy yield losses due to wake effects and device installation constraints among all array configurations this loss has been calculated depending on net energy yield or wake energy yield for all turbines in the tidal farm and gross energy yield without wake effects as seen in fig 15 the arrangement of tidal turbines in centered layouts causes higher power losses than in staggered designs the maximum energy loss for staggered layout a with four turbines was about 2 1 of the total annual energy yield achieved by this farm corresponding to an approximately four times smaller loss than that of centered layout a with the same number of turbines it can be said that centered layout a showed the lowest performance in this study since it has the highest energy losses due to wake effects the discrepancy in energy production of layouts b and c was 3 41 and 1 93 respectively this also means that when deploying more turbines the energy losses induced by wake effects in staggered arrangements were slightly smaller than those of centered designs were in general the efficiency of power extraction by different array configurations can also be evaluated based on the average unit extractable power per turbine fig 16 shows a comparison of net energy yield per device due to wake effects among all array layout configurations it can be concluded that the average unit extractable power output of staggered arrangements is slightly higher than that of centered arrays the results also indicate that staggered layout b with six turbines shows a greater unit extractable power than others however it can be seen in figs 14 16 that the annual energy yield of layout c in staggered formation is about 2 and 1 6 times higher than that of layouts a and b respectively although energy losses due to wake effects in this arrangement are greater than others in other words the design with eight turbines can be regarded as better than other formations when considering optimization of energy yield for the small scale farms in uldolmok this design can produce high tidal energy extraction with a high density of tidal stream devices table 6 shows a comparison of individual turbines performance energy yield gwh yr in layout b with 6 turbines between the centered and staggered configurations as shown in fig 12 the turbines no 1 no 4 and no 5 of the centered layout b are positioned in the same coordinates as the turbines no 1 no 3 and no 5 of the staggered layout b respectively the results indicate that the individual turbines performance in the staggered is over 40 increase in net energy yield compared to the turbines located in the same position in the centered layout the reason is that the turbines in the staggered layout in this case are benefited by small effects of wake developments from the upstream turbines in both flood and ebb tides 4 1 2 for the medium scale array layouts fig 17 shows a comparison of the annual gross and net energy yields between the centered and staggered formations for the medium scale farms the statistical data from fig 17 indicates that the gross energy yield of the centered layouts is almost similar to that of the staggered arrangements it means that the locations of the tidal turbines within both the centered and staggered layouts have the same tidal energy resources besides that the net energy produced by the layout d is identical between the centered and staggered formations nevertheless in the cases of the layouts e and f the net energy yield of the centered configurations is about 3 gwh yr lower than that of the staggered formations in other words it is inferred that the wake flows of the upstream turbines impact on the downstream turbines in the centered layouts much more than those in the staggered designs concerning the energy losses in fig 18 the arrangement of tidal turbines in the centered layouts causes higher losses of power production than that in the staggered designs in most cases especially when deploying more turbines in the uldolmok strait the maximum energy losses of the centered 48 turbine farm are up to 35 3 of the total annual energy yield achieved by this farm corresponding to approximately 1 4 and 1 1 times higher than that of the centered 18 turbine and 36 turbine layouts respectively as well fig 19 shows that the energy yields extracted per device of the layouts e and f are much lower than that of the layout d in brief the layout d with 18 turbines installed in centered and staggered formations can be seen as the most effective configuration for the medium scale farms in the uldolmok strait 4 2 analysis of the turbines wake interactions an analysis of the wake interactions of all the turbines in the array scale was carried out for the layouts a b c and f as shown in figs 20 23 looking at the wake visualizations it is clearly seen that the wakes induced by the upstream turbines of the centered formation from the layout a to layout f superimpose on the downstream turbines especially in the farms with a larger number of turbines this phenomenon results in poor energy production of the downstream turbines in other words the total energy captured by the centered layouts in this case would be remarkably decreased on the contrary for the staggered layouts the effects of the upstream turbines wake on the downstream devices are virtually avoided it interprets the higher energy yield of the staggered layouts compared to the centered layouts as analyzed in section 4 1 above also seen from visualizations of wake prediction in figs 20 23 it is obvious that the turbines wake in ebb tides has more curved shapes than that in flood tides this feature is partly caused by the hydrodynamic characteristics of the tidal stream in the uldolmok strait as featured by kang et al 2012 along with the relatively complicated bathymetry topography solving the problem of layout optimization of the tidal array in the uldolmok strait could be more difficult without considering the wake interactions between turbines indeed the analytical method as presented in this paper supports appreciably the optimization process of the tidal array configurations by means of reducing the time in finding positions of the downstream turbine to avoid the wakes of the upstream turbines as a result the energy production of the array would be maximized relating to the medium scale farms including 48 turbines in fig 23 it shows that the superimposition of the upstream wake flows on the downstream turbines is much visibly stronger than that in the case of the small scale farms comparing the extractable power per device gwh yr the layout f with 48 turbines is about 30 and 38 lower than the layout a with 4 turbines and the layout c with eight turbines respectively in other words with a large number of turbines deployed in the uldolmok strait the energy losses caused by the wake effects can be evaluated as a noteworthy problem of optimizing the tidal array layout in the uldolmok strait because the structural loads on the turbine blades increases the fatigue life of the turbines would be noticeably decreased consequently the capital cost of the tidal project increases due to expansions of the operation and maintenance costs moreover environmental problems sediment transports marine life in this area are significantly affected as well for those reasons when considering the layout optimization of tidal arrays in the uldolmok strait the small scale farms could be the most satisfactory selection to obtain visualizations of accurate wake interactions between turbines and total power extracted in tidal farms as presented above the inputted data for the energy yield calculation tool should be carefully considered it means that the reliability and accuracy of the flow characteristics including tidal speed variations turbulence intensity and power law values and turbine specification data affected significantly the results of the tidal farming optimization therefore it can be seen that the preparation of inputted data and the optimization process of the approach used in this paper were relatively more complicated than other methods that analyzed fully calculations of turbine performance and flow field interactions around the turbines in addition the method showed the improvement of tidal array performance energy yield by manually changing the positions of turbines on the farm it can be said that the optimization of tidal farms in this paper required much experience and the intuitional selection of turbine location was difficult to form better configurations of the tidal farms consequently the optimization process could be time consuming such a manual manner of array optimization could also be considered as a drawback of the method used in this study however the purpose of the numerical tool in the paper is to provide the tidal stream energy industry with a comprehensive and definitive detailed assessment of the potential energy capture of tidal arrays within the geometric and environmental constraints of the site by combining the characteristics of tidal energy devices to be placed within the array the resource at the site in terms of a temporal and spatial flow field and other site specific characteristics which may impact on device interactions the optimization approach of the present study could give a comprehensive and definitive detailed assessment of the potential energy capture of tidal arrays 5 conclusions in this paper to study the effect of different turbine array configurations on extractable tidal energy at a real site a fine unstructured grid hydrodynamic model combined with an array planning and analysis tool was applied to the uldolmok strait south korea conclusions are given as follows 1 the current analytical method used supports appreciably the optimization process of the tidal array configurations by means of reducing the time in finding positions of the downstream turbine to avoid the wakes of the upstream turbines as a result the energy production of the array would be maximized 2 staggered array layouts show a greater performance for tidal energy extraction than the centered arrangements as they produce higher annual energy yield lower energy losses due to wake effects and higher unit extractable power than the centered formations 3 array configuration with 48 turbines is least efficient for tidal farming as it suffers the highest energy losses in comparison with other designs 4 when considering optimization of the energy yield and cost of energy for tidal farming the small scale farm could be the most satisfactory selection because it ensures the capital cost of the entire tidal project as well as minimizes the negative effects on the marine environments in the uldolmok strait declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

22243,this article focuses on the use of an artificial neural network to estimate added resistance in regular head waves while using ship design parameters such as length breadth draught or froude number in order to create a reliable model only experimental data determined through model test measurements was used to train the neural network this study showed that added wave resistance values predicted by the neural network soundly correlated with measured data and had good generalization ability the developed neural network was presented in the form of mathematical function this article presents examples of the use of this function to calculate added wave resistance functions presented here could have practical application in ship resistance analysis at the preliminary design stage keywords ship design added resistance artificial neural network preliminary design approximation model tests head waves 1 introduction a ship is designed in many stages such as concept design preliminary design contract design and detailed design the hull line plan ship general arrangement and propulsion system are conceptualised at the preliminary design stage chądzyński 2001 with this design stage consisting of parametric and geometric design phases watson 1998 rawson and tupper 2001 papanikolaou 2014 argue that the purpose of the parametric design is among others to estimate main propulsion and powering parameters in order to accurately estimate these parameters expert knowledge relating to total hull resistance is required it was also noted arribas and pérez 2007 papanikolaou 2014 that total hull resistance includes added wave resistance which is connected with ship seaway in storm waves can contribute to around 30 50 of total ship resistance can lead to a remarkable drop in operating speed depends on among other factors hull dimension and shape added wave resistance can be determined through model test measurements or far or near field numerical methods far field methods are most often based on momentum conservation theory maruo 1960 joosen 1966 and newman 1967 and the radiated energy approach gerritsma and beukelman 1972 near field numerical methods are based on pressure integration over a wetted hull surface and include approaches developed by fujii and takahashi 1975 salvesen 1978 faltinsen et al 1980 joncquez et al 2008 kuroda et al 2008 and kim and kim 2011 kashiwagi 2009 found satisfactory results using an enhanced unified theory using a modified approach by maruo approximation methods based on semi empirical formulas were also used to estimate additional resistance the common methods are stawave 1 i stawave 2 that have been developed by the sea trial analysis joint industry project boom et al 2013 and implemented by the international towing tank conference in ittc 2017 the stawave 1 method estimates the added resistance of irregular waves caused by short head wave reflection which depends on the waterline shape in the bow region this method was developed for large ships with a high forward speed within trial conditions in mild waves the stawave 2 method was developed to approximate the transfer function of the added resistance in heading regular waves by using main ship characteristics the sea keeping model test results from 200 ships were utilised to develop this method the transfer function calculated by the use of stawave 2 takes the mean resistance increase due to wave reflection and the motion induced resistance ittc 2017 into account due to simple mathematical form and high accuracy both stawave methods are commonly used to estimate the added resistance and accuracy compare other methods liu and papanikolaou 2016a 2016b developed various simple semi empirical formulations for the rapid estimation of ship added resistance in head waves they considered the effect of ship hull form characteristics with best fitting from available experimental data for various types of hull forms liu et al 2016 further refined this research for simple use in engineering applications liu and papanikolaou 2019 extended their previously developed formulas for the approximation of added resistance at wider speed ranges and introduced a new parameter based on b t and investigated trim effect after conducting an extensive parametric study to capture the influence of draft on added resistance the author of this paper cepowski 2008 developed an approximation function for the estimation of an added wave resistance coefficient on the basis of containership design parameters the length between perpendiculars breadth ratio breadth draught ratio and block and waterline coefficient were taken into account as hull design parameters in this study recently the author cepowski 2016 applied an artificial neural network to predict added wave resistance transfer function for bulk carriers thought the use of waterplane area and coefficient as well as ship speed and regular wave frequency considering all of the above methods model tests were found to be the most reliable and accurate though model tests are both expensive and time consuming and also require a hull form computational fluid dynamics cfd methods are considered to be the most accurate calculation methods though these methods are also time consuming and require detailed hull form data alternatively approximation methods were found to be the least accurate but can be applied at the conceptual design stage where a detailed hull form is not available these methods can be also applied to multi criteria design parameter optimization using genetic algorithms due to their simple mathematical form the main disadvantages of approximation methods are that they are only applicable for conventional ships that have been tested and examined these methods cannot be applied in the case of innovative modern ship design the majority of the above methods are limited to resistance calculations for a head wave usually the mean added wave resistance is calculated by the use of a wave system according to the superposition principle then applying this principle an increase in the statistical mean resistance raw in irregular wave is calculated as 1 r aw 2 0 r ω s ζ ζ ω d ω where r aw statistical mean wave resistance increase r added resistance from the regular wave ω frequency s ζζ wave energy spectrum density function full scale added resistance due to waves r may be reduced to the non dimensional coefficient ρ aw by the following equation 2 c aw r ζ a 2 ρ g b 2 l where c aw non dimensional added wave resistance coefficient ζ a amplitude of a regular wave b ship breadth l ship length ρ seawater density g acceleration due to gravity a selection of main dimensions in the case of additional wave resistance is the most effective method in parametric design a body line plan is required to estimate the non dimensional added wave resistance coefficient through the use of model tests or numerical methods though an accurate estimate of the additional resistance of a ship at the parametric design can be problematic because the hull line plan is not developed at this stage therefore the aim of this research was to develop a simple accurate function to estimate the non dimensional added wave resistance coefficient by the use of the ship design parameters such as length breadth draught or froude number in order to discover a reliable model only measurement results through the use of model tests were used in this research in this study the estimation of added wave resistance was only limited to head waves 2

neural networks ann have been used in a number of scientific ship design theory publications abramowski 2013 applied artificial neural networks for the optimization of design parameters in cargo ships a mathematical model to determine the effective power of a ship was developed by the use of neural networks in this publication gurgen et al 2018 applied an artificial neural network to predict the main dimensions of chemical tankers main ship parameters such as overall length length between perpendiculars breadth draught and freeboard were etimated on the basis of deadweight and vessel speed in this paper gurgen et al 2018 argued that the initial main particulars of chemical tankers could be determined through the use of ann offering levels which were much more accurate than compared to sample ship data ekinci et al 2011 used 18 computational intelligence methods including neural network methods to estimate the main design parameters of oil chemical tankers in many scientific studies the use of artificial neural networks offers excellent results 3 artificial neural networks artificial neural network theory is based on the analysis of a biological nervous system a biological nervous structure consists of neurons and their connections a mathematical model of a neural network is created based on this structure and signal transmission this model was built from an input output and one or more hidden layers that consist of neurons haykin 1994 values from previous layers are passed through neurons x1 x2 xn in an artificial neuron which were connected with weights w1 w2 wn as followed and shown in fig 1 4 y φ i 0 n w i x i where x i input signal y neuron output signal w i weights w 0 bias φ activation function the sum result value was transmitted to the node output value by the use of an activation function a number of functions are often used as activation functions in the hidden layer and the output layer in this study the following activation function were used purelin where the neuron activation is passed on directly as the output 5 y x standard logistic function 6 y 1 1 exp x hyperbolic tangent 7 y exp a exp a exp a exp a after the learning process an artificial neural network maps the input vector x to resulting vector y 8 f x y the aim of the learning process is to calculate the weight value wi where the network response is consistent with the results weight w i are calculated on the basis of input and output data the main problems in developing and training an artificial network are selecting the optimal network structure and calculating neuron weight values therefore different types of neural network structure and learning methods can be used a multilayer perceptron mlp consisting of an input hidden and output layer as well as utilising a backpropagation learning algorithm is often applied in regression problems overfitting phenomenon is the main problem in neural networks learning this phenomenon occurs when a model has too many variables in relation to the data sample size a test set method is usually used to detect and avoid this phenomenon unfortunately about 30 50 percent of randomly selected data is wasted throughout the neural network development process to test and validate the model in this method in this study the search process for the best neural network went through the following steps creating a neural network topology training and testing the network an accuracy assessment through the use of test results the following standardized parameters were used for accuracy assessment pearson

include 227 113 and 114 cases respectively ship models of wide design characteristic ranges available in literature were used in this study to obtain the most universal predictive model check whether neural networks would provide accurate solutions in this case the measurement data of the added ship resistance coefficient on regular wave of 14 model ships was used the data source was experimental

et al 2014 and sprenger et al 2015 the design characteristics of ship models are presented in table 1 this table shows that length between perpendiculars breadth draught block coefficient and froude number values are of relatively wide ranges however the upper and lower boundaries of the lbp b ratio equals from 5 05 to 7 5 are rather too narrow according to ship design theory papanikolaou 2014 the lbp b ratio range for merchant ships is 4 5 8 5 the lower boundary of the b d ratio which equals 2 49 is rather to high according to ship design theory papanikolaou 2014 the range for merchant ships of the b d ratio starts from 2 1 to 4 these boundaries limit the method application because a neural network usually has poor ability to extrapolate for input values outside the training ranges 4 results and discussion in this study artificial neural networks were trained and tested by the use of statistica software tibco 2017 the following neural network types were tested for the prediction of an added wave resistance coefficient generalized regression neural network grnn multilayer perceptron mlp radial basis function network rbf linear network length between perpendiculars breadth draught block coefficient froude number fn and non dimensional wave frequency equivalent were used as the input layer and a measured non dimensional added wave resistance coefficient was used as the output layer in the neural networks in order to acquire the closest output values to the measured data various numbers of neurons in the hidden layer and training methods were tested for the grnn neural network the number of neurons in the first hidden layer was equal to the number of training cases i e 227 table 2 shows mse error values for different hidden neurons and teaching algorithms of the developed neural networks with respect to experimental data and were broken down into data used for network training the training set data used for network validating during training the validation set data used only for network testing the test set the network which offers the smallest testing error is usually referred to as the best neural network it can be observed from table 2 that the minimum errors were found in the test set when 6 hidden nodes were chosen and back propagation and conjugate gradient algorithms were used this table also shows that the bfgs algorithm enabled the network to be quickly trained even with the use of only 124 training epochs but this training method leads to large differences in error values in training and test sets for example mse error values of best neural network training together with the use a bfgs algorithm were calculated as 0 61 1 09 and 1 12 for training validation and test sets this can result in the phenomenon of overfitting and an inability to generalize data from among all the network types the best solution was obtained when using the mlp neural network with the following structure 6 neurons in the input layer 6 neurons in the hidden layer and 1 neuron in the output layer the structure of this neural network is graphically shown in fig 2 the mathematical form of the neural network developed is given

program called addedresistance cepowski 2019 for the calculation of added resistance utilising this algorithm fig 3 shows the main form of this software lazarus ide software lazarus 2019 with a free pascal compiler was used to develop the addedresistnace program mse error values of the most effective neural network developed are presented in table 2 and were calculated as 1 02 0 98 and 1 1 for training validation and test sets these values are relatively low statistics for the test set are particularly important as the data in this set was not used to develop the network only test it the test set statistic values testify to the ability of this network to generalize new cases the mse error values for test data vary slightly from training and validation set statistics regression between the estimated and measured values through the use of ann is shown in fig 4 pearson correlation coefficient values were calculated as 0 93 0 93 0 92 and 0 93 for training validation test and all data sets respectively these results indicate that the measures and estimated values are all consistent as a result the developed neural network is probably not overfitted and could have good generalization ability fig 5 shows an error histogram for the training validation test and all sets respectively the error value indicates the difference between the measured and estimated value this figure indicates that the largest portion of data coincided with a zero error line in the error range from 1 2 to 1 2 for all sets figs 6 10 compare added resistance data measured by model tests with values calculated using formula 11 and the stawave 2 method ittc 2017 as a function of wavelength ship length ratio these figures show that the neural network predicted relatively accurate results with the measured data the transfer functions estimated by using the neural network have similar trends as did the functions estimated by using stawave 2 method figs 6 and 8 show that the neural network generates good approximation even when a measured data set has a large dispersion a major drawback of neural networks is a poor ability to extrapolate this means that testing and validation of neural network is more important and demanding than for a physics based method fig 11 shows a comparison of the values estimated by using a neural network with experimental data for test cases that were not at all used in the training of the neural network this method known as a test set method is commonly used to assess the accuracy of a neural network in the process of its development in addition the neural network was tested for ships that were not used at all in the development of the neural network the design characteristics of these ship models are presented in table 3 fig 12 shows a comparison of the values estimated by using the neural network and the stawave 2 method with experiments for these ships these graphs indicate that the neural network effectively predicted data that was not used in the learning of the network this confirms the generalization capability of the developed neural network 5 example calculation this section of the article presents an example

22243,this article focuses on the use of an artificial neural network to estimate added resistance in regular head waves while using ship design parameters such as length breadth draught or froude number in order to create a reliable model only experimental data determined through model test measurements was used to train the neural network this study showed that added wave resistance values predicted by the neural network soundly correlated with measured data and had good generalization ability the developed neural network was presented in the form of mathematical function this article presents examples of the use of this function to calculate added wave resistance functions presented here could have practical application in ship resistance analysis at the preliminary design stage keywords ship design added resistance artificial neural network preliminary design approximation model tests head waves 1 introduction a ship is designed in many stages such as concept design preliminary design contract design and detailed design the hull line plan ship general arrangement and propulsion system are conceptualised at the preliminary design stage chądzyński 2001 with this design stage consisting of parametric and geometric design phases watson 1998 rawson and tupper 2001 papanikolaou 2014 argue that the purpose of the parametric design is among others to estimate main propulsion and powering parameters in order to accurately estimate these parameters expert knowledge relating to total hull resistance is required it was also noted arribas and pérez 2007 papanikolaou 2014 that total hull resistance includes added wave resistance which is connected with ship seaway in storm waves can contribute to around 30 50 of total ship resistance can lead to a remarkable drop in operating speed depends on among other factors hull dimension and shape added wave resistance can be determined through model test measurements or far or near field numerical methods far field methods are most often based on momentum conservation theory maruo 1960 joosen 1966 and newman 1967 and the radiated energy approach gerritsma and beukelman 1972 near field numerical methods are based on pressure integration over a wetted hull surface and include approaches developed by fujii and takahashi 1975 salvesen 1978 faltinsen et al 1980 joncquez et al 2008 kuroda et al 2008 and kim and kim 2011 kashiwagi 2009 found satisfactory results using an enhanced unified theory using a modified approach by maruo approximation methods based on semi empirical formulas were also used to estimate additional resistance the common methods are stawave 1 i stawave 2 that have been developed by the sea trial analysis joint industry project boom et al 2013 and implemented by the international towing tank conference in ittc 2017 the stawave 1 method estimates the added resistance of irregular waves caused by short head wave reflection which depends on the waterline shape in the bow region this method was developed for large ships with a high forward speed within trial conditions in mild waves the stawave 2 method was developed to approximate the transfer function of the added resistance in heading regular waves by using main ship characteristics the sea keeping model test results from 200 ships were utilised to develop this method the transfer function calculated by the use of stawave 2 takes the mean resistance increase due to wave reflection and the motion induced resistance ittc 2017 into account due to simple mathematical form and high accuracy both stawave methods are commonly used to estimate the added resistance and accuracy compare other methods liu and papanikolaou 2016a 2016b developed various simple semi empirical formulations for the rapid estimation of ship added resistance in head waves they considered the effect of ship hull form characteristics with best fitting from available experimental data for various types of hull forms liu et al 2016 further refined this research for simple use in engineering applications liu and papanikolaou 2019 extended their previously developed formulas for the approximation of added resistance at wider speed ranges and introduced a new parameter based on b t and investigated trim effect after conducting an extensive parametric study to capture the influence of draft on added resistance the author of this paper cepowski 2008 developed an approximation function for the estimation of an added wave resistance coefficient on the basis of containership design parameters the length between perpendiculars breadth ratio breadth draught ratio and block and waterline coefficient were taken into account as hull design parameters in this study recently the author cepowski 2016 applied an artificial neural network to predict added wave resistance transfer function for bulk carriers thought the use of waterplane area and coefficient as well as ship speed and regular wave frequency considering all of the above methods model tests were found to be the most reliable and accurate though model tests are both expensive and time consuming and also require a hull form computational fluid dynamics cfd methods are considered to be the most accurate calculation methods though these methods are also time consuming and require detailed hull form data alternatively approximation methods were found to be the least accurate but can be applied at the conceptual design stage where a detailed hull form is not available these methods can be also applied to multi criteria design parameter optimization using genetic algorithms due to their simple mathematical form the main disadvantages of approximation methods are that they are only applicable for conventional ships that have been tested and examined these methods cannot be applied in the case of innovative modern ship design the majority of the above methods are limited to resistance calculations for a head wave usually the mean added wave resistance is calculated by the use of a wave system according to the superposition principle then applying this principle an increase in the statistical mean resistance raw in irregular wave is calculated as 1 r aw 2 0 r ω s ζ ζ ω d ω where r aw statistical mean wave resistance increase r added resistance from the regular wave ω frequency s ζζ wave energy spectrum density function full scale added resistance due to waves r may be reduced to the non dimensional coefficient ρ aw by the following equation 2 c aw r ζ a 2 ρ g b 2 l where c aw non dimensional added wave resistance coefficient ζ a amplitude of a regular wave b ship breadth l ship length ρ seawater density g acceleration due to gravity a selection of main dimensions in the case of additional wave resistance is the most effective method in parametric design a body line plan is required to estimate the non dimensional added wave resistance coefficient through the use of model tests or numerical methods though an accurate estimate of the additional resistance of a ship at the parametric design can be problematic because the hull line plan is not developed at this stage therefore the aim of this research was to develop a simple accurate function to estimate the non dimensional added wave resistance coefficient by the use of the ship design parameters such as length breadth draught or froude number in order to discover a reliable model only measurement results through the use of model tests were used in this research in this study the estimation of added wave resistance was only limited to head waves 2 research method a key element of this research was to determine the function which would estimate the non dimensional added wave resistance coefficient based on design parameters and wave frequency

neural networks ann have been used in a number of scientific ship design theory publications abramowski 2013 applied artificial neural networks for the optimization of design parameters in cargo ships a mathematical model to determine the effective power of a ship was developed by the use of neural networks in this publication gurgen et al 2018 applied an artificial neural network to predict the main dimensions of chemical tankers main ship parameters such as overall length length between perpendiculars breadth draught and freeboard were etimated on the basis of deadweight and vessel speed in this paper gurgen et al 2018 argued that the initial main particulars of chemical tankers could be determined through the use of ann offering levels which were much more accurate than compared to sample ship data ekinci et al 2011 used 18 computational intelligence methods including neural network methods to estimate the main design parameters of oil chemical tankers in many scientific studies the use of artificial neural networks offers excellent results 3 artificial neural networks artificial neural network theory is based on the analysis of a biological nervous system a biological nervous structure consists of neurons and their connections a mathematical model of a neural network is created based on this structure and signal transmission this model was built from an input output and one or more hidden layers that consist of neurons haykin 1994 values from previous layers are passed through neurons x1 x2 xn in an artificial neuron which were connected with weights w1 w2 wn as followed and shown in fig 1 4 y φ i 0 n w i x i where x i input signal y neuron output signal w i weights w 0 bias φ activation function the sum result value was transmitted to the node output value by the use of an activation function a number of functions are often used as activation functions in the hidden layer and the output layer in this study the following activation function were used purelin where the neuron activation is passed on directly as the output 5 y x standard logistic function 6 y 1 1 exp x hyperbolic tangent 7 y exp a exp a exp a exp a after the learning process an artificial neural network maps the input vector x to resulting vector y 8 f x y the aim of the learning process is to calculate the weight value wi where the network response is consistent with the results weight w i are calculated on the basis of input and output data the main problems in developing and training an artificial network are selecting the optimal network structure and calculating neuron weight values therefore different types of neural network structure and learning methods can be used a multilayer perceptron mlp consisting of an input hidden and output layer as well as utilising a backpropagation learning algorithm is often applied in regression problems overfitting phenomenon is the main problem in neural networks learning this phenomenon occurs when a model has too many variables in relation to the data sample size a test set method is usually used to detect and avoid this phenomenon unfortunately about 30 50 percent of randomly selected data is wasted throughout the neural network development process to test and validate the model in this method in this study the search process for the best neural network went through the following steps creating a neural network topology training and testing the network an accuracy assessment through the use of test results the following standardized parameters were used for accuracy assessment pearson

et al 2014 and sprenger et al 2015 the design characteristics of ship models are presented in table 1 this table shows that length between perpendiculars breadth draught block coefficient and froude number values are of relatively wide ranges however the upper and lower boundaries of the lbp b ratio equals from 5 05 to 7 5 are rather too narrow according to ship design theory papanikolaou 2014 the lbp b ratio range for merchant ships is 4 5 8 5 the lower boundary of the b d ratio which equals 2 49 is rather to high according to ship design theory papanikolaou 2014 the range for merchant ships of the b d ratio starts from 2 1 to 4 these boundaries limit the method application because a neural network usually has poor ability to extrapolate for input values outside the training ranges 4 results and discussion in this study artificial neural networks were trained and tested by the use of statistica software tibco 2017 the following neural network types were tested for the prediction of an added wave resistance coefficient generalized regression neural network grnn multilayer perceptron mlp radial basis function network rbf linear network length between perpendiculars breadth draught block coefficient froude number fn and non dimensional wave frequency equivalent were used as the input layer and a measured non dimensional added wave resistance coefficient was used as the output layer in the neural networks in order to acquire the closest output values to the measured data various numbers of neurons in the hidden layer and training methods were tested for the grnn neural network the number of neurons in the first hidden layer was equal to the number of training cases i e 227 table 2 shows mse error values for different hidden neurons and teaching algorithms of the developed neural networks with respect to experimental data and were broken down into data used for network training the training set data used for network validating during training the validation set data used only for network testing the test set the network which offers the smallest testing error is usually referred to as the best neural network it can be observed from table 2 that the minimum errors were found in the test set when 6 hidden nodes were chosen and back propagation and conjugate gradient algorithms were used this table also shows that the bfgs algorithm enabled the network to be quickly trained even with the use of only 124 training epochs but this training method leads to large differences in error values in training and test sets for example mse error values of best neural network training together with the use a bfgs algorithm were calculated as 0 61 1 09 and 1 12 for training validation and test sets this can result in the phenomenon of overfitting and an inability to generalize data from among all the network types the best solution was obtained when using the mlp neural network with the following structure 6 neurons in the input layer 6 neurons in the hidden layer and 1 neuron in the output layer the structure of this neural network is graphically shown in fig 2 the mathematical form of the neural network developed is given

length between perpendiculars m b is the breadth m d is the draught m cb is the block coefficient fn is the froude number λ lbp is the wavelength ship length ratio the author developed a computer program called addedresistance cepowski 2019 for the calculation of added resistance utilising this algorithm fig 3 shows the main form of this software lazarus ide software lazarus 2019 with a free pascal compiler was used to develop the addedresistnace program mse error values of the most effective neural network developed are presented in table 2 and were calculated as 1 02 0 98 and 1 1 for training validation and test sets these values are relatively low statistics for the test set are particularly important as the data in this set was not used to develop the network only test it the test set statistic values testify to the ability of this network to generalize new cases the mse error values for test data vary slightly from training and validation set statistics regression between the estimated and measured values through the use of ann is shown in fig 4 pearson correlation coefficient values were calculated as 0 93 0 93 0 92 and 0 93 for training validation test and all data sets respectively these results indicate that the measures and estimated values are all consistent as a result the developed neural network is probably not overfitted and could have good generalization ability fig 5 shows an error histogram for the training validation test and all sets respectively the error value indicates the difference between the measured and estimated value this figure indicates that the largest portion of data coincided with a zero error line in the error range from 1 2 to 1 2 for all sets figs 6 10 compare added resistance data measured by model tests with values calculated using formula 11 and the stawave 2 method ittc 2017 as a function of wavelength ship length ratio these figures show that the neural network predicted relatively accurate results with the measured data the transfer functions estimated by using the neural network have similar trends as did the functions estimated by using stawave 2 method figs 6 and 8 show that the neural network generates good approximation even when a measured data set has a large dispersion a major drawback of neural networks is a poor ability to extrapolate this means that testing and validation of neural network is more important and demanding than for a physics based method fig 11 shows a comparison of the values estimated by using a neural network with experimental data for test cases that were not at all used in the training of the neural network this method known as a test set method is commonly used to assess the accuracy of a neural network in the process of its development in addition the neural network was tested for ships that were not used at all in the development of the neural network the design characteristics of these ship models are presented in table 3 fig 12 shows a comparison of the values estimated by using the neural network and the stawave 2 method with experiments for these ships these graphs indicate that the neural network effectively predicted data that was not used in the learning of the network this confirms the generalization capability of the developed neural network 5 example calculation this section of the article presents an example

22244,irregular wave experiments are essential to assess the statistics of ship responses in realistic operating conditions and to validate the associated numerical simulations the cost and time required to achieve statistically converged results are usually high both experimentally and computationally for these reasons high quality statistically converged irregular wave studies are limited in the literature and models to reduce the experimental computational costs are highly desirable here a statistically converged experimental benchmark study of a catamaran in irregular waves is presented along with regular wave uncertainty quantification uq model used to approximate the relevant statistical estimators the statistical assessment is achieved through recently developed approaches based on the analysis of the autocovariance function of the ship response along with block bootstrap and bootstrap methods the validation variables are the wave elevation axial force heave and pitch motions vertical acceleration of the bridge and vertical velocity of the flight deck values from the time series are addressed as primary variables whereas heights associated to mean crossing waves are referred to as secondary variables the statistical uncertainty related to expected value ev and standard deviation sd of primary variables is evaluated through autocovariance analysis and block bootstrap methods the latter are used to assess also the quantile function ev sd and quantile function of secondary variables are then assessed by the bootstrap method regular wave models assess the ev of the axial force and single significant amplitudes twice the sd of pitch acceleration and velocity as relevant merit factors used for design optimization in earlier studies

test geometries the head seas conditions are usually preferred focus on small steepness conditions in the linear regime do not provide body plan offsets or loading weight distributions partially or do not report ua procedures and uncertainties as a result very few seakeeping experimental fluid dynamics efd information exist that may be useful as benchmark data for validation of computational fluid dynamics cfd seakeeping codes longo and stern 2005 and stern et al 2006 provide data sets of typical towing tank tests and the methodology for computing and reporting the ua results of the measurement variables the delft catamaran is an international benchmark geometry which has been used for cfd and efd studies earlier research on the delft catamaran includes seakeeping cfd castiglione et al 2011

et al 2015 diez et al 2015b however experimental uq studies and validation of uq methods for the irregular wave statistics are still lacking stochastic uq methods and approximations are an essential part of stochastic simulation based design optimization such as reliability based and robust design optimization for real ocean environment and operations diez et al 2013 and tahara et al 2014 presented a multi objective design optimization for resistance and operability in real ocean environment and operations including variable sea state and speed but limited to head waves for the delft catamaran the approach encompasses a single deterministic regular wave approximation for the evaluation of the mean resistance in wave and a stochastic regular wave uq model for the single significant amplitudes ssas of the relevant constrained variables pitch acceleration of bridge and velocity of flight deck as per the nato standardization agreement stanag 4154 e g kennell et al 1985 and nato nato stanag 4154 1997 the results from the approximated deterministic and stochastic regular wave uq models compared well with numerical benchmark values based on irregular wave simulation the objective of the present work is the experimental validation of uq methods developed and applied in earlier studies for design optimization the focus is on the a irregular wave benchmark analysis and b stochastic regular wave uq model along with the assessment of the validation methods and comparison of the resulting confidence intervals the approach includes experiments in irregular waves taken as experimental benchmark followed by regular wave uq the validation variables are the wave elevation ζ x force heave z pitch θ vertical acceleration of the bridge z b and the vertical velocity of the flight deck z d the current approach addresses the statistics of the irregular wave time series as primary variables and mean crossing amplitudes as secondary variables providing their expected value ev standard deviation sd and cumulative probability density functions cdf pdf the subseries carlstein 1986 and bootstrap efron 1981 methods give the required validation values and confidence intervals for ev sd and cdf expressed by the quantile function of primary and secondary variables respectively the combined use of the kernel density estimator kde miecznikowski et al 2010a with the subseries and bootstrap methods provides validation values and confidence intervals for the pdf additionally validation values and confidence intervals of time series ev and sd are evaluated using the sample variance and size and the autocovariance function as shown by belenky et al 2015 the regular wave uq focuses on ev of axial force and ssas of pitch motion acceleration and velocity as relevant merit

of unsteady rans and potential flow solutions with experimental data and showing the effects of the number of inlet wave components on the validation errors the present paper is organized as follows in section 2 an overview of the experimental setup with a presentation of the instrumentation used is given in section 3 statistical estimators and confidence intervals for regular and irregular waves are indicated in section 4 the results of the experiments in irregular and in regular waves are outlined together with their uncertainty analysis and finally compared in section 5 conclusions are offered 2 experimental setup in this section experimental setup is described in details the catamaran model is shown in section 2 1 in order to measure motions and longitudinal force the vessel is completely instrumented whereas the towing carriage is equipped for the wave height measurements instrumentations and the facility are illustrated in sections 2 2 and 2 3 it has to be highlighted that a carefully assessment of the wave generation and propagation has been pursued being mandatory for the high fidelity measurements required for a valuable uq analysis 2 1 catamaran model the tu delft 372 catamaran van t veer van t veer 1998a van t veer 1998b has been selected as a case study for the current benchmark a fiberglass model was manufactured cnr inm model 2554 at the same scale of the delft one i e lpp 3m a full scale vessel has never been built anyhow in order to properly select the operative condition in a real scenario a 100m catamaran at full scale i e a λ 33 33 scale factor has been considered in the following the basic geometry and the body plan of the model are sketched in fig 1 the cnr inm 2554 model is shown in fig 2 the main geometric hydrostatic and hydrodynamic properties at model and full scales are given in table 1 the model is towed through a twin gimbal one for each demi hull rigidly connected with a transversal beam which ensures free pitch motion around the center of gravity and a vertical beam sliding in a linear bearing which allows free heave motion the linking system ensures that surge sway and roll are so restricted that they may be assumed as restrained yaw is kept fixed by means of a motion preventer to increase the rigidity of the catamaran model the two demi hulls are connected with two transversal aluminum beams ahead and behind the center of gravity and a third aluminum beam at the aft perpendicular as shown in fig 2 the configuration ensures enough rigidity of the catamaran without using a deck in the fore part of the model therefore no deck slamming phenomena occurred during the tests the total weight and its distribution are carefully checked in order to match the prescribed displacement and dynamical properties current regular and irregular wave tests are focused on first and second harmonic components of the dynamical resistance and kinematic motions quantities therefore the experimental setup should be able to provide time accurate measurements of loads and motions different linking systems have been tested the first one was not completely rigid so that as it will be shown later the motion of the beam induced a large elastic response of the mounting system leading to a large over prediction of both added resistance and the amplitude of its second harmonic component this problem was particularly evident due to the high speed at which the catamaran has been tested to overcome this issue a second more rigid mounting solution was designed and built as in fig 3 this new arrangement was tested either with or without soft springs as it will be shown later the use of soft springs works as a low pass filter damping out first and higher harmonics thus providing the mean in wave resistance only on the contrary without springs the system has been tested and verified to provide accurate measurements without any large deformation which would affect the measurements themselves 2 2 instrumentations 2 2 1 motion measurements a krypton optical system with an acquisition frequency of 800 hz is used to measure the motion of the model it consists of three linear ccd cameras k600 camera unit which detect the position of a reference system fixed to the body identified through three infrared leds the plate with the infrared leds is placed in the stern region of the left hull as sketched in fig 4 the spatial position of each led is found with a high resolution through a triangulation procedure the field of view of the cameras spans from 1 5m to 6m the accuracy of the system is distributed in three zones zone i from 1 5m to 3 5m with a vol accuracy of 0 09 0 01 mm m and a single point accuracy of 0 060 0 007 mm m zone ii from 3 5m to 5 0m with a vol accuracy of 0 09 0 025 mm m and a single point accuracy of 0 060 0 017 mm m zone iii from 5 0m to 6 0 m with a vol accuracy of 0 190 0 025 mm m and a single point accuracy of 0 130 0 017 mm m where the measurement uncertainty is expressed for a confidence level of 95 according to iso 10360 ii standard in the current setup the distance between the ccd cameras and the target plate is 2 5m therefore the zone i is the reference one with a global accuracy of 0 225 0 025 mm and a single point accuracy of 0 150 0 017 mm 2 2 2 resistance measurements for the direct measurement of the total resistance in waves two omega lc204 load cells with maximum range of 445n and accuracy around 0 1 are used they are designed to be surface mounted with the load applied through the mounting stud the cells are placed between the gimbal and the ship model one for each gimbal the added resistance in the ship frame of reference i e along the longitudinal axis of the catamaran results from the subtraction of the calm water resistance to the average value of the total resistance in waves since the load cells are mounted on the hull non inertial effects should be estimated and subtracted to this aim the required time histories of the acceleration in correspondence of the cells positions have been reconstructed from the measurements of the motion 2 2 3 acceleration measurements the acceleration of the model is measured at the bridge and at the flight deck two accelerometers are placed at the following positions bridge accelerometer horizontal 0 30l pp from the front perpendicular fp vertical 0 15l pp from the keel line or dimensionally 90 cm from fp and 45 cm from the keel line flight deck accelerometer horizontal 0 85l pp from the fp vertical 0 10l pp from the keel line or dimensionally 255 cm from fp and 30 cm from the keel line the accelerometer is visible in fig 4 the flight deck velocity is obtained through time integration 2 2 4 incoming wave measurements the elevations of the incident waves are measured at two different stations the first one at 3m ahead the model which is considered as the measurement of the undisturbed incident wave while the second measurement is acquired by a probe placed approximately 3m aside the hull at the lcg position see fig 5 this wave measurement could be partially affected by the hull for lower speeds but it is only used to compute the phase shift between the incident wave and the motion of the catamaran the wave height has been measured by means of kenek probes which is a non intrusive instrumentation with accuracy of 0 1 mm and a maximum range of measurement of 150 mm this probe is suitable for low speed seakeeping tests and moderate wave steepness therefore it has been considered accurate enough for the wave steepness range and fr number at which the present tests are carried on 2 3 facility wave maker validation sea keeping tests are performed in the emilio castagneto towing tank one of the cnr inm formerly cnr insean facilities which dimensions are 220m 9m and 3 6m in length width and depth respectively the tank is equipped with a towing carriage capable to operate at the maximum speed of 15 0 m s carriage speed fluctuations are less than 0 01 head wave system is generated by means of a kempf remmers wave maker the wave maker is equipped with a flap plunger hinged 1 80m below the calm water level with a maximum angle range 13 frequency range 0 1 1 8 hz in order to ensure reliable and accurate seakeeping test measurements the wave maker has been recently revamped and its performances i e accuracy and repeatability of the generated wave systems have been carefully evaluated a campaign for the qualification of the facility has been performed it involved the estimation of the transfer function of the plunger stroke versus the frequency the determination of the frequency response function of the mechanical system and the estimation of the error and repeatability of the generated waves the validation assessment has been performed for the whole operating range of the system the generated wave system has been measured by probes mounted on several transversal beams placed all along the channel length allowing the estimation of both the two dimensionality of the wave its dissipation along the tank and possible reflections form the basin end which should be dampen by the presence of the absorbing beach validation assessments for the regular wave generation are reported in table 2 three height over wave length ratios in the whole range of the operating frequencies of the wave maker have been tested the test covers the generation of the regular waves from linear ka 0 052 to high non linear ka 0 209 ranges as clear from table 2 low errors up to 5 are estimated for linear and weakly non linear ka 0 1 waves whereas as expected higher errors and unsatisfactory repeatability are observed for highly non linear waves ka 0 1 moreover larger errors and uncertainties are generally seen for higher frequencies regardless the wave steepness f 1 hz i e shortest waves this indicates that the flap plunger of the wave maker activated by a hydraulic servomechanism experiences difficulties to generate high frequency waves moreover negligible reflection from the basin ends and poorly significant wave damping along the basin have been observed however it has to be noticed that the regular wave tests that will follow are pursued for a frequency steepness range for which the error in the amplitude is not larger than 5 whereas this limit is partially overtaken in the irregular wave tests error and uncertainty in the generation of an irregular wave system has been verified only for the condition under analysis in this paper and it will be presented in section 4 1 2 3 statistical variables and methodss the methodology for stochastic uncertainty quantification employed in this work follows the one already used in diez et al 2018b however for the sake of completeness the methodology is also briefly recall here the validation variables are the wave elevation ζ x force positive forward heave z g positive upward pitch angle θ positive bow up vertical acceleration of the bridge z b positive upward and vertical velocity of the flight deck z d positive upward time series values are addressed as primary variables whereas mean crossing amplitudes height and period are indicated as secondary variables the subseries and bootstrap methods are applied in order to estimate the validation values and 95 confidence intervals for expected value ev standard deviation sd and quantile function additionally validation values and confidence intervals for time series ev and sd are evaluated by time series theory based on the sample variance and size and the autocovariance function the stochastic regular wave uq focuses on ssa s of pitch acceleration and velocity as relevant merit factors for design optimization 3 1 statistical estimators and confidence intervals for irregular wave benchmark 3 1 1 statistical variables statistical variables of interest are expected value ev standard deviation sd and cumulative distribution function cdf probability density function pdf or quantiles along with the mode they are evaluated numerically for both primary and secondary variables using a sample of n items for primary variables items are extracted from the time series as j i j t i i 1 n for secondary variables n mean crossing waves are identified and the associated j i defined note that the sample size n is different for primary and secondary variables the statistical estimators are evaluated as follows 1 e v j 1 n i 1 n j i 2 s d j 1 n 1 i 1 n j i e v j 2 3 c d f j y 1 n i 1 n δ j i y the pdf is evaluated using here the kernel

silverman 1986 6 h s d j n 1 5 3 1 2 statistical estimators and confidence intervals of primary variables 3 1 2 1 autocovariance matrix method ac the analysis of the autocovariance matrix is used to provide validation values and confidence intervals for ev and sd of time series values primary variables the formers are provided directly by eqs 1 and 2 following the work by belenky et al 2015 belenky et al 2013 the confidence intervals associated to a single wave record are evaluated using the variance of the mean var ev and the variance of the variance var sd 2 the former is 7 v a r e v v a r s e v v a r r e v where 8 v a r s e v s d 2 n is the contribution to the variance of the mean associated to the diagonal terms of the autocovariance matrix and 9 v a r r e v 2 n i n 1 1 i n r τ i is the contribution to the variance of the mean associated to the off diagonal terms stemming from the dependence of the time series items evaluated through the autocovariance function as 10 r τ i 1 n

is evaluated at the 95 confidence level assuming a normal distribution for the ev estimate as 12 u e v 2 v a r s e v v a r r e v 2 v a r e v similarly to var ev the variance of the time series variance var sd 2 is 13 v a r s d 2 v a r s s d 2 v a r r s d 2 where assuming normally distributed items 14 v a r s s d 2 2 s d 4 n and 15 v a r r s d 2 4 n i n 1 1 i n r τ i 2 the statistical uncertainty associated to sd is evaluated at the 95 confidence level by the central limit theorem as belenky et al 2013 16 u s d s d 1 2 v a r s s d 2 v a r r s d 2 s d 2 1 3 1 2 2 non overlapping block bootstrap method nbb in order to define the validation values and confidence intervals of the statistical estimators of eqs 1 4 a nbb method broglia et al 2019 künsch 1989 politis and romano 1994 politis et al 1999 is applied to the time series using a number of c n l non overlapping blocks where l is an optimal block length given by 17 l 2 ϕ c 2 3 n 1 3 with 18 ϕ n i 1 n 1 j t i 1 e v j j t i e v j n 1 i 1 n j t i e v j 2 and c 1 ϕ 1 ϕ from the original c blocks a number of c blocks are drawn at random with replacement and concatenated in the order they are picked forming a new bootstrapped series of size n a number of b 100 bootstrapped series is used in the current analysis ev and sd are evaluated as per eqs 1 and 2 the cdf is assessed by the quantile function q evaluated at probabilities p 0 025 0 1 0 2 0 8 0 9 0 975 if one sorts all the j t i i 1 n within each bootstrapped series such that j t i 1 j t i j t i 1 then 19 q p j p n the validation value for ev and its 95 confidence lower and upper bounds are evaluated respectively as 20 e v median e v b e v 0 5 b 21 e v l e v 0 025 b 22 e v u e v 0 975 b where e v b represents the ev value of the b th bootstrapped series ordered such as e v b 1 e v b e v b 1 finally 23 u e v 0 5 e v u e v l the validation values and the confidence intervals for sd and q are evaluated similarly to ev as per eqs 20 22 3 1 2 3 moving block bootstrap method mbb in addition and for comparison to the nbb method validation values and confidence intervals of the statistical estimators of eqs 1 4 are evaluated using a mbb method broglia et al 2019 künsch 1989 miecznikowski et al 2010b nato stanag 4154 1997 politis and romano 1994 politis et al 1999 in the case of moving blocks the original blocks to pick from are in number c n l 1 each formed by j t i i j j l 1 where j is the block index and l is evaluated as in the nbb method from the original set of c blocks a number of c n l blocks are drawn at random with replacement and concatenated in the order they are picked forming a new bootstrapped series of size n a number of b 100 bootstrapped series is used in the current analysis the validation value for ev sd mode and q with their 95 confidence lower and upper bounds are evaluated as in the non overlapping block bootstrap method 3 1 3 statistical estimators and confidence intervals of secondary variables by the bootstrap method the validation values and confidence intervals of the secondary variables are calculated using the bootstrap method efron 1981 the method consists in constructing an empirical probability distribution from the sample assumed independent and identically distributed by assigning a probability of 1 m to each item this empirical probability distribution function represents the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimate of the unknown actual distribution the associated empirical cdf is given by eq 3 from the empirical cdf calculate a number of b new sets bootstraps each of which contains new random items j i i 1 m defined as 24 j i c d f 1 p i where p i are m uniformly distributed random items in 0 1 in practice if one orders the original items j i such as j i 1 j i j i

th bootstrap 3 2 statistical estimators and confidence intervals of regular wave uq model regular wave uq models have been developed for variables relevant to design optimization diez et al 2013 2014 2018a specifically bi and uni variate uq models have been applied to ship response predictions considering the wave period height and frequency as stochastic variables diez et al 2018a the uni variate uq model considering stochastic wave frequency is used here for the ev of the x force and the sd of the motions whose maximum single significant amplitude ssa is prescribed by the nato stanag 4154 standardization agreement nato stanag 4154 1997 a latin hypercube monte carlo method with importance sampling is applied using a number of l uniformly distributed regular wave experiments from metamodel predictions by radial basis functions volpi et al 2015 the ev for the force is then evaluated as 26 e v f x r c w e v 2 m 0 e v i f x r c w a i 2 i 1 l f ω i 1 i 1 l 2 m 0 e v i f x r c w a

distribution 27 2 a i h π 8 h s for all i and period t i 2π ω i a i is the amplitude of the i th regular wave the probability density function is defined as f ω i s ω i m 0 where m 0 is the spectrum energy zero th moment the sd 2 of θ a b and z d is computed as 28 s d j 2 e v σ ˆ i 2 j i 1 l f ω i 1 i 1 l σ ˆ i 2 j f ω i where using the moment transport theorem 29 σ ˆ i 2 j 2 m 0 s d i 2 j e v i j 1 l i 1 l e v i j 2 a i 2 herein the metamodel presented in volpi et al 2015 is used to predict ev i and sd i in eq 29 versus the wave frequency the confidence intervals for e v i and s d i are approximated here by eqs 12 and 16 without considering the non diagonal terms in the autocovariance matrix finally ssa 2 sd 4 seakeeping tests the north pacific ocean environment has been selected as the operating conditions in a real scenario this choice was motivated by the wide literature on the energy spectral distributions obtained from measurement campaigns by off shore industries in table 3 the characteristics of the north pacific ocean are indicated the mean wave height trough to crest of the highest third of the waves h 1 3 and the most probable modal wave period t m are shown for sea states from 1 to 8 following diez et al 2013 a 100m full scale length catamaran advancing in head waves is considered with a variable operational speed within the range from fr 0 115 to 0 575 in the present work an average froude number of 0 425 and a sea state 5 highlighted in table 3 are chosen the operational environment is then characterized by a significant wave height h 1 3 of 3 25 m at full scale corresponding to 95 5 mm at model scale this yields the mean wave height h m π 8 h 1 3 to 2 04 m at full scale which corresponds to 61 10 mm at model scale the most probably wave period t m corresponds to the modal frequency of 9 7 s at full scale and 1 68 s at model scale in table 4 the main sea characteristics are indicated it is worth to notice that the maximum steepness is close to the linearity limit 4 1 irregular wave tests the irregular wave system has been generated by considering the bretschneider energy spectrum which is the best representation of the present scenario being developed for modeling the north pacific area from the linear theory it is known see faltinsen 2005 that the total energy of a single monochromatic wave of amplitude η is ρgη 2 2 in the case of irregular sea a spectral analysis of the gravity wave amplitudes leads to a similar definition for the energy amount associated to a wave with a specific frequency ω 30 1 2 ρ g η 2 ω e ω δ ω and from the definition of the energy density s ω e ω ρg it simply reduces to 31 η 2 ω 2 s ω δ ω obviously the wave amplitude spectrum depends on the interval δ ω chosen because the energy carried by a single wave component depends on the integral of s ω over the considered frequency interval the spectrum s ω is usually expressed in the form 32 s ω a ω 5 e x p b ω 4 where the definition of a and b is arbitrary and normally is referred to the desired sea environment for the bretschneider spectrum 33 s ω 5 16 ω m 4 ω 5 h 1 3 2 e x p 5 4 ω m 4 ω 4 where ω m is the peak modal angular frequency and h 1 3 is the significant wave height whereas t m 2 π ω m is the period associated to the modal frequency the system of irregular waves is then generated by a linear superposition of elemental wave components 34 η t k 1 n w a k c o s ω k t φ k where n w is the number of components a k 2 s ω k δ ω and φ k is a random phase for both the validation test and the irregular seakeeping tests of the catamaran the wave is generated using n w 993 components ranging from 0 18 to 1 84 hz wider than the range of the regular wave frequencies reported in table 4 4 1 1 irregular wave generation validation before proceeding to seakeeping tests the wave maker has been validated in order to assess its capabilities in reproducing the required sea state to this end ten acquisitions of the wave amplitudes have been performed acquisitions are made in a fixed point of the basin about 25m from the wave maker each recording lasts 250s the time history of the wave height including its running mean and rms for one acquisition is depicted in fig 6 it is worth to underline that a satisfactory convergence for both the mean and the rms of the wave height has been achieved after each run the ten acquisitions have been post processed in order to evaluate the global spectrum as well as the spectra of each single acquisition to inspect their convergence toward the theoretical one this approach allows assessing the minimum recording time required for the seakeeping test when the catamaran has encountered a well enough reproduced sea spectrum the acquisition time may be considered good for the estimation of the statistics in fig 7 the energy densities spectra obtained by the wave amplitude time signal are shown the smooth curves are obtained through a natural smoothing spline approximation of the original data with a reconstruction via piecewise cubic polynomials with 1000 segments for each curve the endpoints of each segment are interpolated the figure depicts the spectrum convergence obtained by doubling the number of samples a clear distinction among the different distributions is evident near the peak and at higher frequencies in particular it should be noticed that the convergence is monotonic in the range 0 2hz 0 5 hz where the wave behavior is fundamentally linear on the contrary at high frequencies 0 9 hz no convergence toward the theoretical spectrum is detectable in the medium range 0 5hz 0 9 hz a convergence in the peak values highlighted in the side table of fig 7 is evident although oscillating but monotonic in magnitude the results are very encouraging for low frequencies i e frequencies lower than 0 5 hz where the wave maker is highly reliable conversely for higher frequencies higher than 0 8 hz the spectra manifest an evident energy increase with respect to the theoretical one this effect is mainly ascribable to the difficulty of the wave maker in accurately producing short wavelengths standing the mechanical limits of the flap plunger quantitative error estimation is not trivial an l 2 norm of the relative error with the theoretical spectrum within the whole frequencies range could be meaningless because of the flap plunger problems at high frequencies explained above moreover when an experimental campaign of measurement is carried out the error on the total energy content and on the position and intensity of the energy density peak are by far more important than the local error on s ω for this reason a convergence based on the peak error and on the global energy is preferred the global error is calculated as the difference between the theoretical and the measured integrals of the energy densities evaluated between ω min and ω max these latter are respectively the lower and higher frequency corresponding to an energy density the 5 of the theoretical spectrum peak in this case ω min 0 4 hz ω max 1 38 hz as suggested by the ittc guidelines load and responses commit 2002 the percentage error between the energy peak of the measured spectrum and the theoretical one is shown in the second column of the side table of fig 7 while the total energy is reported in the third column as anticipated the convergence in terms of the peak intensity is quite monotonic in magnitude whereas an oscillating behavior is observed in terms of total energy nevertheless a satisfactory error is seen with values lower than 6 for the latter and lower than 1 for the peak error once the spectrum can be assumed to correctly represent the theoretical one the calculation of the second and fourth momenta are useful to verify that the bandwidth coefficient suggested by mollison mollison and evansfalcão 1985 falls in the correct range 35 ε 1 m 2 2 m 0 m 4 0 59 which is in satisfactory agreement with the theoretical value of 0 56 it should be pointed out that for an ocean environment a typical broadband value of 0 5 ԑ 0 6 is expected so that the present value means that the sea spectrum produced is really representing an ocean environment the measured statistics of the generated sea are reported in table 5 as expected the value of h1 3 obtained from the measurements 101 76 mm is close to the expected value of 97 5 mm indicated in table 3 with a percentage error of 4 37 the total number of encountered waves n w is a quite vague value that can be calculated in different manners from a direct evaluation of the negative zero crossing it would be equal to 1825 but by considering the mean zero crossing period t zc m 2 m 0 1 27 s this value rises to 1879 however if the average peak to peak period t c m 4 m 2 1 02 s is taken into account the final number of encountered waves becomes 2337 by stressing the information coming from the spectrum and being the data in agreement with a raw measurement of zero crossing events the value of 1879 will be considered hereafter in the left frame of fig 8 the running means and rms are highlighted for the global time history showing the asymptotic value of 25 98 mm which represents the standard deviation in the right plot of fig 8 the amplitude percentage occurrence of the irregular waves shows a correct gaussian distribution finally in order to exclude unwanted periodic signals in the stochastic realizations of the experiments the autocorrelation function is evaluated the autocorrelation is the correlation of a signal with a delayed copy of itself as a function of delay τ differently from the pdf which contains information on the amplitude variation of the process the autocorrelation gives an indication of the time variation of the process allowing to evaluate periodic patterns even if they are covered by a white noise it is defined by the formula 36 r τ i 1 s d 2 k 1 n i e j t k e v j j t k i e v j where τ i is the time lag and e x is the expected value operator if a signal varies slowly in time its value at times t and t τ remains quite similar and the autocorrelation will be positive while if it varies quickly the autocorrelation will assume a value close to zero in fig 9 the autocorrelation for the time signals of all the measured quantities is reported demonstrating that any periodic pattern is present in the time signals and they are only related to stochastic processes 4 1 2 irregular wave tests once the capabilities of the wave maker in correctly reproducing the required sea state have been appraised the seakeeping tests have been performed the experiments were carried out at the reference speed of 2 305 m s model scale i e at a length based froude number equal to 0 425 by taking into account an operative length of 220m for the towing tank the time window for each run is approximately 95s excluding the transient phases acceleration and stop a useful time window of about 50s may be assumed for each run this means that in each test about 289 s at full scale are simulated according to the ittc recommended procedures and guidelines load and responses commit 2002 the test duration should cover at least 30 min of equivalent full scale this means that measurement must be recorded for at least 6 runs in the present analysis for an accurate evaluation of the statistics and in order to guarantee good convergence properties 18 runs were considered the total time of acquisition corresponds to 86 6 min at full scale exceeding almost 3 times the ittc recommendations as already stated the considered sea spectrum is the bretschneider one with characteristics defined in the previous section the final data are obtained by concatenating the 18 runs through fading in out ramps with a length of about 1 5 modal periods such ensuring negligible frequency analysis errors according to the current setup the number of time samples is n 90114 this assures the model to encounter 1464 waves see table 6 in addition to the validation reported in the previous subsection the quality of the irregular wave system has been further validated its accuracy is summarized in table 6 where zero first and second order spectrum moments are compared with the theoretical values the errors are generally less than 1 5 decreasing for the higher moments with an average error of about 0 5 table 7 shows the uq assessment of the encountered wave train the validation study includes the wave elevation as primary variable and the wave height as secondary variable the wave elevation and its autocovariance are presented in fig 10 the wave elevation statistics is assessed by autocovariance analysis and both non overlapping and moving block bootstrap methods see table 7 errors of ev sd and quantiles versus theoretical values are reasonable being smaller than 3 the associated uncertainties are also rather small less than 3 the wave height statistics have a similar trend with larger errors and uncertainties fig 11 shows the pdfs and the quantiles of wave amplitude and the wave height which represents the secondary variable differently from the distribution for the primary variable the secondary variable gives a more direct feeling of the sea encountered by the ship during the straight advancing the most probable wave height is about 44 mm in fig 12 the pdf and the quantile function for the resistance are reported the distributions are referred to the signal where the non inertia effects due to a relatively small surge motion are subtracted in principle the surge motion should be constrained but it would be possible only with an infinitely rigid transversal beam so that it remains unrealistic non inertial effects are estimated by assuming the added mass contribution equal to the 10 of the ship model mass the apparent force term is then 1 1 δ d η 1 d t where η 1 represents the surge motion acquired by the kripton system and δ is displacement defined in table 1 pdfs and quantiles for heave and pitch motions are reported in fig 13 and fig 14 whereas the ones for the flight deck velocity and the bridge acceleration are in fig 15 validation for resistance heave pitch bridge acceleration and flight deck velocity time series assessed with the various methods described in diez et al 2018b are reported in table 8 table 9 and table 10 for primary variables and in table 11 for secondary variables in order to normalize the results the uncertainties are expressed in percentage of 2sd since the process j t is assumed to be stationary its autocovariance function depends only on the difference in time time lag between the two points following belenky et al 2015 it is useful to stress that while the term 8 in formula 7 represents the variance of the mean estimate of a random variable the term 9 highlights in turn the dependence between the data points of a stochastic process if the process may be assumed as an uncorrelated white noise the result is identical to a random variable one because the auto covariance function of the white noise equals zero for all non zero time lags from table 8 the low values of the uncertainties on the mean values reflect low variances on diagonal and off diagonal terms being equation 7 a sum of two positive terms the first one goes to zero for the number of items going to infinity whereas the second one goes to a stationary value this means that by enriching the items with longer time histories the autocovariance function remains unaltered whereas the variance of the mean value becomes negligible thus allowing to conclude that the process is stationary in a statistical sense being the autocovariance analysis naturally biased by the order with which the different records are collected the nbb and mbb methods where the total signals are divided in bootstrapped series and rearranged have been also considered table 8 tables 9 and 10 show low and similar uncertainties both for the primary variables and for their standard deviations this meaning that the experimental acquisitions are long enough to be unaffected by their collection conversely the uncertainties associated to the secondary variables evaluated with bootstrap method are slightly larger although lower than the 3 the quantiles of the secondary variables are affected by greater uncertainties as indicated by table 11 and detectable by figs 13 figs 14 and 15 it should be finally stressed that the non zero time averaged value of the flight deck velocity comes from a trivial error on the bridge acceleration integration that may be assumed negligible 4 2 regular wave tests for the assessment of the stochastic regular wave uq a set of seakeeping tests in regular waves has been performed during the tests the wave amplitude the heave the pitch and the resistance are recorded once the signals are acquired their time average is computed and subtracted from the original signal a fourier transform is performed in order to check that the signals energies are confined in a narrow band around the first harmonic the module of the associated fourier complex coefficient is taken as representative value at the corresponding frequency the set of regular waves should be representative of the irregular wave campaign i e of the benchmark to this aim a test matrix consisting of 33 monochromatic progressive waves with constant height equal to the mean wave height h m 61 1 m m see table 4 and frequencies uniformly distributed over the encounter frequencies interval of the irregular wave is designed the resulting test matrix is summarized in table 12 the run 16 in red which is relative to a frequency near the heave peak has been repeated for six times in order to assess the repeatability in the worst condition in table 12 the wave steepness of the incident wave are reported as well it has to be highlighted that the range of frequencies wave steepness considered is within the region of low error max 5 5 and low uncertainty 4 of the wave maker operability table 2 however to increase the confidence on the generated wave the wave height has been measured at each run by the kenek fixed on the carriage placed 3 m ahead the catamaran the fourier transform of the signals allows to evaluate the amplitude of the first harmonics as well as of higher order harmonics which should be negligible the measurements are reported in the plots of fig 16 first harmonics of the incident waves are reported in the left plot with square symbols whereas the red line represents the desired value as expected thus confirming the validation assessment of the wave maker reported in section 2 3 the amplitudes of the generated waves show a satisfactory agreement with the desiderated value the percentage errors blue line in the left plot of figure respect to the desired amplitude a 0 30 55 mm is everywhere lower than the 4 although increasing with frequency a mean value of 1 4 is found on average over the whole frequency range thus remaining under the threshold of 5 assumed by the ittc standards load and responses commit 2002 as a requirement in order to evaluate the linearity of the generated waves the second harmonics are also estimated and reported in the right frame of fig 16 the amplitudes are all less than 2 mm with an average value over the frequency range less than 1 mm solid red line which corresponds to about the 3 0 of a 0 4 2 1 calm water resistance during the seakeeping tests the hull resistance is measured through the load cells described in section 2 2 for every run performed the first half of the basin is traveled in calm water whereas in the second half regular waves are encountered the calm water component is recorded every run and may be exploited for an estimation of the repeatability of the experiments in terms of steady force measurements for each run calm water resistances are reported in the left frame of fig 17 with a mean value of 32 8n on the abscissa the wave frequency related to the corresponding run number is indicated the results highlight a satisfactory repeatability for the resistance measurement with a mean percentage deviation from the average value of 1 2 fig 17 shows right panel the mean error with a red line while with blue dots the percentage deviations of single runs are reported a maximum deviation of 3 8 ensures a narrow error band it is worth to remark that this result is comparable with the repeatability of the wave generation discussed above ensuring the reliability of all the facilities instrumentations equipment 4 2 2 in wave measurements in fig 18 the mean amplitude rms and phase shift for heave pitch resistance bridge acceleration and flight deck velocity in dimensional form versus the non dimensional wavelength are shown the peak on the bridge acceleration amplitude 6 33m s2 is recorded in correspondence of λ l p p 1 1 where the maximum in the heave motion 59 43 mm appears while the maximum of the flight deck velocity 0 38 m s is little anticipated at λ l p p 1 08 for the sake of completeness in table 13 the lowest the medium and the highest natural frequency cases from left to right respectively are reported as it can be observed the second harmonics amplitudes are always negligible compared to the first harmonics ones in the experiment at f 0 6323 hz at the heave peak the second harmonics amplitude of the resistance is equal to the 24 5 of the first harmonics whereas at the lowest frequency only the 0 8 revealing a modulation in the load cell response due to the intense heave motion generally the second harmonics components of heave pitch and bridge acceleration are rather negligible until f 0 8758 hz where the wavemaker experiences some problem in generating linear monochromatic waves conversely the resistance results more affected by a significant nonlinearity response with greater amplitudes in the second harmonics components up to the 80 of the first harmonics the rao of heave and pitch ξ 3 a and ξ 5 ka respectively are compared with those available literature on the top row of fig 20 whereas the phase shifts respect to the phases of the incoming waves are indicated in the bottom the comparisons seem to be in good agreement a repeatability analysis has been assessed at frequency of 0 6526 hz i e λ l pp 1 22 run 16 in table 12 the chosen frequency corresponds to a condition close to the heave peak repeatability has been estimated through 6 repetitions results are summarized in table 14 satisfactory repeatability properties are seen for all the variables measured being the standard deviation lower than the 1 thus assessing a well restraint of the random errors in fig 21 the non dimensional added resistance 37 r a w r w r c ρ a 2 g 2 b 2 l p p where rw and rc are the in wave mean and calm water resistances is sketched versus the encounter frequency left frame and compared with the data available in literature right frame for high frequencies and short wave lengths the added resistance is caused by the wave diffraction and becomes rather constant r a w 2 whereas at longer wave lengths and low frequencies the radiation is the dominant effect at the latter conditions r a w becomes negligible for λ l p p high enough approaching the total resistance to calm water condition at the present froude number a negligible added resistance is found for λ l p p 2 5 the peak of the added resistance occurs at λ l p p 1 17 and it represents a condition of generation of large waves in the vicinity of resonant heave and pitch of the system due to an encounter frequency around 1 30 hz the corresponding non dimensional wave length is about 1 16 related to a peak r aw 12 which is in good agreement with experiments discussed in he et al 2013 as shown in the right frame of fig 21 where the peaks for different froude numbers are in the wave length range λ l pp between 1 and 1 5 and the corresponding amplitudes span from 7 5 to 17 as evident the added resistance peaks move toward lower values of λ l pp as the fr number decreases in the present case the peak is very close to the one of castiglione et al 2011 for fr 0 45 which is close to the fr 0 425 used for the present experiments as visible from the same figure the short and long length behaviors are in accordance with the literature under the hypothesis of linear behavior i e small motions and uncoupled ship motions the response of a ship in waves can be mathematically described by the classical second order forced mass springer and damper system see lewis 1989 lloyd 1989 therefore the theoretical natural frequencies for heave f n3 and pitch f n5 can be simply derived considering the homogenous system i e with zero external force if heave added mass and pitch added inertia are assumed to be equal to the mass m and the pitch moment of inertia i 55 respectively natural frequencies can be computed as 38 f n 3 g c w p 8 π 2 c b t f n 5 ρ g c i t 2 b 3 l p p 96 π 2 i 55 where cwp aw 2b lpp is the water plane coefficient c b δ 2bl pp t is the block coefficient δ is the volume of fluid displaced and cit 12 it 2b 3 lpp is the coefficient of inertia of the water plane area about the y axis a w denotes the water plane area of the hull and i t its moment of inertia these quantities can be computed from the hydrostatics characteristics of the model giving a w 1 093 m2 and i t 0 589 m4 the quantities ρga w and ρgi t are respectively the restoring heave force and pitch torque under the cited assumption natural heave and pitch frequencies are estimated to be f n3 1 27 hz and f n5 1 17 hz respectively as remarked by lewis 1989 the natural frequency does not depend on the froude number moreover it is important to note that these estimations were developed for mono hull displacement vessels and their validity for high speed semi displacement multihulls is still an open issue at a given froude the frequency at which maximal motion occurs ranges between the resonance one and that of maximal excitation forces moments lewis 1989 showed that a non dimensional heave excitation force goes to unity for low frequencies whereas the dimensional pitch excitation moment has a peak for the ratio λ l pp 1 33 in the present investigation an heave peak is observed at λ l p p 1 22 and a pitch peak at λ l p p 1 45 as may be observed in fig 19 for low encounter frequencies the non dimensional heave and pitch tend to unity in agreement with lewis 1989 whereas for high frequencies the hulls motions are practically indifferent to the presence of short length waves and consequently the heave and the pitch become negligible 4 2 3 effect of the mounting system the mounting system used for towing the catamaran described in section 2 1 is now briefly discussed in terms of the effects on the added resistance as shown in fig 22 the use of soft springs in the mounting system does not alter the rao s of heave and pitch see bottom frames in fig 22 while it affects significantly the resistance of the catamaran with the first designed system the mounting was not enough rigid so that the elastic response of the beam induced an over prediction of the ship resistance in the frequency range near the maximum of the heave about 0 65 hz the first harmonics shown in the top right frame of fig 22 highlights this aspect more clearly the new mounting system is more rigid than the former one and is designed to be used with or without additional springs fig 22 shows the effect when soft springs are used an excessive filtering is visible through an under prediction of the added resistance although heave and pitch raos are unaffected and a negligible amplitude in the 1st harmonics component it has to be highlighted that even if the use of soft springs could be ideal for added resistance prediction it is not possible to use them for the current purposes since for an uncertainty quantification assessment estimation of the first order harmonic is required several springs with different stiffness have been tested revealing that soft springs are more effective in their filtering action being the stiffer ones scarcely distinguishable by the rigid arrangement 4 3 regular wave model the set of 33 regular wave tests equally spaced in encounter frequency and indicated in section 4 2 has been adopted as training set for the uq meta model the test responses are evaluated in terms of heave and pitch raos shown in fig 19 whereas the pitch the bridge acceleration and the flight deck velocity are used as training set for the definition of the meta model the expected value ev i j and the standard deviation sd i j indicated in equation 29 are estimated through spline interpolator as sketched in the left plot of fig 23 the evaluation of the ssa is outlined in table 15 where is evident that the irregular and regular tests present a good agreement with a mean error under 10 and a maximum error on the bridge acceleration around the 9 8 conversely the deterministic regular wave model calculated through formula 26 is used to evaluate the expected value of the resistance which is 37 85n with a difference of 3 71 with respect to the irregular case the uncertainties indicated in table 15 for the regular case are calculated with the autocovariance method equation 16 without considering the non diagonal terms in the autocovariance matrix this leads to a value independent by the specific ssa value and only depends on the total number of items in order to highlight the effect given by the increasing of wave frequencies in the training set needed for an acceptable meta model prediction the convergence of the interpolation curves in terms of expected value of the pitch angle is sketched in the right plot of fig 23 in table 16 the ssas convergence for the pitch angle the bridge acceleration and the flight deck velocity are also shown the pitch angle and the flight deck velocity exhibit a rather fast convergence with an achievement of the final value with just 9 runs conversely the bridge acceleration shows a slower trend with a 27 of variation between 17 and 33 runs the comparison between regular and irregular tests in terms of heave and pitch rao s is depicted in fig 24 being the rao a simplified statistic used to predict the heave and pitch motions in a real sea state it is of great interest to evaluate how this assumption is in agreement with the irregular wave experiments even for the average sea state condition ss5 of the present work something similar was investigated by bouscasse et al 2013 although for mild sea state conditions ss2 and ss3 and a different energy density spectrum pierson moskowitz from the figure is evident how the pitch rao is in good agreement with the irregular tests in the whole range of frequencies of the incoming waves conversely the heave rao is very well reproduced in the range 0 4 0 75 hz where the behaviour may be considered linear while the tests are in some disagreement for higher frequencies in particular the range of well agreement corresponds to an encounter frequency range of 0 6 1 7 hz where the added resistance presents its maximum concluding at the present conditions the description of a formed sea state through a set of regular waves is able to reproduce the heave and pitch rao s as well as through a meta model the ssa of the irregular wave experiments in the framework of the numerical simulations this aspect could be very important because it avoids the necessity to design a very fine grid for achieving a well resolved free surface when a real sea state is simulated conversely a set of regular waves and the adoption of a metamodel like the one described in the present work are able to adequately describe the irregular wave sea condition 5 conclusions a statistically converged experimental benchmark study of a catamaran in irregular waves is presented along with regular wave uncertainty quantification uq model used to approximate the relevant statistical estimators the validation variables are x force z θ z b and z f d values from the time series are addressed as primary variables whereas heights associated to mean crossing waves are indicated as secondary variables a massive experimental campaign has been carried out with a great accuracy in the assessment of facilities and instrumentations reliabilities thoroughly detailed in the present work the global error due to the wave generations is well limited within the standard limit of 5 as well as the instrumental errors in capturing the hull motions different mounting systems have been tested for the current analysis the system which ensures a rigid fix with the carriage with negligible elastic reaction has been demonstrated to be the more suitable the current approach addresses the statistics of the relevant variables providing their ev sd and their related uncertainties the autocovariance and bootstrap methods are applied in order to estimate expected values and confidence intervals for ev sd and quantile function additionally the deterministic regular wave model assesses the ev of the x force whereas the stochastic regular wave uq focuses on ssas of θ z b and z d as relevant merit factors for design optimization at the current stage of the work the discussion on which method provides the most realistic appropriate validation uncertainty still remains open on the one hand the present implementation of the autocovariance and bootstrap methods has four main advantages 1 uncertainties do not depend solely on the number of time steps but also on the number of encountered waves which is a real physical parameter and not an arbitrary implementation parameter 2 it provides validation values and uncertainties not only for the time series ev and sd but also distribution parameters such as quantiles 3 it can be applied not only to primary variables time series but also to secondary variables amplitudes height period 4 it can detect possible stationarity issues in the time series the main drawback of the block bootstrap method is that the time series is not directly assessed for correlation a second drawback is the assumption of independence of the sample required by the bootstrap method used for the secondary variables on the other hand the time series method has the main advantage of evaluating directly the ev and sd uncertainty stemming from the wave record dependence as a drawback it does not directly provide confidence intervals for other parameters than time series ev and sd and does not address directly possible stationarity issues at least when concatenated records are used a combination of the two methods is therefore advisable ongoing and future work will address a nested array approach possibly the experiments will be also extended to a longer run length the relationship of the overall validation uncertainty to both the number of wave components and the run length depends on the problem sea state spectrum speed geometry and will be quantitatively investigated in future work at least for current problem u sn and u d will be included in the validation analysis additionally ev and distribution error and uncertainty will be included in the assessment of the stochastic regular wave uq model acknowledgements the

22244,irregular wave experiments are essential to assess the statistics of ship responses in realistic operating conditions and to validate the associated numerical simulations the cost and time required to achieve statistically converged results are usually high both experimentally and computationally for these reasons high quality statistically converged irregular wave studies are limited in the literature and models to reduce the experimental computational costs are highly desirable here a statistically converged experimental benchmark study of a catamaran in irregular waves is presented along with regular wave uncertainty quantification uq model used to approximate the relevant statistical estimators the statistical assessment is achieved through recently developed approaches based on the analysis of the autocovariance function of the ship response along with block bootstrap and bootstrap methods the validation variables are the wave elevation axial force heave and pitch motions vertical acceleration of the bridge and vertical velocity of the flight deck values from the time series are addressed as primary variables whereas heights associated to mean crossing waves are referred to as secondary variables the statistical uncertainty related to expected value ev and standard deviation sd of primary variables is evaluated through autocovariance analysis and block bootstrap methods the latter are used to assess also the quantile function ev sd and quantile function of secondary variables are then assessed by the bootstrap method regular wave models assess the ev of the axial force and single significant amplitudes twice the sd of pitch acceleration and velocity as relevant merit factors used for design optimization in earlier studies

of unsteady rans and potential flow solutions with experimental data and showing the effects of the number of inlet wave components on the validation errors the present paper is organized as follows in section 2 an overview of the experimental setup with a presentation of the instrumentation used is given in section 3 statistical estimators and confidence intervals for regular and irregular waves are indicated in section 4 the results of the experiments in irregular and in regular waves are outlined together with their uncertainty analysis and finally compared in section 5 conclusions are offered 2 experimental setup in this section experimental setup is described in details the catamaran model is shown in section 2 1 in order to measure motions and longitudinal force the vessel is completely instrumented whereas the towing carriage is equipped for the wave height measurements instrumentations and the facility are illustrated in sections 2 2 and 2 3 it has to be highlighted that a carefully assessment of the wave generation and propagation has been pursued being mandatory for the high fidelity measurements required for a valuable uq analysis 2 1 catamaran model the tu delft 372 catamaran van t veer van t veer 1998a van t veer 1998b has been selected as a case study for the current benchmark a fiberglass model was manufactured cnr inm model 2554 at the same scale of the delft one i e lpp 3m a full scale vessel has never been built anyhow in order to properly select the operative condition in a real scenario a 100m catamaran at full scale i e a λ 33 33 scale factor has been considered in the following the basic geometry and the body plan of the model are sketched in fig 1 the cnr inm 2554 model is shown in fig 2 the main geometric hydrostatic and hydrodynamic properties at model and full scales are given in table 1 the model is towed through a twin gimbal one for each demi hull rigidly connected with a transversal beam which ensures free pitch motion around the center of gravity and a vertical beam sliding in a linear bearing which allows free heave motion the linking system ensures that surge sway and roll are so restricted that they may be assumed as restrained yaw is kept fixed by means of a motion preventer to increase the rigidity of the catamaran model the two demi hulls are connected with two transversal aluminum beams ahead and behind the center of gravity and a third aluminum beam at the aft perpendicular as shown in fig 2 the configuration ensures enough rigidity of the catamaran without using a deck in the fore part of the model therefore no deck slamming phenomena occurred during the tests the total weight and its distribution are carefully checked in order to match the prescribed displacement and dynamical properties current regular and irregular wave tests are focused on first and second harmonic components of the dynamical resistance and kinematic motions quantities therefore the experimental setup should be able to provide time accurate measurements of loads and motions different linking systems have been tested the first one was not completely rigid so that as it will be shown later the motion of the beam induced a large elastic response of the mounting system leading to a large over prediction of both added resistance and the amplitude of its second harmonic component this problem was particularly evident due to the high speed at which the catamaran has been tested to overcome this issue a second more rigid mounting solution was designed and built as in fig 3 this new arrangement was tested either with or without soft springs as it will be shown later the use of soft springs works as a low pass filter damping out first and higher harmonics thus providing the mean in wave resistance only on the contrary without springs the system has been tested and verified to provide accurate measurements without any large deformation which would affect the measurements themselves 2 2 instrumentations 2 2 1 motion measurements a krypton optical system with an acquisition frequency of 800 hz is used to measure the motion of the model it consists of three linear ccd cameras k600 camera unit which detect the position of a reference system fixed to the body identified through three infrared leds the plate with the infrared leds is placed in the stern region of the left hull as sketched in fig 4 the spatial position of each led is found with a high resolution through a triangulation procedure the field of view of the cameras spans from 1 5m to 6m the accuracy of the system is distributed in three zones zone i from 1 5m to 3 5m with a vol accuracy of 0 09 0 01 mm m and a single point accuracy of 0 060 0 007 mm m zone ii from 3 5m to 5 0m with a vol accuracy of 0 09 0 025 mm m and a single point accuracy of 0 060 0 017 mm m zone iii from 5 0m to 6 0 m with a vol accuracy of 0 190 0 025 mm m and a single point accuracy of 0 130 0 017 mm m where the measurement uncertainty is expressed for a confidence level of 95 according to iso 10360 ii standard in the current setup the distance between the ccd cameras and the target plate is 2 5m therefore the zone i is the reference one with a global accuracy of 0 225 0 025 mm and a single point accuracy of 0 150 0 017 mm 2 2 2 resistance measurements for the direct measurement of the total resistance in waves two omega lc204 load cells with maximum range of 445n and accuracy around 0 1 are used they are designed to be surface mounted with the load applied through the mounting stud the cells are placed between the gimbal and the ship model one for each gimbal the added resistance in the ship frame of reference i e along the longitudinal axis of the catamaran results from the subtraction of the calm water resistance to the average value of the total resistance in waves since the load cells are mounted on the hull non inertial effects should be estimated and subtracted to this aim the required time histories of the acceleration in correspondence of the cells positions have been reconstructed from the measurements of the motion 2 2 3 acceleration measurements the acceleration of the model is measured at the bridge and at the flight deck two accelerometers are placed at the following positions bridge accelerometer horizontal 0 30l pp from the front perpendicular fp vertical 0 15l pp from

and 30 cm from the keel line the accelerometer is visible in fig 4 the flight deck velocity is obtained through time integration 2 2 4 incoming wave measurements the elevations of the incident waves are measured at two different stations the first one at 3m ahead the model which is considered as the measurement of the undisturbed incident wave while the second measurement is acquired by a probe placed approximately 3m aside the hull at the lcg position see fig 5 this wave measurement could be partially affected by the hull for lower speeds but it is only used to compute the phase shift between the incident wave and the motion of the catamaran the wave height has been measured by means of kenek probes which is a non intrusive instrumentation with accuracy of 0 1 mm and a maximum range of measurement of 150 mm this probe is suitable for low speed seakeeping tests and moderate wave steepness therefore it has been considered accurate enough for the wave steepness range and fr number at which the present tests are carried on 2 3 facility wave maker validation sea keeping tests are performed in the emilio castagneto towing tank one of the cnr inm formerly cnr insean facilities which dimensions are 220m 9m and 3 6m in length width and depth respectively the tank is equipped with a towing carriage capable to operate at the maximum speed of 15 0 m s carriage speed fluctuations are less than 0 01 head wave system is generated by means of a kempf remmers wave maker the wave maker is equipped with a flap plunger hinged 1 80m below the calm water level with a maximum angle range 13 frequency range 0 1 1 8 hz in order to ensure reliable and accurate seakeeping test measurements the wave maker has been recently revamped and its performances i e accuracy and repeatability of the generated wave systems have been carefully evaluated a campaign for the qualification of the facility has been performed it involved the estimation of the transfer function of the plunger stroke versus the frequency the determination of the frequency response function of the mechanical system and the estimation of the error and repeatability of the generated waves the validation assessment has been performed for the whole operating range of the system the generated wave system has been measured by probes mounted on several transversal beams placed all along the channel length allowing the estimation of both the two dimensionality of the wave its dissipation along the tank and possible reflections form the basin end which should be dampen by the presence of the absorbing beach validation assessments for the regular wave generation are reported in table 2 three height over wave length ratios in the whole range of the operating frequencies of the wave maker have been tested the test covers the generation of the regular waves from linear ka 0 052 to high non linear ka 0 209 ranges as clear from table 2 low errors up to 5 are estimated for linear and weakly non linear ka 0 1 waves whereas as expected higher errors and unsatisfactory repeatability are observed for highly non linear waves ka 0 1 moreover larger errors and uncertainties are generally seen for higher frequencies regardless the wave steepness f 1 hz i e shortest waves this indicates that the flap plunger of the wave maker activated by a hydraulic servomechanism experiences difficulties to generate high frequency waves moreover negligible reflection from the basin ends and poorly significant wave damping along the basin have been observed however it has to be noticed that the regular wave tests that will follow are pursued for a frequency steepness range for which the error in the amplitude is not larger than 5 whereas this limit is partially overtaken in the irregular wave tests error and uncertainty in the generation of an irregular wave system has been verified only for the condition under analysis in this paper and it will be presented in section 4 1 2 3 statistical variables and methodss the methodology for stochastic uncertainty quantification employed in this work follows the one already used in diez et al 2018b however for the sake of completeness the methodology is also briefly recall here the validation variables are the wave elevation ζ x force positive forward heave z g positive upward pitch angle θ positive bow up vertical acceleration of the bridge z b positive upward and vertical velocity of the flight deck z d positive upward time series values are addressed as primary variables whereas mean crossing amplitudes height and period are indicated as secondary variables the subseries and bootstrap methods are applied in order to estimate the validation values and 95 confidence intervals for expected value ev standard deviation sd and quantile function additionally validation values and confidence intervals for time series ev and sd are evaluated by time series theory based on the sample variance and size and the autocovariance function the stochastic regular wave uq focuses on ssa s of pitch acceleration and velocity as relevant merit factors for design optimization 3 1 statistical estimators and

belenky et al 2013 the confidence intervals associated to a single wave record are evaluated using the variance of the mean var ev and the variance of the variance var sd 2 the former is 7 v a r e v v

moving block bootstrap method mbb in addition and for comparison to the nbb method validation values and confidence intervals of the statistical estimators of eqs 1 4 are evaluated using a mbb method broglia et al 2019 künsch 1989 miecznikowski et al 2010b nato stanag 4154 1997 politis and romano 1994 politis et al 1999 in the case of moving blocks the original blocks to pick from are in number c

bootstrap method the validation values and confidence intervals of the secondary variables are calculated using the bootstrap method efron 1981 the method consists in constructing an empirical probability distribution from the sample assumed independent and identically distributed by assigning a probability of 1 m to each item this empirical probability distribution function represents the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimate of the unknown actual distribution the associated empirical cdf is given by eq 3 from the empirical cdf calculate a number of b new sets bootstraps each of

2018a specifically bi and uni variate uq models have been applied to ship response predictions considering the wave period height and frequency as stochastic variables diez et al 2018a the uni variate uq model considering stochastic wave frequency is used here for the ev of the x force and the sd of the motions whose maximum single significant amplitude ssa is prescribed by the nato stanag 4154 standardization agreement nato stanag 4154 1997 a latin hypercube monte carlo method with importance sampling is applied using a number of l uniformly distributed regular wave experiments from metamodel predictions by radial basis functions volpi et al 2015 the ev for the force is then evaluated as 26 e v f x r c w e v 2 m 0 e v i f x r c w a i 2 i 1 l f ω i 1 i 1 l 2 m 0 e v i f x r c w a

distribution 27 2 a i h π 8 h s for all i and period t i 2π ω i a i is the amplitude of the i th regular wave the probability density function is defined as f ω i s ω i m 0 where m 0 is the spectrum energy zero th moment the sd 2 of θ a b and z d is computed as 28 s d j 2 e v σ ˆ i 2 j i 1 l f ω i 1 i 1 l σ ˆ i 2 j f ω i where using the moment transport theorem 29 σ ˆ i 2 j 2 m 0 s d i 2 j e v i

approximated here by eqs 12 and 16 without considering the non diagonal terms in the autocovariance matrix finally ssa 2 sd 4 seakeeping tests the north pacific ocean environment has been selected as the operating conditions in a real scenario this choice was motivated by the wide literature on the energy spectral distributions obtained from measurement campaigns by off shore industries in table 3 the characteristics of the north pacific ocean are indicated the mean wave height trough to crest of the highest third of the waves h 1 3 and the most probable modal wave period t m are shown for sea states from 1 to 8 following diez et al 2013 a 100m full scale length catamaran advancing in head waves is considered with a variable operational speed within the range from fr 0 115 to 0 575 in the present work an average froude number of 0 425 and a sea state 5 highlighted in table 3 are chosen the operational environment is then characterized by a significant wave height h 1 3 of 3 25 m at full scale corresponding to 95 5 mm at model scale this yields the mean wave height h m π 8 h 1 3 to 2 04 m at full scale which corresponds to 61 10 mm at model scale the most probably wave period t m corresponds to the modal frequency of 9 7 s at full scale and 1 68 s at model scale in table 4 the main sea characteristics are indicated it is worth to notice that the maximum steepness is close to the linearity limit 4 1 irregular wave tests the irregular wave system has been generated by considering the bretschneider energy spectrum which is the best representation of the present scenario being developed for modeling the north pacific area from the linear theory it is known see faltinsen 2005 that the total energy of a single monochromatic wave of amplitude η is ρgη 2 2 in the case of irregular sea a spectral analysis of the gravity wave amplitudes leads to a similar definition for the energy amount associated to a wave with a specific frequency ω 30 1 2 ρ g η 2 ω e ω δ ω and from the definition of the energy density s ω e ω ρg it simply reduces to 31 η 2 ω 2 s ω δ ω obviously the wave amplitude spectrum depends on the interval δ ω chosen because the energy carried by a single wave component depends on the integral of s ω over the considered frequency interval the spectrum s ω is usually expressed in the form 32 s ω a ω 5 e x p b ω 4 where the definition of a and b is arbitrary and normally is referred to the desired sea environment for the bretschneider spectrum 33 s ω 5 16 ω m 4 ω 5 h 1 3 2 e x p 5 4 ω m 4 ω 4 where ω m is the peak modal angular frequency and h 1 3 is the significant wave height whereas t m 2 π ω m is the period associated to the modal frequency the system of irregular waves is then generated by a linear superposition of elemental wave components 34 η t k 1 n w a k c o s ω k t φ k where n w is the number of components a k 2 s ω k δ ω and φ k is a random phase for both the validation test and the irregular seakeeping tests of the catamaran the wave is generated using n w 993 components ranging from 0 18 to 1 84 hz wider than the range of the regular wave frequencies reported in table 4 4 1 1 irregular wave generation validation before proceeding to seakeeping tests the wave maker has been validated in order to assess its capabilities in reproducing the required sea state to this end ten acquisitions of the wave amplitudes have been performed acquisitions are made in a fixed point of the basin about 25m from the wave maker each recording lasts 250s the time history of the wave height including its running mean and rms for one acquisition is depicted in fig 6 it is worth to underline that a satisfactory convergence for both the mean and the rms of the wave height has been achieved after each run the ten acquisitions have been post processed in order to evaluate the global spectrum as well as the spectra of each single acquisition to inspect their convergence toward the theoretical one this approach allows assessing the minimum recording time required for the seakeeping test when the catamaran has encountered a well enough reproduced sea spectrum the acquisition time may be considered good for the estimation of the statistics in fig 7 the energy densities spectra obtained by the wave amplitude time signal are shown the smooth curves are obtained through a natural smoothing spline approximation of the original data with a reconstruction via piecewise cubic polynomials with 1000 segments for each curve the endpoints of each segment are interpolated the figure depicts the spectrum convergence obtained by doubling the number of samples a clear distinction among the different distributions is evident near the peak and at higher frequencies in particular it should be noticed that the convergence is monotonic in the range 0 2hz 0 5 hz where the wave behavior is fundamentally linear on the contrary at high frequencies 0 9 hz no convergence toward the theoretical spectrum is detectable in the medium range 0 5hz 0 9 hz a convergence in the peak values highlighted in the side table of fig 7 is evident although oscillating but monotonic in magnitude the results are very encouraging for low frequencies i e frequencies lower than 0 5 hz where the wave maker is highly reliable conversely for higher frequencies higher than 0 8 hz the spectra manifest an evident energy increase with respect to the theoretical one this effect is mainly ascribable to the difficulty of the wave maker in accurately producing short wavelengths standing the mechanical limits of the flap plunger quantitative error estimation is not trivial an l 2 norm of the relative error with the theoretical spectrum within the whole frequencies range could be meaningless because of the flap plunger problems at high frequencies explained above moreover when an experimental campaign of measurement is carried out the error on the total energy content and on the position and intensity of the energy density peak are by far more important than the local error on s ω for this reason a convergence based on the peak error and on the global energy is preferred the global error is calculated as the difference between the theoretical and the measured integrals of the energy densities evaluated between ω min and ω max these latter are respectively the lower and higher frequency corresponding to an energy density the 5 of the theoretical spectrum peak in this case ω min 0 4 hz ω max 1 38 hz as suggested by the ittc guidelines load and responses commit 2002 the percentage error between the energy peak of the measured spectrum and the theoretical one is shown in the second column of the side table of fig 7 while the total energy is reported in the third column as anticipated the convergence in terms of the peak intensity is quite monotonic in magnitude whereas an oscillating behavior is observed in terms of total energy nevertheless a satisfactory error is seen with values lower than 6 for the latter and lower than 1 for the peak error once the spectrum can be assumed to correctly represent the theoretical one the calculation of the second and fourth momenta are useful to verify that the bandwidth coefficient suggested by mollison mollison and evansfalcão 1985 falls in the correct range 35 ε 1 m 2 2 m 0 m 4 0 59 which is in satisfactory agreement with the theoretical value of 0 56 it should be pointed out that for an ocean environment a typical broadband value of 0 5 ԑ 0 6 is expected so that the present value means that the sea spectrum produced is really representing an ocean environment the measured statistics of the generated sea are reported in table 5 as expected the value of h1 3 obtained from the measurements 101 76 mm is close to the expected value of 97 5 mm indicated in table 3 with a percentage error of 4 37 the total number of encountered waves n w is a quite vague value that can be calculated in different manners from a direct evaluation of the negative zero crossing it would be equal to 1825 but by considering the mean zero crossing period t zc m 2 m 0 1 27 s this value rises to 1879 however if the average peak to peak period t c m 4 m 2 1 02 s is taken into account the final number of encountered waves becomes 2337 by stressing the information coming from the spectrum and being the data in agreement with a raw measurement of zero crossing events the value of 1879 will be considered hereafter in the left frame of fig 8 the running means and rms are highlighted for the global time history showing the asymptotic value of 25 98 mm which represents the standard deviation in the right plot of fig 8 the amplitude percentage occurrence of the irregular waves shows a correct gaussian distribution finally in order to exclude unwanted periodic signals in the stochastic realizations of the experiments the autocorrelation function is evaluated the autocorrelation is the correlation of a signal with a delayed copy of itself as a function of delay τ differently from the pdf which contains information on the amplitude variation of the process the autocorrelation gives an indication of the time variation of the process allowing to evaluate periodic patterns even if they are covered by a white noise it is defined by the formula 36 r τ i 1 s d 2 k 1 n i e j t k e v j j t k i e v j where τ i is the time lag and e x is the expected value operator if a signal varies slowly in time its value at times t and t τ remains quite similar and the autocorrelation will be positive while if it varies quickly the autocorrelation will assume a value close to zero in fig 9 the autocorrelation for the time signals of all the measured quantities is reported demonstrating that any periodic pattern is present in the time signals and they are only related to stochastic processes 4 1 2 irregular wave tests once the capabilities of the wave maker in correctly reproducing the required sea state have been appraised the seakeeping tests have been performed the experiments were carried out at the reference speed of 2 305 m s model scale i e at a length based froude number equal to 0 425 by taking into account an operative length of 220m for the towing tank the time window for each run is approximately 95s excluding the transient phases acceleration and stop a useful time window of about 50s may be assumed for each run this means that in each test about 289 s at full scale are simulated according to the ittc recommended procedures and guidelines load and responses commit 2002 the test duration should cover at least 30 min of equivalent full scale this means that measurement must be recorded for at least 6 runs in the present analysis for an accurate evaluation of the statistics and in order to guarantee good convergence properties 18 runs were considered the total time of acquisition corresponds to 86 6 min at full scale exceeding almost 3 times the ittc recommendations as already stated the considered sea spectrum is the bretschneider one with characteristics defined in the previous section the final data are obtained by concatenating the 18 runs through fading in out ramps with a length of about 1 5 modal periods such ensuring negligible frequency analysis errors according to the current setup the number of time samples is n 90114 this assures the model to encounter 1464 waves see table 6 in addition to the validation reported in the previous subsection the quality of the irregular wave system has been further validated its accuracy is summarized in table 6 where zero first and second order spectrum moments are compared with the theoretical values the errors are generally less than 1 5 decreasing for the higher moments with an average error of about 0 5 table 7 shows the uq assessment of the encountered wave train the validation study includes the wave elevation as primary variable and the wave height as secondary variable the wave elevation and its autocovariance are presented in fig 10 the wave elevation statistics is assessed by autocovariance analysis and both non overlapping and moving block bootstrap methods see table 7 errors of ev sd and quantiles versus theoretical values are reasonable being smaller than 3 the associated uncertainties are also rather small less than 3 the wave height statistics have a similar trend with larger errors and uncertainties fig 11 shows the pdfs and the quantiles of wave amplitude and the wave height which represents the secondary variable differently from the distribution for the primary variable the secondary variable gives a more direct feeling of the sea encountered by the ship during the straight advancing the most probable wave height is about 44 mm in fig 12 the pdf and the quantile function for the resistance are reported the distributions are referred to the signal where the non inertia effects due to a relatively small surge motion are subtracted in principle the surge motion should be constrained but it would be possible only with an infinitely rigid transversal beam so that it remains unrealistic non inertial effects are estimated by assuming the added mass contribution equal to the 10 of the ship model mass the apparent force term is then 1 1 δ d η 1 d t where η 1 represents the surge motion acquired by the kripton system and δ is displacement defined in table 1 pdfs and quantiles for heave and pitch motions are reported in fig 13 and fig 14 whereas the ones for the flight deck velocity and the bridge acceleration are in fig 15 validation for resistance heave pitch bridge acceleration and flight deck velocity time series assessed with the various methods described in diez et al 2018b are reported in table 8 table 9 and table 10 for primary variables and in table 11 for secondary variables in order to normalize the results the uncertainties are expressed in percentage of 2sd since the process j t is assumed to be stationary its autocovariance function depends only on the difference in time time lag between the two points following belenky et al 2015 it is useful to stress that while the term 8 in formula 7 represents the variance of the mean estimate of a random variable the term 9 highlights in turn the dependence between the data points of a stochastic process if the process may be assumed as an uncorrelated white noise the result is identical to a random variable one because the auto covariance function of the white noise equals zero for all non zero time lags from table 8 the low values of the uncertainties on the mean values reflect low variances on diagonal and off diagonal terms being equation 7 a sum of two positive terms the first one goes to zero for the number of items going to infinity whereas the second one goes to a stationary value this means that by enriching the items with longer time histories the autocovariance function remains unaltered whereas the variance of the mean value becomes negligible thus allowing to conclude that the process is stationary in a statistical sense being the autocovariance analysis naturally biased by the order with which the different records are collected the nbb and mbb methods where the total signals are divided in bootstrapped series and rearranged have been also considered table 8 tables 9 and 10 show low and similar uncertainties both for the primary variables and for their standard deviations this meaning that the experimental acquisitions are long enough to be unaffected by their collection conversely the uncertainties associated to the secondary variables evaluated with bootstrap method are slightly larger although lower than the 3 the quantiles of the secondary variables are affected by greater uncertainties as indicated by table 11 and detectable by figs 13 figs 14 and 15 it should be finally stressed that the non zero time averaged value of the flight deck velocity comes from a trivial error on the bridge acceleration integration that may be assumed negligible 4 2 regular wave tests for the assessment of the stochastic regular wave uq a set of seakeeping tests in regular waves has been performed during the tests the wave amplitude the heave the pitch and the resistance are recorded once the signals are acquired their time average is computed and subtracted from the original signal a fourier transform is performed in order to check that the signals energies are confined in a narrow band around the first harmonic the module of the associated fourier complex coefficient is taken as representative value at the corresponding frequency the set of regular waves should be representative of the irregular wave campaign i e of the benchmark to this aim a test matrix consisting of 33 monochromatic progressive waves with constant height equal to the mean wave height h m 61 1 m m see table 4 and frequencies uniformly distributed over the encounter frequencies interval of the irregular wave is designed the resulting test matrix is summarized in table 12 the run 16 in red which is relative to a frequency near the heave peak has been repeated for six times in order to assess the repeatability in the worst condition in table 12 the wave steepness of the incident wave are reported as well it has to be highlighted that the range of frequencies wave steepness considered is within the region of low error max 5 5 and low uncertainty 4 of the wave maker operability table 2 however to increase the confidence on the generated wave the wave height has been measured at each run by the kenek fixed on the carriage placed 3 m ahead the catamaran the fourier transform of the signals allows to evaluate the amplitude of the first harmonics as well as of higher order harmonics which should be negligible the measurements are reported in the plots of fig 16 first harmonics of the incident waves are reported in the left plot with square symbols whereas the red line represents the desired value as expected thus confirming the validation assessment of the wave maker reported in section 2 3 the amplitudes of the generated waves show a satisfactory agreement with the desiderated value the percentage errors blue line in the left plot of figure respect to the desired amplitude a 0 30 55 mm is everywhere lower than the 4 although increasing with frequency a mean value of 1 4 is found on average over the whole frequency range thus remaining under the threshold of 5 assumed by the ittc standards load and responses commit 2002 as a requirement in order to evaluate the linearity of the generated waves the second harmonics are also estimated and reported in the right frame of fig 16 the amplitudes are all less than 2 mm with an average value over the frequency range less than 1 mm solid red line which corresponds to about the 3 0 of a 0 4 2 1 calm water resistance during the seakeeping tests the hull resistance is measured through the load cells described in section 2 2 for every run performed the first half of the basin is traveled in calm water whereas in the second half regular waves are encountered the calm water component is recorded every run and may be exploited for an estimation of the repeatability of the experiments in terms of steady force measurements for each run calm water resistances are reported in the left frame of fig 17 with a mean value of 32 8n on the abscissa the wave frequency related to the corresponding run number is indicated the results highlight a satisfactory repeatability for the resistance measurement with a mean percentage deviation from the average value of 1 2 fig 17 shows right panel the mean error with a red line while with blue dots the percentage deviations of single runs are reported a maximum deviation of 3 8 ensures a narrow error band it is worth to remark that this result is comparable with the repeatability of the wave generation discussed above ensuring the reliability of all the facilities instrumentations equipment 4 2 2 in wave measurements in fig 18 the mean amplitude rms and phase shift for heave pitch resistance bridge acceleration and flight deck velocity in dimensional form versus the non dimensional wavelength are shown the peak on the bridge acceleration amplitude 6 33m s2 is recorded in correspondence of λ l p p 1 1 where the maximum in the heave motion 59 43 mm appears while the maximum of the flight deck velocity 0 38 m s is little anticipated at λ l p p 1 08 for the sake of completeness in table 13 the lowest the medium and the highest natural frequency cases from left to right respectively are reported as it can be observed the second harmonics amplitudes are always negligible compared to the first harmonics ones in the experiment at f 0 6323 hz at the heave peak the second harmonics amplitude of the resistance is equal to the 24 5 of the first harmonics whereas at the lowest frequency only the 0 8 revealing a modulation in the load cell response due to the intense heave motion generally the second harmonics components of heave pitch and bridge acceleration are rather negligible until f 0 8758 hz where the wavemaker experiences some problem in generating linear monochromatic waves conversely the resistance results more affected by a significant nonlinearity response with greater amplitudes in the second harmonics components up to the 80 of the first harmonics the rao of heave and pitch ξ 3 a and ξ 5 ka respectively are compared with those available literature on the top row of fig 20 whereas the phase shifts respect to the phases of the incoming waves are indicated in the bottom the comparisons seem to be in good agreement a repeatability analysis has been assessed at frequency of 0 6526 hz i e λ l pp 1 22 run 16 in table 12 the chosen frequency corresponds to a condition close to the heave peak repeatability has been estimated through 6 repetitions results are summarized in table 14 satisfactory repeatability properties are seen for all the variables measured being the standard deviation lower than the 1 thus assessing a well restraint of the random errors in fig 21 the non dimensional added resistance 37 r a w r w r c ρ a 2 g 2 b 2 l p p where rw and rc are the in wave mean and calm water resistances is sketched versus the encounter frequency left frame and compared with the data available in literature right frame for high frequencies and short wave lengths the added resistance is caused by the wave diffraction and becomes rather constant r a w 2 whereas at longer wave lengths and low frequencies the radiation is the dominant effect at the latter conditions r a w becomes negligible for λ l p p high enough approaching the total resistance to calm water condition at the present froude number a negligible added resistance is found for λ l p p 2 5 the peak of the added resistance occurs at λ l p p 1 17 and it represents a condition of generation of large waves in the vicinity of resonant heave and pitch of the system due to an encounter frequency around 1 30 hz the corresponding non dimensional wave length is about 1 16 related to a peak r aw 12 which is in good agreement with experiments discussed in he et al 2013 as shown in the right frame of fig 21 where the peaks for different froude numbers are in the wave length range λ l pp between 1 and 1 5 and the corresponding amplitudes span from 7 5 to 17 as evident the added resistance peaks move toward lower values of λ l pp as the fr number decreases in the present case the peak is very close to the one of castiglione et al 2011 for fr 0 45 which is close to the fr 0 425 used for the present experiments as visible from the same figure the short and long length behaviors are in accordance with the literature under the hypothesis of linear behavior i e small motions and uncoupled ship motions the response of a ship in waves can be mathematically described by the classical second order forced mass springer and damper system see lewis 1989 lloyd 1989 therefore the theoretical natural frequencies for heave f n3 and pitch f n5 can be simply derived considering the homogenous system i e with zero external force if heave added mass and pitch added inertia are assumed to be equal to the mass m and the pitch moment of inertia i 55 respectively natural frequencies can be computed as 38 f n 3 g c w p 8 π 2 c b t f n 5 ρ g c i t 2 b 3 l p p 96 π 2 i 55 where cwp aw 2b lpp is the water plane coefficient c b δ 2bl pp t is the block coefficient δ is the volume of fluid displaced and cit 12 it 2b 3 lpp is the coefficient of inertia of the water plane area about the y axis a w denotes the water plane area of the hull and i t its moment of inertia these quantities can be computed from the hydrostatics characteristics of the model giving a w 1 093 m2 and i t 0 589 m4 the quantities ρga w and ρgi t are respectively the restoring heave force and pitch torque under the cited assumption natural heave and pitch frequencies are estimated to be f n3 1 27 hz and f n5 1 17 hz respectively as remarked by lewis 1989 the natural frequency does not depend on the froude number moreover it is important to note that these estimations were developed for mono hull displacement vessels and their validity for high speed semi displacement multihulls is still an open issue at a given froude the frequency at which maximal motion occurs ranges between the resonance one and that of maximal excitation forces moments lewis 1989 showed that a non dimensional heave excitation force goes to unity for low frequencies whereas the dimensional pitch excitation moment has a peak for the ratio λ l pp 1 33 in the present investigation an heave peak is observed at λ l p p 1 22 and a pitch peak at λ l p p 1 45 as may be observed in fig 19 for low encounter frequencies the non dimensional heave and pitch tend to unity in agreement with lewis 1989 whereas for high frequencies the hulls motions are practically indifferent to the presence of short length waves and consequently the heave and the pitch become negligible 4 2 3 effect of the mounting system the mounting system used for towing the catamaran described in section 2 1 is now briefly discussed in terms of the effects on the added resistance as shown in fig 22 the use of soft springs in the mounting system does not alter the rao s of heave and pitch see bottom frames in fig 22 while it affects significantly the resistance of the catamaran with the first designed system the mounting was not enough rigid so that the elastic response of the beam induced an over prediction of the ship resistance in the frequency range near the maximum of the heave about 0 65 hz the first harmonics shown in the top right frame of fig 22 highlights this aspect more clearly the new mounting system is more rigid than the former one and is designed to be used with or without additional springs fig 22 shows the effect when soft springs are used an excessive filtering is visible through an under prediction of the added resistance although heave and pitch raos are unaffected and a negligible amplitude in the 1st harmonics component it has to be highlighted that even if the use of soft springs could be ideal for added resistance prediction it is not possible to use them for the current purposes since for an uncertainty quantification assessment estimation of the first order harmonic is required several springs with different stiffness have been tested revealing that soft springs are more effective in their filtering action being the stiffer ones scarcely distinguishable by the rigid arrangement 4 3 regular wave model the set of 33 regular wave tests equally spaced in encounter frequency and indicated in section 4 2 has been adopted as training set for the uq meta model the test responses are evaluated in terms of heave and pitch raos shown in fig 19 whereas the pitch the bridge acceleration and the flight deck velocity are used as training set for the definition of the meta model the expected value ev i j and the standard deviation sd i j indicated in equation 29 are estimated through spline interpolator as sketched in the left plot of fig 23 the evaluation of the ssa is outlined in table 15 where is evident that the irregular and regular tests present a good agreement with a mean error under 10 and a maximum error on the bridge acceleration around the 9 8 conversely the deterministic regular wave model calculated through formula 26 is used to evaluate the expected value of the resistance which is 37 85n with a difference of 3 71 with respect to the irregular case the uncertainties indicated in table 15 for the regular case are calculated with the autocovariance method equation 16 without considering the non diagonal terms in the autocovariance matrix this leads to a value independent by the specific ssa value and only depends on the total number of items in order to highlight the effect given by the increasing of wave frequencies in the training set needed for an acceptable meta model prediction the convergence of the interpolation curves in terms of expected value of the pitch angle is sketched in the right plot of fig 23 in table 16 the ssas convergence for the pitch angle the bridge acceleration and the flight deck velocity are also shown the pitch angle and the flight deck velocity exhibit a rather fast convergence with an achievement of the final value with just 9 runs conversely the bridge acceleration shows a slower trend with a 27 of variation between 17 and 33 runs the comparison between regular and irregular tests in terms of heave and pitch rao s is depicted in fig 24 being the rao a simplified statistic used to predict the heave and pitch motions in a real sea state it is of great interest to evaluate how this assumption is in agreement with the irregular wave experiments even for the average sea state condition ss5 of the present work something similar was investigated by bouscasse et al 2013 although for mild sea state conditions ss2 and ss3 and a different energy density spectrum pierson moskowitz from the figure is evident how the pitch rao is in good agreement with the irregular tests in the whole range of frequencies of the incoming waves conversely the heave rao is very well reproduced in the range 0 4 0 75 hz where the behaviour may be considered linear while the tests are in some disagreement for higher frequencies in particular the range of well agreement corresponds to an encounter frequency range of 0 6 1 7 hz where the added resistance presents its maximum concluding at the present conditions the description of a formed sea state through a set of regular waves is able to reproduce the heave and pitch rao s as well as through a meta model the ssa of the irregular wave experiments in the framework of the numerical simulations this aspect could be very important because it avoids the necessity to design a very fine grid for achieving a well resolved free surface when a real sea state is simulated conversely a set of regular waves and the adoption of a metamodel like the one described in the present work are able to adequately describe the irregular wave sea condition 5 conclusions a statistically converged experimental benchmark study of a catamaran in irregular waves is presented along with regular wave uncertainty quantification uq model used to approximate the relevant statistical estimators the validation variables are x force z θ z b and z f d values from the time series are addressed as primary variables whereas heights associated to mean crossing waves are indicated as secondary variables a massive experimental campaign has been carried out with a great accuracy in the assessment of facilities and instrumentations reliabilities thoroughly detailed in the present work the global error due to the wave generations is well limited within the standard limit of 5 as well as the instrumental errors in capturing the hull motions different mounting systems have been tested for the current analysis the system which ensures a rigid fix with the carriage with negligible elastic reaction has been demonstrated to be the more suitable the current approach addresses the statistics of the relevant variables providing their ev sd and their related uncertainties the autocovariance and bootstrap methods are applied in order to estimate expected values and confidence intervals for ev sd and quantile function additionally the deterministic regular wave model assesses the ev of the x force whereas the stochastic regular wave uq focuses on ssas of θ z b and z d as relevant merit factors for design optimization at the current stage of the work the discussion on which method provides the most realistic appropriate validation uncertainty still remains open on the one hand the present implementation of the autocovariance and bootstrap methods has four main advantages 1 uncertainties do not depend solely on the number of time steps but also on the number of encountered waves which is a real physical parameter and not an arbitrary implementation parameter 2 it provides validation values and uncertainties not only for the time series ev and sd but also distribution parameters such as quantiles 3 it can be applied not only to primary variables time series but also to secondary variables amplitudes height period 4 it can detect possible stationarity issues in the time series the main drawback of the block bootstrap method is that the time series is not directly assessed for correlation a second drawback is the assumption of independence of the sample required by the bootstrap method used for the secondary variables on the other hand the time series method has the main advantage of evaluating directly the ev and sd uncertainty stemming from the wave record dependence as a drawback it does not directly provide confidence intervals for other parameters than time series ev and sd and does not address directly possible stationarity issues at least when concatenated records are used a combination of the two methods is therefore advisable ongoing and future work will address a nested array approach possibly the experiments will be also extended to a longer run length the relationship of the overall validation uncertainty to both the number of wave components and the run length depends on the problem sea state spectrum speed geometry and will be quantitatively investigated in future work at least for current problem u sn and u d will be included in the validation analysis additionally ev and distribution error and uncertainty will be included in the assessment of the stochastic regular wave uq model acknowledgements the
