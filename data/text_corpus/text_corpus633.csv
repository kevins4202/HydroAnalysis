3165,climate warming is accelerating the release of voluminous organic carbon from thawing permafrost into the arctic ocean via riverine transport however the seasonal variations in riverine dissolved organic carbon doc exports in arctic river basins with different areal extents of permafrost and how changes in water temperature tw impact seasonal doc exports are not fully understood in this study the concentrations ages and seasonality of riverine doc in the estuaries of six major arctic rivers ob yenisei lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie were analysed using arctic great rivers observatory arcticgro datasets from 2003 to 2019 the results showed that doc concentrations generally increased with the increases in the streamflow but always dropped to the minimum with the oldest δ 14c doc ages as old as 1650 years bp in the freezing period november april when the streamflow originates predominantly from groundwater during the flood pulse period may or june a rapid increase in riverine doc concentration with younger organic carbon δ 14c values from 61 to 152 was observed likely associated with snowmelt dominated runoff regimes lower δ18o h2o of approximately 20 4 1 6 during the ice free period june september doc concentrations decreased due to the enhanced dilution of streamflow from precipitation in the lena and kolyma river basins with large areal extents of continuous permafrost over 70 of doc flux exported during the ice free period originated from doc sources from 410 years and 230 years bp to the present respectively this suggests that greater permafrost extents restrict the release of older doc into rivers however riverine doc exports likely respond positively to changes in tw during the ice free period in addition such a positive response is likely to be enhanced in basins with larger percentages of sporadic permafrost thicker active layers more precipitation and less soil organic carbon ultimately under a warming climate riverine doc exports are expected to rise with increasing river water temperatures keywords riverine dissolved organic carbon permafrost climate warming arctic rivers 1 introduction approximately 50 of soil organic carbon soc across the globe 1672 pg is stored in the northern circumpolar permafrost region hugelius et al 2014 tarnocai et al 2009 among which 37 0 39 5 gt of carbon is stored in the permafrost peatlands in europe and western siberia fewster et al 2022 accordingly the global loss of soc caused by one degree of warming has been estimated to range from 30 30 pg to 203 161 pg crowther et al 2016 these values are much higher than the amount 25 36 tg of riverine dissolved organic carbon doc exported to the arctic ocean each year raymond et al 2007 climate warming is making the extensive permafrost carbon stock vulnerable mcfarlane et al 2022 and the corresponding loss of organic carbon from peat soils and permafrost thawing could result in an increased release of carbon into rivers freeman et al 2001 olefeldt and roulet 2014 thus vast amounts of soc are vulnerable to being released from thawing permafrost into the arctic ocean via riverine transport by arctic rivers guo et al 2007 mann et al 2022 shogren et al 2021 changes in riverine doc exports from arctic river basins significantly affect primary production in the arctic ocean terhaar et al 2021 air to sea co2 fluxes terhaar et al 2019 and the arctic hydrological ecological and biogeochemical cycles fabre et al 2019 frey and mcclelland 2009 generally doc in river water is sourced from soil carbon and is strongly associated with the drainage intensity and basin slope ludwig et al 1996 as well as the land use morphology chaplot and mutema 2021 ducharme et al 2021 consequently variations in riverine doc concentration are dependent on changes in river streamflow permafrost degradation soil type and climate change ducharme et al 2021 liu and wang 2022 loiko et al 2017 song et al 2019 and the strong seasonality of doc export is associated with seasonal flow regimes vegetation distributions and phenological patterns kaiser et al 2017 river morphology wohl et al 2017 basin landscape shogren et al 2021 and water residence times casas ruiz et al 2017 recent studies have quantified the positive correlation between doc concentrations and river runoff mu et al 2019 raymond et al 2007 based on separate idealized simulations and climate model simulations the riverine inputs of doc to the arctic ocean were predicted to increase at a rate of 1 yr until doubling terhaar et al 2019 with doc inputs reaching almost 2 7 4 3 tg yr over the next century frey and smith 2005 however few studies have systematically investigated the mechanism responsible for the seasonality of riverine doc export or quantified the effects of water temperature on this export the complex climate warming induced changes in both the biological and the chemical properties of the organic matter that serves as the source material of doc are precisely why long term changes in the amount of riverine doc export are difficult to evaluate prokushkin et al 2005 on the other hand the uncertainties in hydrological changes and limited water sampling make it even more difficult to accurately assess and predict the total export of riverine doc nevertheless quantifying the overall carbon budget is necessary to better understand these doc variations hornberger et al 1994 in addition estimating the quantities transport mechanisms and responses to climate change of seasonal riverine doc sources in arctic river basins could help expose both the variations in the arctic terrestrial soc and the changes in the global carbon cycle considering the changes in the hydrological regimes of arctic rivers and the uncertainties in the influencing factors of riverine doc in this study we performed the first examination of the temporal changes in riverine doc exports during the three periods of the year i e the flood pulse ice free and freezing periods and to determine the responses of these exports to water temperature variations the six largest arctic rivers i e ob yenisei lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie all of which are characterized by large scale doc outputs and high runoff liu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 were selected for this study the objectives of this study were to i identify the seasonal and spatial variations in riverine doc exports in each of the six arctic river basins during 2003 2019 and ii reveal the potential factors that influence the riverine doc export changes during the flood pulse ice free and freezing periods 2 data and methods 2 1 study area six major arctic rivers namely the ob yenisei lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie rivers with lengths of approximately 3650 4803 4260 2410 3340 and 5472 km across different permafrost zones respectively fabre et al 2019 majhi and yang 2008 motovilov 2017 rood et al 2016 wickland et al 2012 zhang et al 1999 were selected for this study fig 1 the ob river basin is located in western siberia contains a large number of small lakes more than 450 000 with an area of 1 km2 xu et al 2020 and is strongly affected by human activities mainly in the form of industry and agriculture gordeev et al 2004 yang et al 2004 in addition the ob river basin is relatively warm compared with the other river basins the annual mean temperature during 2003 2019 was approximately 0 2 c table 1 the yenisei river basin contains lake baikal the most voluminous freshwater lake in the world the main anthropogenic factor influencing the hydrology of this basin is the presence of large dams utilized for hydropower generation fabre et al 2019 approximately 80 of the watershed of the lena river basin is composed of continuous permafrost mcclelland et al 2004 and it has the greatest annual river runoff among the six river basins likewise the kolyma river basin is completely underlain by continuous permafrost mcclelland et al 2004 and has the highest soc content among all 6 river basins the yukon river basin includes northwest canada and boreal alaska and features a long winter freezing period pan et al 2021 the mackenzie river basin whose namesake is the longest river in the arctic is characterized by large lakes that cover 10 of the drainage basin area amon et al 2012 the yukon and mackenzie river basins are much less effected by humans compared with other arctic rivers in eurasia wohl et al 2022 of the total riverine inputs of doc to the arctic ocean 56 is from the ob yenisei lena kolyma and mackenzie rivers terhaar et al 2019 2 2 data daily river discharge data from gauging stations during 2003 2019 were obtained from the arctic great rivers observatory arcticgro discharge dataset shiklomanov et al 2021 water quality data from 2003 to 2019 including water temperature tw ph total suspended solids tss and doc concentration as well as isotopic characteristics δ14c δ13c and δ18o were downloaded from the arcticgro water quality dataset holmes et al 2021 surface water samples were taken at salekhard dudinka zhigansk cherskiy pilot station and tsiigehtchic for the ob yenisei lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie rivers respectively using an identical sampling scheme table 1 gridded monthly average 2 m temperature t data and monthly potential evapotranspiration pet data with a resolution of 0 5 were obtained from the climatic research unit cru gridded time series ts dataset v 4 04 harris et al 2020 gridded monthly land surface precipitation p data were obtained from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc version 2020 at a resolution of 0 25 schneider et al 2020 the soc lithological classes and soil erosion data of each basin were collected from hydrosheds lehner and grill 2013 the snow water equivalent and snow depth data of the period from 2003 to 2019 were sourced from the monthly global land data assimilation system gldas noah land surface model l4 with a resolution of 0 25 0 25 beaudoing et al 2020 the permafrost area distribution was sourced from both the 2000 2016 ground temperature map obu et al 2019 and the circum arctic map of permafrost and ground ice conditions brown et al 2002 for comparison the permafrost active layer thickness alt data for 2003 2019 were obtained from the european space agency esa permafrost climate change initiative permafrost cci v3 0 obu et al 2021 2 3 methods we focused mainly on the annual and seasonal doc output changes to this end we defined the period from june to september as the ice free period corresponding to the vegetation growing season prokushkin et al 2005 with the tw always remaining above 5 c fig s1 and the lowest snow depth fig s2 considering that spring ice breakup occurs in may or june griffin et al 2018 the flood pulse period was typically defined in may except for the mackenzie and yenisei river basins for which this period was defined in june accompanied by a sudden seasonal warming induced increase in streamflow fig s1 and a continuous decrease in snow depth fig s2 additionally the freezing period was defined by winter which lasts from november to the following april lesack et al 2013 streletskiy et al 2015 the annual and ice free period fluxes of doc were quantified by the widely used load estimator loadest programme runkel et al 2004 which constructs a calibrated regression of doc and streamflow data pairs and then obtains daily doc loads mass per day in combination with the daily measured streamflow record griffin et al 2018 holmes et al 2012 johnston et al 2021 tank et al 2012 wu et al 2021 the adjusted maximum likelihood estimator amle was used to fit the calibrated equation and the model with the lowest value of akaike s information criterion aic was chosen to estimate the doc load the age of carbon export with streamflow was identified by radiocarbon δ 14c measurements heaton et al 2021 raymond and bauer 2001 based on the studies of graven 2015 graven et al 2020 and umling and thunell 2017 the radiocarbon age of δ 14c doc δ 14cage was calculated by the following equation from stuiver and polach 1977 1 δ 14 c age 8033 l n δ 14 c 1000 1 to quantify the changes in riverine doc concentrations streamflow q and tw we calculated d d o c d o c doc as the doc departure mg l d q q q as the streamflow departure mm and d t w t w t w as the water temperature departure c in these equations doc q and t w refer to the average values of the doc concentration streamflow and water temperature respectively next nonlinear fitting was performed to examine the relationships between d d o c and d q considering the changes in water temperature d t w and the results were compared with the linear regression of d d o c and d q as this comparison can help identify the effects of tw changes on riverine doc outputs with streamflow 2 d d o c a d q e b d t w c 3 d d o c a d q c where a is the rate of change in d d o c as a function of d q b is the warming factor representing the effect of d t w on d d o c and c is a regression constant additionally to quantify the changes and differences in the alt in these six arctic river basins the mean active layer thickness altmean was determined by the annual mean of all gridded alt data from 2003 to 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 permafrost extent effects on the interbasin variation in riverine doc export the annual doc flux of the six major arctic river basins was 18 41 tg during 2003 2019 although the six basins differed greatly in terms of their doc exports and other energy and hydrological characteristics such as tw and q fig 2 spatially the annual doc concentration during 2003 2019 were highest in the ob and lena river basins averaging 9 5 0 2 mg l n 75 and 9 4 0 2 mg l n 75 respectively based on the daily sampling data table 2 in contrast relatively low doc concentrations were found in the other basins especially the mackenzie river basin with an annual doc concentration of 4 6 0 1 mg l n 76 and a mean of 5 0 0 2 mg l n 42 during the ice free period additionally distinct ages of δ 14c doc δ 14cage were found for the ob 1070 years bp to modern δ 14c values from 125 to 71 yenisei 960 years bp to modern δ 14c values from 123 to 126 lena 410 years bp to modern δ 14c values from 50 to 152 kolyma 230 years bp to modern δ 14c values from 28 to 94 yukon 1650 years bp to modern δ 14c values from 186 to 95 and mackenzie 880 years bp to modern δ 14c values from 104 to 53 rivers during 2003 2019 the permafrost extent can affect the doc variation in each basin through different sources and mobilization pathways guo et al 2007 despite the similar doc concentrations in the ob and lena river basins the sources of doc in these two rivers are different probably due to their extents of permafrost compared with the δ 14c enriched doc in the lena river the relatively depleted δ 14c values in the ob river indicate that the streamflow therein may contain a higher percentage of doc originating from water that has interacted more with soils containing old organic carbon neff et al 2006 in particular with the peat accumulations more than 200 cm thick that first developed at the end of the last glacial period kremenetski et al 2003 therefore both the ob and the lena river basins have high doc concentrations the former has high values because of the leaching facilitated by discontinuous permafrost wild et al 2019 in abundant peat deposits sheng et al 2004 and is characterized by the release of older carbon 1070 years bp to modern whereas the latter benefits from the driving force of doc by continuous permafrost as an aquiclude maclean et al 1999 and is dominated by younger carbon 410 years bp to modern additionally our results showed that the seasonal variations in riverine doc export are more obvious in basins with greater permafrost coverage based on the proportion of the ice free period doc flux to that of the whole year for instance the lena and kolyma river basins with larger extents of continuous permafrost are characterized by higher doc flux proportions from june to september 74 and 79 respectively compared with only 65 66 63 and 56 in the ob yenisei yukon and mackenzie river basins respectively this correlation is likely associated with the fact that streamflow components change significantly among different permafrost rivers song et al 2021 and a widespread permafrost with active layer before reaching its maximum thaw depth at the end of summer connon et al 2018 can serve as an aquiclude that inhibits the deep percolation of water and generates an abundance of contemporary boreal vegetation derived doc during the ice free period amon et al 2012 maclean et al 1999 rogers et al 2021 the larger the extent of continuous permafrost is the greater the permafrost restriction on the organic carbon output the kolyma river basin which is almost entirely underlain by continuous permafrost has a low doc concentration of 5 5 3 1 mg l n 74 with a relatively modern terrestrial source δ 14c values from 28 to 94 the small doc in the kolyma river reaffirms that the continuous permafrost hinders the percolation of older soils and brings doc derived by modern plant litter from the surface additionally organic matter always decomposes quickly during the thawing process in the frozen yedoma zimov et al 2006 furthermore riverine doc concentrations are limited by the organic carbon content of permafrost soil and the corresponding hydrological conditions for instance the lower runoff in the mackenzie river basin with a relatively low soc content of 0 83 t km2 relative to the other basins restricts soil leaching and riverine doc exports moreover relatively turbid water with a high tss content 91 0 1 2 mg l is not conducive to doc production by aquatic plant growth and a longer water residence time owing to an abundance of water bodies amon et al 2012 results in the removal of a large portion of bioavailable dissolved organic matter yi et al 2010 thus the mechanisms responsible for the changes in riverine doc exports among arctic river basins are complex and depend mainly on their permafrost conditions such as the extent of permafrost the ages of deposits and the doc concentration in permafrost soil as well as the corresponding hydrologic characteristics of the permafrost area 3 2 permafrost extent limits the seasonality of riverine doc exports previous studies on the temporal variations in riverine doc suggested that the seasonality of doc exports is closely related to the hydrological regime of arctic river basins guo and macdonald 2006 maclean et al 1999 townsend small et al 2011 our results further demonstrate that the riverine doc exports in the continuous permafrost dominated basins exhibit more significant seasonal variations notably all six major arctic rivers experience a pulse of doc during the flood pulse ice breakup period and the rivers contain higher doc concentrations during the ice free period than during the remainder of the year fig 3 this unevenness is particularly obvious in the continuous permafrost dominated lena and kolyma river basins in comparison with the ob river basin whose riverine doc exports exhibit weak seasonal variation doc concentrations typically increase rapidly in may although this rise is delayed until june for the mackenzie and yenisei river basins and this process is always accompanied by sudden seasonal warming and spring freshet with increased streamflow fig 3 and fig 4 a resulting in snowmelt dominated streamflow with low δ18o h2o fig s3 guo and macdonald 2006 welp et al 2005 almost 55 of the doc flux of arctic rivers is exported during the flood pulse period finlay et al 2006 during which doc is generally derived from leached terrestrial organic matter in the upper soil layers behnke et al 2021 boyer et al 1997 rember and trefry 2004 with younger δ 14c doc ages from 500 years bp to modern δ 14c values from 61 to 152 however the large amounts of young leachates derived from boreal vegetation that are exported into rivers during the spring freshet could also result in younger δ 14c doc ages amon et al 2012 additionally significant positive correlations between the doc concentrations and river runoff in major arctic river basins arise not only at the annual scale mu et al 2019 but also in some individual periods fig 4 for example notable linear relationships were found for the ob yenisei and kolyma river basins in the flood pulse period fig 4 a as doc export was mainly driven by the snowmelt dominated streamflow in contrast the doc concentration significantly decreased with decreasing streamflow during the ice free period only in the yenisei kolyma and yukon river basins fig 4 b as a consequence of the multi sourced streamflow containing more permafrost or ice melt and rain with high δ18o h2o values fig 5 thus although the δ 14c doc values from 139 to 121 δ 14c doc ages from 1200 years bp to the present day are high in the ice free period these exports are still lower than those during the flood pulse period in addition such correlations appear to be relatively rare during the freezing period except for the yukon river basin fig 4 c this finding indicates the complexity of riverine doc exports in both time and space for the lowest doc exports during the freezing period a shift towards older doc sources δ 14c doc ages from 1650 years bp to modern with lower δ 14c values from 186 to 83 was observed especially in the ob river basin δ 14c values from 125 to 27 δ 14c doc ages from 220 to 1070 years bp to modern yenisei river basin δ 14c values from 113 to 34 δ 14c doc ages from 960 years bp to modern and yukon river basins δ 14c values from 186 to 68 δ 14c doc ages from 1650 years bp to modern in contrast the output of older carbon in basins underlain by continuous permafrost i e the lena and kolyma river basins is still limited at present fig 5 c d nevertheless considering that the extensive northern permafrost carbon stock is becoming increasingly vulnerable to decomposition and translocation under the influence of climate warming evans et al 2020 juhls et al 2020 mcfarlane et al 2021 st jacques and sauchyn 2009 wang et al 2022 these basins will likely be important contributors to high latitude ecosystem carbon loss the effect of freeze thawing on seasonal riverine doc exports has been shown in fig 6 which will help understand the potential permafrost related changes in riverine doc export under warming 3 3 water temperature effect on riverine doc exports our results confirm that although hydrological processes regulate riverine doc outputs doc export processes are also constrained by water temperature as shown in table 3 the positive correlation coefficient between riverine doc export and q rises when considering tw comparing the nonlinear regression equation a in table 3 with the linear regression equation b in table 3 indicates that the water temperature change coefficient b defined as the warming factor represents the influence of changes in water temperature positive promoting negative inhibiting on the riverine doc export with streamflow in different basins fig s4 we found that an increase in tw generally promotes doc export during the ice free period with a positive warming factor b 0 moreover this promotion effect during the ice free period is more significant in basins with a wider distribution of sporadic permafrost fig s5 g r2 0 5 higher p and lower soc fig s6 for example for the mackenzie river basin with b reaching as high as 0 05 p 0 001 the soc is as low as 0 83 t km2 p is relatively high 386 mm yr and the percentage of sporadic permafrost is the largest 27 among the six studied basins in contrast the lowest warming factor b is observed in the kolyma river basin which is dominated by continuous permafrost with a non sporadic permafrost distribution and has the lowest p at approximately 280 mm yr and a higher soc of 1 72 t km2 therefore in addition to the temperature and permafrost extent frey and smith 2005 the soc alt and p characteristics are key factors in controlling the warming effect on doc export crowther et al 2016 prokushkin et al 2005 soc and p could be used to determine the storing factor soc p while alt and the percentage of sporadic permafrost spora could be considered as a thawing factor determined with alt exp spora on one hand an abundance of soc with less p larger soc p ratio corresponds to better storage and is less sensitive to warming at a lower b on the other hand riverine doc export with streamflow in basins characterized by easy thawing and a larger percentage of sporadic permafrost with a thicker active layer is more affected by warming with higher b it is worth noting that riverine doc export factors could also affect each other as noted by park et al 2017 tw at the outlets of arctic rivers exhibits a rate of increase of 0 16 c decade warming could increase riverine doc production during the growing season via the deepening of the active layer prokushkin et al 2005 an increased alt allows more precipitation to enter subsurface aquifers streletskiy et al 2015 thereby enhancing soil infiltration and supporting deeper flow paths walvoord and striegl 2007 for both nutrient and water transport thus terrestrial soc could be mobilized via the deepening of the permafrost active layer guo and macdonald 2006 with the increased desorption of doc in soils through freeze thaw effects yu et al 2010 moreover in contrast to a previous study on the initial soil carbon stock effect on global carbon losses crowther et al 2016 our results suggest that among the studied basins those with a lower doc storing factor soc p and higher thawing factor alt exp spora are likely to be more vulnerable to doc losses with a larger warming factor b representing the effect of water temperature changes on riverine doc export fig 7 nevertheless the warming effect on riverine doc export is challenging to evaluate directly in this study due to the lack of sampling data during the flood pulse period and the unfluctuating tw during the freezing period thus the influence of annual water temperature changes is even more complicated to explain however previous studies have indicated that the doc in the flood pulse period is significantly affected by winter temperatures haei et al 2010 specifically longer and colder winters always result in higher doc concentrations during subsequent snowmelt periods haei et al 2013 due to the stronger freeze out of doc ågren et al 2012 and the fine root injuries caused by prolonged soil frost tierney et al 2001 even so riverine doc exports during the freezing period depend mainly on permanently degraded permafrost under warming throughout the year as winter doc originates predominantly from groundwater douglas et al 2013 enhanced groundwater flow due to permafrost thawing elevates the concentrations of doc haei et al 2010 lamontagne hallé et al 2020 laudon et al 2013 walvoord and striegl 2007 by increasing the microbially mediated decomposition of soil organic matter öquist et al 2009 additionally it is worth noting that the timing and amount of doc export could also be influenced by the shortening of the freezing period douglas et al 2013 and the lengthening of the ice free period due to warming pavelsky and smith 2004 semmens and ramage 2013 yang et al 2020 3 4 uncertainties in the riverine doc export analysis it should be noted that the water sampling sites in this study are all located in the downstream parts of the corresponding river basins holmes et al 2021 in addition only 1 7 water samples per year were collected for each river basin and such a paucity of data cannot precisely reveal the seasonal variations in riverine doc exports moreover these data spatially average the inherent heterogeneities of climate topography land cover and various hydrological processes across each entire basin for example the streamflow in headwater streams as well as in tributaries that are heavily influenced by glacier derived meltwater and groundwater is always characterized by older δ14c ages than is peat dominated blackwater or water in non glaciated areas aiken et al 2014 walvoord and striegl 2007 thus warming could result in greater contributions of older doc from soils glacial meltwater and groundwater via rapidly receding glaciers and enhanced groundwater aiken et al 2014 csank et al 2019 in addition this study uses the soc in the top 5 cm of each basin but spatial heterogeneities in soil carbon can also be found at a smaller horizontal resolution within a basin hengl et al 2014 as well as in the vertical direction e g the average organic carbon density in the top 1 m of soil 19 2 t km2 is almost 20 times that in the litter horizon 0 90 t km2 throughout russia schepaschenko et al 2013 moreover the stock of the deep carbon pool could change with sedimentary conditions e g yedoma and deltaic deposits in the northern permafrost region deeper than 300 cm have soc values of 407 pg and 241 pg respectively tarnocai et al 2009 furthermore doc decomposition is strongly regulated by the microscale water distribution which varies across soil spaces yan et al 2018 thus hydroclimatic drivers are difficult to quantify due to the complex heterogeneous of river basins basu et al 2010 furthermore the warming effects on the hydrological processes controlling doc export wen et al 2020 are extremely complex spring floods can be affected by permafrost at the beginning of the melting season gao et al 2021 liu et al 2022b which studies have shown has arrived earlier in more recent years kankaanpää et al 2018 zhang and ma 2018 in addition to deepening the active layer via increased soil moisture and thermal conductivity warming could result in shallower active layers as the latent heat of the soil increases pi et al 2021 furthermore permafrost degradation could not only increase the release of carbon petrone et al 2006 but also provide longer residence times for rock water interactions that degrade and reduce the existing doc in water cochand et al 2019 prokushkin et al 2009 moreover this study did not consider increasing terrestrial productivity which is one of the important factors affecting aquatic doc variations zhu et al 2022 human activities could also indirectly influence riverine doc export by affecting hydrological processes e g via the damming of rivers maavara et al 2017 which has weakened the seasonal variation in streamflow of the ob river basin raymond et al 2007 and generally reduces the organic carbon carried by rivers liu et al 2022a maavara et al 2017 finally we note first that the results presented in this study are based on insufficient water sampling data second the river discharge data for the yenisei lena and kolyma river basins have not been corrected for the distance between the sampling location and the discharge measurement position nevertheless our study is focused on the differences among basins and the trends of the seasonal variation in doc rather than its absolute values therefore although there are some uncertainties in the observed doc data due to the random errors associated with water quality measurements these uncertainties can be assumed not to affect the main conclusions 4 conclusion in this study we sought to identify the seasonal variations in riverine doc export and to reveal the predominant drivers of these variations in six large permafrost dominated arctic river basins we found that the seasonality of riverine doc exports is more significant in basins with larger extents of continuous permafrost for the basins dominated by continuous permafrost e g the lena and kolyma river basins permafrost restricts the output of older doc especially during the freezing period in contrast for basins with significant permafrost degradation e g the ob river basin deepening the active layer as a result of warming leads to the release of stored carbon during the thawing of frozen soil from the flood pulse period to the freezing period mobilized organic carbon deepens downwards from the surface soil with decreases in the doc concentration and increases in carbon ages due to the changes in doc sources and transport processes we further identified the influence of water temperature on riverine doc exports and concluded that climate warming could indirectly impact the doc characteristics via changes in the amount of soc storage and in the permafrost extent in boreal regions although the mechanisms regulating riverine doc export are complex and even though no strict statistical analysis was performed due to the large scales of the studied watersheds and the sparsity of observations this work exposed the warming effects on seasonal riverine doc exports in vulnerable permafrost dominated arctic river basins this mechanism is probably associated with permafrost conditions such as the extent of permafrost the ages of deposits and the organic carbon content of permafrost soil as well as other corresponding hydrological conditions notably our analysis did not consider complex doc conversion processes such as groundwater surface water interactions ford and naiman 1989 larned et al 2015 river lake connectivity stolpmann et al 2021 wen et al 2019 extreme climate rainfall and wildfire disturbances jung et al 2014 rodríguez cardona et al 2020 and abrupt permafrost carbon collapse loiko et al 2017 due to the lack of appropriately detailed datasets for these parameters additionally the doc released from the ground ice of permafrost during coastal erosion should not be ignored in additional studies of the impacts of doc on ecosystems along the arctic coastline tanski et al 2016 nevertheless our study of the influencing factors and potential mechanisms of seasonal riverine doc exports provides the first in depth overview of the effects of water temperature changes on the permafrost constrained riverine doc output of course further investigation is needed for a better understanding of the warming effects on hydrological changes and their relationships with riverine doc exports in arctic river basins and therefore to reveal the profound influence of permafrost on the global carbon cycle and its change

3165,climate warming is accelerating the release of voluminous organic carbon from thawing permafrost into the arctic ocean via riverine transport however the seasonal variations in riverine dissolved organic carbon doc exports in arctic river basins with different areal extents of permafrost and how changes in water temperature tw impact seasonal doc exports are not fully understood in this study the concentrations ages and seasonality of riverine doc in the estuaries of six major arctic rivers ob yenisei lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie were analysed using arctic great rivers observatory arcticgro datasets from 2003 to 2019 the results showed that doc concentrations generally increased with the increases in the streamflow but always dropped to the minimum with the oldest δ 14c doc ages as old as 1650 years bp in the freezing period november april when the streamflow originates predominantly from groundwater during the flood pulse period may or june a rapid increase in riverine doc concentration with younger organic carbon δ 14c values from 61 to 152 was observed likely associated with snowmelt dominated runoff regimes lower δ18o h2o of approximately 20 4 1 6 during the ice free period june september doc concentrations decreased due to the enhanced dilution of streamflow from precipitation in the lena and kolyma river basins with large areal extents of continuous permafrost over 70 of doc flux exported during the ice free period originated from doc sources from 410 years and 230 years bp to the present respectively this suggests that greater permafrost extents restrict the release of older doc into rivers however riverine doc exports likely respond positively to changes in tw during the ice free period in addition such a positive response is likely to be enhanced in basins with larger percentages of sporadic permafrost thicker active layers more precipitation and less soil organic carbon ultimately under a warming climate riverine doc exports are expected to rise with increasing river water temperatures keywords riverine dissolved organic carbon permafrost climate warming arctic rivers 1 introduction approximately 50 of soil organic carbon soc across the globe 1672 pg is stored in the northern circumpolar permafrost region hugelius et al 2014 tarnocai et al 2009 among which 37 0 39 5 gt of carbon is stored in the permafrost peatlands in europe and western siberia fewster et al 2022 accordingly the global loss of soc caused by one degree of warming has been estimated to range from 30 30 pg to 203 161 pg crowther et al 2016 these values are much higher than the amount 25 36 tg of riverine dissolved organic carbon doc exported to the arctic ocean each year raymond et al 2007 climate warming is making the extensive permafrost carbon stock vulnerable mcfarlane et al 2022 and the corresponding loss of organic carbon from peat soils and permafrost thawing could result in an increased release of carbon into rivers freeman et al 2001 olefeldt and roulet 2014 thus vast amounts of soc are vulnerable to being released from thawing permafrost into the arctic ocean via riverine transport by arctic rivers guo et al 2007 mann et al 2022 shogren et al 2021 changes in riverine doc exports from arctic river basins significantly affect primary production in the arctic ocean terhaar et al 2021 air to sea co2 fluxes terhaar et al 2019 and the arctic hydrological ecological and biogeochemical cycles fabre et al 2019 frey and mcclelland 2009 generally doc in river water is sourced from soil carbon and is strongly associated with the drainage intensity and basin slope ludwig et al 1996 as well as the land use morphology chaplot and mutema 2021 ducharme et al 2021 consequently variations in riverine doc concentration are dependent on changes in river streamflow permafrost degradation soil type and climate change ducharme et al 2021 liu and wang 2022 loiko et al 2017 song et al 2019 and the strong seasonality of doc export is associated with seasonal flow regimes vegetation distributions and phenological patterns kaiser et al 2017 river morphology wohl et al 2017 basin landscape shogren et al 2021 and water residence times casas ruiz et al 2017 recent studies have quantified the positive correlation between doc concentrations and river runoff mu et al 2019 raymond et al 2007 based on separate idealized simulations and climate model simulations the riverine inputs of doc to the arctic ocean were predicted to increase at a rate of 1 yr until doubling terhaar et al 2019 with doc inputs reaching almost 2 7 4 3 tg yr over the next century frey and smith 2005 however few studies have systematically investigated the mechanism responsible for the seasonality of riverine doc export or quantified the effects of water temperature on this export the complex climate warming induced changes in both the biological and the chemical properties of the organic matter that serves as the source material of doc are precisely why long term changes in the amount of riverine doc export are difficult to evaluate prokushkin et al 2005 on the other hand the uncertainties in hydrological changes and limited water sampling make it even more difficult to accurately assess and predict the total export of riverine doc nevertheless quantifying the overall carbon budget is necessary to better understand these doc variations hornberger et al 1994 in addition estimating the quantities transport mechanisms and responses to climate change of seasonal riverine doc sources in arctic river basins could help expose both the variations in the arctic terrestrial soc and the changes in the global carbon cycle considering the changes in the hydrological regimes of arctic rivers and the uncertainties in the influencing factors of riverine doc in this study we performed the first examination of the temporal changes in riverine doc exports during the three periods of the year i e the flood pulse ice free and freezing periods and to determine the responses of these exports to water temperature variations the six largest arctic rivers i e ob yenisei lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie all of which are characterized by large scale doc outputs and high runoff liu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 were selected for this study the objectives of this study were to i identify the seasonal and spatial variations in riverine doc exports in each of the six arctic river basins during 2003 2019 and ii reveal the potential factors that influence the riverine doc export changes during the flood pulse ice free and freezing periods 2 data and methods 2 1 study area six major arctic rivers namely the ob yenisei lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie rivers with lengths of approximately 3650 4803 4260 2410 3340 and 5472 km across different permafrost zones respectively fabre et al 2019 majhi and yang 2008 motovilov 2017 rood et al 2016 wickland et al 2012 zhang et al 1999 were selected for this study fig 1 the ob river basin is located in western siberia contains a large number of small lakes more than 450 000 with an area of 1 km2 xu et al 2020 and is strongly affected by human activities mainly in the form of industry and agriculture gordeev et al 2004 yang et al 2004 in addition the ob river basin is relatively warm compared with the other river basins the annual mean temperature during 2003 2019 was approximately 0 2 c table 1 the yenisei river basin contains lake baikal the most voluminous freshwater lake in the world the main anthropogenic factor influencing the hydrology of this basin is the presence of large dams utilized for hydropower generation fabre et al 2019 approximately 80 of the watershed of the lena river basin is composed of continuous permafrost mcclelland et al 2004 and it has the greatest annual river runoff among the six river basins likewise the kolyma river basin is completely underlain by continuous permafrost mcclelland et al 2004 and has the highest soc content among all 6 river basins the yukon river basin includes northwest canada and boreal alaska and features a long winter freezing period pan et al 2021 the mackenzie river basin whose namesake is the longest river in the arctic is characterized by large lakes that cover 10 of the drainage basin area amon et al 2012 the yukon and mackenzie river basins are much less effected by humans compared with other arctic rivers in eurasia wohl et al 2022 of the total riverine inputs of doc to the arctic ocean 56 is from the ob yenisei lena kolyma and mackenzie rivers terhaar et al 2019 2 2 data daily river discharge data from gauging stations during 2003 2019 were obtained from the arctic great rivers observatory arcticgro discharge dataset shiklomanov et al 2021 water quality data from 2003 to 2019 including water temperature tw ph total suspended solids tss and doc concentration as well as isotopic characteristics δ14c δ13c and δ18o were downloaded from the arcticgro water quality dataset holmes et al 2021 surface water samples were taken at salekhard dudinka zhigansk cherskiy pilot station and tsiigehtchic for the ob yenisei lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie rivers respectively using an identical sampling scheme table 1 gridded monthly average 2 m temperature t data and monthly potential evapotranspiration pet data with a resolution of 0 5 were obtained from the climatic research unit cru gridded time series ts dataset v 4 04 harris et al 2020 gridded monthly land surface precipitation p data were obtained from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc version 2020 at a resolution of 0 25 schneider et al 2020 the soc lithological classes and soil erosion data of each basin were collected from hydrosheds lehner and grill 2013 the snow water equivalent and snow depth data of the period from 2003 to 2019 were sourced from the monthly global land data assimilation system gldas noah land surface model l4 with a resolution of 0 25 0 25 beaudoing et al 2020 the permafrost area distribution was sourced from both the 2000 2016 ground temperature map obu et al 2019 and the circum arctic map of permafrost and ground ice conditions brown et al 2002 for comparison the permafrost active layer thickness alt data for 2003 2019 were obtained from the european space agency esa permafrost climate change initiative permafrost cci v3 0 obu et al 2021 2 3 methods we focused mainly on the annual and seasonal doc output changes to this end we defined the period from june to september as the ice free period corresponding to the vegetation growing season prokushkin et al 2005 with the tw always remaining above 5 c fig s1 and the lowest snow depth fig s2 considering that spring ice breakup occurs in may or june griffin et al 2018 the flood pulse period was typically defined in may except for the mackenzie and yenisei river basins for which this period was defined in june accompanied by a sudden seasonal warming induced increase in streamflow fig s1 and a continuous decrease in snow depth fig s2 additionally the freezing period was defined by winter which lasts from november to the following april lesack et al 2013 streletskiy et al 2015 the annual and ice free period fluxes of doc were quantified by the widely used load estimator loadest programme runkel et al 2004 which constructs a calibrated regression of doc and streamflow data pairs and then obtains daily doc loads mass per day in combination with the daily measured streamflow record griffin et al 2018 holmes et al 2012 johnston et al 2021 tank et al 2012 wu et al 2021 the adjusted maximum likelihood estimator amle was used to fit the calibrated equation and the model with the lowest value of akaike s information criterion aic was chosen to estimate the doc load the age of carbon export with streamflow was identified by radiocarbon δ 14c measurements heaton et al 2021 raymond and bauer 2001 based on the studies of graven 2015 graven et al 2020 and umling and thunell 2017 the radiocarbon age of δ 14c doc δ 14cage was calculated by the following equation from stuiver and polach 1977 1 δ 14 c age 8033 l n δ 14 c 1000 1 to quantify the changes in riverine doc concentrations streamflow q and tw we calculated d d o c d o c doc as the doc departure mg l d q q q as the streamflow departure mm and d t w t w t w as the water temperature departure c in these equations doc q and t w refer to the average values of the doc concentration streamflow and water temperature respectively next nonlinear fitting was performed to examine the relationships between d d o c and d q considering the changes in water temperature d t w and the results were compared with the linear regression of d d o c and d q as this comparison can help identify the effects of tw changes on riverine doc outputs with streamflow 2 d d o c a d q e b d t w c 3 d d o c a d q c where a is the rate of change in d d o c as a function of d q b is the warming factor representing the effect of d t w on d d o c and c is a regression constant additionally to quantify the changes and differences in the alt in these six arctic river basins the mean active layer thickness altmean was determined by the annual mean of all gridded alt data from 2003 to 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 permafrost extent effects on the interbasin variation in riverine doc export the annual doc flux of the six major arctic river basins was 18 41 tg during 2003 2019 although the six basins differed greatly in terms of their doc exports and other energy and hydrological characteristics such as tw and q fig 2 spatially the annual doc concentration during 2003 2019 were highest in the ob and lena river basins averaging 9 5 0 2 mg l n 75 and 9 4 0 2 mg l n 75 respectively based on the daily sampling data table 2 in contrast relatively low doc concentrations were found in the other basins especially the mackenzie river basin with an annual doc concentration of 4 6 0 1 mg l n 76 and a mean of 5 0 0 2 mg l n 42 during the ice free period additionally distinct ages of δ 14c doc δ 14cage were found for the ob 1070 years bp to modern δ 14c values from 125 to 71 yenisei 960 years bp to modern δ 14c values from 123 to 126 lena 410 years bp to modern δ 14c values from 50 to 152 kolyma 230 years bp to modern δ 14c values from 28 to 94 yukon 1650 years bp to modern δ 14c values from 186 to 95 and mackenzie 880 years bp to modern δ 14c values from 104 to 53 rivers during 2003 2019 the permafrost extent can affect the doc variation in each basin through different sources and mobilization pathways guo et al 2007 despite the similar doc concentrations in the ob and lena river basins the sources of doc in these two rivers are different probably due to their extents of permafrost compared with the δ 14c enriched doc in the lena river the relatively depleted δ 14c values in the ob river indicate that the streamflow therein may contain a higher percentage of doc originating from water that has interacted more with soils containing old organic carbon neff et al 2006 in particular with the peat accumulations more than 200 cm thick that first developed at the end of the last glacial period kremenetski et al 2003 therefore both the ob and the lena river basins have high doc concentrations the former has high values because of the leaching facilitated by discontinuous permafrost wild et al 2019 in abundant peat deposits sheng et al 2004 and is characterized by the release of older carbon 1070 years bp to modern whereas the latter benefits from the driving force of doc by continuous permafrost as an aquiclude maclean et al 1999 and is dominated by younger carbon 410 years bp to modern additionally our results showed that the seasonal variations in riverine doc export are more obvious in basins with greater permafrost coverage based on the proportion of the ice free period doc flux to that of the whole year for instance the lena and kolyma river basins with larger extents of continuous permafrost are characterized by higher doc flux proportions from june to september 74 and 79 respectively compared with only 65 66 63 and 56 in the ob yenisei yukon and mackenzie river basins respectively this correlation is likely associated with the fact that streamflow components change significantly among different permafrost rivers song et al 2021 and a widespread permafrost with active layer before reaching its maximum thaw depth at the end of summer connon et al 2018 can serve as an aquiclude that inhibits the deep percolation of water and generates an abundance of contemporary boreal vegetation derived doc during the ice free period amon et al 2012 maclean et al 1999 rogers et al 2021 the larger the extent of continuous permafrost is the greater the permafrost restriction on the organic carbon output the kolyma river basin which is almost entirely underlain by continuous permafrost has a low doc concentration of 5 5 3 1 mg l n 74 with a relatively modern terrestrial source δ 14c values from 28 to 94 the small doc in the kolyma river reaffirms that the continuous permafrost hinders the percolation of older soils and brings doc derived by modern plant litter from the surface additionally organic matter always decomposes quickly during the thawing process in the frozen yedoma zimov et al 2006 furthermore riverine doc concentrations are limited by the organic carbon content of permafrost soil and the corresponding hydrological conditions for instance the lower runoff in the mackenzie river basin with a relatively low soc content of 0 83 t km2 relative to the other basins restricts soil leaching and riverine doc exports moreover relatively turbid water with a high tss content 91 0 1 2 mg l is not conducive to doc production by aquatic plant growth and a longer water residence time owing to an abundance of water bodies amon et al 2012 results in the removal of a large portion of bioavailable dissolved organic matter yi et al 2010 thus the mechanisms responsible for the changes in riverine doc exports among arctic river basins are complex and depend mainly on their permafrost conditions such as the extent of permafrost the ages of deposits and the doc concentration in permafrost soil as well as the corresponding hydrologic characteristics of the permafrost area 3 2 permafrost extent limits the seasonality of riverine doc exports previous studies on the temporal variations in riverine doc suggested that the seasonality of doc exports is closely related to the hydrological regime of arctic river basins guo and macdonald 2006 maclean et al 1999 townsend small et al 2011 our results further demonstrate that the riverine doc exports in the continuous permafrost dominated basins exhibit more significant seasonal variations notably all six major arctic rivers experience a pulse of doc during the flood pulse ice breakup period and the rivers contain higher doc concentrations during the ice free period than during the remainder of the year fig 3 this unevenness is particularly obvious in the continuous permafrost dominated lena and kolyma river basins in comparison with the ob river basin whose riverine doc exports exhibit weak seasonal variation doc concentrations typically increase rapidly in may although this rise is delayed until june for the mackenzie and yenisei river basins and this process is always accompanied by sudden seasonal warming and spring freshet with increased streamflow fig 3 and fig 4 a resulting in snowmelt dominated streamflow with low δ18o h2o fig s3 guo and macdonald 2006 welp et al 2005 almost 55 of the doc flux of arctic rivers is exported during the flood pulse period finlay et al 2006 during which doc is generally derived from leached terrestrial organic matter in the upper soil layers behnke et al 2021 boyer et al 1997 rember and trefry 2004 with younger δ 14c doc ages from 500 years bp to modern δ 14c values from 61 to 152 however the large amounts of young leachates derived from boreal vegetation that are exported into rivers during the spring freshet could also result in younger δ 14c doc ages amon et al 2012 additionally significant positive correlations between the doc concentrations and river runoff in major arctic river basins arise not only at the annual scale mu et al 2019 but also in some individual periods fig 4 for example notable linear relationships were found for the ob yenisei and kolyma river basins in the flood pulse period fig 4 a as doc export was mainly driven by the snowmelt dominated streamflow in contrast the doc concentration significantly decreased with decreasing streamflow during the ice free period only in the yenisei kolyma and yukon river basins fig 4 b as a consequence of the multi sourced streamflow containing more permafrost or ice melt and rain with high δ18o h2o values fig 5 thus although the δ 14c doc values from 139 to 121 δ 14c doc ages from 1200 years bp to the present day are high in the ice free period these exports are still lower than those during the flood pulse period in addition such correlations appear to be relatively rare during the freezing period except for the yukon river basin fig 4 c this finding indicates the complexity of riverine doc exports in both time and space for the lowest doc exports during the freezing period a shift towards older doc sources δ 14c doc ages from 1650 years bp to modern with lower δ 14c values from 186 to 83 was observed especially in the ob river basin δ 14c values from 125 to 27 δ 14c doc ages from 220 to 1070 years bp to modern yenisei river basin δ 14c values from 113 to 34 δ 14c doc ages from 960 years bp to modern and yukon river basins δ 14c values from 186 to 68 δ 14c doc ages from 1650 years bp to modern in contrast the output of older carbon in basins underlain by continuous permafrost i e the lena and kolyma river basins is still limited at present fig 5 c d nevertheless considering that the extensive northern permafrost carbon stock is becoming increasingly vulnerable to decomposition and translocation under the influence of climate warming evans et al 2020 juhls et al 2020 mcfarlane et al 2021 st jacques and sauchyn 2009 wang et al 2022 these basins will likely be important contributors to high latitude ecosystem carbon loss the effect of freeze thawing on seasonal riverine doc exports has been shown in fig 6 which will help understand the potential permafrost related changes in riverine doc export under warming 3 3 water temperature effect on riverine doc exports our results confirm that although hydrological processes regulate riverine doc outputs doc export processes are also constrained by water temperature as shown in table 3 the positive correlation coefficient between riverine doc export and q rises when considering tw comparing the nonlinear regression equation a in table 3 with the linear regression equation b in table 3 indicates that the water temperature change coefficient b defined as the warming factor represents the influence of changes in water temperature positive promoting negative inhibiting on the riverine doc export with streamflow in different basins fig s4 we found that an increase in tw generally promotes doc export during the ice free period with a positive warming factor b 0 moreover this promotion effect during the ice free period is more significant in basins with a wider distribution of sporadic permafrost fig s5 g r2 0 5 higher p and lower soc fig s6 for example for the mackenzie river basin with b reaching as high as 0 05 p 0 001 the soc is as low as 0 83 t km2 p is relatively high 386 mm yr and the percentage of sporadic permafrost is the largest 27 among the six studied basins in contrast the lowest warming factor b is observed in the kolyma river basin which is dominated by continuous permafrost with a non sporadic permafrost distribution and has the lowest p at approximately 280 mm yr and a higher soc of 1 72 t km2 therefore in addition to the temperature and permafrost extent frey and smith 2005 the soc alt and p characteristics are key factors in controlling the warming effect on doc export crowther et al 2016 prokushkin et al 2005 soc and p could be used to determine the storing factor soc p while alt and the percentage of sporadic permafrost spora could be considered as a thawing factor determined with alt exp spora on one hand an abundance of soc with less p larger soc p ratio corresponds to better storage and is less sensitive to warming at a lower b on the other hand riverine doc export with streamflow in basins characterized by easy thawing and a larger percentage of sporadic permafrost with a thicker active layer is more affected by warming with higher b it is worth noting that riverine doc export factors could also affect each other as noted by park et al 2017 tw at the outlets of arctic rivers exhibits a rate of increase of 0 16 c decade warming could increase riverine doc production during the growing season via the deepening of the active layer prokushkin et al 2005 an increased alt allows more precipitation to enter subsurface aquifers streletskiy et al 2015 thereby enhancing soil infiltration and supporting deeper flow paths walvoord and striegl 2007 for both nutrient and water transport thus terrestrial soc could be mobilized via the deepening of the permafrost active layer guo and macdonald 2006 with the increased desorption of doc in soils through freeze thaw effects yu et al 2010 moreover in contrast to a previous study on the initial soil carbon stock effect on global carbon losses crowther et al 2016 our results suggest that among the studied basins those with a lower doc storing factor soc p and higher thawing factor alt exp spora are likely to be more vulnerable to doc losses with a larger warming factor b representing the effect of water temperature changes on riverine doc export fig 7 nevertheless the warming effect on riverine doc export is challenging to evaluate directly in this study due to the lack of sampling data during the flood pulse period and the unfluctuating tw during the freezing period thus the influence of annual water temperature changes is even more complicated to explain however previous studies have indicated that the doc in the flood pulse period is significantly affected by winter temperatures haei et al 2010 specifically longer and colder winters always result in higher doc concentrations during subsequent snowmelt periods haei et al 2013 due to the stronger freeze out of doc ågren et al 2012 and the fine root injuries caused by prolonged soil frost tierney et al 2001 even so riverine doc exports during the freezing period depend mainly on permanently degraded permafrost under warming throughout the year as winter doc originates predominantly from groundwater douglas et al 2013 enhanced groundwater flow due to permafrost thawing elevates the concentrations of doc haei et al 2010 lamontagne hallé et al 2020 laudon et al 2013 walvoord and striegl 2007 by increasing the microbially mediated decomposition of soil organic matter öquist et al 2009 additionally it is worth noting that the timing and amount of doc export could also be influenced by the shortening of the freezing period douglas et al 2013 and the lengthening of the ice free period due to warming pavelsky and smith 2004 semmens and ramage 2013 yang et al 2020 3 4 uncertainties in the riverine doc export analysis it should be noted that the water sampling sites in this study are all located in the downstream parts of the corresponding river basins holmes et al 2021 in addition only 1 7 water samples per year were collected for each river basin and such a paucity of data cannot precisely reveal the seasonal variations in riverine doc exports moreover these data spatially average the inherent heterogeneities of climate topography land cover and various hydrological processes across each entire basin for example the streamflow in headwater streams as well as in tributaries that are heavily influenced by glacier derived meltwater and groundwater is always characterized by older δ14c ages than is peat dominated blackwater or water in non glaciated areas aiken et al 2014 walvoord and striegl 2007 thus warming could result in greater contributions of older doc from soils glacial meltwater and groundwater via rapidly receding glaciers and enhanced groundwater aiken et al 2014 csank et al 2019 in addition this study uses the soc in the top 5 cm of each basin but spatial heterogeneities in soil carbon can also be found at a smaller horizontal resolution within a basin hengl et al 2014 as well as in the vertical direction e g the average organic carbon density in the top 1 m of soil 19 2 t km2 is almost 20 times that in the litter horizon 0 90 t km2 throughout russia schepaschenko et al 2013 moreover the stock of the deep carbon pool could change with sedimentary conditions e g yedoma and deltaic deposits in the northern permafrost region deeper than 300 cm have soc values of 407 pg and 241 pg respectively tarnocai et al 2009 furthermore doc decomposition is strongly regulated by the microscale water distribution which varies across soil spaces yan et al 2018 thus hydroclimatic drivers are difficult to quantify due to the complex heterogeneous of river basins basu et al 2010 furthermore the warming effects on the hydrological processes controlling doc export wen et al 2020 are extremely complex spring floods can be affected by permafrost at the beginning of the melting season gao et al 2021 liu et al 2022b which studies have shown has arrived earlier in more recent years kankaanpää et al 2018 zhang and ma 2018 in addition to deepening the active layer via increased soil moisture and thermal conductivity warming could result in shallower active layers as the latent heat of the soil increases pi et al 2021 furthermore permafrost degradation could not only increase the release of carbon petrone et al 2006 but also provide longer residence times for rock water interactions that degrade and reduce the existing doc in water cochand et al 2019 prokushkin et al 2009 moreover this study did not consider increasing terrestrial productivity which is one of the important factors affecting aquatic doc variations zhu et al 2022 human activities could also indirectly influence riverine doc export by affecting hydrological processes e g via the damming of rivers maavara et al 2017 which has weakened the seasonal variation in streamflow of the ob river basin raymond et al 2007 and generally reduces the organic carbon carried by rivers liu et al 2022a maavara et al 2017 finally we note first that the results presented in this study are based on insufficient water sampling data second the river discharge data for the yenisei lena and kolyma river basins have not been corrected for the distance between the sampling location and the discharge measurement position nevertheless our study is focused on the differences among basins and the trends of the seasonal variation in doc rather than its absolute values therefore although there are some uncertainties in the observed doc data due to the random errors associated with water quality measurements these uncertainties can be assumed not to affect the main conclusions 4 conclusion in this study we sought to identify the seasonal variations in riverine doc export and to reveal the predominant drivers of these variations in six large permafrost dominated arctic river basins we found that the seasonality of riverine doc exports is more significant in basins with larger extents of continuous permafrost for the basins dominated by continuous permafrost e g the lena and kolyma river basins permafrost restricts the output of older doc especially during the freezing period in contrast for basins with significant permafrost degradation e g the ob river basin deepening the active layer as a result of warming leads to the release of stored carbon during the thawing of frozen soil from the flood pulse period to the freezing period mobilized organic carbon deepens downwards from the surface soil with decreases in the doc concentration and increases in carbon ages due to the changes in doc sources and transport processes we further identified the influence of water temperature on riverine doc exports and concluded that climate warming could indirectly impact the doc characteristics via changes in the amount of soc storage and in the permafrost extent in boreal regions although the mechanisms regulating riverine doc export are complex and even though no strict statistical analysis was performed due to the large scales of the studied watersheds and the sparsity of observations this work exposed the warming effects on seasonal riverine doc exports in vulnerable permafrost dominated arctic river basins this mechanism is probably associated with permafrost conditions such as the extent of permafrost the ages of deposits and the organic carbon content of permafrost soil as well as other corresponding hydrological conditions notably our analysis did not consider complex doc conversion processes such as groundwater surface water interactions ford and naiman 1989 larned et al 2015 river lake connectivity stolpmann et al

3166,global population growth and rapid economic development along with modern goals for creating sustainable communities render it necessary to focus on fundamental finite resources such as water and energy the interdependencies between water and energy are well known while recently the interest of the scientific and policy communities on their dependency relationship has grown noticeably on the one hand water is used throughout the energy industry while on the other hand the water system needs energy for collecting pumping supplying and treating water considering the latter case great importance should be given when specifically referring to groundwater resources for the abstraction of which a large amount of energy is generally required therefore minimizing the energy consumed for pumping groundwater is extremely important and for this reason a large number of studies have been conducted in order to address this certain issue however most of the studies dealing with pumping cost minimization problems ignore the effect of friction losses on the total energy consumed for pumping and transporting groundwater under this perspective the present paper attempts to highlight the importance of including friction losses in such type of problems by combining a simulation model and an optimization algorithm through the formulation of different setups of the same problem that is the energy cost minimization for pumping groundwater from a system of wells and transporting it through transmission lines it was found that only when including friction losses in the optimization problem all managed wells are being used for pumping water thus resulting in more reasonable and workable solutions keywords water energy nexus groundwater management pumping energy minimization friction losses combined simulation optimization iterative algorithm data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction one of the main goals set by the united nations 2030 program for sustainable development is creating social and sustainable human communities i e communities that can fully and harmoniously combine social and economic progress with environmental protection and respect for all community members tejada guibert et al 2015 united nations 2020 water and energy are two crucial parameters that should be both taken seriously into account when attempting to establish sustainable communities griggs et al 2013 especially if one considers the fact that both water and energy consumption are expected to increase in the future under the combined effect of continuous economic development rapid population growth and global rise of urbanization dai et al 2018 as a matter of fact it is estimated that total energy requirements will increase up to 40 by 2035 while global water demand will grow up to 55 by 2050 moreover in the next 30 years it is projected that more than two thirds of the world population will live in urban areas thus exerting growing pressure on energy and water resources as the basic resources of urban economic development international energy agency 2012 unicef 2013 for these reasons research upon the water energy nexus as the dependency relationship between energy and water resources is called is constantly gaining interest within the scientific community thus having evolved into an important issue that undoubtedly has to be taken into account when designing sustainable policies for the future dai et al 2018 lee et al 2017 wang et al 2018 according to this relationship water and energy are interrelated with each other since on the one hand energy is consumed in various stages of water supply and use while on the other hand water is needed in many aspects of energy generation from coal mining and washing hydro power production to power plant cooling scott et al 2011 wang et al 2018 water supply systems are generally responsible for the consumption of a considerable part of the total energy used in many countries worldwide healy et al 2015 lee et al 2017 especially in the case of groundwater exploitation it is indicatively mentioned that the united states as reported by ahlfeld and laverty 2015 uses around 1 2 of total electricity production for groundwater extraction the whole issue is gaining a greater importance especially for countries like greece where more than 60 of total water demand is covered by groundwater resources eurostat 2022 considering all the above it is becoming clear that the need of minimizing the energy consumed for providing water especially in the case of using groundwater resources is imperative a common approach implemented in order to minimize the energy consumption for pumping water from well systems is to combine simulation models used for quantifying the relationship between managed stresses e g groundwater pumping and aquifer state e g hydraulic heads with optimization tools ahlfeld and baro montes 2008 ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015

mallios and tsiarapas 2021 these solutions lead to more general results and can be used as guides to solve more complicated problems katsifarakis et al 2018 a common feature of most of the studies dealing with the minimization of the energy consumed for groundwater pumping is the fact that they do not consider in the analysis the hydraulic head losses generally occurring when pumping and transporting water through transmission lines this is probably due to the fact that taking into account friction losses occurring in the water pipes makes the problem much more complicated while at the same time it may lead to a solution that is not significantly different from the one deriving when solving the typical minimization problem i e without considering losses mallios and tsiarapas 2021 friction losses however are an important part of the total amount of energy consumed when pumping and transporting water and therefore they should be included in the optimization procedure mallios and tsiarapas 2021 in the present paper an attempt to highlight the importance of considering the energy losses due to friction in optimization problems focused on the minimization of pumping energy consumption is taking place by extending the work of mallios and tsiarapas 2021 who combined analytical groundwater models with an iterative algorithm to solve the minimization problem in the case of a hypothetical confined aquifer taking a step further from the aforementioned study herein the optimization algorithm was coupled with a steady state groundwater flow model developed by siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 and modified accordingly in order to address a real world problem under both confined and unconfined conditions to this task the response matrix approach gorelick 1983 javadi et al 2012 singh 2015 was applied and the corresponding response coefficients quantifying the relationship between hydraulic stimuli i e pumping and aquifer response i e hydraulic head were computed and incorporated into the iterative optimization algorithm the field scale problem concerns the minimization of the energy consumed for pumping and transporting groundwater from a drilling system consisted of ten abstraction wells to a water tank used for providing water to the settlement of nea moudania chalkidiki greece the results clearly show that by incorporating the friction losses in the optimization procedure more reasonable and workable solutions regarding the operation of well systems are obtained while more precise estimation of the total energy consumed when pumping and transporting water is accomplished moreover through the linkage between the simulation model and the optimization algorithm different setups of the field scale optimization problem can be solved thus allowing for investigating the effect of friction losses more efficiently and also reaching safer conclusions regarding the importance of including them in the optimization problem 2 optimization problem formulation this section presents the formulation of the optimization problem considered in this study i e it presents the problem s objective function and basic constraints in addition the stationarity conditions of the problem as presented by katsifarakis 2008 ahlfeld and laverty 2011 and mallios and tsiarapas 2021 and used for finding the optimal solution of the problem are briefly described 2 1 objective function and constraints the optimization problem is formed in such a way that the total energy e tot required for pumping water from a system of wells and transporting it to a water tank is minimized while at the same time meeting specific constraints related to the total water demand as well as to the water velocity range in the transmission lines therefore considering a system of n wells from which water is pumped and is then transported to a tank the objective function of the optimization problem which expresses the total energy needs is defined as it follows 1 minimize e tot ρ g t 1000 η pump i 1 n q i h i where ρ is the water density g is the acceleration of gravity t is the duration of pumping npump is the efficiency coefficient of the pumps which is considered constant and equal for all pumps ahlfeld and laverty 2011 2015 katsifarakis 2008 qi is the pumping rate of the i th well and hi is the corresponding required head for pumping and transferring the water to the tank the required hydraulic head defined above in the case of not considering friction losses is analyzed according to equation 2 while in the case where friction losses are taken into account is analyzed according to equation 3 2 h i δ i s i 3 h i δ i s i h fi where δi is the initial lift at location i which is equal to the distance between the initial level of the hydraulic head and the tank s elevation si is the head drawdown at well i which is due to the operation of the well system and hfi are the friction losses occurring along the pipes that transfer the water to the tank the drawdown si at the location of the i th well when the groundwater flow equation is linear and boundary conditions are not head dependent is expressed by the following linear function of pumping rates ahlfeld and laverty 2011 4 s i j 1 n r ij q j where qj is the flow rate of the i th well and rij is the response coefficients which quantify the change in head at pumping site i with change in pumping rate at location j ahlfeld and laverty 2015 ahlfeld and mulligan 2000 the friction losses hfi occurring along the transmission lines are given from the equation of darcy weisbach de nevers 1970 5 h f i f i l t o t i d i u i 2 2 g q i u i a i u i π d i 2 4 h fi 8 f i l toti q i 2 g π 2 d i 5 where fi is the darcy weisbach friction coefficient ltoti is the length and di is the diameter of the pipe in well i that ends up in the tank the darcy weisbach friction coefficient fi can be calculated using the following equation swamee and jain 1976 6 f i 1 325 ln ε i 3 7 d i 5 74 r e i 0 9 2 where εi is the roughness and rei is the reynolds number of the pipe in well i the total length ltoti of the pipe in well i that ends up in the tank is analysed as 7 l toti s i δ l i where li is the length of the pipe connecting the well i to the tank and si and δ as defined above based on the proceeding analysis symbolizing as a ρ g t 1000 npump and by substituting equations 2 and 4 in equation 1 for the case that friction losses are not considered and equations 3 to 7 in equation 1 for the case that friction losses are taken into account the objective function of the problem is described by equations 8 and 9 respectively 8 minimize e tot a i 1 n q i δ i j 1 n r ij q j 9 minimize e tot a i 1 n 8 f i g π 2 d i 5 q i 3 q i δ i j 1 n r ij q j i 1 n 8 f i l i g π 2 d i

no recharging wells in this application but only pumping wells and c the range of water velocity through the transmission lines which according to swamee and sharma 2008 should be between an upper and

an analytical solution for the minimization problem being studied and more specifically for the case of not considering friction losses which was then extended by ahlfeld and laverty 2011 2015 according to this analytical solution for steady state flow conditions the objective function of the problem is minimized by finding the set pumping flow rates that lead to drawdowns that satisfy at every well i the following stationarity condition 14 δ i 2 s i c or q i 0 mallios and tsiarapas 2021 extended the analytical solution in order to take into consideration the head losses occurring along the transmission lines as wells as the constraints associated with the water velocity the stationarity condition in this case takes the following form 15 j 1 n 8 f j g π 2 d j 5 r i j q j 3 3 8 f i g π 2 d i 5 q i 2 s i δ i l i 2 s i δ i c or q i 0 or q i q m i n or q i q m a x because of the nonlinear form of equation 15 mallios and tsiarapas 2021 developed an iterative algorithm which uses the above stationarity condition in order to find the optimal solution the aforementioned algorithm is used for solving all the problems analyzed in the following sections which actually refer to different setups of the pumping cost minimization problem for the area under study at this point it should be noted that according to the findings of katsifarakis and tselepidou 2009 and mallios and tsiarapas 2021 the above stationarity conditions are still valid even if there are unmanaged wells operating in the area as in our case study implementation that follows 3 case study implementation the area selected for the case study presented in this paper is the coastal basin of nea moudania located in the southwestern part of the chalkidiki peninsula northern greece fig 1 the basin extends over an area of about 127 km2 while its mean topographic elevation is about 176 m above sea level and its mean slope is about 12 the study area is a typical rural area where agriculture dominates both the local economy and land use almost 76 of the study area is used as agricultural land thus leading to increased irrigation needs these needs along with domestic and livestock water needs are exclusively covered by the nea moudania aquifer system fig 1 which is the main exploitable aquifer in the study area and the sole source of freshwater as a result a large number of both private and municipal wells have been drilled in the nea moudania aquifer fig 1 siarkos et al 2021 siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 under natural conditions the nea moudania aquifer is considered to be a semi confined aquifer system which comprises various successive water bearing layers separated by lenses of semi permeable or impermeable materials nevertheless the large number of wells operating in the region have caused substantial decline of groundwater levels thus creating phreatic conditions in several locations especially in the central part of the study area where the bulk of pumpage is accumulated fig 1 siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 the excessive pumping and associated groundwater levels decline have been thoroughly studied either solely e g latinopoulos and siarkos 2014 siarkos et al 2013 or in combination with seawater intrusion caused by existing overexploitation conditions e g siarkos et al 2017 siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 to this task numerical modeling has been used and various groundwater flow and mass transport models have been developed a calibrated steady state flow model built by applying the modflow code mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 in order to form a generic image of the aquifer s behavior as well as to achieve an initial estimation concerning specific aquifer parameters e g hydraulic conductivity recharge is included among them in the following the key elements regarding both the conceptual model of the aquifer under study and the groundwater flow problem under steady state conditions are presented i the boundaries of the aquifer under study match the boundaries of the nea moudania basin except for the northern boundary which was defined based on an isopiezometric map created by applying the ordinary kriging technique latinopoulos et al 2003 fig 1 ii the various successive permeable stratigraphic layers form a single unified system with a uniform thickness of 250 m iii the aquifer s eastern and western boundaries are assigned as no flow boundaries while the southern and northern boundaries are simulated as constant head boundary chb h 0 m and general head boundary ghb h 150 m respectively fig 2 iv the aquifer s hydraulic conductivity was determined on the basis of a few pumping tests conducted in individual wells latinopoulos et al 2003 thus resulting in the delineation of six distinct zones of hydraulic conductivity ranging between 0 116 and 0 669 m day fig 2 v the aquifer is mainly recharged by rainfall irrigation return flows and losses from both water supply and wastewater networks while the groundwater is abstracted through a large number of abstraction wells 518 wells to meet irrigation domestic and livestock needs fig 1 vi the spatial discretization of the numerical model involves the construction of a regularly spaced single layer grid with equal sized cells in the horizontal plane 100 m side which is comprised of 180 rows 120 columns and 1 layer resulting in a vertically integrated two dimensional areal model consisting of one layer and vii the model calibration procedure was accomplished using 17 observation wells monitored during november 2001 latinopoulos et al 2003 by applying the pest tool doherty 2004 mean error 0 096 m mean absolute error 1 193 m and root mean square error 1 419 m the aforementioned steady state flow model was employed in the present study and combined with the algorithm developed by mallios and tsiarapas 2021 in order to solve the pumping optimization problem which is actually translated to the minimization of the total energy consumed for pumping water from a system of ten wells designated as w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 w6 w7 w8 w9 and w10 fig 1 and transporting it to a tank used for providing water to the settlement of nea moudania in particular it is aimed to find the optimal pumping strategy for the system of wells that is to optimally distribute the total amount of water required by the settlement on a daily basis which was estimated to be equal to 3 203 57 m3 d for the year 2021 fig 3 shows the locations of the ten managed wells in conjunction with the location of the tank and the transmission lines that connect each well to the tank in table 1 the coordinates in the ggrs87 projection and the ground surface elevation of the ten wells and the tank along with the length of the pipes between each well and the tank are given for all the necessary calculations taking place in the present study it is mentioned that the water supply wells are all directly connected to the tank with pvc pipes having the following characteristics operating pressure 10 atm internal diameter d 81 4 mm nominal diameter d 0 90 mm and roughness ε 0 01 mm in the context of this paper the pumping cost minimization problem was first solved assuming confined aquifer conditions for this reason a constant transmissivity version of the steady state flow model was created following the procedure described in ahlfeld and laverty 2015 in order to produce a linear groundwater simulation more specifically the upper layer of the aquifer was modified in order to coincide with the steady state heads produced without pumping from the ten managed wells meaning that the rest of the wells in the study area were kept fully operational pre pumping conditions fig 1 ahlfeld and laverty 2015 the hydraulic heads computed following the aforementioned procedure as well the pre pumping lift to the ground surface elevation are depicted in fig 4 while the pre pumping heads at each managed well are given in table 1 it is noted that the initial lift of the managed wells varies over about 50 m with well w1 having the smaller and well w10 the higher initial lift the modified flow model was used to compute the response coefficients by applying the perturbation method ahlfeld and laverty 2015 ahlfeld and mulligan 2000 the response coefficients were then integrated into the iterative algorithm of mallios and tsiarapas 2021 in order to find the optimal solution of the pumping energy consumption minimization problem in the case of three different setups of the problem namely 1 optimal solution for pumping and transporting water to the ground surface without considering friction losses 2 optimal solution for pumping and transporting water to the tank without considering friction losses 3a optimal solution for pumping and transporting water to the tank while considering the losses due to friction and 3b optimal solution for pumping and transporting water to the tank while considering both the losses due to friction and the water velocity constraint after finding the most reasonable and workable solution of the previous setups the steady state flow model was returned to its original form i e head dependent transmissivity and the problem was solved for unconfined aquifer conditions the resulting problem is now non linear and in order to solve it a successive linearization procedure of the relationship between head and pumping as described in ahlfeld and mulligan 2000 was implemented under this repetitive procedure consisted of a number of iterations the response coefficients were computed by applying the perturbation method and the optimization algorithm was run for each iteration the aforementioned procedure was applied only for the problem setup that was found to be the most reasonable and workable and more specifically the one referring to the optimal solution for pumping and transporting water to the tank while considering both the losses due to friction and the water velocity constraint mallios and tsiarapas 2021 at this point it is worth mentioning that for all the setups of the optimization problem and therefore for each optimal solution the values of the drawdown at each managed well which were calculated by the optimization algorithm were verified correctly by the simulation model thus confirming the validity of the optimization procedure 4 results and discussion in this section the results of all setups of the optimization problem as described in section 3 in the form of well pumping rates the initial lift and the drawdown at managed wells the value of the stationarity condition and the electricity consumption in each well are presented at first following the practice which is common in similar studies e g ahlfeld and laverty 2015 the optimization problem is formulated given that groundwater is lifted to the ground surface at the exact location of each well and the energy losses due to friction are not taken into consideration while assuming confined aquifer conditions the results of the first setup of the optimization problem are presented in table 2 the optimal solution found by the optimization algorithm shows that in this case the water demand should be satisfied exclusively by wells w1 w6 and w9 while no water should be pumped from the rest of the wells 7 wells in total this is due to the wide range of the initial lift at the managed wells which as already mentioned vary between 37 1 m and 90 4 m according to the results the three wells activated are the ones with the lowest initial lift values wells w1 w6 and w9 additionally for these three wells the value of the stationarity condition eq 14 is the same which as already mentioned is true when achieving the optimal solution on the other hand for all other wells the water withdrawal was set to zero due to the high value of the initial lift at these wells while the stationarity condition was not calculated in all these cases head drawdown should get lower or even negative values in order for the stationarity condition to be calculated something that obviously cannot happen when pumping water from them next the problem is modified in relation to the previous one so that groundwater is now lifted not to the wells elevation but to the tank s elevation fig 3 friction losses are not considered in this case as well the results of this version are presented in table 3 as it is obvious in this problem setup the convergence of the stationarity condition eq 14 is achieved in more wells compared to the previous version of the problem in particular six of the ten wells are now activated this is due to the fact that the range of the initial lift values is now significantly smaller i e about 15 m in relation to the previous problem setup which was about 50 m the wells with zero flow rates are w4 w7 w8 and w10 which are those having the highest initial lift values as in the previous case in these wells head drawdown should be lower so that the stationarity condition to be calculated it is obvious that drawdown cannot get lower values when pumping water from these wells and therefore they are excluded from the optimal solution of the problem the next problem setup involves pumping and transporting water to the tank taking also into consideration the friction losses occurring through the transmission lines for this configuration of the problem the stationarity condition that must be satisfied for the optimal solution is that of equation 15 the results of this problem setup are shown in table 4 according to these results all ten wells are now activated since the stationarity condition is satisfied for all managed wells furthermore the drawdown at the wells is more evenly distributed compared to the previous two setups of the problem while the head losses due to friction are significantly higher than the values of drawdown at the wells thus highlighting the importance of considering friction losses in the analysis what is worth mentioning is that taking into account the friction losses occurring in the pipes is the reason why all wells are activated since the differences in the initial lift at the wells locations are mainly compensated by the head losses due to friction at this point it is worth a closer view to the values of total energy consumption calculated for the three problem setups presented earlier the electricity consumption shown in tables 2 3 and 4 is 617 77 kwh day 1 135 03 kwh day and 1 356 72 kwh day respectively however these values are not directly comparable since the first two do not correspond to the total energy that is actually consumed due to the fact that friction losses were not taken into consideration during their calculation in order to be able to compare the results of the three versions of the problem as far as the amount of the total energy consumption is considered the values referring to the first two problem setups should be re calculated to this task the total manometric head of the well s pumps which is needed for transporting the water to the tank have to be calculated then the total energy consumption can be computed under this perspective for the pumping flow rates presented in tables 2 and 3 the total energy consumption of the first two problem setups is 3427 73 kwh day and 1997 72 kwh day respectively for pipes with an internal diameter equal to 81 4 mm as these values are much higher than the one shown in table 5 the one referring to the third setup of the problem it turns out that in order to achieve a reasonable and workable solution to such problems the friction losses in the transmission lines should be taken into consideration one more point to note while observing the results of the third version of the problem is the water velocity values presented in the 5th column of table 4 for all wells except w10 the constraints related to the upper and lower limit of the water velocity in the pipes are met however in the case of w10 the water velocity was calculated equal to 0 40 m s as already mentioned see section 2 1 this value is not acceptable for this reason the problem was solved again taking into account this time the constraint associated with the range of the water velocity along the pipes the results of this problem setup are shown in table 5 as expected the results of this problem setup do not significantly differ from the corresponding results of table 4 in general the flow rates of all other wells were reduced so that the flow rate of w10 could be increased to such an extent that the water velocity in this well s transmission line meets the minimum limit of 0 5 m s with regard to the total energy consumption as it was also expected it is slightly higher than the value calculated in the previous version of the problem in which the water velocity constraint was not considered table 4 based on the previous analysis it turns out that the most realistic and applicable solution is the one in which both the losses due to friction and the constraint of the minimum flow rate in the water pipes are taken into account therefore the problem with this setting is also solved for unconfined flow conditions table 6 presents the results obtained from the optimization algorithm for this model formulation as already mentioned in this case since the flow conditions are non linear the solution of the problem was achieved by integrating the algorithm of mallios and tsiarapas 2021 in a sequential linearization algorithm such as that described by ahlfeld and mulligan 2000 the results in table 6 do not significantly differ from the results in table 5 the values of the pumping flow rates calculated and consequently the total amount of energy required is very close to each other this is mostly attributable to the nature of the aquifer of the study area more specifically the behavior of the aquifer for these pumping flow rates is almost linear and this is because the drawdown observed at the wells location is very small in relation to the saturated thickness of the aquifer bear 1979 furthermore as expected drawdown values observed at all well locations are slightly bigger than those presented in table 5 it is also worth noting that the values of the stationarity condition are different for all wells and this is because the stationarity condition only applies to confined aquifers nevertheless the drawdown values calculated by the optimization algorithm were verified by the simulation model of the aquifer by running the simulation model setting the pumping flow rates in the ten studied wells equal to those calculated from the optimization algorithm this proves that the optimization algorithm can also be used in optimization problems involving unconfined aquifer conditions 5 conclusions in the present paper under the context of the water energy nexus the problem of energy cost minimization for pumping water from a system of wells and transporting it through a pipeline network to a tank while taking into account the friction losses occurring in the water transfer pipes was studied more specifically the problem was solved for the case of a system of ten abstraction wells providing water to the settlement of nea moudania by combing a steady state groundwater flow model already built for the study area by siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 with an iterative optimization algorithm developed by mallios and tsiarapas 2021 for the linkage between the simulation and the optimization models the response matrix approach was applied and the response coefficients were calculated and incorporated into the optimization algorithm several problem setups were formulated either by taking the friction loses into account or not while considering both confined and unconfined aquifer conditions the results from the cases examined clearly highlight the importance of including friction losses that occur along the water pipes in problems considering the minimization of energy consumption during groundwater pumping not only a more precise estimate of the energy used for pumping and transporting water does take place but also more reasonable and workable solutions with regard to the operation of the system of managed wells are found to be more specific in those cases where friction loses are incorporated into the optimization algorithm it was found that all managed wells 10 in total are being used for pumping water while in the cases of ignoring friction losses not all the wells are being activated thus leading to not so workable solutions at all i e resulting in exceptionally high pumping rates in the wells having lower initial lift furthermore with regard to the first two problem setups where friction losses are ignored if the energy consumption for each problem is re calculated considering the total manometric head of the well s pumps while at the same time taking into account the hydraulic head losses along the water pipes the results show that the amount of energy required is much more higher than the amount calculated when friction losses are incorporated into the optimization problem in the first place i e third problem setup consequently the main conclusion to be drawn from this study is that in order to obtain more reliable solutions regarding the minimization of the energy consumed for pumping water through a system of wells and transporting it through a pipeline network the head losses due to friction in the water pipes should be taken into consideration and incorporated into the optimization procedure credit authorship contribution

3166,global population growth and rapid economic development along with modern goals for creating sustainable communities render it necessary to focus on fundamental finite resources such as water and energy the interdependencies between water and energy are well known while recently the interest of the scientific and policy communities on their dependency relationship has grown noticeably on the one hand water is used throughout the energy industry while on the other hand the water system needs energy for collecting pumping supplying and treating water considering the latter case great importance should be given when specifically referring to groundwater resources for the abstraction of which a large amount of energy is generally required therefore minimizing the energy consumed for pumping groundwater is extremely important and for this reason a large number of studies have been conducted in order to address this certain issue however most of the studies dealing with pumping cost minimization problems ignore the effect of friction losses on the total energy consumed for pumping and transporting groundwater under this perspective the present paper attempts to highlight the importance of including friction losses in such type of problems by combining a simulation model and an optimization algorithm through the formulation of different setups of the same problem that is the energy cost minimization for pumping groundwater from a system of wells and transporting it through transmission lines it was found that only when including friction losses in the optimization problem all managed wells are being used for pumping water thus resulting in more reasonable and workable solutions keywords water energy nexus groundwater management pumping energy minimization

program for sustainable development is creating social and sustainable human communities i e communities that can fully and harmoniously combine social and economic progress with environmental protection and respect for all community members tejada guibert et al 2015 united nations 2020 water and energy are two crucial parameters that should be both taken seriously into account when attempting to establish sustainable communities griggs et al 2013 especially if one considers the fact that both water and energy consumption are expected to increase in the future under the combined effect of continuous economic development rapid population growth and global rise of urbanization dai et al 2018 as a matter of fact it is estimated that total energy requirements will increase up to 40 by 2035 while global water demand will grow up to 55 by 2050 moreover in the next 30 years it is projected that more than two thirds of the world population will live in urban areas thus exerting growing pressure on energy and water resources as the basic resources of urban economic development international energy agency 2012 unicef 2013 for these reasons research upon the water energy nexus as the dependency relationship between energy and water resources is called is constantly gaining interest within the scientific community thus having evolved into an important issue that undoubtedly has to be taken into account when designing sustainable policies for the future dai et al 2018 lee et al 2017 wang et al 2018 according to this relationship water and energy are interrelated with each other since on the one hand energy is consumed in various stages of water supply and use while on the other hand water is needed in many aspects of energy generation from coal mining and washing hydro power production to power plant cooling scott et al 2011 wang et al 2018 water supply systems are generally responsible for the consumption of a considerable part of the total energy used in many countries worldwide healy et al 2015 lee et al 2017 especially in the case of groundwater exploitation it is indicatively mentioned that the united states as reported by ahlfeld and laverty 2015 uses around 1 2 of total electricity production for groundwater extraction the whole issue is gaining a greater importance especially for countries like greece where more than 60 of total water demand is covered by groundwater resources eurostat 2022 considering all the above it is becoming clear that the need of minimizing the energy consumed for providing water especially in the case of using groundwater resources is imperative a common approach implemented in order to minimize the energy consumption for pumping water from well systems is to combine simulation models used for quantifying the relationship between managed stresses e g groundwater pumping and aquifer state e g hydraulic heads with optimization tools ahlfeld and baro montes 2008 ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015

mallios and tsiarapas 2021 these solutions lead to more general results and can be used as guides to solve more complicated problems katsifarakis et al 2018 a common feature of most of the studies dealing with the minimization of the energy consumed for groundwater pumping is the fact that they do not consider in the analysis the hydraulic head losses generally occurring when pumping and transporting water through transmission lines this is probably due to the fact that taking into account friction losses occurring in the water pipes makes the problem much more complicated while at the same time it may lead to a solution that is not significantly different from the one deriving when solving the typical minimization problem i e without considering losses mallios and tsiarapas 2021 friction losses however are an important part of the total amount of energy consumed when pumping and transporting water and therefore they should be included in the optimization procedure mallios and tsiarapas 2021 in the present paper an attempt to highlight the importance of considering the energy losses due to friction in optimization problems focused on the minimization of pumping energy consumption is taking place by extending the work of mallios and tsiarapas 2021 who combined analytical groundwater models with an iterative algorithm to solve the minimization problem in the case of a hypothetical confined aquifer taking a step further from the aforementioned study herein the optimization algorithm was coupled with a steady state groundwater flow model developed by siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 and modified accordingly in order to address a real world problem under both confined and unconfined conditions to this task the response matrix approach gorelick 1983 javadi et al 2012 singh 2015 was applied and the corresponding response coefficients quantifying the relationship between hydraulic stimuli i e pumping and aquifer response i e hydraulic head were computed and incorporated into the iterative optimization algorithm the field scale problem concerns the minimization of the energy consumed for pumping and transporting groundwater from a drilling system consisted of ten abstraction wells to a water tank used for providing water to the settlement of nea moudania chalkidiki greece the results clearly show that by incorporating the friction losses in the optimization procedure more reasonable and workable solutions regarding the operation of well systems are obtained while more precise estimation of the total energy consumed when pumping and transporting water is accomplished moreover through the linkage between the simulation model and the optimization algorithm different setups of the field scale optimization problem can be solved thus allowing for investigating the effect of friction losses more efficiently and also reaching safer conclusions regarding the importance of including them in the optimization problem 2 optimization problem formulation this section presents the formulation of the optimization problem considered in this study i e it presents the problem s objective function and basic constraints in addition the stationarity conditions of the problem as presented by katsifarakis 2008 ahlfeld and laverty 2011 and mallios and tsiarapas 2021 and used for finding the optimal solution of the problem are briefly described 2 1 objective function and constraints the optimization problem is formed in such a way that the total energy e tot required for pumping water from a system of wells and transporting it to a water tank is minimized while at the same time meeting specific constraints related to the total water demand as well as to the water velocity range in the transmission lines therefore considering a system of n wells from which water is pumped and is then transported to a tank the objective function of the optimization problem which expresses the total energy needs is defined as it follows 1 minimize e tot ρ g t 1000 η pump i 1 n q i h i where ρ is the water density g is the acceleration of gravity t is the duration of pumping npump is the efficiency coefficient of the pumps which is considered constant and equal for all pumps ahlfeld and laverty 2011 2015 katsifarakis 2008 qi is the pumping rate of the i th well and hi is the corresponding required head for pumping and transferring the water to the tank the required hydraulic head defined above in the case of not considering friction losses is analyzed according to equation 2 while in the case where friction losses are taken into account is analyzed according to equation 3 2 h i δ i s i 3 h i δ i s i h fi where δi is the initial lift at location i which is equal to the distance between the initial level of the hydraulic head and the tank s elevation si is the head drawdown at well i which is due to the operation of the well system and hfi are the friction losses occurring along the pipes that transfer the water to the tank the drawdown si at the location of the i th well when the groundwater flow equation is linear and boundary conditions are not head dependent is expressed by the following linear function of pumping rates ahlfeld and laverty 2011 4 s i j 1 n r ij q j where qj is the flow rate of the i th well and rij is the response coefficients which quantify the change in head at pumping site i with change in pumping rate at location j ahlfeld and laverty 2015 ahlfeld and mulligan 2000 the friction losses hfi occurring along the transmission lines are given from the equation of darcy weisbach de nevers 1970 5 h f i f i l t o t i d i u i 2 2 g q i u i a i u i π d i 2 4 h fi 8 f i l toti q i 2 g π 2 d i 5 where fi is the darcy weisbach friction coefficient ltoti is the length and di is the diameter of the pipe in well i that ends up in the tank the darcy weisbach friction coefficient fi can be calculated using the following equation swamee and jain 1976 6 f i 1 325 ln ε i 3 7 d i 5 74 r e i 0 9 2 where εi is the roughness and rei is the reynolds number of the pipe in well i the total length ltoti of the pipe in well i that ends up in the tank is analysed as 7 l toti s i δ l i where li is the length of the pipe connecting the well i to the tank and si and δ as defined above based on the proceeding analysis symbolizing as a ρ g t 1000 npump and by substituting equations 2 and 4 in equation 1 for the case that friction losses are not considered and equations 3 to 7 in equation 1 for the case that friction losses are taken into account the objective function of the problem is described by equations 8 and 9 respectively 8 minimize e tot a i 1 n q i δ i j 1 n r ij q j 9 minimize e tot a i 1 n 8 f i g π 2 d i 5 q i 3 q i δ i j 1 n r ij q j i 1 n 8 f i l i g π 2 d i

an analytical solution for the minimization problem being studied and more specifically for the case of not considering friction losses which was then extended by ahlfeld and laverty 2011 2015 according to this analytical solution for steady state flow conditions the objective function of the problem is minimized by finding the set pumping flow rates that lead to drawdowns that satisfy at every well i the following stationarity condition 14 δ i 2 s i c or q i 0 mallios and tsiarapas 2021 extended the analytical solution in order to take into consideration the head losses occurring along the transmission lines as wells as the constraints associated with the water velocity the stationarity condition in this case takes the following form 15 j 1 n 8 f j g π 2 d j 5 r i j q j 3 3 8 f i g π 2 d i 5 q i 2 s i δ i l i 2 s i δ i c or q i 0 or q i q m i n or q i q m a x because of the nonlinear form of equation 15 mallios and tsiarapas 2021 developed an iterative algorithm which uses the above stationarity condition in order to find the optimal solution the aforementioned algorithm is used for solving all the problems analyzed in the following sections which actually refer to different setups of the pumping cost minimization problem for the area under study at this point it should be noted that according to the findings of katsifarakis and tselepidou 2009 and mallios and tsiarapas 2021 the above stationarity conditions are still valid even if there are unmanaged wells operating in the area as in our case study implementation that follows 3 case study implementation the area selected for the case study presented in this paper is the coastal basin of nea moudania located in the southwestern part of the chalkidiki peninsula northern greece fig 1 the basin extends over an area of about 127 km2 while its mean topographic elevation is about 176 m above sea level and its mean slope is about 12 the study area is a typical rural area where agriculture dominates both the local economy and land use almost 76 of the study area is used as agricultural land thus leading to increased irrigation needs these needs along with domestic and livestock water needs are exclusively covered by the nea moudania aquifer system fig 1 which is the main exploitable aquifer in the study area and the sole source of freshwater as a result a large number of both private and municipal wells have been drilled in the nea moudania aquifer fig 1 siarkos et al 2021 siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 under natural conditions the nea moudania aquifer is considered to be a semi confined aquifer system which comprises various successive water bearing layers separated by lenses of semi permeable or impermeable materials nevertheless the large number of wells operating in the region have caused substantial decline of groundwater levels thus creating phreatic conditions in several locations especially in the central part of the study area where the bulk of pumpage is accumulated fig 1 siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 the excessive pumping and associated groundwater levels decline have been thoroughly studied either solely e g latinopoulos and siarkos 2014 siarkos et al 2013 or in combination with seawater intrusion caused by existing overexploitation conditions e g siarkos et al 2017 siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 to this task numerical modeling has been used and various groundwater flow and mass transport models have been developed a calibrated steady state flow model built by applying the modflow code mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 in order to form a generic image of the aquifer s behavior as well as to achieve an initial estimation concerning specific aquifer parameters e g hydraulic conductivity recharge is included among them in the following the key elements regarding both the conceptual model of the aquifer under study and the groundwater flow problem under steady state conditions are presented i the boundaries of the aquifer under study match the boundaries of the nea moudania basin except for the northern boundary which was defined based on an isopiezometric map created by applying the ordinary kriging technique latinopoulos et al 2003 fig 1 ii the various successive permeable stratigraphic layers form a single unified system with a uniform thickness of 250 m iii the aquifer s eastern and western boundaries are assigned as no flow boundaries while the southern and northern boundaries are simulated as constant head boundary chb h 0 m and general head boundary ghb h 150 m respectively fig 2 iv the aquifer s hydraulic conductivity was determined on the basis of a few pumping tests conducted in individual wells latinopoulos et al 2003 thus resulting in the delineation of six distinct zones of hydraulic conductivity ranging between 0 116 and 0 669 m day fig 2 v the aquifer is mainly recharged by rainfall irrigation return flows and losses from both water supply and wastewater networks while the groundwater is abstracted through a large number of abstraction wells 518 wells to meet irrigation domestic and livestock needs fig 1 vi the spatial discretization of the numerical model involves the construction of a regularly spaced single layer grid with equal sized cells in the horizontal plane 100 m side which is comprised of 180 rows 120 columns and 1 layer resulting in a vertically integrated two dimensional areal model consisting of one layer and vii the model calibration procedure was accomplished using 17 observation wells monitored during november 2001 latinopoulos et al 2003 by applying the pest tool doherty 2004 mean error 0 096 m mean absolute error 1 193 m and root mean square error 1 419 m the aforementioned steady state flow model was employed in the present study and combined with the algorithm developed by mallios and tsiarapas 2021 in order to solve the pumping optimization problem which is actually translated to the minimization of the total energy consumed for pumping water from a system of ten wells designated as w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 w6 w7 w8 w9 and w10 fig 1 and transporting it to a tank used for providing water to the settlement of nea moudania in particular it is aimed to find the optimal pumping strategy for the system of wells that is to optimally distribute the total amount of water required by the settlement on a daily basis which was estimated to be equal to 3 203 57 m3 d for the year 2021 fig 3 shows the locations of the ten managed wells in conjunction with the location of the tank and the transmission lines that connect each well to the tank in table 1 the coordinates in the ggrs87 projection and the ground surface elevation of the ten wells and the tank along with the length of the pipes between each well and the tank are given for all the necessary calculations taking place in the present study it is mentioned that the water supply wells are all directly connected to the tank with pvc pipes having the following characteristics operating pressure 10 atm internal diameter d 81 4 mm nominal diameter d 0 90 mm and roughness ε 0 01 mm in the context of this paper the pumping cost minimization problem was first solved assuming confined aquifer conditions for this reason a constant transmissivity version of the steady state flow model was created following the procedure described in ahlfeld and laverty 2015 in order to produce a linear groundwater simulation more specifically the upper layer of the aquifer was modified in order to coincide with the steady state heads produced without pumping from the ten managed wells meaning that the rest of the wells in the study area were kept fully operational pre pumping conditions fig 1 ahlfeld and laverty 2015 the hydraulic heads computed following the aforementioned procedure as well the pre pumping lift to the ground surface elevation are depicted in fig 4 while the pre pumping heads at each managed well are given in table 1 it is noted that the initial lift of the managed wells varies over about 50 m with well w1 having the smaller and well w10 the higher initial lift the modified flow model was used to compute the response coefficients by applying the perturbation method ahlfeld and laverty 2015 ahlfeld and mulligan 2000 the response coefficients were then integrated into the iterative algorithm of mallios and tsiarapas 2021 in order to find the optimal solution of the pumping energy consumption minimization problem in the case of three different setups of the problem namely 1 optimal solution for pumping and transporting water to the ground surface without considering friction losses 2 optimal solution for pumping and transporting water to the tank without considering friction losses 3a optimal solution for pumping and transporting water to the tank while considering the losses due to friction and 3b optimal solution for pumping and transporting water to the tank while considering both the losses due to friction and the water velocity constraint after finding the most reasonable and workable solution of the previous setups the steady state flow model was returned to its original form i e head dependent transmissivity and the problem was solved for unconfined aquifer conditions the resulting problem is now non linear and in order to solve it a successive linearization procedure of the relationship between head and pumping as described in ahlfeld and mulligan 2000 was implemented under this repetitive procedure consisted of a number of iterations the response coefficients were computed by applying the perturbation method and the optimization algorithm was run for each iteration the aforementioned procedure was applied only for the problem setup that was found to be the most reasonable and workable and more specifically the one referring to the optimal solution for pumping and transporting water to the tank while considering both the losses due to friction and the water velocity constraint mallios and tsiarapas 2021 at this point it is worth mentioning that for all the setups of the optimization problem and therefore for each optimal solution the values of the drawdown at each managed well which were calculated by the optimization algorithm were verified correctly by the simulation model thus confirming the validity of the optimization procedure 4 results and discussion in this section the results of all setups of the optimization problem as described in section 3 in the form of well pumping rates the initial lift and the drawdown at managed wells the value of the stationarity condition and the electricity consumption in each well are presented at first following the practice which is common in similar studies e g ahlfeld and laverty 2015 the optimization problem is formulated given that groundwater is lifted to the ground surface at the exact location of each well and the energy losses due to friction are not taken into consideration while assuming confined aquifer conditions the results of the first setup of the optimization problem are presented in table 2 the optimal solution found by the optimization algorithm shows that in this case the water demand should be satisfied exclusively by wells w1 w6 and w9 while no water should be pumped from the rest of the wells 7 wells in total this is due to the wide range of the initial lift at the managed wells which as already mentioned vary between 37 1 m and 90 4 m according to the results the three wells activated are the ones with the lowest initial lift values wells w1 w6 and w9 additionally for these three wells the value of the stationarity condition eq 14 is the same which as already mentioned is true when achieving the optimal solution on the other hand for all other wells the water withdrawal was set to zero due to the high value of the initial lift at these wells while the stationarity condition was not calculated in all these cases head drawdown should get lower or even negative values in order for the stationarity condition to be calculated something that obviously cannot happen when pumping water from them next the problem is modified in relation to the previous one so that groundwater is now lifted not to the wells elevation but to the tank s elevation fig 3 friction losses are not considered in this case as well the results of this version are presented in table 3 as it is obvious in this problem setup the convergence of the stationarity condition eq 14 is achieved in more wells compared to the previous version of the problem in particular six of the ten wells are now activated this is due to the fact that the range of the initial lift values is now significantly smaller i e about 15 m in relation to the previous problem setup which was about 50 m the wells with zero flow rates are w4 w7 w8 and w10 which are those having the highest initial lift values as in the previous case in these wells head drawdown should be lower so that the stationarity condition to be calculated it is obvious that drawdown cannot get lower values when pumping water from these wells and therefore they are excluded from the optimal solution of the problem the next problem setup involves pumping and transporting water to the tank taking also into consideration the friction losses occurring through the transmission lines for this configuration of the problem the stationarity condition that must be satisfied for the optimal solution is that of equation 15 the results of this problem setup are shown in table 4 according to these results all ten wells are now activated since the stationarity condition is satisfied for all managed wells furthermore the drawdown at the wells is more evenly distributed compared to the previous two setups of the problem while the head losses due to friction are significantly higher than the values of drawdown at the wells thus highlighting the importance of considering friction losses in the analysis what is worth mentioning is that taking into account the friction losses occurring in the pipes is the reason why all wells are activated since the differences in the initial lift at the wells locations are mainly compensated by the head losses due to friction at this point it is worth a closer view to the values of total energy consumption calculated for the three problem setups presented earlier the electricity consumption shown in tables 2 3 and 4 is 617 77 kwh day 1 135 03 kwh day and 1 356 72 kwh day respectively however these values are not directly comparable since the first two do not correspond to the total energy that is actually consumed due to the fact that friction losses were not taken into consideration during their calculation in order to be able to compare the results of the three versions of the problem as far as the amount of the total energy consumption is considered the values referring to the first two problem setups should be re calculated to this task the total manometric head of the well s pumps which is needed for transporting the water to the tank have to be calculated then the total energy consumption can be computed under this perspective for the pumping flow rates presented in tables 2 and 3 the total energy consumption of the first two problem setups is 3427 73 kwh day and 1997 72 kwh day respectively for pipes with an internal diameter equal to 81 4 mm as these values are much higher than the one shown in table 5 the one referring to the third setup of the problem it turns out that in order to achieve a reasonable and workable solution to such problems the friction losses in the transmission lines should be taken into consideration one more point to note while observing the results of the third version of the problem is the water velocity values presented in the 5th column of table 4 for all wells except w10 the constraints related to the upper and lower limit of the water velocity in the pipes are met however in the case of w10 the water velocity was calculated equal to 0 40 m s as already mentioned see section 2 1 this value is not acceptable for this reason the problem was solved again taking into account this time the constraint associated with the range of the water velocity along the pipes the results of this problem setup are shown in table 5 as expected the results of this problem setup do not significantly differ from the corresponding results of table 4 in general the flow rates of all other wells were reduced so that the flow rate of w10 could be increased to such an extent that the water velocity in this well s transmission line meets the minimum limit of 0 5 m s with regard to the total energy consumption as it was also expected it is slightly higher than the value calculated in the previous version of the problem in which the water velocity constraint was not considered table 4 based on the previous analysis it turns out that the most realistic and applicable solution is the one in which both the losses due to friction and the constraint of the minimum flow rate in the water pipes are taken into account therefore the problem with this setting is also solved for unconfined flow conditions table 6 presents the results obtained from the optimization algorithm for this model formulation as already mentioned in this case since the flow conditions are non linear the solution of the problem was achieved by integrating the algorithm of mallios and tsiarapas 2021 in a sequential linearization algorithm such as that described by ahlfeld and mulligan 2000 the results in table 6 do not significantly differ from the results in table 5 the values of the pumping flow rates calculated and consequently the total amount of energy required is very close to each other this is mostly attributable to the nature of the aquifer of the study area more specifically the behavior of the aquifer for these pumping flow rates is almost linear and this is because the drawdown observed at the wells location is very small in relation to the saturated thickness of the aquifer bear 1979 furthermore as expected drawdown values observed at all well locations are slightly bigger than those presented in table 5 it is also worth noting that the values of the stationarity condition are different for all wells and this is because the stationarity condition only applies to confined aquifers nevertheless the drawdown values calculated by the optimization algorithm were verified by the simulation model of the aquifer by running the simulation model setting the pumping flow rates in the ten studied wells equal to those calculated from the optimization algorithm this proves that the optimization algorithm can also be used in optimization problems involving unconfined aquifer conditions 5 conclusions in the present paper under the context of the water energy nexus the problem of energy cost minimization for pumping water from a system of wells and transporting it through a pipeline network to a tank while taking into account the friction losses occurring in the water transfer pipes was studied more specifically the problem was solved for the case of a system of ten abstraction wells providing water to the settlement of nea moudania by combing a steady state groundwater flow model already built for the study area by siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 with an iterative optimization algorithm developed by mallios and tsiarapas 2021 for the linkage between the simulation and the optimization models the response matrix approach was applied and the response coefficients were calculated and incorporated into the optimization algorithm several problem setups were formulated either by taking the friction loses into account or not while considering both confined and unconfined aquifer conditions the results from the cases examined clearly highlight the importance of including friction losses that occur along the water pipes in problems considering the minimization of energy consumption during groundwater pumping not only a more precise estimate of the energy used for pumping and transporting water does take place but also more reasonable and workable solutions with regard to the operation of the system of managed wells are found to be more specific in those cases where friction loses are incorporated into the optimization algorithm it was found that all managed wells 10 in total are being used for pumping water while in the cases of ignoring friction losses not all the wells are being activated thus leading to not so workable solutions at all i e resulting in exceptionally high pumping rates in the wells having lower initial lift furthermore with regard to the first two problem setups where friction losses are ignored if the energy consumption for each problem is re calculated considering the total manometric head of the well s pumps while at the same time taking into account the hydraulic head losses along the water pipes the results show that the amount of energy required is much more higher than the amount calculated when friction losses are incorporated into the optimization problem in the first place i e third problem setup consequently the main conclusion to be drawn from this study is that in order to obtain more reliable solutions regarding the minimization of the energy consumed for pumping water through a system of wells and transporting it through a pipeline network the head losses due to friction in the water pipes should be taken into consideration and incorporated into the optimization procedure credit authorship contribution

3167,the process of water exchange between rivers and groundwater is critical for the circulation of material and energy however this process is strongly affected by dam regulated water and sediment the lower yellow river seeps downward throughout its coarse and suspended perched riverbed and feeds the surrounding floodplain groundwater the xiaolangdi dam xld and water sediment regulation scheme wsrs have altered the exchange processes between river and groundwater along the lower yellow river however few researchers have examined the response of this river fed groundwater system to the operation of the xld and implementation of the wsrs as such in this study we analyzed the responses of groundwater to changes in flow and sediment characteristics based on statistical analysis using historical data extremely randomized tree models and distributed lag non linear models we found that since the xld began operating in 2002 the groundwater level near the lower yellow river substantially decreased and the groundwater level in june significantly decreased at the 0 05 level the highest groundwater level in the pre dam period occurred in august whereas the highest level in the post dam period occurred in october changes in the annual groundwater level and in the mid and post wsrs seasons along the lower yellow river were mainly determined by the water level and incoming sediment coefficient in the river whereas those in the pre wsrs season were mainly determined by the water level and suspended sediment concentration regarding the changes in groundwater level between the mid and post wsrs seasons we found that suspended sediment concentration was the dominant factor in the pre dam period whereas the combined effect of water and sediment was the dominant factor in post dam period the response of the monthly groundwater level to changes in water and sediment characteristics lagged by 2 5 months these results are essential to understanding the interaction between

quality and level kim et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 lee et al 2021 gao et al 2022 mukherjee and singh 2022 few have analyzed the impact of comprehensive changes in water and sediment characteristics on groundwater for analyzing these situations the extremely randomized trees ert model which is a completely randomized ensemble method with excellent accuracy and high computational efficiency especially for large datasets is suitable galelli and castelletti 2013 this model can also be used to evaluate the importance of variables in the process of algorithm implementation helping to avoid overfitting of standalone decision trees li et al 2020 therefore the ert model is suitable for studying the relationships between the changes in water and sediment characteristics caused by dams and groundwater the response of groundwater to changes in river water and sediment characteristics is not limited to the observation period as the response may be delayed gasparrini et al 2017 lowe et al 2018 this lag effect is related to several factors the distance between rivers and groundwater monitoring wells the boundary conditions of rivers with semipermeable riverbeds and the hydraulic head between rivers and groundwater singh 2004 this lag effect can have serious ecological consequences on aquatic and riparian ecosystems sun et al 2016b zimmer and mcglynn 2017 including spring drought sun et al 2016a vegetation degradation jia and ci 2000 soil and groundwater salinization sun et al 2016b land subsidence ma et al 2006 and desertification ge et al 2016 liu et al 2016 this lag effect should be considered when quantifying the interaction between groundwater and rivers particularly given the impacts of dam operation whereas some researchers have considered the lag response between groundwater and rivers most have focused on the relationship between groundwater and climate rainfall change hocking and kelly 2016 bahir et al 2019 atawneh et al 2021 malakar et al 2021 few have investigated the lag response of the groundwater level to dam operation induced changes in water and sediment characteristics the distributed lag non linear model dlnm is a new method used to define the relationship between a predictor and an outcome and then to estimate the related effect the dlnm can not only be used to analyze the lag response of an outcome to a predictor but also to compensate for the shortcomings of models in determining the beginning and end of a lag response gasparrini 2014 however dlnm has not often been applied in hydrological research therefore using the dlnm to analyze the lagged response between groundwater and rivers can provide new insights into the effects of dam operation the xiaolangdi dam xld located in the last gorge in the middle reaches of the yellow river was completed in 2001 the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc implemented the water sediment regulation scheme wsrs in 2002 kong et al 2020 generally the wsrs lasts for 2 3 weeks with two separate phases for water and sediment regulation during the water regulation phase which lasts approximately 10 days a large amounts of runoff are released with a maximum discharge of 4000 m3 s 1 to scour the river channel downstream and preserve reservoir storage for flood control kong et al 2015 during the sediment regulation phase sediments trapped in the xld reservoir is scoured to the lower yellow river to maintain reservoir capacity and the water discharge from the xld decreases from 4000 to 2000 3000 m3 s 1 wang et al 2017 this drastic alteration in hydrodynamic conditions has fundamentally changed the conditions of the water and sediment channel morphology and boundary conditions all of which have affected the interactions and exchanges between river and groundwater along the lower yellow river the water level is consistently higher than the groundwater level in the lower yellow river throughout the year additionally groundwater levels follow changes in the water level yuan et al 2020 the operation of the xld has led to reduced groundwater levels chu 2014 su et al 2021 and changes in hydrochemical features yuan et al 2020 the xld has also transformed the typical wet dry cycle into semi permanent dryness zhao et al 2012 however the seasonal variations in the relationship between river and groundwater before during and after the wsrs have not previously been described additionally whether the groundwater level lags behind the changes in water and sediment induced by the wsrs of the xld remains unclear accordingly in this study we had several main objectives 1 to measure how flow rates frs water levels wls suspended sediment concentrations sscs incoming sediment coefficients iscs and groundwater levels in the lower yellow river were altered by the wsrs of the xld 2 to analyze the contribution rate of water and sediment characteristics to the variations in the groundwater level between the pre and post dam periods and between the mid and post wsrs seasons and 3 to determine whether groundwater level changes lag behind changes in water and sediment characteristics these results provide guidance for the assessment of water resources and the combined regulation of surface water and groundwater in irrigated agricultural areas along the lower yellow river 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yellow river 32 10 42 50 n 95 53 119 05 e is the second longest river in china fig 1 extending approximately 5464 km with a drainage area of 7 95 105 km2 the yellow river is also the most sediment laden river worldwide with an annual maximum sediment load of 3 91 108 kg and a maximum sediment concentration of 972 kg m 3 in its water zhao et al 2012 lu et al 2022 the yellow river is split into three reaches based on hydrology and geography 1 the upper reaches 3472 km ranging from the source region to hekou town in inner mongolia 2 the middle reaches 1206 km extending from hekou town to taohuayu henan and 3 the lower reaches 786 km and covering from taohuayu to the bohai sea the middle reaches flow along the loess plateau and are characterized by loose soil degraded vegetation severe soil erosion and heavy sediment loads gao et al 2016 when the lower yellow river enters a floodplain the channel widens the slope becomes gentler and the sediment is deposit gradually forming a suspended or perched river hong et al 2021 as the river travels over the ground a special phenomenon occurs in which the river replenishes groundwater the lower yellow river area experiences severe floods and droughts to reduce deposition and regulate floods and droughts the xld was built in 2001 and the water and sediment regulation scheme wsrs was implemented in 2002 kong et al 2020 the xld primarily functions to reduce siltation control floods alleviate water shortages and generate power for the needs of those in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river zhao et al 2021a 2022 with the establishment of the wsrs officials expected more than one third of the total annual sediment and runoff to be discharged into the sea li et al 2021 consequently the xld and wsrs are the factors most directly influencing water sediment interactions in the lower yellow river our study area is located in an irrigation district of the lower reaches of the yellow river in henan province the area has a temperate continental monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 12 4 14 3 c annual average precipitation of 616 mm and annual average humidity of 62 zhao et al 2021b the study area is an important agricultural production base mainly for wheat and corn with small amounts of rice being produced here in addition irrigation in this area originates from atmospheric precipitation the yellow river and groundwater chen et al 2002 li et al 2017 although the water from the yellow river compensates for the shortages in atmospheric precipitation the full benefits of obtaining irrigation water from the yellow river have not been optimized because of the large area that requires irrigation in most places agricultural irrigation still depends on the groundwater therefore a more thorough understanding of the effects of operation of the xld on the groundwater levels in the yellow river area is crucial for groundwater management 2 2 data sources for this study the yrcc provided the wl fr ssc and groundwater level data https www yrcc gov cn wl fr and ssc data were obtained at the huayuankou hyk and jiahetan jht hydrological stations and groundwater level data from four monitoring wells yy1 zm18 fq12 and kf10 accordingly we used monthly wl 1983 2019 fr 1983 2019 and ssc 1983 2015 data to analyze changes in water and sediment characteristics at the hyk and jht hydrological stations that were induced by the wsrs of the xld we used groundwater level data 1984 2015 from the four monitoring wells to analyze groundwater changes induced by the wsrs of the xld we analyzed the contribution of fr wl ssc and isc to the annual and seasonal changes pre mid and post wsrs seasons in groundwater levels between the pre and post dam periods we also assessed the lag response of the groundwater level to changes in water and sediment characteristics affected by the wsrs of the xld 2 3 extremely randomized trees model the extremely randomized tree ert model introduced by geurts et al 2006 is an improved version of the original decision tree model which is widely used in regression and classification problems decision trees are recursively trained using all the original training samples in the ert model heddam et al 2020 li et al 2020 compared with other models based on machine learning the ert model provides more benefits in practical applications and exhibits superior streamflow modeling wu 2008b galelli and castelletti 2013 in this study we implemented the ert model using the extratreesregressor package in the sklearn ensemble library in pycharm2021 li et al 2020 to quantitatively measure the contribution rates of fr wl ssc and isc to groundwater changes in the ert model we set 500 random numbers and eigenvalues of 2 or 4 using 70 of the original samples as the training set and the remaining 30 as the test set galelli and castelletti 2013 finally we evaluated the performance of the model by calculating the area under the curve auc the auc value is approximately 1 when the discrimination performance of a model is optimal and approximately 0 5 for an inaccurate classification li et al 2020 in this study the auc of the model on the training set exceeded 0 85 whereas that on the test set exceeded 0 6 this indicated that the constructed model could accurately capture the relationship between water and sediment characteristics and groundwater level 2 4 distributed lag non linear model the effects of water and sediment characteristics on groundwater are not limited to an observed period wu 2008b gasparrini et al 2017 lowe et al 2018 in previous river modeling study wu 2008a 2008b proposed a delayed response model drm based on the self regulation principle of river systems and the characteristic behavior of delayed responses and cumulative effects however the drm does not clearly describe the start and end of the lag response the dlnm is based on the definition of a cross basis obtained by the combination of 2 functions and flexibly models linear or non linear exposure responses and the lag structure of the relationship gasparrini 2014 lowe et al 2018 a standard exposure response function is defined to express a potentially non linear exposure response curve along the dimensions of the influencing factors an additional lag response function expresses the temporal dimension their combination in a bi dimensional exposure lag response function flexibly models both the intensity and timing of past exposures gasparrini et al 2010 the dlnm has been widely applied in studies on extreme weather xing et al 2019 guo et al 2021 biomedicine gasparrini 2014 niewiadomska et al 2020 and the economy lahiani et al 2016 yan et al 2020 however the dlnm has rarely been used to study hydrological processes in this study we applied the dlnm to analyze the relationship between water and sediment characteristics and groundwater level we aimed for this approach to provide a new research method for studying hydrological processes we implemented the dlnm model using the dlnm package in r3 6 1 gasparrini 2014 and our calculation process was as follows a model for time series data may be generally represented by 1 g μ t α j 1 j s j x tj β j k 1 k γ k u tk where t represents time μt e yt g is a monotonic link function and yt is the series of outcomes with t 1 2 n the cross basis functions sj specify the relationships between the variables xj j 1 2 j and the linear predictor defined by the parameter vector βj uk includes other predictors with linear effects specified by the related coefficient γk the first step in the development of a dlnm is to define the relationship within the space of the predictor gasparrini 2011 generally non linear exposure response dependencies are expressed in regression models through an appropriate function s which is the basis function the independent variable xt can be used to generate a new set of variables by selecting a suitable basis function that can be included in the design matrix of the model to estimate its effect common basis functions include orthogonal linear threshold and spline functions braga et al 2001 muggeo 2010 spline functions such as the smoothing natural cubic and b splines are the most widely used yang et al 2012 the spline function formula is as follows 2 s x t β z t β where is the independent variable which represents the frs ssc wl and isc zt represents the tth row of the n vx basis matrix z which is a new variable generated by the transformation of the independent variable through the basis function the basis matrix z then be included in the design matrix of the model in 1 to estimate the related unknown parameters β and define the shape of the relationship the first step defining a dlnm is performed in the dlnm package with the mkbasis function which is used to create the basis matrix z this function provides a general method to include the non linear effects of with different choices specified as different mkbasis arguments the second step in defining a dlnm is specifying the function to model the relationship with the additional dimension of lags allowing for delayed effects gasparrini 2011 given a maximum lag l the additional lag dimension can be expressed by the n l 1 matrix q gasparrini et al 2010 3 q t x t x t ℓ x t l t where qt is the tth row of q the vector of lags ℓ 0 ℓ l t correspond to the scale of this additional dimension distributed lag models dlm can be used to describe the delayed effects of linear relationships using a function to describe the dependency between the outcome and the lagged exposures gasparrini et al 2010 the formula is defined as follows 4 s x t η q t c η where c is an l 1 vℓ matrix of basis variables derived from the application of the specific basis functions to the lag vector ℓ and η is a vector of unknown parameters this basis matrix is used to define the relationship along the lag dimension this second step is performed in dlnm through the mklagbasis function which calls mkbasis to build the basis matrix c the last step in the specification of a dlnm is defining the relationship between the two dimensions of the predictor and the lags on a cross basis gasparrini 2011 first a basis is chosen for to derive z namely formula 2 second creating the additional lag dimension for each basis variable of namely formula 3 produces an n vx l 1 array r through the selection of the appropriate basis function for matrix q third with c defined in 4 a dlnm can be represented by 5 s x t η j 1 v x k 1 v ℓ r t j c k η jk w t η where wt is the t th row of the cross basis matrix w finally rtj is derived from the lag exposure qt using the basis function j transformation this is performed by the crossbasis function which calls the mkbasis and mklagbasis functions to generate the two basis matrices z and c respectively which are combined through a tensor product to produce w based on the dlnm in this study we focused on the main factors influencing the groundwater level and discussed the lag response of the groundwater level to changes in water and sediment characteristics the dlnm process and relative risk rr calculations are shown in fig 2 we set the degrees of freedom df 2 or 3 and maximum lag period 6 in the dlnm where the lag times from 0 to 6 represented june to december respectively the exposed and the non exposed groups represented the monthly fr wl ssc isc and groundwater level data in the mid wsrs june august and post wsrs september december periods respectively rr is defined as the ratio of the risk of the exposed group to non exposed group gasparrini 2014 lowe et al 2018 which indicated the degrees of changes in water and sediment at the groundwater level within 6 months of the maximum lag period an rr 1 indicated the groundwater level responded to the exposure factors where a rr represented a stronger response of the groundwater level an rr 1 indicated that the change in groundwater level was independent of the exposure factors a p value 0 01 indicates that the groundwater level showed a significantly lagged response to water and sediment characteristics in the observed lag period cheng et al 2021 guo et al 2021 the specific model we implemented using the dlnm package in r3 6 1 was as follows 6 e y t α β 1 w tl wl n s time d f y e a r n s fr d f n s ssc d f n s isc d f 7 rr i e i o where t is the observation month yt is the groundwater level at month t e yt is the expected groundwater level in month t α is the intercept indicating the baseline risk w 1 t l is the cross basis function obtained by applying the dlnm to the mean monthly water level df is the degrees of freedom β1 is the vector of coefficients for w1 t l and l is the number of lag months we used a natural cubic b spline ns to estimate the non linear and lag effects of the mean monthly water level ie is the ratio of months in which groundwater was affected by the wsrs to the total number of months of the wsrs io is the ratio of the months in which groundwater was affected by non wsrs to the total number of months of non wsrs 2 5 statistical analysis the operation of the xld has changed water and sediment characteristics groundwater and their relationship with the lower yellow river based on the water and sediment data from the hyk and jht hydrological stations and the groundwater level data from the monitoring wells yy1 zm18 fq12 and kf10 from 1983 to 2019 we used one way analysis of variance anova to test whether fl wl ssc isc and groundwater level at the monthly scale significantly changed from the pre to the post dam period we used spearman s rank correlation coefficient srcc to analyze the correlation between water and sediment characteristics fl wl ssc and isc and groundwater level at annual seasonal and monthly scales in the pre and post dam periods schmid and schmidt 2007 we implemented anova and srcc using spss24 song and park 2020 3 results 3 1 variation in water and sediment characteristics in lower yellow river we analyzed the changes in fr wl ssc and isc at the hyk and jht hydrological stations fig 3 at hyk we observed the maximum fr 1768 43 m3 s 1 in august in the pre dam period whereas in the post dam period the maximum 1597 11 m3 s 1 occurred in june fig 3a1 the fr in june significantly different p 0 01 between the per and post dam periods fig 3a1 this indicated that the xld not only decreased the peak fr in the lower yellow river but also artificially advanced the time of the peak fr the ssc and isc from june to october showed an inverted v shaped curve in the pre dam period and we observed both the maximum ssc 47 57 kg m 3 and isc 0 0269 in august fig 3b1 and d1 in the post dam period both ssc and isc decreased especially from july to september fig 3b1 and d1 ssc was significantly lower in january p 0 01 february p 0 01 may p 0 01 june p 0 05 and december p 0 01 isc was significantly lower in all 12 months p 0 01 fig 3b1 and d1 compared with the pre dam period the wl in the post dam period was significantly lower in march p 0 01 april p 0 01 and july p 0 01 and we found the highest wl 90 65 m in june fig 3c1 the changes in the fr wl ssc and isc at jht were similar to those at hyk we observed the maximum fr in the pre and post dam periods in august 1662 17 m3 s 1 and june 1525 28 m3 s 1 respectively fig 3a2 the ssc and isc showed an inverted v shaped curve in the pre dam period with both reaching maxima in august at 44 01 kg m 3 and 0 0265 respectively fig 3b2 and d2 in contrast both ssc and isc decreased in the post dam period fig 3b2 and d2 however the ssc at hyk significantly lower in may p 0 01 july p 0 05 august p 0 01 and october p 0 01 in the post dam period fig 3b2 wl generally decreased in the post dam period with the highest value occurring in june 73 91 m fig 3c2 wl was significantly different only in june p 0 05 fig 3c2 this finding indicated that the operation of the xld substantially altered the water and sediment conditions in the lower yellow river 3 2 spatiotemporal variation in groundwater levels the changes in the monthly groundwater levels at the four monitoring wells yy1 zm18 fq12 and kf10 along the lower yellow river were similar fig 4 for each month the groundwater levels at the four monitoring wells were lower in the post dam than pre dam period as indicated by the mean median maximum and minimum values we observed the highest groundwater levels at the four monitoring wells in august during the pre dam period fig 4 which is consistent with the fr ssc wl and isc values fig 3 this indicated that the groundwater level synchronously changed with the water and sediment characteristics in the pre dam period in contrast in the post dam period the highest groundwater levels occurred in october the highest fr and wl values in june and the highest ssc and isc values in july fig 3 supporting the existence of a lagged response between groundwater level and water and sediment characteristics in the post dam period the changes in the groundwater level at the four monitoring wells were differed specifically at yy1 fig 4a and kf10 fig 4d the dispersion degree of the groundwater level in the post dam period exceeded that in the pre dam period we observed no significant differences except for june at kf10 in contrast at both zm18 and fq12 we found significant differences between the pre and post dam periods at zm18 fig 4b the groundwater level in each month was significantly lower p 0 05 or 0 01 in the post dam period except for october and december at fq12 fig 4c we identified significant decreases p 0 05 or 0 01 in the groundwater level in january february april june and august were observed 3 3 relationship between water and sediment characteristics and groundwater level we analyzed the annual seasonal pre mid and post wsrs seasons and monthly correlations between groundwater level and water and sediment characteristics tables 1 2 and 3 annually only the groundwater levels at yy1 and zm18 significantly correlated with fr in the pre dam period whereas those of fq12 and kf10 significantly correlated with wl ssc and isc in the post dam period table 1 the groundwater levels at yy1 and zm18 in the mid and post wsrs seasons of the pre dam period significantly correlated with fr particularly at zm18 those at fq12 and kf10 significantly correlated with fr and ssc table 1 in the post dam period except for yy1 groundwater levels in the pre wsrs season significantly correlated with fr wl ssc and isc particularly at kf10 in the mid wsrs season the groundwater levels at zm18 and fq12 significantly correlated with wl in the post wsrs season fr wl ssc and isc significantly correlated with groundwater levels particularly at fq12 monthly the correlation between groundwater levels and wl and ssc was insignificant in the pre dam period but significant in the post dam period p 0 05 or 0 01 in contrast the correlation between groundwater levels and fr and isc mainly was significant in the pre dam period p 0 05 or 0 01 in the post dam period it was insignificant or inversed from positive to negative and vice versa tables 2 and 3 we observed significant inverse relationships between groundwater levels and water and sediment characteristics in the post and pre dam periods we mainly observed these relationships for fr particularly at zm18 for example in the pre and post dam periods the correlations between fr and the groundwater level at zm18 in the pre wsrs season were 0 888 and 0 900 respectively in march the correlation coefficients were 0 767 and 0 900 respectively the correlations between the isc and groundwater level at zm18 in april were 0 786 and 1 000 respectively at fq12 in august the correlations were 0 901 and 0 900 respectively from these results we found that the correlations between groundwater levels and water and sediment characteristics in the study area was significantly altered by the wsrs 3 4 contribution of water and sediment characteristics to variations in groundwater level 3 4 1 factors influencing the inter annual variation in groundwater level at yy1 wl contributed the most to the changes in the annual groundwater level 71 16 followed by isc 14 89 ssc 11 71 and fr 2 78 fig 5 a1 wl ssc isc and fr contributed 43 78 28 57 23 09 and 4 55 to the changes in the groundwater level in the pre wsrs season fig 5a2 74 19 12 51 11 66 and 1 64 in the mid wsrs season fig 5a3 and 56 23 12 34 30 89 and 0 54 in the post wsrs season respectively fig 5a4 at zm18 the contribution rates of fr wl ssc and isc to the changes in the annual and seasonal groundwater levels were similar to those at yy1 at fq12 and kf10 isc contributed the most to the changes in the annual groundwater level and those in the mid and post wsrs seasons whereas ssc contributed the most in the pre wsrs season in general wl was the main factor influencing the variations in groundwater level at yy1 and zm18 particularly annually and in the mid and post wsrs seasons whereas isc and ssc were the main factors influencing the variations in the groundwater level at fq12 and kf10 3 4 2 factors influencing seasonal variations in groundwater level fig 6 shows the contribution rates of fr wl ssc and isc to the changes in the groundwater level between the mid and post wsrs seasons at yy1 ssc 46 63 contributed the most to the changes in seasonal groundwater level followed by wl 20 9 fr 18 41 and isc 14 06 in the pre dam period in contrast in post dam period fr 33 58 contributed the most to the changes in the seasonal groundwater level followed by isc 25 61 wl 22 34 and ssc 18 47 at fq12 the wl 38 15 contributed the most to the changes in the seasonal groundwater level followed by isc 27 93 ssc 17 84 and fr 16 09 in pre dam period the isc 31 44 contributed the most to the changes in the seasonal groundwater level followed by ssc 28 2 wl 21 03 and fr 19 33 in the post dam period at zm18 and kf10 ssc contributed the most to the changes in the seasonal groundwater levels in the pre dam period whereas wl contributed the most in the post dam period in general in the pre dam period ssc ssc wl and ssc were the main factors influencing the variations in the groundwater levels at yy1 zm18 fq12 and kf10 respectively fr wl isc and wl were the main factors influencing the variations in the groundwater level at yy1 zm18 fq12 and kf10 in the post dam period respectively 3 5 lag in groundwater levels after changes in water and sediment factors fig 7 shows the lagged response of the groundwater level at yy1 zm18 fq12 and kf10 to changes in water and sediment characteristics in the lower yellow river in the post dam period fr was the main factor influencing the variations in the groundwater level at yy1 and we observed no lag similarly the isc was the main factor influencing variations in the groundwater level at fq12 with no lag these results indicated that the groundwater at yy1 and fq12 was sensitive to changes in fr and isc respectively however wl was the main factor influencing the variations in groundwater levels at the zm18 and kf10 with a lag of 2 5 months this showed that although wl influenced the groundwater at these two wells the response of groundwater to changes in wl did not synchronously occur in particular the response of groundwater to changes in wl induced by the wsrs at kf 10 occurred later than that at zm18 therefore groundwater along the lower yellow river responded to the wsrs with a lag whereas groundwater closer to the river synchronously responded 4 discussion 4 1 effects of the xld and wsrs on water and sediment characteristics in the lower yellow river the operation of the xld and the implementation of the wsrs could fundamentally altered the water and sediment processes in the lower yellow river these alterations have mainly manifested as decreasing and advancing fr peaks and decreasing ssc isc and wl kong et al 2015 2016 chen and wang 2019 wu et al 2021 we confirmed these findings in the present study confirmed this we also found that the distance from the xld affected the changes in water and sediment characteristics particularly the monthly wl and ssc at hyk which lies 142 9 km downstream from the xld wl in the post dam period significantly declined p 0 01 notably in march april and july in contrast at jht which is 106 km downstream from hyk wl declined in the post dam period although only significantly in june p 0 05 we attributed this difference to the effects of the xld and wsrs on channel morphology chen and wang 2019 wu et al 2021 in the pre wsrs season the discharge of clean water from the reservoir with a low ssc could have led to a downstream channel incision however a channel incision occurred in the upper reach of the lower yellow river between the xld and hyk hou et al 2021 in addition large amounts of sediment were deposited in the lower yellow river and the sediment content in the river was high although the construction of the xld intercepted sediment and there reduced the sediment content in the lower yellow river sediment regulation in the mid wsrs season led to the deposited sediment being washed into the estuary this led to a higher sediment content in the channel than in the non wsrs season wang et al 2017 lu et al 2022 therefore we observed that ssc was significantly lower in the post dam period p 0 01 at hyk in january february may and december and at jht in may august and october however ssc was significantly lower p 0 05 at hyk and jht in june and july respectively generally changes in wl and ssc at hyk were more significant than those at jht both before and after the construction of the xld the ssc and isc from june to august in the lower yellow river remarkably changed in the pre and post dam periods mainly related to the construction of the xld and the duration of sediment regulation in the mid wsrs period kong et al 2015 kong et al 2020 in the pre dam period compared with the non flood season the ssc and isc from june to august in the lower yellow river were higher and lasted longer owing to seasonal floods chen et al 2019 hou et al 2021 in the post dam period the wsrs has lasts for 2 3 weeks with two separate phases for water and sediment regulation during the water regulation phase a large amount of runoff was released by the xld to scour the downstream channel and the ssc and isc were low kong et al 2015 during the sediment regulation phase sediments trapped in the xld reservoir were scoured to the lower yellow river and so the ssc and isc were higher wang et al 2017 however the duration of sediment regulation was short and the ssc and isc gradually decreased over time during june august the xld retained upstream sediment and released clear water to maintain downstream rivers li et al 2021 at this time ssc and isc were lower in the lower yellow river therefore in the post dam period the wsrs could only maintain high ssc and isc during the sediment regulation phase based on monthly data we analyzed the impact of the operation of the xld on ssc and isc in the lower yellow river compared with the daily data the monthly data represented the combined changes in monthly ssc and isc we found that ssc and isc from june to august in the lower yellow river were significantly decreased in the post dam period 4 2 relationship between water and sediment characteristics and groundwater level the groundwater level along the lower yellow river was affected by the wsrs of the xld the groundwater level in the post dam period decreased which is consistent with the results of previous studies prathapar and bawain 2014 su et al 2021 however the xld had different effects on groundwater level at four monitoring wells because rivers only have an effective influence on the groundwater level within a limited range zhao et al 2012 xin et al 2020 as the distance increased and the scope expanded the influence of the river on the groundwater level gradually weakened su et al 2021 in this study yy1 zm18 fq12 and kf10 were located 3 72 km 2 41 km 3 47 km and 5 08 km respectively from the yellow river therefore the groundwater levels at zm18 and fq12 which are closer to the yellow river showed a stronger response to the operation of the xld moreover the highest groundwater level in the pre dam period occurred in august which was consistent with the time the highest fr wl ssc and isc occurred in the post dam period the highest fr wl ssc and isc occurred in july whereas the highest groundwater level occurred in october this indicated that the groundwater level in the lower yellow river may exhibit a lag effect behind the water and sediment characteristics affected by the wsrs of the xld in the post dam period the relationships between groundwater levels and water and sediment characteristics widely varied and sometimes even inversed between the pre and post dam periods this may have been related to the erosion deposition and channel morphology formed by the combination of water and sediment xin et al 2020 in this study the monitoring wells were located far from the yellow river and river water impacted the groundwater through slow lateral seepage however brunner et al 2017 reported that sediment deposited in the riverbed reduced hydraulic conductivity and affected the exchange capacity between river and groundwater before the xld was constructed the water level in the channels in the lower yellow river were lower and had more sediment and serious siltation particularly in the non flood season the xld improved the combination of water and sediment and washed the riverbed producing favorable conditions for the exchange of river and groundwater therefore the isc and groundwater levels in april 0 786 1 000 and august 0 901 0 900 were negatively correlated in the pre dam period and positively correlated in the post dam period however the wide and shallow channel of the lower yellow river formed a floodplain that allowed runoff to easily overflow the banks before the xld was constructed wang et al 2020 the runoff after dam operation was trapped in the narrow and deep channels and could only affect the groundwater through lateral seepage indicating that the runoff before dam construction more likely promoted exchanges between river and groundwater therefore the fr in the pre wsrs season positively 0 888 and negatively 0 900 correlated with the groundwater level in the pre and post dam periods respectively the main factors influencing the inter annual changes in the groundwater level along the lower yellow river differ although xin et al 2020 yuan et al 2020 and this study found that the annual response of groundwater to rivers was highly dependent on the dynamic change in water level this may only hold true for monitoring wells close to the river for example yy1 and zm18 the fq12 and kf10 located further downstream are 3 47 km and 5 08 km away from the yellow river respectively compared with yy1 and zm18 the changes in the groundwater levels at fq12 and kf10 may have been related to the distance from these monitoring wells to the yellow river in addition diem et al 2014 found that riverbed morphology affected the distribution of the river water level which in turn drove exchanges with groundwater for monitoring wells far from rivers and therefore not susceptible to rivers river morphological characteristics and boundary conditions su et al 2021 affected by changes in water sediment combinations may be factors more strongly affecting groundwater level changes in this study xld completely changed the water and sediment conditions in the lower yellow river reshaping the riverbed and channel morphology li et al 2021 lu et al 2022 this change was more conducive to the exchange of river and groundwater levels at the considered monitoring wells especially fq12 and kf10 which were farther from the yellow river than the other monitoring sites annual and seasonal mid and post wsrs changes in isc were the main factors affecting the annual changes in groundwater level before and after the dam operation however compared with the mid and post wsrs seasons ssc was the main factor influencing fq12 and kf10 seasonally in the pre wsrs season in the pre wsrs season prior to the xld the ssc was high and serious sediment deposition occurred in the channels of the lower reaches of the yellow river in contrast the post dam ssc was low owing to the release of clean water the changes in the channel deposition and erosion between the pre and post dam periods led to changes in the recharge of groundwater by river water peng et al 2010 therefore the influence of changes in the sediment deposited in the river channel before and after dam construction was stronger that of other factors in summary wl and isc were the main factors affecting groundwater level changes in annual seasonal mid and post wsrs while wl and ssc were the main factors seasonally affecting groundwater level changes in the pre wsrs the main factors affecting the changes in the groundwater level along the lower yellow river between the mid wsrs and post wsrs seasons differed in the pre and post dam periods the wl 38 15 in the pre dam period was the main factor affecting the changes in the groundwater level at fq12 however the deposition of sediments can reduce the hydraulic conductivity of riverbeds the interface between river and groundwater which controls river groundwater interactions schälchli 1992 brunner et al 2017 as the river with the highest sediment content worldwide the yellow river sees deposits a large amount of sediment in the downstream river channel which reduces the hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed and affects the development of river channel morphology and the water level hou et al 2021 shi 2021 therefore changes in the ssc restricted the development of groundwater levels yy1 zm18 and kf10 along the lower yellow river in the pre dam period however the artificial floods generated by the wsrs of the xld have washed away parts of the downstream riverbed kong et al 2015 thereby improving the downstream silting situation kong et al 2020 this produced wl conditions at zm18 and kf10 that were conducive to water exchange inside and outside the channel however the effects of lateral seepage differ caused by differences in riverbank boundary conditions which rendered fr and isc particularly important in affecting the groundwater levels at yy1 and fq12 thus the combined changes in water and sediment characteristics after dam construction affected the groundwater level in the lower yellow river 4 3 response of groundwater level to changes in river water and sediment the groundwater level along the lower yellow river lagged behind changes in water and sediment characteristics induced by the wsrs of the xld the groundwater levels at monitoring wells farther from the river typically were affected by water trapped in the channel which could only affect the groundwater level through slow lateral infiltration prathapar and bawain 2014 xin et al 2020 however different monitoring wells had to different hydrogeological conditions and topography fu et al 2020 which means that the groundwater levels at four monitoring wells differently responded to changes in water and sediment characteristics in this study we found that the groundwater levels at zm18 and kf10 lagged behind the changes in water and sediment characteristics in addition the monitoring wells were located 2 km away from the yellow river so a long time would have been required for lateral seepage to affect the groundwater level we used monthly data to analyze the monthly lag response of the groundwater level to changes in water and sediment characteristics through a dlnm although the results indicated the start and end times of the lag responses the data were not sufficiently precise in the future more detailed groundwater level data near the river need to be collected to enable a more accurate analysis of the daily lag response of groundwater level to changes in water and sediment characteristics through a dlnm 5 study implications and limitations the operation of the xld and the implementation of the wsrs have changed the characteristics of water and sediment and the groundwater in the lower yellow river in this study by combining the ert model and dlnm we identified the main water and sediment factors influencing the groundwater levels at four monitoring wells along the lower yellow river and determined the lag response of the groundwater level to changes in water and sediment characteristics induced by the xld and the wsrs we determined the start and end times of the lagged response of the groundwater level compared with other machine learning methods the ert model has been effectively used in watershed hydrological research because of complete randomization integration method efficient and accurate calculation results importance assessment of variables and avoidance of excessive fitting galelli and castelletti 2013 li et al 2020 therefore in this study we used the ert model to rank the factors influencing groundwater and determine the contribution rate of each factor to that level this process compensated for the shortcomings of the dlnm model in selecting the main factors through experience and subjective which laid a foundation for the rational analysis of the lag effect the dlnm is a new method used to characterize the non linear exposure lag response relationship between variables which is less restrictive in terms of data requirements gasparrini 2014 lowe et al 2018 yan et al 2020 guo et al 2021 as long as perfectly matched independent and dependent variable data are available the lag response between various factors can be purposefully analyzed with this study we are the first apply a dlnm in hydrological research the successful application of the dlnm based on monthly fr wl ssc isc and groundwater level data opens new research possibilities and a new method for analyzing the lag response of groundwater in areas lacking fine or high precision data in particular compared with simple and basic statistical methods the combination of ert and dlnm can not only handle big data but also provides improved calculation efficiency and accuracy enabling the application of data from qualitative research to quantitative research galelli and castelletti 2013 gasparrini 2014 li et al 2020 this method is beneficial for analyzing the relationships among factors involved in watershed hydrology and other fields however we determined the lag response of groundwater to river water and sediment characteristics based on groundwater data observed from four randomly distributed monitoring wells along the lower yellow river we did not consider the distance gradient between river and monitoring wells applying a well designed distance gradient may more accurately reveal the lag response mechanism of groundwater to river water and sediment characteristics bayat et al 2020 atawneh et al 2021 the lag effect on river water and groundwater is a complex hydrological process that is influenced by the hydraulic gradient riverbed permeability and other factors singh 2004 brunner et al 2017 xin et al 2020 the models we introduced in this study which are differ from physical models gasparrini 2011 cheng et al 2021 did not consider these factors in addition we considered the construction of the xld and the operation of the wsrs as the demarcation point for determining the impact of natural and anthropogenic factors on hydrological time series which highlighted the lag effect in hydrological processes induced by dam regulation however we did not address the specific contribution of other factors to the lag effect in hydrological processes given the above limitations optimizing the introduced methods or introducing other methods is needed in the future however the results of this study promote the research on the interaction between river water and groundwater and provide a useful scientific basis for the management and planning of river water and groundwater 5 conclusions rivers are important source for groundwater recharge dam construction in a rivers can disturb downstream hydrologic processes and indirectly affect the development of groundwater to explore how dam construction affected the changes in groundwater level along the lower yellow river in this study we first analyzed the changes in water and sediment characteristics and groundwater level in the pre and post dam periods the results showed that the operation of the xld not only decreased the peak fr ssc wl isc and groundwater level but also advanced the peak fr to june the highest monthly groundwater level synchronously changed with water and sediment characteristics before dam construction but lagged behind the changes in water and sediment characteristics after the dam was constructed moreover the distance between the monitoring wells and the yellow river also affected the relationship between groundwater and water and sediment characteristics comparing the post dam and pre dam periods we found that the changes in the wl and isc contributed most to the changes in the groundwater level in the annual and mid and post wsrs seasons wl and ssc contributed most in the pre wsrs season between the mid wsrs and post wsrs seasons changes in the ssc and the combined effect of water sediment contributed the most to changes in the groundwater level along the lower yellow river in pre and post dam periods respectively although groundwater is inseparable from changes in water and sediment characteristics the river channel morphology also plays an important role we found that the response of the monthly groundwater level to the changes in the water and sediment characteristics lagged by 2 5 months although we examined the response of typical river fed groundwater system to the operation of the xld and the implementation of the wsrs more accurate river and

3167,the process of water exchange between rivers and groundwater is critical for the circulation of material and energy however this process is strongly affected by dam regulated water and sediment the lower yellow river seeps downward throughout its coarse and suspended perched riverbed and feeds the surrounding floodplain groundwater the xiaolangdi dam xld and water sediment regulation scheme wsrs have altered the exchange processes between river and groundwater along the lower yellow river however few researchers have examined the response of this river fed groundwater system to the operation of the xld and implementation of the wsrs as such in this study we analyzed the responses of groundwater to changes in flow and sediment characteristics based on statistical analysis using historical data extremely randomized tree models and distributed lag non linear models we found that since the xld began operating in 2002 the groundwater level near the lower yellow river substantially decreased and the groundwater level in june significantly decreased at the 0 05 level the highest groundwater level in the pre dam period occurred in august whereas the highest level in the post dam period occurred in october changes in the annual groundwater level and in the mid and post wsrs seasons along the lower yellow river were mainly determined by the water level and incoming sediment coefficient in the river whereas those in the pre wsrs season were mainly determined by the water level and suspended sediment concentration regarding the changes in groundwater level between the mid and post wsrs seasons we found that suspended sediment concentration was the dominant factor in the pre dam period whereas the combined effect of water and sediment was the dominant factor in post dam period the response of the monthly groundwater level to changes in water and sediment characteristics lagged by 2 5 months these results are essential to understanding the interaction between river water and groundwater keywords xiaolangdi dam water sediment regulation groundwater level lag response extremely randomized trees model distributed lag non linear model 1 introduction as the world s largest freshwater resource groundwater plays an important role in maintaining human health energy and food security social and economic development ecosystem services and biodiversity giordano 2009 gleeson et al 2016 de graaf et al 2019 janža 2022 affected by natural and anthropogenic factors the lateral and vertical exchange of water materials solids and solutes and energy of rivers and the surrounding groundwater have substantially changed harvey and gooseff 2015 ferencz et al 2019 these changes are severely threatening energy and food security human health and ecosystems klove et al 2011 gleeson et al 2020 as an exacerbating human factor dams increase the frequency of river fluctuations bevelhimer et al 2015 which considerably changes the interactions between rivers and groundwater prathapar and bawain 2014 ferencz et al 2019 bayat et al 2020 therefore the relationships between rivers dams and groundwater must be analyzed yellen and boutt 2015 shuai et al 2017 song et al 2018 dam induced changes in river water and sediment characteristics affect the groundwater hervai et al 2020 because the groundwater along the river is intimately connected both physically and chemically to the river water winter 1999 dam construction and operation can lead to highly dynamic downstream flows and water level fluctuations which can alter channel morphology and river boundary conditions including the riverbed and river wall prathapar and bawain 2014 oh et al 2016 wang et al 2017 as well as promote the movement of water and solutes between rivers and groundwater harvey and gooseff 2015 for example a higher river water level can alter the flow direction between rivers and groundwater fill unsaturated zones and displace groundwater ferencz et al 2019 these changes comprehensively affect the lateral seepage capacity of rivers and the groundwater recharge rate bayat et al 2020 although researchers have focused on the impact of dam operation on groundwater quality and level kim et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 lee et al 2021 gao et al 2022 mukherjee and singh 2022 few have analyzed the impact of comprehensive changes in water and sediment characteristics on groundwater for analyzing these situations the extremely randomized trees ert model which is a completely randomized ensemble method with excellent accuracy and high computational efficiency especially for large datasets is suitable galelli and castelletti 2013 this model can also be used to evaluate the importance of variables in the process of algorithm implementation helping to avoid overfitting of standalone decision trees li et al 2020 therefore the ert model is suitable for studying the relationships between the changes in water and sediment characteristics caused by dams and groundwater the response of groundwater to changes in river water and sediment characteristics is not limited to the observation period as the response may be delayed gasparrini et al 2017 lowe et al 2018 this lag effect is related to several factors the distance between rivers and groundwater monitoring wells the boundary conditions of rivers with semipermeable riverbeds and the hydraulic head between rivers and groundwater singh 2004 this lag effect can have serious ecological consequences on aquatic and riparian ecosystems sun et al 2016b zimmer and mcglynn 2017 including spring drought sun et al 2016a vegetation degradation jia and ci 2000 soil and groundwater salinization sun et al 2016b land subsidence ma et al 2006 and desertification ge et al 2016 liu et al 2016 this lag effect should be considered when quantifying the interaction between groundwater and rivers particularly given the impacts of dam operation whereas some researchers have considered the lag response between groundwater and rivers most have focused on the relationship between groundwater and climate rainfall change hocking and kelly 2016 bahir et al 2019 atawneh et al 2021 malakar et al 2021 few have investigated the lag response of the groundwater level to dam operation induced changes in water and sediment characteristics the distributed lag non linear model dlnm is a new method used to define the relationship between a predictor and an outcome and then to estimate the related effect the dlnm can not only be used to analyze the lag response of an outcome to a predictor but also to compensate for the shortcomings of models in determining the beginning and end of a lag response gasparrini 2014 however dlnm has not often been applied in hydrological research therefore using the dlnm to analyze the lagged response between groundwater and rivers can provide new insights into the effects of dam operation the xiaolangdi dam xld located in the last gorge in the middle reaches of the yellow river was completed in 2001 the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc implemented the water sediment regulation scheme wsrs in 2002 kong et al 2020 generally the wsrs lasts for 2 3 weeks with two separate phases for water and sediment regulation during the water regulation phase which lasts approximately 10 days a large amounts of runoff are released with a maximum discharge of 4000 m3 s 1 to scour the river channel downstream and preserve reservoir storage for flood control kong et al 2015 during the sediment regulation phase sediments trapped in the xld reservoir is scoured to the lower yellow river to maintain reservoir capacity and the water discharge from the xld decreases from 4000 to 2000 3000 m3 s 1 wang et al 2017 this drastic alteration in hydrodynamic conditions has fundamentally changed the conditions of the water and sediment channel morphology and boundary conditions all of which have affected the interactions and exchanges between river and groundwater along the lower yellow river the water level is consistently higher than the groundwater level in the lower yellow river throughout the year additionally groundwater levels follow changes in the water level yuan et al 2020 the operation of the xld has led to reduced groundwater levels chu 2014 su et al 2021 and changes in hydrochemical features yuan et al 2020 the xld has also transformed the typical wet dry cycle into semi permanent dryness zhao et al 2012 however the seasonal variations in the relationship between river and groundwater before during and after the wsrs have not previously been described additionally whether the groundwater level lags behind the changes in water and sediment induced by the wsrs of the xld remains unclear accordingly in this study we had several main objectives 1 to measure how flow rates frs water levels wls suspended sediment concentrations sscs incoming sediment coefficients iscs and groundwater levels in the lower yellow river were altered by the wsrs of the xld 2 to analyze the contribution rate of water and sediment characteristics to the variations in the groundwater level between the pre and post dam periods and between the mid and post wsrs seasons and 3 to determine whether groundwater level changes lag behind changes in water and sediment characteristics these results provide guidance for the assessment of water resources and the combined regulation of surface water and groundwater in irrigated agricultural areas along the lower yellow river 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yellow river 32 10 42 50 n 95 53 119 05 e is the second longest river in china fig 1 extending approximately 5464 km with a drainage area of 7 95 105 km2 the yellow river is also the most sediment laden river worldwide with an annual maximum sediment load of 3 91 108 kg and a maximum sediment concentration of 972 kg m 3 in its water zhao et al 2012 lu et al 2022 the yellow river is split into three reaches based on hydrology and geography 1 the upper reaches 3472 km ranging from the source region to hekou town in inner mongolia 2 the middle reaches 1206 km extending from hekou town to taohuayu henan and 3 the lower reaches 786 km and covering from taohuayu to the bohai sea the middle reaches flow along the loess plateau and are characterized by loose soil degraded vegetation severe soil erosion and heavy sediment loads gao et al 2016 when the lower yellow river enters a floodplain the channel widens the slope becomes gentler and the sediment is deposit gradually forming a suspended or perched river hong et al 2021 as the river travels over the ground a special phenomenon occurs in which the river replenishes groundwater the lower yellow river area experiences severe floods and droughts to reduce deposition and regulate floods and droughts the xld was built in 2001 and the water and sediment regulation scheme wsrs was implemented in 2002 kong et al 2020 the xld primarily functions to reduce siltation control floods alleviate water shortages and generate power for the needs of those in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river zhao et al 2021a 2022 with the establishment of the wsrs officials expected more than one third of the total annual sediment and runoff to be discharged into the sea li et al 2021 consequently the xld and wsrs are the factors most directly influencing water sediment interactions in the lower yellow river our study area is located in an irrigation district of the lower reaches of the yellow river in henan province the area has a temperate continental monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 12 4 14 3 c annual average precipitation of 616 mm and annual average humidity of 62 zhao et al 2021b the study area is an important agricultural production base mainly for wheat and corn with small amounts of rice being produced here in addition irrigation in this area originates from atmospheric precipitation the yellow river and groundwater chen et al 2002 li et al 2017 although the water from the yellow river compensates for the shortages in atmospheric precipitation the full benefits of obtaining irrigation water from the yellow river have not been optimized because of the large area that requires irrigation in most places agricultural irrigation still depends on the groundwater therefore a more thorough understanding of the effects of operation of the xld on the groundwater levels in the yellow river area is crucial for groundwater management 2 2 data sources for this study the yrcc provided the wl fr ssc and groundwater level data https www yrcc gov cn wl fr and ssc data were obtained at the huayuankou hyk and jiahetan jht hydrological stations and groundwater level data from four monitoring wells yy1 zm18 fq12 and kf10 accordingly we used monthly wl 1983 2019 fr 1983 2019 and ssc 1983 2015 data to analyze changes in water and sediment characteristics at the hyk and jht hydrological stations that were induced by the wsrs of the xld we used groundwater level data 1984 2015 from the four monitoring wells to analyze groundwater changes induced by the wsrs of the xld we analyzed the contribution of fr wl ssc and isc to the annual and seasonal changes pre mid and post wsrs seasons in groundwater levels between the pre and post dam periods we also assessed the lag response of the groundwater level to changes in water and sediment characteristics affected by the wsrs of the xld 2 3 extremely randomized trees model the extremely randomized tree ert model introduced by geurts et al 2006 is an improved version of the original decision tree model which is widely used in regression and classification problems decision trees are recursively trained using all the original training samples in the ert model heddam et al 2020 li et al 2020 compared with other models based on machine learning the ert model provides more benefits in practical applications and exhibits superior streamflow modeling wu 2008b galelli and castelletti 2013 in this study we implemented the ert model using the extratreesregressor package in the sklearn ensemble library in pycharm2021 li et al 2020 to quantitatively measure the contribution rates of fr wl ssc and isc to groundwater changes in the ert model we set 500 random numbers and eigenvalues of 2 or 4 using 70 of the original samples as the training set and the remaining 30 as the test set galelli and castelletti 2013 finally we evaluated the performance of the model by calculating the area under the curve auc the auc value is approximately 1 when the discrimination performance of a model is optimal and approximately 0 5 for an inaccurate classification li et al 2020 in this study the auc of the model on the training set exceeded 0 85 whereas that on the test set exceeded 0 6 this indicated that the constructed model could accurately capture the relationship between water and sediment characteristics and groundwater level 2 4 distributed lag non linear model the effects of water and sediment characteristics on groundwater are not limited to an observed period wu 2008b gasparrini et al 2017 lowe et al 2018 in previous river modeling study wu 2008a 2008b proposed a delayed response model drm based on the self regulation principle of river systems and the characteristic behavior of delayed responses and cumulative effects however the drm does not clearly describe the start and end of the lag response the dlnm is based on the definition of a cross basis obtained by the combination of 2 functions and flexibly models linear or non linear exposure responses and the lag structure of the relationship gasparrini 2014 lowe et al 2018 a standard exposure response function is defined to express a potentially non linear exposure response curve along the dimensions of the influencing factors an additional lag response function expresses the temporal dimension their combination in a bi dimensional exposure lag response function flexibly models both the intensity and timing of past exposures gasparrini et al 2010 the dlnm has been widely applied in studies on extreme weather xing et al 2019 guo et al 2021 biomedicine gasparrini 2014 niewiadomska et al 2020 and the economy lahiani et al 2016 yan et al 2020 however the dlnm has rarely been used to study hydrological processes in this study we applied the dlnm to analyze the relationship between water and sediment characteristics and groundwater level we aimed for this approach to provide a new research method for studying hydrological processes we implemented the dlnm model using the dlnm package in r3 6 1 gasparrini 2014 and our calculation process was as follows a model for time series data may be generally represented by 1 g μ t α j 1 j s j x tj β j k 1 k γ k u tk where t represents time μt e yt g is a monotonic link function and yt is the series of outcomes with t 1 2 n the cross basis functions sj specify the relationships between the variables xj j 1 2 j and the linear predictor defined by the parameter vector βj uk includes other predictors with linear effects specified by the related coefficient γk the first step in the development of a dlnm is to define the relationship within the space of the predictor gasparrini 2011 generally non linear exposure response dependencies are expressed in regression models through an appropriate function s which is the basis function the independent variable xt can be used to generate a new set of variables by selecting a suitable basis function that can be included in the design matrix of the model to estimate its effect common basis functions include orthogonal linear threshold and spline functions braga et al 2001 muggeo 2010 spline functions such as the smoothing natural cubic and b splines are the most widely used yang et al 2012 the spline function formula is as follows 2 s x t β z t β where is the independent variable which represents the frs ssc wl and isc zt represents the tth row of the n vx basis matrix z which is a new variable generated by the transformation of the independent variable through the basis function the basis matrix z then be included in the design matrix of the model in 1 to estimate the related unknown parameters β and define the shape of the relationship the first step defining a dlnm is performed in the dlnm package with the mkbasis function which is used to create the basis matrix z this function provides a general method to include the non linear effects of with different choices specified as different mkbasis arguments the second step in defining a dlnm is specifying the function to model the relationship with the additional dimension of lags allowing for delayed effects gasparrini 2011 given a maximum lag l the additional lag dimension can be expressed by the n l 1 matrix q gasparrini et al 2010 3 q t x t x t ℓ x t l t where qt is the tth row of q the vector of lags ℓ 0 ℓ l t correspond to the scale of this additional dimension distributed lag models dlm can be used to describe the delayed effects of linear relationships using a function to describe the dependency between the outcome and the lagged exposures gasparrini et al 2010 the formula is defined as follows 4 s x t η q t c η where c is an l 1 vℓ matrix of basis variables derived from the application of the specific basis functions to the lag vector ℓ and η is a vector of unknown parameters this basis matrix is used to define the relationship along the lag dimension this second step is performed in dlnm through the mklagbasis function which calls mkbasis to build the basis matrix c the last step in the specification of a dlnm is defining the relationship between the two dimensions of the predictor and the lags on a cross basis gasparrini 2011 first a basis is chosen for to derive z namely formula 2 second creating the additional lag dimension for each basis variable of namely formula 3 produces an n vx l 1 array r through the selection of the appropriate basis function for matrix q third with c defined in 4 a dlnm can be represented by 5 s x t η j 1 v x k 1 v ℓ r t j c k η jk w t η where wt is the t th row of the cross basis matrix w finally rtj is derived from the lag exposure qt using the basis function j transformation this is performed by the crossbasis function which calls the mkbasis and mklagbasis functions to generate the two basis matrices z and c respectively which are combined through a tensor product to produce w based on the dlnm in this study we focused on the main factors influencing the groundwater level and discussed the lag response of the groundwater level to changes in water and sediment characteristics the dlnm process and relative risk rr calculations are shown in fig 2 we set the degrees of freedom df 2 or 3 and maximum lag period 6 in the dlnm where the lag times from 0 to 6 represented june to december respectively the exposed and the non exposed groups represented the monthly fr wl ssc isc and groundwater level data in the mid wsrs june august and post wsrs september december periods respectively rr is defined as the ratio of the risk of the exposed group to non exposed group gasparrini 2014 lowe et al 2018 which indicated the degrees of changes in water and sediment at the groundwater level within 6 months of the maximum lag period an rr 1 indicated the groundwater level responded to the exposure factors where a rr represented a stronger response of the groundwater level an rr 1 indicated that the change in groundwater level was independent of the exposure factors a p value 0 01 indicates that the groundwater level showed a significantly lagged response to water and sediment characteristics in the observed lag period cheng et al 2021 guo et al 2021 the specific model we implemented using the dlnm package in r3 6 1 was as follows 6 e y t α β 1 w tl wl n s time d f y e a r n s fr d f n s ssc d f n s isc d f 7 rr i e i o where t is the observation month yt is the groundwater level at month t e yt is the expected groundwater level in month t α is the intercept indicating the baseline risk w 1 t l is the cross basis function obtained by applying the dlnm to the mean monthly water level df is the degrees of freedom β1 is the vector of coefficients for w1 t l and l is the number of lag months we used a natural cubic b spline ns to estimate the non linear and lag effects of the mean monthly water level ie is the ratio of months in which groundwater was affected by the wsrs to the total number of months of the wsrs io is the ratio of the months in which groundwater was affected by non wsrs to the total number of months of non wsrs 2 5 statistical analysis the operation of the xld has changed water and sediment characteristics groundwater and their relationship with the lower yellow river based on the water and sediment data from the hyk and jht hydrological stations and the groundwater level data from the monitoring wells yy1 zm18 fq12 and kf10 from 1983 to 2019 we used one way analysis of variance anova to test whether fl wl ssc isc and groundwater level at the monthly scale significantly changed from the pre to the post dam period we used spearman s rank correlation coefficient srcc to analyze the correlation between water and sediment characteristics fl wl ssc and isc and groundwater level at annual seasonal and monthly scales in the pre and post dam periods schmid and schmidt 2007 we implemented anova and srcc using spss24 song and park 2020 3 results 3 1 variation in water and sediment characteristics in lower yellow river we analyzed the changes in fr wl ssc and isc at the hyk and jht hydrological stations fig 3 at hyk we observed the maximum fr 1768 43 m3 s 1 in august in the pre dam period whereas in the post dam period the maximum 1597 11 m3 s 1 occurred in june fig 3a1 the fr in june significantly different p 0 01 between the per and post dam periods fig 3a1 this indicated that the xld not only decreased the peak fr in the lower yellow river but also artificially advanced the time of the peak fr the ssc and isc from june to october showed an inverted v shaped curve in the pre dam period and we observed both the maximum ssc 47 57 kg m 3 and isc 0 0269 in august fig 3b1 and d1 in the post dam period both ssc and isc decreased especially from july to september fig 3b1 and d1 ssc was significantly lower in january p 0 01 february p 0 01 may p 0 01 june p 0 05 and december p 0 01 isc was significantly lower in all 12 months p 0 01 fig 3b1 and d1 compared with the pre dam period the wl in the post dam period was significantly lower in march p 0 01 april p 0 01 and july p 0 01 and we found the highest wl 90 65 m in june fig 3c1 the changes in the fr wl ssc and isc at jht were similar to those at hyk we observed the maximum fr in the pre and post dam periods in august 1662 17 m3 s 1 and june 1525 28 m3 s 1 respectively fig 3a2 the ssc and isc showed an inverted v shaped curve in the pre dam period with both reaching maxima in august at 44 01 kg m 3 and 0 0265 respectively fig 3b2 and d2 in contrast both ssc and isc decreased in the post dam period fig 3b2 and d2 however the ssc at hyk significantly lower in may p 0 01 july p 0 05 august p 0 01 and october p 0 01 in the post dam period fig 3b2 wl generally decreased in the post dam period with the highest value occurring in june 73 91 m fig 3c2 wl was significantly different only in june p 0 05 fig 3c2 this finding indicated that the operation of the xld substantially altered the water and sediment conditions in the lower yellow river 3 2 spatiotemporal variation in groundwater levels the changes in the monthly groundwater levels at the four monitoring wells yy1 zm18 fq12 and kf10 along the lower yellow river were similar fig 4 for each month the groundwater levels at the four monitoring wells were lower in the post dam than pre dam period as indicated by the mean median maximum and minimum values we observed the highest groundwater levels at the four monitoring wells in august during the pre dam period fig 4 which is consistent with the fr ssc wl and isc values fig 3 this indicated that the groundwater level synchronously changed with the water and sediment characteristics in the pre dam period in contrast in the post dam period the highest groundwater levels occurred in october the highest fr and wl values in june and the highest ssc and isc values in july fig 3 supporting the existence of a lagged response between groundwater level and water and sediment characteristics in the post dam period the changes in the groundwater level at the four monitoring wells were differed specifically at yy1 fig 4a and kf10 fig 4d the dispersion degree of the groundwater level in the post dam period exceeded that in the pre dam period we observed no significant differences except for june at kf10 in contrast at both zm18 and fq12 we found significant differences between the pre and post dam periods at zm18 fig 4b the groundwater level in each month was significantly lower p 0 05 or 0 01 in the post dam period except for october and december at fq12 fig 4c we identified significant decreases p 0 05 or 0 01 in the groundwater level in january february april june and august were observed 3 3 relationship between water and sediment characteristics and groundwater level we analyzed the annual seasonal pre mid and post wsrs seasons and monthly correlations between groundwater level and water and sediment characteristics tables 1 2 and 3 annually only the groundwater levels at yy1 and zm18 significantly correlated with fr in the pre dam period whereas those of fq12 and kf10 significantly correlated with wl ssc and isc in the post dam period table 1 the groundwater levels at yy1 and zm18 in the mid and post wsrs seasons of the pre dam period significantly correlated with fr particularly at zm18 those at fq12 and kf10 significantly correlated with fr and ssc table 1 in the post dam period except for yy1 groundwater levels in the pre wsrs season significantly correlated with fr wl ssc and isc particularly at kf10 in the mid wsrs season the groundwater levels at zm18 and fq12 significantly correlated with wl in the post wsrs season fr wl ssc and isc significantly correlated with groundwater levels particularly at fq12 monthly the correlation between groundwater levels and wl and ssc was insignificant in the pre dam period but significant in the post dam period p 0 05 or 0 01 in contrast the correlation between groundwater levels and fr and isc mainly was significant in the pre dam period p 0 05 or 0 01 in the post dam period it was insignificant or inversed from positive to negative and vice versa tables 2 and 3 we observed significant inverse relationships between groundwater levels and water and sediment characteristics in the post and pre dam periods we mainly observed these relationships for fr particularly at zm18 for example in the pre and post dam periods the correlations between fr and the groundwater level at zm18 in the pre wsrs season were 0 888 and 0 900 respectively in march the correlation coefficients were 0 767 and 0 900 respectively the correlations between the isc and groundwater level at zm18 in april were 0 786 and 1 000 respectively at fq12 in august the correlations were 0 901 and 0 900 respectively from these results we found that the correlations between groundwater levels and water and sediment characteristics in the study area was significantly altered by the wsrs 3 4 contribution of water and sediment characteristics to variations in groundwater level 3 4 1 factors influencing the inter annual variation in groundwater level at yy1 wl contributed the most to the changes in the annual groundwater level 71 16 followed by isc 14 89 ssc 11 71 and fr 2 78 fig 5 a1 wl ssc isc and fr contributed 43 78 28 57 23 09 and 4 55 to the changes in the groundwater level in the pre wsrs season fig 5a2 74 19 12 51 11 66 and 1 64 in the mid wsrs season fig 5a3 and 56 23 12 34 30 89 and 0 54 in the post wsrs season respectively fig 5a4 at zm18 the contribution rates of fr wl ssc and isc to the changes in the annual and seasonal groundwater levels were similar to those at yy1 at fq12 and kf10 isc contributed the most to the changes in the annual groundwater level and those in the mid and post wsrs seasons whereas ssc contributed the most in the pre wsrs season in general wl was the main factor influencing the variations in groundwater level at yy1 and zm18 particularly annually and in the mid and post wsrs seasons whereas isc and ssc were the main factors influencing the variations in the groundwater level at fq12 and kf10 3 4 2 factors influencing seasonal variations in groundwater level fig 6 shows the contribution rates of fr wl ssc and isc to the changes in the groundwater level between the mid and post wsrs seasons at yy1 ssc 46 63 contributed the most to the changes in seasonal groundwater level followed by wl 20 9 fr 18 41 and isc 14 06 in the pre dam period in contrast in post dam period fr 33 58 contributed the most to the changes in the seasonal groundwater level followed by isc 25 61 wl 22 34 and ssc 18 47 at fq12 the wl 38 15 contributed the most to the changes in the seasonal groundwater level followed by isc 27 93 ssc 17 84 and fr 16 09 in pre dam period the isc 31 44 contributed the most to the changes in the seasonal groundwater level followed by ssc 28 2 wl 21 03 and fr 19 33 in the post dam period at zm18 and kf10 ssc contributed the most to the changes in the seasonal groundwater levels in the pre dam period whereas wl contributed the most in the post dam period in general in the pre dam period ssc ssc wl and ssc were the main factors influencing the variations in the groundwater levels at yy1 zm18 fq12 and kf10 respectively fr wl isc and wl were the main factors influencing the variations in the groundwater level at yy1 zm18 fq12 and kf10 in the post dam period respectively 3 5 lag in groundwater levels after changes in water and sediment factors fig 7 shows the lagged response of the groundwater level at yy1 zm18 fq12 and kf10 to changes in water and sediment characteristics in the lower yellow river in the post dam period fr was the main factor influencing the variations in the groundwater level at yy1 and we observed no lag similarly the isc was the main factor influencing variations in the groundwater level at fq12 with no lag these results indicated that the groundwater at yy1 and fq12 was sensitive to changes in fr and isc respectively however wl was the main factor influencing the variations in groundwater levels at the zm18 and kf10 with a lag of 2 5 months this showed that although wl influenced the groundwater at these two wells the response of groundwater to changes in wl did not synchronously occur in particular the response of groundwater to changes in wl induced by the wsrs at kf 10 occurred later than that at zm18 therefore groundwater along the lower yellow river responded to the wsrs with a lag whereas groundwater closer to the river synchronously responded 4 discussion 4 1 effects of the xld and wsrs on water and sediment characteristics in the lower yellow river the operation of the xld and the implementation of the wsrs could fundamentally altered the water and sediment processes in the lower yellow river these alterations have mainly manifested as decreasing and advancing fr peaks and decreasing ssc isc and wl kong et al 2015 2016 chen and wang 2019 wu et al 2021 we confirmed these findings in the present study confirmed this we also found that the distance from the xld affected the changes in water and sediment characteristics particularly the monthly wl and ssc at hyk which lies 142 9 km downstream from the xld wl in the post dam period significantly declined p 0 01 notably in march april and july in contrast at jht which is 106 km downstream from hyk wl declined in the post dam period although only significantly in june p 0 05 we attributed this difference to the effects of the xld and wsrs on channel morphology chen and wang 2019 wu et al 2021 in the pre wsrs season the discharge of clean water from the reservoir with a low ssc could have led to a downstream channel incision however a channel incision occurred in the upper reach of the lower yellow river between the xld and hyk hou et al 2021 in addition large amounts of sediment were deposited in the lower yellow river and the sediment content in the river was high although the construction of the xld intercepted sediment and there reduced the sediment content in the lower yellow river sediment regulation in the mid wsrs season led to the deposited sediment being washed into the estuary this led to a higher sediment content in the channel than in the non wsrs season wang et al 2017 lu et al 2022 therefore we observed that ssc was significantly lower in the post dam period p 0 01 at hyk in january february may and december and at jht in may august and october however ssc was significantly lower p 0 05 at hyk and jht in june and july respectively generally changes in wl and ssc at hyk were more significant than those at jht both before and after the construction of the xld the ssc and isc from june to august in the lower yellow river remarkably changed in the pre and post dam periods mainly related to the construction of the xld and the duration of sediment regulation in the mid wsrs period kong et al 2015 kong et al 2020 in the pre dam period compared with the non flood season the ssc and isc from june to august in the lower yellow river were higher and lasted longer owing to seasonal floods chen et al 2019 hou et al 2021 in the post dam period the wsrs has lasts for 2 3 weeks with two separate phases for water and sediment regulation during the water regulation phase a large amount of runoff was released by the xld to scour the downstream channel and the ssc and isc were low kong et al 2015 during the sediment regulation phase sediments trapped in the xld reservoir were scoured to the lower yellow river and so the ssc and isc were higher wang et al 2017 however the duration of sediment regulation was short and the ssc and isc gradually decreased over time during june august the xld retained upstream sediment and released clear water to maintain downstream rivers li et al 2021 at this time ssc and isc were lower in the lower yellow river therefore in the post dam period the wsrs could only maintain high ssc and isc during the sediment regulation phase based on monthly data we analyzed the impact of the operation of the xld on ssc and isc in the lower yellow river compared with the daily data the monthly data represented the combined changes in monthly ssc and isc we found that ssc and isc from june to august in the lower yellow river were significantly decreased in the post dam period 4 2 relationship between water and sediment characteristics and groundwater level the groundwater level along the lower yellow river was affected by the wsrs of the xld the groundwater level in the post dam period decreased which is consistent with the results of previous studies prathapar and bawain 2014 su et al 2021 however the xld had different effects on groundwater level at four monitoring wells because rivers only have an effective influence on the groundwater level within a limited range zhao et al 2012 xin et al 2020 as the distance increased and the scope expanded the influence of the river on the groundwater level gradually weakened su et al 2021 in this study yy1 zm18 fq12 and kf10 were located 3 72 km 2 41 km 3 47 km and 5 08 km respectively from the yellow river therefore the groundwater levels at zm18 and fq12 which are closer to the yellow river showed a stronger response to the operation of the xld moreover the highest groundwater level in the pre dam period occurred in august which was consistent with the time the highest fr wl ssc and isc occurred in the post dam period the highest fr wl ssc and isc occurred in july whereas the highest groundwater level occurred in october this indicated that the groundwater level in the lower yellow river may exhibit a lag effect behind the water and sediment characteristics affected by the wsrs of the xld in the post dam period the relationships between groundwater levels and water and sediment characteristics widely varied and sometimes even inversed between the pre and post dam periods this may have been related to the erosion deposition and channel morphology formed by the combination of water and sediment xin et al 2020 in this study the monitoring wells were located far from the yellow river and river water impacted the groundwater through slow lateral seepage however brunner et al 2017 reported that sediment deposited in the riverbed reduced hydraulic conductivity and affected the exchange capacity between river and groundwater before the xld was constructed the water level in the channels in the lower yellow river were lower and had more sediment and serious siltation particularly in the non flood season the xld improved the combination of water and sediment and washed the riverbed producing favorable conditions for the exchange of river and groundwater therefore the isc and groundwater levels in april 0 786 1 000 and august 0 901 0 900 were negatively correlated in the pre dam period and positively correlated in the post dam period however the wide and shallow channel of the lower yellow river formed a floodplain that allowed runoff to easily overflow the banks before the xld was constructed wang et al 2020 the runoff after dam operation was trapped in the narrow and deep channels and could only affect the groundwater through lateral seepage indicating that the runoff before dam construction more likely promoted exchanges between river and groundwater therefore the fr in the pre wsrs season positively 0 888 and negatively 0 900 correlated with the groundwater level in the pre and post dam periods respectively the main factors influencing the inter annual changes in the groundwater level along the lower yellow river differ although xin et al 2020 yuan et al 2020 and this study found that the annual response of groundwater to rivers was highly dependent on the dynamic change in water level this may only hold true for monitoring wells close to the river for example yy1 and zm18 the fq12 and kf10 located further downstream are 3 47 km and 5 08 km away from the yellow river respectively compared with yy1 and zm18 the changes in the groundwater levels at fq12 and kf10 may have been related to the distance from these monitoring wells to the yellow river in addition diem et al 2014 found that riverbed morphology affected the distribution of the river water level which in turn drove exchanges with groundwater for monitoring wells far from rivers and therefore not susceptible to rivers river morphological characteristics and boundary conditions su et al 2021 affected by changes in water sediment combinations may be factors more strongly affecting groundwater level changes in this study xld completely changed the water and sediment conditions in the lower yellow river reshaping the riverbed and channel morphology li et al 2021 lu et al 2022 this change was more conducive to the exchange of river and groundwater levels at the considered monitoring wells especially fq12 and kf10 which were farther from the yellow river than the other monitoring sites annual and seasonal mid and post wsrs changes in isc were the main factors affecting the annual changes in groundwater level before and after the dam operation however compared with the mid and post wsrs seasons ssc was the main factor influencing fq12 and kf10 seasonally in the pre wsrs season in the pre wsrs season prior to the xld the ssc was high and serious sediment deposition occurred in the channels of the lower reaches of the yellow river in contrast the post dam ssc was low owing to the release of clean water the changes in the channel deposition and erosion between the pre and post dam periods led to changes in the recharge of groundwater by river water peng et al 2010 therefore the influence of changes in the sediment deposited in the river channel before and after dam construction was stronger that of other factors in summary wl and isc were the main factors affecting groundwater level changes in annual seasonal mid and post wsrs while wl and ssc were the main factors seasonally affecting groundwater level changes in the pre wsrs the main factors affecting the changes in the groundwater level along the lower yellow river between the mid wsrs and post wsrs seasons differed in the pre and post dam periods the wl 38 15 in the pre dam period was the main factor affecting the changes in the groundwater level at fq12 however the deposition of sediments can reduce the hydraulic conductivity of riverbeds the interface between river and groundwater which controls river groundwater interactions schälchli 1992 brunner et al 2017 as the river with the highest sediment content worldwide the yellow river sees deposits a large amount of sediment in the downstream river channel which reduces the hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed and affects the development of river channel morphology and the water level hou et al 2021 shi 2021 therefore changes in the ssc restricted the development of groundwater levels yy1 zm18 and kf10 along the lower yellow river in the pre dam period however the artificial floods generated by the wsrs of the xld have washed away parts of the downstream riverbed kong et al 2015 thereby improving the downstream silting situation kong et al 2020 this produced wl conditions at zm18 and kf10 that were conducive to water exchange inside and outside the channel however the effects of lateral seepage differ caused by differences in riverbank boundary conditions which rendered fr and isc particularly important in affecting the groundwater levels at yy1 and fq12 thus the combined changes in water and sediment characteristics after dam construction affected the groundwater level in the lower yellow river 4 3 response of groundwater level to changes in river water and sediment the groundwater level along the lower yellow river lagged behind changes in water and sediment characteristics induced by the wsrs of the xld the groundwater levels at monitoring wells farther from the river typically were affected by water trapped in the channel which could only affect the groundwater level through slow lateral infiltration prathapar and bawain 2014 xin et al 2020 however different monitoring wells had to different hydrogeological conditions and topography fu et al 2020 which means that the groundwater levels at four monitoring wells differently responded to changes in water and sediment characteristics in this study we found that the groundwater levels at zm18 and kf10 lagged behind the changes in water and sediment characteristics in addition the monitoring wells were located 2 km away from the yellow river so a long time would have been required for lateral seepage to affect the groundwater level we used monthly data to analyze the monthly lag response of the groundwater level to changes in water and sediment characteristics through a dlnm although the results indicated the start and end times of the lag responses the data were not sufficiently precise in the future more detailed groundwater level data near the river need to be collected to enable a more accurate analysis of the daily lag response of groundwater level to changes in water and sediment characteristics through a dlnm 5 study implications and limitations the operation of the xld and the implementation of the wsrs have changed the characteristics of water and sediment and the groundwater in the lower yellow river in this study by combining the ert model and dlnm we identified the main water and sediment factors influencing the groundwater levels at four monitoring wells along the lower yellow river and determined the lag response of the groundwater level to changes in water and sediment characteristics induced by the xld and the wsrs we determined the start and end times of the lagged response of the groundwater level compared with other machine learning methods the ert model has been effectively used in watershed hydrological research because of complete randomization integration method efficient and accurate calculation results importance assessment of variables and avoidance of excessive fitting galelli and castelletti 2013 li et al 2020 therefore in this study we used the ert model to rank the factors influencing groundwater and determine the contribution rate of each factor to that level this process compensated for the shortcomings of the dlnm model in selecting the main factors through experience and subjective which laid a foundation for the rational analysis of the lag effect the dlnm is a new method used to characterize the non linear exposure lag response relationship between variables which is less restrictive in terms of data requirements gasparrini 2014 lowe et al 2018 yan et al 2020 guo et al 2021 as long as perfectly matched independent and dependent variable data are available the lag response between various factors can be purposefully analyzed with this study we are the first apply a dlnm in hydrological research the successful application of the dlnm based on monthly fr wl ssc isc and groundwater level data opens new research possibilities and a new method for analyzing the lag response of groundwater in areas lacking fine or high precision data in particular compared with simple and basic statistical methods the combination of ert and dlnm can not only handle big data but also provides improved calculation efficiency and accuracy enabling the application of data from qualitative research to quantitative research galelli and castelletti 2013 gasparrini 2014 li et al 2020 this method is beneficial for analyzing the relationships among factors involved in watershed hydrology and other fields however we determined the lag response of groundwater to river water and sediment characteristics based on groundwater data observed from four randomly distributed monitoring wells along the lower yellow river we did not consider the distance gradient between river and monitoring wells applying a well designed distance gradient may more accurately reveal the lag response mechanism of groundwater to river water and sediment characteristics bayat et al 2020 atawneh et al 2021 the lag effect on river water and groundwater is a complex hydrological process that is influenced by the hydraulic gradient riverbed permeability and other factors singh 2004 brunner et al 2017 xin et al 2020 the models we introduced in this study which are differ from physical models gasparrini 2011 cheng et al 2021 did not consider these factors in addition we considered the construction of the xld and the operation of the wsrs as the demarcation point for determining the impact of natural and anthropogenic factors on hydrological time series which highlighted the lag effect in hydrological processes induced by dam regulation however we did not address the specific contribution of other factors to the lag effect in hydrological processes given the above limitations optimizing the introduced methods or introducing other methods is needed in the future however the results of this study promote the research on the interaction between river water and groundwater and provide a useful scientific basis for the management and planning of river water and groundwater 5 conclusions rivers are important source for groundwater recharge dam construction in a rivers can disturb downstream hydrologic processes and indirectly affect the development of groundwater to explore how dam construction affected the changes in groundwater level along the lower yellow river in this study we first analyzed the changes in water and sediment characteristics and groundwater level in the pre and post dam periods the results showed that the operation of the xld not only decreased the peak fr ssc wl isc and groundwater level but also advanced the peak fr to june the highest monthly groundwater level synchronously changed with water and sediment characteristics before dam construction but lagged behind the changes in water and sediment characteristics after the dam was constructed moreover the distance between the monitoring wells and the yellow river also affected the relationship between groundwater and water and sediment characteristics comparing the post dam and pre dam periods we found that the changes in the wl and isc contributed most to the changes in the groundwater level in the annual and mid and post wsrs seasons wl and ssc contributed most in the pre wsrs season between the mid wsrs and post wsrs seasons changes in the ssc and the combined effect of water sediment contributed the most to changes in the groundwater level along the lower yellow river in pre and post dam periods respectively although groundwater is inseparable from changes in water and sediment characteristics the river channel morphology also plays an important role we found that the response of the monthly groundwater level to the changes in the water and sediment characteristics lagged by 2 5 months although we examined the response of typical river fed groundwater system to the operation of the xld and the implementation of the wsrs more accurate river and

3168,wetlands in drylands have high inter and intra annual ecohydrological variations that are driven to a great extent by climate variability and anthropogenic influences the ramsar convention on wetlands encourages the development of frameworks for national action and international cooperation for ensuring conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources at local national and regional scales however the implementation of these frameworks remains a challenge this is mainly due to limited availability of high resolution data and suitable big data processing techniques for assessing and monitoring wetland ecohydrological dynamics at large spatial scales particularly in the sub saharan african region the availability of cloud computing platforms such as google earth engine gee offers unique big data handling and processing opportunities to address some of these challenges in this study we applied the gee cloud computing platform to monitor the long term ecohydrological dynamics of a seasonally flooded part of the nylsvley floodplain wetland complex in north eastern south africa over a 20 year period 2000 2020 the specific objectives of the study were 1 to evaluate wetland ecohydrological dynamics using the 20 year multi date landsat composite data coupled with the random forest machine learning algorithm and 2 to establish the major drivers of wetland ecohydrological changes using selected spectral indices i e normalised difference vegetation index ndvi normalised difference water index ndwi and normalised difference phenology index ndpi coupled with climate data the ecohydrology of the wetland changed over time with some classes increasing twice when compared to the previous measurement while others decreasing significantly during the study period notably the bare surface class increased at rates of 230 and 350 between 2006 2010 and 2016 2020 respectively moreover the indices showed similar trends throughout the 20 year period with ndwi having minimum values less than zero in all cases this implied no surface inundation although the presence of some wetland vegetation indicated seasonal to semi permanent soil saturation conditions a comparative analysis of climate data and remotely sensed indices showed that annual changes of precipitation and evapotranspiration were the main drivers of wetland ecohydrological variations the findings of the study underscore the relevance of cloud computing artificial intelligence techniques and particularly the gee platform in evaluating wetland ecohydrological dynamics for semi arid southern african systems which are deteriorating due to the unsustainable use and poor management resulting from limited knowledge about their changes over time keywords artificial intelligence dryland wetland ephemeral wetland machine learning algorithm wetland condition wetland management 1 introduction semi arid areas commonly host small intermittently flooded wetlands which are highly sensitive to climate variability and anthropogenic influences wetlands in dry lands research network 2014 anthropogenic influences and climate variability are the major causes of the high inter and intra annual ecohydrological variability in these systems in many cases the disappearance of surface inundation during the dry season makes such wetlands susceptible to habitat destruction and loss blanckenberg et al 2020 globally semi arid wetlands have been reported to be declining at alarming rates mostly due to erratic rainfall climate change and high utilisation by the surrounding communities thamaga et al 2021 in ethiopia which is predominantly arid reports indicate that several seasonal wetlands have been lost bahilu and tadesse 2017 this has been attributed to unregulated use and over utilization of these systems resulting in negative impacts on wetland condition in china it has been reported that over 30 of wetlands have been lost during the past 50 years due to anthropogenic activities liu et al 2017 estimates of wetland loss in south africa range from 50 to 58 but the full extent of transformation is difficult to quantify over the large spatial scales necessary for informing national policy responses van deventer et al 2019a b there is therefore an urgent need for interventions to halt further degradation of these important ecosystems in order to sustain these systems programmes such as the south african national biodiversity assessment van deventer et al 2019a b and working for wetlands dini and bahadur 2016 are promoting conservation wise use and restoration of all wetlands at local national and regional scales there are also several regional and international efforts aimed at reversing wetland degradation through dissemination of information and involvement of local communities in the establishment of proper management plans rebelo 2010 these efforts are however hindered by the lack of data on wetland ecohydrological dynamics at appropriate spatial and temporal scales particularly in the sub saharan african region gxokwe et al 2020 thamaga et al 2021 projects such as the current wetland monitoring and assessment services for transboundary basins in southern africa wemast funded by european union africa global monitoring for environmental security eu africa gmes have been initiated to ensure the effectiveness of monitoring and assessment of wetlands using earth observation data such data provide opportunities for producing detailed wetland inventories and understanding wetland dynamics at scales relevant to the management of wetlands of varying sizes e g van deventer et al 2019a b moreover the availability of cloud computing platforms such as google earth engine gee supports efforts of regional wetland analyses using earth observation data the availability of 40 years and over a petabyte of remotely sensed data that are freely accessible coupled with advanced machine learning algorithms on the gee platform makes it possible to consistently monitor small to large wetlands and track their changes over time gorelick et al 2017 this therefore provides the necessary baseline information about ecohydrological dynamics that is much needed for developing management actions although the gee cloud computing platform offers numerous advantages to address issues of limited and inconsistent data for wetland monitoring the utility of this platform in monitoring long term changes in the ecohydrological dynamics of semi arid wetlands requires further evaluation wua et al 2019 studies that have utilized this platform for long term monitoring of environmental change include mapping of forests croplands and open water kumar and mutanga 2018 tamiminia et al 2020 the most recent studies which have utilized gee in wetlands mapping have demonstrated the potential value of this platform in wetland studies gxokwe et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 although these studies underscore the relevance of utilizing gee for investigating small seasonally flooded wetlands they did not assess longer term changes using time series data in gee there is therefore a need to assess the applicability of the gee and multi source spatial data in monitoring long term changes in ecohydrological dynamics of wetlands in semi arid environments particularly in sub saharan africa this will aid in developing consistent and comparable wetland inventories and assessments across the region and advance an understanding of drivers of wetland dynamics including anthropogenic stressors that contribute to wetland degradation and loss this will enhance local regional and international wetland conservation and management programmes moreover long term monitoring of ecohydrological dynamics is critical for preventing or managing loss of wetland ecosystem services millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 the current study therefore aims to assess the utility of the gee cloud computing platform for monitoring long term variations in ecohydrological dynamics of small seasonally flooded wetlands in a semi arid region of south africa over a 20 year period 2000 2020 using nylsvley floodplain as a case study the specific objectives are 1 to evaluate the spatio temporal variations in ecohydrological dynamics of wetlands using time series landsat composite data coupled with gee machine learning algorithms and 2 to establish the major drivers of ecohydrological changes in the studied systems using remotely sensed metrics coupled with climate data 2 study area the study was conducted on part of the

as phragmites australis common reeds other plant species present include vachellia tortilis vachellia nilotica and vachellia karoo african conservation 1998 the nylsvley floodplain serves as an important habitat for about 80000 birds when inundated vlok et al 2006 the study focused on the protected area within the nylsvley nature reserve covering an area of 13 69 km2 fig 1c 3 materials and methods 3 1 field data collection field data were collected between 28 09 2020 and 1 10 2020 a total of 300 ground truth points representing different landcover classes were collected during field surveys using a handheld geographical positioning system gps with an error margin of less than 3 65 m the landcover observed during field surveys included classes such as bare surfaces short wetland grass species comprising of cynodon dyctolon bermuda grass and oryza longistaminata rice grass as well as long wetland grass species comprising of only phragmites australis common reeds these vegetation communities were visually identified in the field the floodplain was completely dry during the field survey and therefore no water surface was identified the field survey period coincided with the months when some of the images used in this study were acquired ground truth points were collected following a stratified random sampling approach consequently the floodplain was sub divided into 30 m 30 m quadrants which were spaced by about 10 m apart the 30 m 30 m quadrants were chosen because of the pixel sizes of the remotely sensed data used as well as the size of the studied floodplain this is supported by a number of remote sensing studies such as mudereri et al 2021 thamaga and dube 2018 a minimum of 20 points were randomly collected from each quadrant depending on the heterogeneity of the landcover identified in each quadrant and the accessibility of some sections within the wetland the field data were further supplemented by 350additional points that were randomly extracted from higher resolution google earth images coinciding with dates of some of the remotely sensed images used the data gathered from field visits and higher resolution google earth image comprised of 552 points representing short grass species 68 points for bare surface and 30 points for long grass species the collected points were then randomly split on r studio into 70 for training 386 points for short grass 48 points for bare surface and 21 points for long grass and 30 for validation 136 points for short grass 20 points for bare surface and 9 points for long grass of classification of images by the random forest model 3 2 ancillary data the 2000 2020 monthly rainfall and temperature data for the mookgopong weather station located at 24 42745 and 28 59419 north west of nylsvley floodplain were collected from the south african agricultural research council the station is located at an altitude of 820 m towards higher elevation areas and 26 km away from the studied floodplain fig 1c due to the unavailability of evapotranspiration data evapotranspiration rates were estimated using the following hargreaves and samani 1985 equation 1 1 e 1 25 0 0023 r a t r 0 5 t a 17 8 where e is potential evapotranspiration rate mm day ra is extra terrestrial radiation mm equivalent per day tr is monthly temperature range c and ta is average daily temperature for the month c other methods for estimating evapotranspiration such as the penman monteith equation could not be used because solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity are not available for the study area 3 3 remote sensing data acquisition and processing the steps followed during the acquisition and processing of remote sensing data are presented in fig 2 prior to image classification remotely sensed products were extracted from the gee catalogue the images extracted are for the landsat 7 etm chosen because of having the longest availability on the platform although it is reported in the literature that landsat 7 etm was adversely affected by the failure of the scan line corrector slc dube and mutanga 2015 after 31 may 2003 the stripes caused by this failure did not affect the area covered by the studied wetland the data collected was then filtered by the boundaries of the studied wetland and the date using the codes image filterbounds and ee filter date in the gee cloud computing platform after filtering of images by dates and boundaries they were then filtered by cloud cover images with clear cloud coverage 0 were selected because of the size 13 69 km2 of studied wetland images with cloud cover were excluded since cloud masking would result in severe error propagation the ee filter eq cloud cover 0 code was used to filter images with clear cloud cover the number of images obtained from the filtering process are presented in table 1 cloud free images were then grouped by intervals of 5 years the first interval was from 2000 to 2005 and all the images for that period were grouped the second and third intervals were from 2006 2010 and 2011 2015 and the last interval was from 2016 to 2020 after the grouping of images wetland indices such as the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi normalised difference water index ndwi and normalised difference phenology index ndpi were computed for all images obtained in each interval using the equations presented in the supplementary material table a then extracted to assess their variations overtime these indices were used as proxy for ecohydrological dynamics the ndvi was chosen because of its sensitivity to photosynthetically active biomass which enables discrimination between wetland and non wetland areas as well as vegetated and non vegetated areas liu and huete 1995 ndwi was chosen as this can discriminate between water and non water areas although it was noted that the studied system has very limited open water the ndwi was used to capture pixels which may have open water at any time periods ndpi which was recently developed by wang et al 2017 and it uses the weighted combination of red and short wave infrared swir bands instead of the red band like in the ndvi the weighted combination is almost equal to the value of near infrared band nir for different soils and is sensitivity to vegetation moreover the ndpi considers the absorption of leaf water content in the swir band thus could account for variations in canopy water content this assist in improving the separability of soil and vegetation with varying leaf water content a previous daunting task when using ndvi the ndpi was chosen for these reasons further the above mentioned indices were computed from the time series data and then used to assess wetland ecohydrological dynamics overtime in addition visible red green and blue nir and swir bands were extracted from the grouped images representing each interval and concatenated to the extracted indices to form images with only the appropriate band combinations that better enhances the wetland features the concatenated images were then composited per interval to form single images representing each interval using the median composite algorithm in gee the median composite algorithm reduces a stack of images by calculating a median across the matching bands of the image stack thus minimising the illumination effects such as shades as well as the effects of cloud cover gorelick et al 2017 mahdianpari et al 2020 consequently the derived composite images were subjected to the object based image analysis obia obia was chosen because of its superiority to pixel based analysis various studies such as mahdianpari et al 2019 pande chhetri et al 2017 have shown that obia does not only rely on spectral characteristics but also considers contextual information height texture area perimeter etc of a pixel which helps in improving the discrimination of wetland classes the initial step in obia is image segmentation this process involves the partitioning of the image into multiple discreet and non overlapping objects based on a specific criterion this maximizes the separability of different landcover classes and prevents the salt and pepper effects on the final classified image dlamini et al 2021a further a simple non iterative clustering snic algorithm was used to partition the composite images the snic undertakes image segmentation by initializing the centroids in a regular gridded image and then the dependency of each pixel relative to the centroids is established using the distance in five dimensional space of colour and spatial coordinate the distance joins the normalised spatial and colour distances to produce uniform super pixel the candidate pixel is added to the cluster based on its shortest distance to the centroid achanta and süsstrunk 2017 the algorithm was selected because of the simplicity memory efficiency as well as the ability to incorporate connectivity between the pixels after initiation of the algorithm the snic algorithm was implemented using the code ee algorithms image segmantation snic and the outputs were images with super pixels as well as contextual information of those pixels such as areas texture standard deviation perimeters and heights these were then integrated with the selected spectral bands and used as an input concatenate images in the selected machine learning algorithm 3 4 adopted wetland classification approach classification of the acquired images was executed using the random forest rf machine learning algorithm in the gee cloud computing platform the rf algorithm is an ensemble non parametric classifier which consists of many different trees from subsets of randomly selected training data dlamini et al 2021b each tree casts a unit vote to decide on the final class of the object the algorithm was selected because of the ability to handle large differences between landcover classes thereby neutralising noise in the data set simioni et al 2020 moreover the selection of the rf algorithm in this study was informed by a study by gxokwe et al 2021 which identified rf as an appropriate gee algorithm for classifying small seasonally flooded wetlands comparatively the rf algorithms produced highest overall producer s and user s accuracy prior to the classification the ground truth points were split on r studio into 70 training and 30 validation samples the split training data were then imported and converted to vector files in a gis environment and then imported to the gee to train the classifier the training of the rf classifier on gee was executed using the code ee classifier train in training the object based rf model the grid search value for mtry parameter was varied from 1 and 5 the grid search value for ntree parameter was varied from 500 to 10 000 with an interval of 500 the ranges were selected based on studies of similar nature such as dlamini et al 2021a b gxokwe et al 2021 ryan et al 2014 the search yielded hundred combinations of mtry and ntree values and the optimum values 1500 ntree and 5 mtry from these combinations were finally used as the rf model input parameters for classifying the landsat 7 composite images classification of the remotely sensed image composites was then executed using the code image classify 3 5 accuracy assessment accuracy assessment was executed using three metrices namely the overall accuracy oa user s accuracy ua and producer s accuracy pa oa measures the overall correctly classified pixels story and congalton 1986 and ua measures the probability that a classified pixel of a particular category belongs to that category on the ground pa measures how well the reference ground cover type pixels were classified story and congalton 1986 the oa was implemented using the code image accuracy in gee pa and ua were implemented using the codes image producersaccuracy and image consumersaccuracy during the implementation of the above mentioned algorithms in gee the validation vector produced from the 30 field data was firstly imported to the platform and zones on the classified image corresponding to the vector points were sampled using the code image sampleregions the sampled zones as well as the validation vector points were then used as input files to the latter algorithms to compute each accuracy metric oa ua and pa 3 6 change analysis variations and major drivers to assess wetlands ecohydrological changes the area covered by each land cover class were estimated from the classified image per interval and the rate of change for each class rac was established using the method described by shen et al 2019 equation 2 2 rac ea i a ia 100 where rac is given as the rate of change of wetland area ea is the area at the of the period considered refers to the areas in years 2000 2005 2006 2010 2011 2015 2016 2020 ia is the initial wetland area refers to the total area for the period of 2000 2005 calculated as the sum of the surface areas covered by the wetland classes identified the variations in ecohydrological dynamics were established by analysing time series of ndvis ndwis and ndpis which were used as proxy for wetland ecohydrological dynamics 4 results 4 1 variations in ecohydrological dynamics the changes in spatial distribution of the wetland cover classes for the time periods are presented in fig 3 water class could not be identified using the object based rf model due to unavailable training and validation data for this class this is resulting from no visible spatial coverage of the class during the ground truthing period which may have been caused by short term surface inundation moreover the indices used could not detect any water class mainly because of the forested vegetation within the wetland as well as the spatial resolution of the data used although water could not be detected most vegetation species identified such as phragmites australis are associated with the presence of semi permanent saturated wetland soils which provided ecohydrological information about the nylsvley floodplain this is supported by the findings in kotze and o connor 2000 who reported that species such as phragmites australis were associated with wettest zones within the studied wetland therefore implying that ecohydrology information could be deduced from these types of species the class distribution shows that the short grass was the most dominant class except for the period 2016 to 2020 when bare surface was the most dominant class long grass was the least dominant class for all the cases except for the 4th period 2016 2020 where short grass was least dominant visual assessment of the changes from the derived spatial distribution maps of the wetland classes shows variations in these classes over time these results show that classes such as short grass and long grass declined between period 1 and 2 2000 2005 and 2006 2010 however a resurgence was observed in these classes during period 3 2011 2015 for bare surface an increase was noted for the entire monitoring period except for period 3 2011 2015 where a decline of about 1 5 km2 was noted a sharp decline in spatial distributions of short and long grass were observed for the period 4 2016 2020 as bare surface sharply increased for the same period the class area results shown in fig 4 corroborate with the visual observation during fieldwork of the spatial distribution of the identified wetland classes the results show that the short grass class had the highest surface area for the periods 1 2 and 3 2000 2005 2006 2010 and 2011 2015 with surface areas ranging between 5 km2 and 8 km2 respectively the long grass had the lowest surface area for the above mentioned periods which ranged between 0 1 km2 to 0 5 km2 respectively during period 4 2016 2020 bare surface had the highest surface area of 4 8 km2 and short grass had the lowest 1 5 km2 the results on the rate of change per class are shown on table 2 drastic changes occurred in the wetland cover classes at high rates between the periods the results show that the short grass declined at a rate of about 38 between the period 1 and 2 2000 2005 and 2006 2010 whereas other classes increase at a rate of 228 and 230 particularly bare surface which doubled compared to period 1 2000 2005 although a decline in short grass was observed for the above mentioned periods there was an increase in this class during the period 3 2011 2015 at a rate of 51 bare surface and long grass decreased at the rates of 69 and 46 respectively for period 3 2011 2015 furthermore the results show that the short grass declined by 81 while other classes such as long grass doubled there were no major changes of the temporal variations of ndvi ndpi and ndwi for the nylsvley floodplain supplementary material figure a however the ndwi had low values less than 0 throughout implying that there was no surface inundation detected ndpi and ndvi had values greater than 0 in most cases particularly for the time periods 2000 2005 2006 2010 and 2016 2020 supplementary material figure a implying that there was vegetation detected although it was not healthy 4 2 accuracy assessment the accuracy assessment results showed that the oa fig 5 for all the periods were within the acceptable range between 72 and 78 with 2011 2015 and 2016 2020 having the highest values and 2006 2010 the lowest value the class accuracy results are presented in table 3 the results show that for all the periods the pa ranged between 33 and 88 and the short grass had the highest pa in all the cases and long grass had the lowest pa particularly for period 1 and 2 2000 2005 and 2006 2010 during which the pa was 33 for period 3 and 4 2011 2015 and 2016 2020 the bare surface had the lowest pa with 37 5 for both periods the ua results ranged from 40 to 100 with long grass having the highest ua for period 1 and 2 2000 2005 and 2006 2010 the lowest ua was for bare surface during period 1 2006 2010 with a proportion of 40 table 3 4 3 drivers of ecohydrological variation a statistical summary of the ndvi ndwi and ndpi results for all the periods are presented in the supplementary material figure b the results indicate that the indices are mostly positively skewed except for ndwi for years like 2006 in time period 2 and 2014 in time period 3 which have symmetric distributions the data also show larger variations in most cases with large ranges stretched whiskers except for some years such as 2003 in period 1 2000 2005 where the whiskers for ndvi ndwi and ndpi are squeezed as well as 2008 and 2009 in period 2 2006 2010 where the whiskers are short the outliers were observed for ndvi ndwi and ndpi data for the year 2004 in time period 1 and in period 4 for the years 2017 2018 and 2019 for the time period 3 outliers were observed for ndvi during the year 2015 further an inverse relationship between the biomass indices and the annual et rate fig 6 was noted the ndpi decreased considerably during years when et increased e g 2002 and 2004 fig 6a the biomass indices except for ndpi tended to increase as expected with the amount of annual precipitation e g 2007 to 2009 fig 7 this relationship is however not evident during some years such as 2002 to 2004 in time period 1 a wetland typically stores both surface and subsurface water and therefore a decrease in rainfall in a single year such as 2002 and 2003 may not have significant effects to the growth of plants as they may be utilising water already in storage 5 discussion this study assessed the utility of the gee cloud computing platform in monitoring long term 2000 2020 variations in ecohydrological dynamics of the small seasonally flooded wetlands in a semi arid environment of south africa using the nylsvley floodplain as a case study the main classification results showed that the following three landcover classes could be identified i short grass vegetation characterised by species such as cynodon dyctolon and oryza longistaminata ii long grass species such as phragmites australis and iii bare surfaces these land cover classes represent zones with semi permanent soil saturation as shown by the presence of phragmites australis and temporary to seasonal saturation represented by short grass oryza longistaminata kotze and o connor 2000 while overall the nylsvley floodplain may be considered a seasonally flooded system the results of this study show that the system contains both seasonal and semi permanent hydroperiods because of the presence of the above mentioned wetland vegetation species which are viewed as indicators of environments with semi permanent saturated soils and seasonal inundation the water class could not be detected due to unavailable training and validation data covering this class resulting from the absence of surface inundation during the period of ground truthing moreover the remotely sensed spectral indices used failed to detect the presence of water mostly due to the dense vegetation in parts of the studied system as well as the spatial resolution of the landsat 7 etm which was selected because of the length of the image record and the number of good quality images table b in supplementary material available for this product on the gee catalogue accuracy assessment results showed that an overall accuracy was within the acceptable range of 69 79 although this was the case there were some inaccuracies for classes such as bare surface and long grass for some periods these can be mostly attributed to the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed product used which resulted in significant spectral mixing between the classes several studies such as dvorett et al 2016 and gxokwe et al 2021 have demonstrated that the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed data does significantly impact the accuracy of classification results particularly when mapping small areas such as the wetlands studied here moreover the report by federal geographic data committee 1992 highlighted that with landsat data which is used in this study accurate identification of an object requires at least 9 pixels which covers a total surface area of about 0 9 ha and at most 25 pixels the limited training data of bare surface and long grass relative to the short grass species due to the spatial coverage of these classes within the wetland led to unequal distribution of training points which affected the ability of the training data to adequately characterise the classes of interest due to the small size of bare surface and long grass within the wetland fewer points were collected for these classes than for short grass thus resulting in the imbalance in training samples these imbalances are likely to have caused inaccuracies in the classification of bare surface and long grass than short grass which had more training data several studies such as millard and richardson 2013 ustuner et al 2016 xia et al 2019 have demonstrated that unequal distribution or imbalance in the training data is likely to influence the classification accuracy of the classes in a way that the over represented classes may dominate the underrepresented classes resulting in classification inaccuracies for the underrepresented classes however the imbalances in training samples in this case were not as a result of sampling error but rather a result of lower number of training points available for bare surface and long grass caused by the small areal coverage these land cover class in the area under study the spatiotemporal variation results showed that ecohydrological conditions varied from one period to another denoted by some of the classes changing to more than double the previous area and some which significantly dropped to half the previous period the results indicated that in most cases bare surface significantly increased for periods such as 2006 2010 and 2016 2020 this can be attributed mostly to seasonal changes as most images used for these periods were collected during dry season addendum a which is the leaf off season few suitable images were available for the wet season images leaf on season due to frequent cloud cover moreover below average precipitation was received in the ltrb around 2016 2017 which significantly impacted most ecosystems including the wetlands in the area gxokwe et al 2021 which therefore explains the cause of bare surface domination this is also evident in figure 9 the temporal variations in the indices results showed similar trends between ndvi ndwi and ndpi and the floodplain was dry for most times these finding corroborates with nhamo et al 2017 who reported high seasonal variabilities in wetland of the witbank catchment in south africa although the study focused only on inundation dynamics at larger scale than the studied as expected there was an inverse relationship between et and wetland biomass for all the periods this is because et tends to contribute to water losses in wetlands particularly in semi arid regions therefore resulting in loss of moisture available in wetlands and thus contributing to the decline in the ndwi values for the wetlands due to the decline in moisture content available in the wetland some vegetation become less healthy because water stress results in ndvi and ndpi decline a study by al shehhi et al 2011 monitored the effects of variable soil moisture content to the modis derived ndvi for different vegetation species in abu dhabi the findings showed that with increasing evaporation rates less healthy vegetation dominated the studied area due to plants wilting thus resulting in decreased ndvi values these results by al shehhi et al 2011 corroborate with the findings of current study although the focus was not only on wetland vegetation further west et al 2018 studied vegetation response to varying soil moisture using sentinel 2 data and the results show strong correlation between sentinel 2 derived ndvi as well as soil moisture content which therefore supports the findings of the current study comparative analysis of annual precipitation with average ndvi ndwi and ndpi showed that with increase in annual precipitation the indices also increased for all the time periods except for 2000 2001 where the indices showed delayed response to varying annual precipitation the delayed response could be resulting from the use of dry season images which corresponds to the leaf off season for vegetation and low flow period for inundation the study by chen et al 2020 evaluated the vegetation response to precipitation anomalies in the semi arid inner mongolia plateau china over a 34 year period using the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr derived ndvi and multi source precipitation data the findings of the study show that there is a time lag in vegetation response to precipitation though the duration is not visible annual variations of rainfall and evapotranspiration rates have been shown in this study to be major drivers for the ecohydrological dynamics of the nylsvley floodplain annual rainfall will also influence the availability of both soil water and groundwater which also influence vegetation growth in a wetland these finding corroborate with the study of birkhead et al 2007 which modelled the hydraulic behaviour of the nylsvley floodplain using field measured climate data coupled with lidar data the study identified et and annual rainfall as driving factors of the ecohydrological changes in the floodplain overall the findings underscore the relevance of cloud computing artificial intelligence platforms such as gee in monitoring long term variations in ecohydrological dynamics of semi arid wetlands in the sub saharan region and therefore providing information on their degradation rates and loss which is currently unknown for these regions these findings are critical in the development of sustainable use and management frameworks of small seasonal flooded wetlands in semi arid regions besides they provide useful alternative ways and robust methodologies to generate routine and continuous wetland information about their changes a previous daunting task from traditional mapping and monitoring techniques this therefore will aid in development of local to global scale frameworks that will assist in setting up conservation policies and apply effective management practices of wetlands particularly in data scarce regions with semi arid climates and semi permanent wetland with varying ecohydrology that typically may be over exploited during dry periods the study also informs the ongoing efforts by the projects such as global monitoring environment and security gmes africa hosted by southern african science services centre for climate change and adaptive land management which is promoting the use of earth observation data for assessing monitoring and managing wetlands in transboundary basins to prevent loss of ecosystems services which are beneficial to the communities around these systems further the study contributes towards achieving the key priority areas of the african union s agenda 2063 which elaborates on preserving at least 17 of the of terrestrial and inland waters including wetlands and 10 of the marine areas by 2023 the study also contributes to achieving sustainable development goal sdg 6 6 which advocates for the prevention of the destruction and degradations of all the ecosystems and rehabilitating those that had already been destroyed sudmanns et al 2020 6 conclusion the study utilized remotely sensed data accessible from the gee platform coupled with advanced machine learning algorithms to monitor long term ecohydrological dynamics over a 20 year period of semi permanent wetlands using nylsvley floodplain in limpopo south africa as a case study the findings of the study showed that the ecohydrology of the wetland varied over time and space for example bare surface increased twice as much as the previous measurement period whereas short grass decreased significantly during study period 2 moreover the remotely sensed derived spectral indices showed similar trends throughout the 20 year period with ndwi having minimum values less than zero in all cases implying that there was no surface inundation however the presence of some wetland vegetation indicated seasonal to semi permanent soil saturation conditions the results also showed that annual rainfall and et were the major drivers to ecohydrological dynamics of the nylsvley floodplain these findings underscore the relevance of using cloud computing artificial intelligence techniques coupled with optical remotely sensed data in monitoring changes in ecohydrology of small seasonal flooded wetlands and are critical in sustainable use and management of these systems in these regions they provide useful alternative ways and robust methodologies to generate long term baseline information about their changes overtime a previously daunting task from traditional mapping and monitoring techniques this therefore aids in development of local to global scale frameworks that will assist is setting up conservation policies and applying effective management practices of wetlands particularly in data scarce regions with semi arid climates and semi permanent wetland that vary in ecohydrology may typically be over exploited during dry periods while the study offers new opportunities to generate high resolution continuous wetland scale information it is recommended that the potential of this platform in catchment scale monitoring the impacts of adjacent land use and land cover changes as well as groundwater level change to these systems be

3168,wetlands in drylands have high inter and intra annual ecohydrological variations that are driven to a great extent by climate variability and anthropogenic influences the ramsar convention on wetlands encourages the development of frameworks for national action and international cooperation for ensuring conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources at local national and regional scales however the implementation of these frameworks remains a challenge this is mainly due to limited availability of high resolution data and suitable big data processing techniques for assessing and monitoring wetland ecohydrological dynamics at large spatial scales particularly in the sub saharan african region the availability of cloud computing platforms such as google earth engine gee offers unique big data handling and processing opportunities to address some of these challenges in this study we applied the gee cloud computing platform to monitor the long term ecohydrological dynamics of a seasonally flooded part of the nylsvley floodplain wetland complex in north eastern south africa over a 20 year period 2000 2020 the specific objectives of the study were 1 to evaluate wetland ecohydrological dynamics using the 20 year multi date landsat composite data coupled with the random forest machine learning algorithm and 2 to establish the major drivers of wetland ecohydrological changes using selected spectral indices i e normalised difference vegetation index ndvi normalised difference water index ndwi and normalised difference phenology index ndpi coupled with climate data the ecohydrology of the wetland changed over time with some classes increasing twice when compared to the previous measurement while others decreasing significantly during the study period notably the bare surface class increased at rates of 230 and 350 between 2006 2010 and 2016 2020 respectively moreover the indices showed similar trends throughout the 20 year period with ndwi having minimum values less than zero in all cases this implied no surface inundation although the presence of some wetland vegetation indicated seasonal to semi permanent soil saturation conditions a comparative analysis of climate data and remotely sensed indices showed that annual changes of precipitation and evapotranspiration were the main drivers of wetland ecohydrological variations the findings of the study underscore the relevance of cloud computing artificial intelligence techniques and particularly the gee platform in evaluating wetland ecohydrological dynamics for semi arid southern african systems which are deteriorating due to the unsustainable use and poor management resulting from limited knowledge about their changes over time keywords artificial intelligence dryland wetland ephemeral wetland machine learning algorithm wetland condition wetland management 1 introduction semi arid areas commonly host small intermittently flooded wetlands which are highly sensitive to climate variability and anthropogenic influences wetlands in dry lands research network 2014 anthropogenic influences and climate variability are the major causes of the high inter and intra annual ecohydrological variability in these systems in many cases the disappearance of surface inundation during the dry season makes such wetlands susceptible to habitat destruction and loss blanckenberg et al 2020 globally semi arid wetlands have been reported to be declining at alarming rates mostly due to erratic rainfall climate change and high utilisation by the surrounding communities thamaga et al 2021 in ethiopia which is predominantly arid reports indicate that several seasonal wetlands have been lost bahilu and tadesse 2017 this has been attributed to unregulated use and over utilization of these systems resulting in negative impacts on wetland condition in china it has been reported that over 30 of wetlands have been lost during the past 50 years due to anthropogenic activities liu et al 2017 estimates of wetland loss in south africa range from 50 to 58 but the full extent of transformation is difficult to quantify over the large spatial scales necessary for informing national policy responses van deventer et al 2019a b there is therefore an urgent need for interventions to halt further degradation of these important ecosystems in order to sustain these systems programmes such as the south african national biodiversity assessment van deventer et al 2019a b and working for wetlands dini and bahadur 2016 are promoting conservation wise use and restoration of all wetlands at local national and regional scales there are also several regional and international efforts aimed at reversing wetland degradation through dissemination of information and involvement of local communities in the establishment of proper management plans rebelo 2010 these efforts are however hindered by the lack of data on wetland ecohydrological dynamics at appropriate spatial and temporal scales particularly in the sub saharan african region gxokwe et al 2020 thamaga et al 2021 projects such as the current wetland monitoring and assessment services for transboundary basins in southern africa wemast funded by european union africa global monitoring for environmental security eu africa gmes have been initiated to ensure the effectiveness of monitoring and assessment of wetlands using earth observation data such data provide opportunities for producing detailed wetland inventories and understanding wetland dynamics at scales relevant to the management of wetlands of varying sizes e g van deventer et al 2019a b moreover the availability of cloud computing platforms such as google earth engine gee supports efforts of regional wetland analyses using earth observation data the availability of 40 years and over a petabyte of remotely sensed data that are freely accessible coupled with advanced machine learning algorithms on the gee platform makes it possible to consistently monitor small to large wetlands and track their changes over time gorelick et al 2017 this therefore provides the necessary baseline information about ecohydrological dynamics that is much needed for developing management actions although the gee cloud computing platform offers numerous advantages to address issues of limited and inconsistent data for wetland monitoring the utility of this platform in monitoring long term changes in the ecohydrological dynamics of semi arid wetlands requires further evaluation wua et al 2019 studies that have utilized this platform for long term monitoring of environmental change include mapping of forests croplands and open water kumar and mutanga 2018 tamiminia et al 2020 the most recent studies which have utilized gee in wetlands mapping have demonstrated the potential value of this platform in wetland studies gxokwe et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 although these studies underscore the relevance of utilizing gee for investigating small seasonally flooded wetlands they did not assess longer term changes using time series data in gee there is therefore a need to assess the applicability of the gee and multi source spatial data in monitoring long term changes in ecohydrological dynamics of wetlands in semi arid environments particularly in sub saharan africa this will aid in developing consistent and comparable wetland inventories and assessments across the region and advance an understanding of drivers of wetland dynamics including anthropogenic stressors that contribute to wetland degradation and loss this will enhance local regional and international wetland conservation and management programmes moreover long term monitoring of ecohydrological dynamics is critical for preventing or managing loss of wetland ecosystem services millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 the current study therefore aims to assess the utility of the gee cloud computing platform for monitoring long term variations in ecohydrological dynamics of small seasonally flooded wetlands in a semi arid region of south africa over a 20 year period 2000 2020 using nylsvley floodplain as a case study the specific objectives are 1 to evaluate the spatio temporal variations in ecohydrological dynamics of wetlands using time series landsat composite data coupled with gee machine learning algorithms and 2 to establish the major drivers of ecohydrological changes in the studied systems using remotely sensed metrics coupled with climate data 2 study area the study was conducted on part of the nylsvley floodplain located within the limpopo transboundary river basin ltrb fig 1 a in the limpopo province fig 1b south africa the nylsvley floodplain is 70 km long and 7 km wide when fully inundated bordering the nyl river see the dotted line in fig 1c 24 632116 s and 28 684779 e 24 614213 s and 28 686909 e 24 659827 s and 28 692914 e 24 659699 s and 28 696835 e this floodplain is a ramsar listed wetland dzurume et al 2021 and derives water from the olifantsspruit groot and klein nyl rivers during the period of high flows september to december as well as local rainfall botai et al 2020 dzurume et al 2021 mosase et al 2019 the dominant vegetation includes short grass species such as cynodon dactylon bermuda grass and oryza longistaminata rice grass and long grass species such as phragmites australis common reeds other plant species present include vachellia tortilis vachellia nilotica and vachellia karoo african conservation 1998 the nylsvley floodplain serves as an important habitat for about 80000 birds when inundated vlok et al 2006 the study focused on the protected area within the nylsvley nature reserve covering an area of 13 69 km2 fig 1c 3 materials and methods 3 1 field data collection field data were collected between 28 09 2020 and 1 10 2020 a total of 300 ground truth points representing different landcover classes were collected during field surveys using a handheld geographical positioning system gps with an error margin of less than 3 65 m the landcover observed during field surveys included classes such as bare surfaces short wetland grass species comprising of cynodon dyctolon bermuda grass and oryza longistaminata rice grass as well as long wetland grass species comprising of only phragmites australis common reeds these vegetation communities were visually identified in the field the floodplain was completely dry during the field survey and therefore no water surface was identified the field survey period coincided with the months when some of the images used in this study were acquired ground truth points were collected following a stratified random sampling approach consequently the floodplain was sub divided into 30 m 30 m quadrants which were spaced by about 10 m apart the 30 m 30 m quadrants were chosen because of the pixel sizes of the remotely sensed data used as well as the size of the studied floodplain this is supported by a number of remote sensing studies such as mudereri et al 2021 thamaga and dube 2018 a minimum of 20 points were randomly collected from each quadrant depending on the heterogeneity of the landcover identified in each quadrant and the accessibility of some sections within the wetland the field data were further supplemented by 350additional points that were randomly extracted from higher resolution google earth images coinciding with dates of some of the remotely sensed images used the data gathered from field visits and higher resolution google earth image comprised of 552 points representing short grass species 68 points for bare surface and 30 points for long grass species the collected points were then randomly split on r studio into 70 for training 386 points for short grass 48 points for bare surface and 21 points for long grass and 30 for validation 136 points for short grass 20 points for bare surface and 9 points for long grass of classification of images by the random forest model 3 2 ancillary data the 2000 2020 monthly rainfall and temperature data for the mookgopong weather station located at 24 42745 and 28 59419 north west of nylsvley floodplain were collected from the south african agricultural research council the station is located at an altitude of 820 m towards higher elevation areas and 26 km away from the studied floodplain fig 1c due to the unavailability of evapotranspiration data evapotranspiration rates were estimated using the following hargreaves and samani 1985 equation 1 1 e 1 25 0 0023 r a t r 0 5 t a 17 8 where e is potential evapotranspiration rate mm day ra is extra terrestrial radiation mm equivalent per day tr is monthly temperature range c and ta is average daily temperature for the month c other methods for estimating evapotranspiration such as the penman monteith equation could not be used because solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity are not available for the study area 3 3 remote sensing data acquisition and processing the steps followed during the acquisition and processing of remote sensing data are presented in fig 2 prior to image classification remotely sensed products were extracted from the gee catalogue the images extracted are for the landsat 7 etm chosen because of having the longest availability on the platform although it is reported in the literature that landsat 7 etm was adversely affected by the failure of the scan line corrector slc dube and mutanga 2015 after 31 may 2003 the stripes caused by this failure did not affect the area covered by the studied wetland the data collected was then filtered by the boundaries of the studied wetland and the date using the codes image filterbounds and ee filter date in the gee cloud computing platform after filtering of images by dates and boundaries they were then filtered by cloud cover images with clear cloud coverage 0 were selected because of the size 13 69 km2 of studied wetland images with cloud cover were excluded since cloud masking would result in severe error propagation the ee filter eq cloud cover 0 code was used to filter images with clear cloud cover the number of images obtained from the filtering process are presented in table 1 cloud free images were then grouped by intervals of 5 years the first interval was from 2000 to 2005 and all the images for that period were grouped the second and third intervals were from 2006 2010 and 2011 2015 and the last interval was from 2016 to 2020 after the grouping of images wetland indices such as the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi normalised difference water index ndwi and normalised difference phenology index ndpi were computed for all images obtained in each interval using the equations presented in the supplementary material table a then extracted to assess their variations overtime these indices were used as proxy for ecohydrological dynamics the ndvi was chosen because of its sensitivity to photosynthetically active biomass which enables discrimination between wetland and non wetland areas as well as vegetated and non vegetated areas liu and huete 1995 ndwi was chosen as this can discriminate between water and non water areas although it was noted that the studied system has very limited open water the ndwi was used to capture pixels which may have open water at any time periods ndpi which was recently developed by wang et al 2017 and it uses the weighted combination of red and short wave infrared swir bands instead of the red band like in the ndvi the weighted combination is almost equal to the value of near infrared band nir for different soils and is sensitivity to vegetation moreover the ndpi considers the absorption of leaf water content in the swir band thus could account for variations in canopy water content this assist in improving the separability of soil and vegetation with varying leaf water content a previous daunting task when using ndvi the ndpi was chosen for these reasons further the above mentioned indices were computed from the time series data and then used to assess wetland ecohydrological dynamics overtime in addition visible red green and blue nir and swir bands were extracted from the grouped images representing each interval and concatenated to the extracted indices to form images with only the appropriate band combinations that better enhances the wetland features the concatenated images were then composited per interval to form single images representing each interval using the median composite algorithm in gee the median composite algorithm reduces a stack of images by calculating a median across the matching bands of the image stack thus minimising the illumination effects such as shades as well as the effects of cloud cover gorelick et al 2017 mahdianpari et al 2020 consequently the derived composite images were subjected to the object based image analysis obia obia was chosen because of its superiority to pixel based analysis various studies such as mahdianpari et al 2019 pande chhetri et al 2017 have shown that obia does not only rely on spectral characteristics but also considers contextual information height texture area perimeter etc of a pixel which helps in improving the discrimination of wetland classes the initial step in obia is image segmentation this process involves the partitioning of the image into multiple discreet and non overlapping objects based on a specific criterion this maximizes the separability of different landcover classes and prevents the salt and pepper effects on the final classified image dlamini et al 2021a further a simple non iterative clustering snic algorithm was used to partition the composite images the snic undertakes image segmentation by initializing the centroids in a regular gridded image and then the dependency of each pixel relative to the centroids is established using the distance in five dimensional space of colour and spatial coordinate the distance joins the normalised spatial and colour distances to produce uniform super pixel the candidate pixel is added to the cluster based on its shortest distance to the centroid achanta and süsstrunk 2017 the algorithm was selected because of the simplicity memory efficiency as well as the ability to incorporate connectivity between the pixels after initiation of the algorithm the snic algorithm was implemented using the code ee algorithms image segmantation snic and the outputs were images with super pixels as well as contextual information of those pixels such as areas texture standard deviation perimeters and heights these were then integrated with the selected spectral bands and used as an input concatenate images in the selected machine learning algorithm 3 4 adopted wetland classification approach classification of the acquired images was executed using the random forest rf machine learning algorithm in the gee cloud computing platform the rf algorithm is an ensemble non parametric classifier which consists of many different trees from subsets of randomly selected training data dlamini et al 2021b each tree casts a unit vote to decide on the final class of the object the algorithm was selected because of the ability to handle large differences between landcover classes thereby neutralising noise in the data set simioni et al 2020 moreover the selection of the rf algorithm in this study was informed by a study by gxokwe et al 2021 which identified rf as an appropriate gee algorithm for classifying small seasonally flooded wetlands comparatively the rf algorithms produced highest overall producer s and user s accuracy prior to the classification the ground truth points were split on r studio into 70 training and 30 validation samples the split training data were then imported and converted to vector files in a gis environment and then imported to the gee to train the classifier the training of the rf classifier on gee was executed using the code ee classifier train in training the object based rf model the grid search value for mtry parameter was varied from 1 and 5 the grid search value for ntree parameter was varied from 500 to 10 000 with an interval of 500 the ranges were selected based on studies of similar nature such as dlamini et al 2021a b gxokwe et al 2021 ryan et al 2014 the search yielded hundred combinations of mtry and ntree values and the optimum values 1500 ntree and 5 mtry from these combinations were finally used as the rf model input parameters for classifying the landsat 7 composite images classification of the remotely sensed image composites was then executed using the code image classify 3 5 accuracy assessment accuracy assessment was executed using three metrices namely the overall accuracy oa user s accuracy ua and producer s accuracy pa oa measures the overall correctly classified pixels story and congalton 1986 and ua measures the probability that a classified pixel of a particular category belongs to that category on the ground pa measures how well the reference ground cover type pixels were classified story and congalton 1986 the oa was implemented using the code image accuracy in gee pa and ua were implemented using the codes image producersaccuracy and image consumersaccuracy during the implementation of the above mentioned algorithms in gee the validation vector produced from the 30 field data was firstly imported to the platform and zones on the classified image corresponding to the vector points were sampled using the code image sampleregions the sampled zones as well as the validation vector points were then used as input files to the latter algorithms to compute each accuracy metric oa ua and pa 3 6 change analysis variations and major drivers to assess wetlands ecohydrological changes the area covered by each land cover class were estimated from the classified image per interval and the rate of change for each class rac was established using the method described by shen et al 2019 equation 2 2 rac ea i a ia 100 where rac is given as the rate of change of wetland area ea is the area at the of the period considered refers to the areas in years 2000 2005 2006 2010 2011 2015 2016 2020 ia is the initial wetland area refers to the total area for the period of 2000 2005 calculated as the sum of the surface areas covered by the wetland classes identified the variations in ecohydrological dynamics were established by analysing time series of ndvis ndwis and ndpis which were used as proxy for wetland ecohydrological dynamics 4 results 4 1 variations in ecohydrological dynamics the changes in spatial distribution of the wetland cover classes for the time periods are presented in fig 3 water class could not be identified using the object based rf model due to unavailable training and validation data for this class this is resulting from no visible spatial coverage of the class during the ground truthing period which may have been caused by short term surface inundation moreover the indices used could not detect any water class mainly because of the forested vegetation within the wetland as well as the spatial resolution of the data used although water could not be detected most vegetation species identified such as phragmites australis are associated with the presence of semi permanent saturated wetland soils which provided ecohydrological information about the nylsvley floodplain this is supported by the findings in kotze and o connor 2000 who reported that species such as phragmites australis were associated with wettest zones within the studied wetland therefore implying that ecohydrology information could be deduced from these types of species the class distribution shows that the short grass was the most dominant class except for the period 2016 to 2020 when bare surface was the most dominant class long grass was the least dominant class for all the cases except for the 4th period 2016 2020 where short grass was least dominant visual assessment of the changes from the derived spatial distribution maps of the wetland classes shows variations in these classes over time these results show that classes such as short grass and long grass declined between period 1 and 2 2000 2005 and 2006 2010 however a resurgence was observed in these classes during period 3 2011 2015 for bare surface an increase was noted for the entire monitoring period except for period 3 2011 2015 where a decline of about 1 5 km2 was noted a sharp decline in spatial distributions of short and long grass were observed for the period 4 2016 2020 as bare surface sharply increased for the same period the class area results shown in fig 4 corroborate with the visual observation during fieldwork of the spatial distribution of the identified wetland classes the results show that the short grass class had the highest surface area for the periods 1 2 and 3 2000 2005 2006 2010 and 2011 2015 with surface areas ranging between 5 km2 and 8 km2 respectively the long grass had the lowest surface area for the above mentioned periods which ranged between 0 1 km2 to 0 5 km2 respectively during period 4 2016 2020 bare surface had the highest surface area of 4 8 km2 and short grass had the lowest 1 5 km2 the results on the rate of change per class are shown on table 2 drastic changes occurred in the wetland cover classes at high rates between the periods the results show that the short grass declined at a rate of about 38 between the period 1 and 2 2000 2005 and 2006 2010 whereas other classes increase at a rate of 228 and 230 particularly bare surface which doubled compared to period 1 2000 2005 although a decline in short grass was observed for the above mentioned periods there was an increase in this class during the period 3 2011 2015 at a rate of 51 bare surface and long grass decreased at the rates of 69 and 46 respectively for period 3 2011 2015 furthermore the results show that the short grass declined by 81 while other classes such as long grass doubled there were no major changes of the temporal variations of ndvi ndpi and ndwi for the nylsvley floodplain supplementary material figure a however the ndwi had low values less than 0 throughout implying that there was no surface inundation detected ndpi and ndvi had values greater than 0 in most cases particularly for the time periods 2000 2005 2006 2010 and 2016 2020 supplementary material figure a implying that there was vegetation detected although it was not healthy 4 2 accuracy assessment the accuracy assessment results showed that the oa fig 5 for all the periods were within the acceptable range between 72 and 78 with 2011 2015 and 2016 2020 having the highest values and 2006 2010 the lowest value the class accuracy results are presented in table 3 the results show that for all the periods the pa ranged between 33 and 88 and the short grass had the highest pa in all the cases and long grass had the lowest pa particularly for period 1 and 2 2000 2005 and 2006 2010 during which the pa was 33 for period 3 and 4 2011 2015 and 2016 2020 the bare surface had the lowest pa with 37 5 for both periods the ua results ranged from 40 to 100 with long grass having the highest ua for period 1 and 2 2000 2005 and 2006 2010 the lowest ua was for bare surface during period 1 2006 2010 with a proportion of 40 table 3 4 3 drivers of ecohydrological variation a statistical summary of the ndvi ndwi and ndpi results for all the periods are presented in the supplementary material figure b the results indicate that the indices are mostly positively skewed except for ndwi for years like 2006 in time period 2 and 2014 in time period 3 which have symmetric distributions the data also show larger variations in most cases with large ranges stretched whiskers except for some years such as 2003 in period 1 2000 2005 where the whiskers for ndvi ndwi and ndpi are squeezed as well as 2008 and 2009 in period 2 2006 2010 where the whiskers are short the outliers were observed for ndvi ndwi and ndpi data for the year 2004 in time period 1 and in period 4 for the years 2017 2018 and 2019 for the time period 3 outliers were observed for ndvi during the year 2015 further an inverse relationship between the biomass indices and the annual et rate fig 6 was noted the ndpi decreased considerably during years when et increased e g 2002 and 2004 fig 6a the biomass indices except for ndpi tended to increase as expected with the amount of annual precipitation e g 2007 to 2009 fig 7 this relationship is however not evident during some years such as 2002 to 2004 in time period 1 a wetland typically stores both surface and subsurface water and therefore a decrease in rainfall in a single year such as 2002 and 2003 may not have significant effects to the growth of plants as they may be utilising water already in storage 5 discussion this study assessed the utility of the gee cloud computing platform in monitoring long term 2000 2020 variations in ecohydrological dynamics of the small seasonally flooded wetlands in a semi arid environment of south africa using the nylsvley floodplain as a case study the main classification results showed that the following three landcover classes could be identified i short grass vegetation characterised by species such as cynodon dyctolon and oryza longistaminata ii long grass species such as phragmites australis and iii bare surfaces these land cover classes represent zones with semi permanent soil saturation as shown by the presence of phragmites australis and temporary to seasonal saturation represented by short grass oryza longistaminata kotze and o connor 2000 while overall the nylsvley floodplain may be considered a seasonally flooded system the results of this study show that the system contains both seasonal and semi permanent hydroperiods because of the presence of the above mentioned wetland vegetation species which are viewed as indicators of environments with semi permanent saturated soils and seasonal inundation the water class could not be detected due to unavailable training and validation data covering this class resulting from the absence of surface inundation during the period of ground truthing moreover the remotely sensed spectral indices used failed to detect the presence of water mostly due to the dense vegetation in parts of the studied system as well as the spatial resolution of the landsat 7 etm which was selected because of the length of the image record and the number of good quality images table b in supplementary material available for this product on the gee catalogue accuracy assessment results showed that an overall accuracy was within the acceptable range of 69 79 although this was the case there were some inaccuracies for classes such as bare surface and long grass for some periods these can be mostly attributed to the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed product used which resulted in significant spectral mixing between the classes several studies such as dvorett et al 2016 and gxokwe et al 2021 have demonstrated that the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed data does significantly impact the accuracy of classification results particularly when mapping small areas such as the wetlands studied here moreover the report by federal geographic data committee 1992 highlighted that with landsat data which is used in this study accurate identification of an object requires at least 9 pixels which covers a total surface area of about 0 9 ha and at most 25 pixels the limited training data of bare surface and long grass relative to the short grass species due to the spatial coverage of these classes within the wetland led to unequal distribution of training points which affected the ability of the training data to adequately characterise the classes of interest due to the small size of bare surface and long grass within the wetland fewer points were collected for these classes than for short grass thus resulting in the imbalance in training samples these imbalances are likely to have caused inaccuracies in the classification of bare surface and long grass than short grass which had more training data several studies such as millard and richardson 2013 ustuner et al 2016 xia et al 2019 have demonstrated that unequal distribution or imbalance in the training data is likely to influence the classification accuracy of the classes in a way that the over represented classes may dominate the underrepresented classes resulting in classification inaccuracies for the underrepresented classes however the imbalances in training samples in this case were not as a result of sampling error but rather a result of lower number of training points available for bare surface and long grass caused by the small areal coverage these land cover class in the area under study the spatiotemporal variation results showed that ecohydrological conditions varied from one period to another denoted by some of the classes changing to more than double the previous area and some which significantly dropped to half the previous period the results indicated that in most cases bare surface significantly increased for periods such as 2006 2010 and 2016 2020 this can be attributed mostly to seasonal changes as most images used for these periods were collected during dry season addendum a which is the leaf off season few suitable images were available for the wet season images leaf on season due to frequent cloud cover moreover below average precipitation was received in the ltrb around 2016 2017 which significantly impacted most ecosystems including the wetlands in the area gxokwe et al 2021 which therefore explains the cause of bare surface domination this is also evident in figure 9 the temporal variations in the indices results showed similar trends between ndvi ndwi and ndpi and the floodplain was dry for most times these finding corroborates with nhamo et al 2017 who reported high seasonal variabilities in wetland of the witbank catchment in south africa although the study focused only on inundation dynamics at larger scale than the studied as expected there was an inverse relationship between et and wetland biomass for all the periods this is because et tends to contribute to water losses in wetlands particularly in semi arid regions therefore resulting in loss of moisture available in wetlands and thus contributing to the decline in the ndwi values for the wetlands due to the decline in moisture content available in the wetland some vegetation become less healthy because water stress results in ndvi and ndpi decline a study by al shehhi et al 2011 monitored the effects of variable soil moisture content to the modis derived ndvi for different vegetation species in abu dhabi the findings showed that with increasing evaporation rates less healthy vegetation dominated the studied area due to plants wilting thus resulting in decreased ndvi values these results by al shehhi et al 2011 corroborate with the findings of current study although the focus was not only on wetland vegetation further west et al 2018 studied vegetation response to varying soil moisture using sentinel 2 data and the results show strong correlation between sentinel 2 derived ndvi as well as soil moisture content which therefore supports the findings of the current study comparative analysis of annual precipitation with average ndvi ndwi and ndpi showed that with increase in annual precipitation the indices also increased for all the time periods except for 2000 2001 where the indices showed delayed response to varying annual precipitation the delayed response could be resulting from the use of dry season images which corresponds to the leaf off season for vegetation and low flow period for inundation the study by chen et al 2020 evaluated the vegetation response to precipitation anomalies in the semi arid inner mongolia plateau china over a 34 year period using the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr derived ndvi and multi source precipitation data the findings of the study show that there is a time lag in vegetation response to precipitation though the duration is not visible annual variations of rainfall and evapotranspiration rates have been shown in this study to be major drivers for the ecohydrological dynamics of the nylsvley floodplain annual rainfall will also influence the availability of both soil water and groundwater which also influence vegetation growth in a wetland these finding corroborate with the study of birkhead et al 2007 which modelled the hydraulic behaviour of the nylsvley floodplain using field measured climate data coupled with lidar data the study identified et and annual rainfall as driving factors of the ecohydrological changes in the floodplain overall the findings underscore the relevance of cloud computing artificial intelligence platforms such as gee in monitoring long term variations in ecohydrological dynamics of semi arid wetlands in the sub saharan region and therefore providing information on their degradation rates and loss which is currently unknown for these regions these findings are critical in the development of sustainable use and management frameworks of small seasonal flooded wetlands in semi arid regions besides they provide useful alternative ways and robust methodologies to generate routine and continuous wetland information about their changes a previous daunting task from traditional mapping and monitoring techniques this therefore will aid in development of local to global scale frameworks that will assist in setting up conservation policies and apply effective management practices of wetlands particularly in data scarce regions with semi arid climates and semi permanent wetland with varying ecohydrology that typically may be over exploited during dry periods the study also informs the ongoing efforts by the projects such as global monitoring environment and security gmes africa hosted by southern african science services centre for climate change and adaptive land management which is promoting the use of earth observation data for assessing monitoring and managing wetlands in transboundary basins to prevent loss of ecosystems services which are beneficial to the communities around these systems further the study contributes towards achieving the key priority areas of the african union s agenda 2063 which elaborates on preserving at least 17 of the of terrestrial and inland waters including wetlands and 10 of the marine areas by 2023 the study also contributes to achieving sustainable development goal sdg 6 6 which advocates for the prevention of the destruction and degradations of all the ecosystems and rehabilitating those that had already been destroyed sudmanns et al 2020 6 conclusion the study utilized remotely sensed data accessible from the gee platform coupled with advanced machine learning algorithms to monitor long term ecohydrological dynamics over a 20 year period of semi permanent wetlands using nylsvley floodplain in limpopo south africa as a case study the findings of the study showed that the ecohydrology of the wetland varied over time and space for example bare surface increased twice as much as the previous measurement period whereas short grass decreased significantly during study period 2 moreover the remotely sensed derived spectral indices showed similar trends throughout the 20 year period with ndwi having minimum values less than zero in all cases implying that there was no surface inundation however the presence of some wetland vegetation indicated seasonal to semi permanent soil saturation conditions the results also showed that annual rainfall and et were the major drivers to ecohydrological dynamics of the nylsvley floodplain these findings underscore the relevance of using cloud computing artificial intelligence techniques coupled with optical remotely sensed data in monitoring changes in ecohydrology of small seasonal flooded wetlands and are critical in sustainable use and management of these systems in these regions they provide useful alternative ways and robust methodologies to generate long term baseline information about their changes overtime a previously daunting task from traditional mapping and monitoring techniques this therefore aids in development of local to global scale frameworks that will assist is setting up conservation policies and applying effective management practices of wetlands particularly in data scarce regions with semi arid climates and semi permanent wetland that vary in ecohydrology may typically be over exploited during dry periods while the study offers new opportunities to generate high resolution continuous wetland scale information it is recommended that the potential of this platform in catchment scale monitoring the impacts of adjacent land use and land cover changes as well as groundwater level change to these systems be

3169,air gap diffusion distillation agdd is a practical desalination technique the highly saturated super hydrophilic porous medium as its evaporation surface has a decisive influence on the desalination efficiency of agdd in experiments we found preferential flow in porous media however the preferential flow in highly saturated super hydrophilic porous media has not been studied and the effect of preferential paths on evaporation from porous media surfaces remains poorly understood the method of combining dye tracking and infrared imaging was used to visualize the process of thermal seepage in highly saturated super hydrophilic porous media under the condition of uniform and continuous liquid supply on the upper surface the preferential flow characteristics of hot stream seepage in porous media are tracked point source infiltration experiments were carried out at room temperature to compare the difference between preferential flow in super hydrophilic porous media and general soil sand the experimental results of thermal seepage showed that the preferential flow greatly influences the uneven temperature distribution of the porous media which directly impairs the desalination efficiency of agdd according to the coefficient of variation cv the preferential flow development process can be divided into three stages stable development exponential development and high speed growth as the seepage flow is stabilized the influence of preferential flow on the flow field and temperature field still exists and is affected by these three stages preferential flow characteristics were also captured in the saturated capillary rise zone at the bottom of the porous medium below the phreatic level the point source infiltration experiment found that the preferential flow in superhydrophilic porous medium will reappear at high saturation which is completely different from the soil sand studied by previous studies in addition the effects of inlet temperature flow rate thickness and hydrophilic hygroscopicity on preferential flow were discussed increasing the flow rate and inlet temperature and reducing the thickness of the porous media can weaken the influence of preferential flow on the temperature field but increasing the temperature only superficially weakens the preferential flow increasing hydrophilicity and hygroscopicity can also reduce the preferential flow keywords desalination air gap diffusion distillation agdd super hydrophilic porous media highly saturated preferential flow temperature distribution data availability the data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request 1 introduction air gap diffusion distillation agdd is a desalination device designed based on air gap membrane distillation agmd xu et al 2019 unlike agmd agdd uses super hydrophilic porous media instead of a hot stream channel and a membrane for the seepage and evaporation of the salt solution fig 1 since the water vapor diffuses directly from the surface of porous media into air gap the heat and mass transfer resistance in agdd can be reduced significantly in comparison with agmd xu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 reported that the gained output ratio gor of agdd can reach 2 53 times that of agmd industrial low grade heat sources and solar energy can be used as heat sources to achieve low temperature multi effect desalination under normal pressure because of its simple structure and low cost it can also be used to solve residential water shortages in remote areas which makes it has a high application and research value in the experiment we discovered the existence of preferential flow finger flow during the seepage process of super hydrophilic porous materials owing to the presence of preferential flow the feed stream is allowed to bypass part of the porous medium kang et al 2022 nimmo 2021 the distribution of the high temperature salt solution in the porous media is not uniform and cannot be fully utilized the temperature of the evaporation surface was affected by the distribution of the salt solution in the porous media it becomes uneven and low greatly impairing the desalination evaporation efficiency of agdd which is worthy of further exploration the non uniform transport mechanism of the finger flow is caused by the instability of the seepage flow itself or the instability of the wetting front when the wetting front becomes unstable the finger is formed and moves down through the seepage zone bypassing most of the unsaturated porous media to reach the phreatic surface glass et al 1989 liyanage and juanes 2022 in an unsaturated homogeneous porous media the generation of finger flow is related to the density and viscosity of the fluid hosseinalipoor et al 2020 jin et al 2021 parameters such as the hydrophilic water repellency saturation initial water content and hydraulic conductivity of porous media affect the generation of finger flow hardie et al 2011 jiang et al 2020 kang et al 2022 wang and wallach 2021 zhao and mohanty 2019 much discussion of the porous material s wettability has focused on water repellency ganz et al 2013 leuther et al 2018 li et al 2019 mao et al 2019 mirbabaei et al 2021 ogunmokun et al 2020 wang and wallach 2021 because finger flow is not easily formed in hydrophilic porous media nimmo 2021 wei et al 2014 fingering is promoted when the medium is quite dry even relatively low water saturations lead to a compact wetting front liyanage and juanes 2022 the higher the initial water content the wider is the finger width dicarlo 2004 dicarlo et al 1999 kang et al 2022 liu et al 1994 the continuous increase of the initial water content will weaken the finger flow as well as fill the flow channel forming an unstable wetting front called richards wetting front bauters et al 2000 however previous studies have focused on soils sands rocks and snow with low initial water content and poor hydrophilicity there were few studies on preferential flow in high initial water content saturation and super hydrophilic porous media porous foam materials beven and germann 2013 guo and lin 2018 mohammed et al 2018 nimmo 2021 although there have been a lot of studies on the effect of preferential flow on evaporation these studies mainly focus on the evaporation process on the natural surface of soil or sand li et al 2017 mirbabaei et al 2021 rye and smettem 2017 shao et al 2017 sidle and bogaard 2016 sprenger et al 2016 tran et al 2019 xu et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 which is completely different from the preferential flow longitudinal section evaporation process in agdd desalination it is worth mentioning that it is not easy to find relevant research on the seepage state of preferential flow reaching below the phreatic surface and its application in the heat and mass transfer of porous media therefore exploring the preferential flow phenomenon in highly saturated super hydrophilic porous media and its impact on the desalination evaporation efficiency of agdd can fill the gap of related research and has great practical significance dye tracking is a standard method for visualizing preferential flows brilliant blue fcf is widely used in dye tracking because of its prominent visibility high water solubility low toxicity low cost and robust stability guo et al 2019 li et al 2021 wu et al 2015 however this method is challenging to both achieve standardization and attain a quantitative comparison between different experimental results allaire et al 2009 usually the dye tracking experiment of preferential flow observes the transient seepage process or the final steady state result after the quantitative tracer is added in the agdd experiment continuous addition of the tracer will cause the surface of the porous media that has been dyed by capillary action and concentration diffusion to be unable to distinguish the subsequent seepage process infrared imaging methods can be used to make up for this shortcoming and are less affected by capillary action and concentration diffusion improving the accuracy of capturing seepage processes and through the two dimensional temperature distribution the preferential flow phenomenon below the phreatic surface and after the flow field is stabilized can be continuously tracked and compared to dye tracking it is easy to achieve standardization and attain a quantitative comparison the main purpose of this study is to investigate the preferential flow phenomenon in a super hydrophilic porous media with a high initial water content saturation and the effect of preferential flow on the desalination evaporation efficiency of agdd will be discussed to achieve this goal we performed a series of visualization experiments combining dye tracing and infrared imaging methods firstly the existence of the preferential flow has been proven and the characteristics of the preferential flow and its influence on the temperature of agdd have been discussed secondly four factors that affect the preferential flow were studied because preferential flow is a ubiquitous phenomenon it is impossible to directly reflect the influence degree of preferential flow on the agdd water production rate by comparison with experiments to achieve a uniform and stable seepage in porous media therefore this study took the porous medium evaporation surface temperature as the object of discussion by discussing the influence of preferential flow on the inhoogeneity of temperature distribution the influence of preferential flow on desalination evaporation efficiency of agdd was indirectly evaluated 2 material and methods 2 1 materials the super hydrophilic porous media material used in the experiment was polyvinyl alcohol dimethyl formal pvfm and hydrophilic but non hygroscopic melamine sponges ms and hydrophobic polyurethane pu foam were used for comparison experiments a scanning electron microscope sem tescan mira3 lmh czech republic was used to characterize the sponge surface morphology a video optical contact angle measuring instrument dataphysics oca50 germany was used to measure the contact angle of the pvfm fig 2 the contact angle of pvfm and ms is 0 and the contact angle of the pu is 123 2 2 experimental system to visualize the preferential flow the cold endplate cold stream channel and condensate plate of the agdd were removed xu et al 2019 this means that only the hot side remains including the hot endplate hot stream channel plate hot stream channel and cover plate fig 3 the structural parameters of the test system are listed in table 1 as shown in fig 4 0 5 g l brilliant blue fcf solution was used as a tracer which was transported by the solution pump to the hot side of the agdd and sprayed evenly to the top of the porous media through a sprayer the flow was controlled by a valve installed in the pipeline and the electric heating container controlled the inlet temperature the thermistor evenly distributed inside the porous media was used to measure the average temperature of the porous media a flow meter was used to record the flow of the solution the camera and infrared thermal imager recorded the flow pattern and temperature change process in the seepage process respectively the tricolor card was used to correct the color of the dyed picture and the shape of the dyed picture and the infrared picture were corrected using an orthogonally placed ruler all data were recorded by the data acquisition module and later saved on a personal computer a stabilized voltage supply machine was used to provide power for the precision measuring equipment and a 24 v dc stabilized voltage supply to provide power for the data acquisition unit the specifications of the principal components and the measurement instruments are listed in table 2 we also conducted a point source infiltration experiment to explore the difference between the finger flow in super hydrophilic porous media pvfm and soil which was commonly used by researchers in the past a 53 4 cm high 20 3 cm wide and 1 cm thick porous media flow chamber was used the porous media s front rear and lower surfaces are open to prevent air entrapment in the porous media flow chamber during water flow infiltrating experiments were performed by injecting 0 5 g l brilliant blue fcf solution at a 2 ml min as a point source through a hypodermic needle near the porous media surface the supply pipe was connected to a peristaltic pump table 2 a camera was used to record the infiltration process table 2 2 3 experimental procedures at the beginning of the experiment deionized water was used as the working fluid the valve and electric heating container were adjusted to ensure that the inlet flow and temperature of the working fluid reached the specified value and the valve opening and electric heating container values were kept unchanged the water bath heating pipeline was switched to the non heated state using the same flow rate of average temperature 25 c deionized water to cool the porous media allowing the overall temperature of the porous media to decrease to the average temperature then the camera and infrared thermal imager were turned on and the data acquisition unit was prepared to collect data later the water bath heating pipeline was changed to the heating state and connected with the brilliant blue fcf solution as the working fluid to start recording the camera continuously captures the dye tracking and the infrared thermal imager takes an infrared photo every 2 s owing to the continuous supply of the brilliant blue fcf solution after the surface of the porous media is dyed completely the dye tracking method cannot distinguish the subsequent stabilization process of preferential flow in the porous media then the camera is turned off at this time the infrared thermal imager can continue to track the stable process of the preferential flow in the porous media until the surface temperature of the porous media no longer changes then the thermal infrared camera and data acquisition unit were turned off the varying ranges of the experimental parameters are shown in table 3 infiltrating experiments were carried out using porous media with five saturation of 13 5 27 4 50 7 69 7 and 89 1 respectively and different saturations were obtained by weighing infiltration was carried out for 30 min and the total water volume added to the porous medium for all runs was 60 ml the camera takes a photo every 1 min 2 4 data processing methods 2 4 1 image processing methods photoshop application was used to correct the shape and color of the dye tracking image in photoshop the dye tracking image was first denoised and then binarized with a threshold of 80 the temperature cloud images were drawn based on infrared data in the origin the seepage and temperature front positions were also obtained using photoshop 2 4 2 coefficient of variation the coefficient of variation cv was used to evaluate the degree of development of the preferential flow and is defined as 1 c v 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 2 x where n is the number of samples when discussing the cv of the temperature front and the seepage front in the seepage process x i is the relative depth m of the i th sample point on the front and denoted as x i y i y min where y i is the depth m of this sample point and y min is the minimum depth m of the front sample point when discussing the cv of the temperature distribution after the temperature field is stabilized x i is the relative temperature of the i th sample point on the sectional line parallel to the x axis denoted as x i t i t min where t i is the temperature of this sample point and t min is the minimum temperature on the sectional line and x i is defined as 2 x i 1 n x i n 2 4 3 average range it is well known that except for porous media materials and liquid properties the surface evaporation efficiency of the porous medium under normal pressure is mainly related to the temperature attari moghaddam et al 2017 cabrera et al 2020 odagiri et al 2021 xu et al 2019 in the ideal state without preferential flow the temperature at any level in the agdd porous medium is uniformly distributed however this situation cannot be achieved experimentally therefore we use the average range ar to evaluate the degree of dispersion of the experimental temperature relative to the ideal state compared with cv ar can more intuitively represent the degree of temperature distribution non uniformity on the surface of porous media caused by preferential flow which is defined as 3 a r y 0 0 5 t max t min n where t max and t min are the maximum and minimum temperatures on any horizontal line of the porous medium surface n is the number of samples take 200 temperature lines at equal distances from 0 to 0 5 m on the surface of the porous medium 3 results and discussion 3 1 preferential flow characteristics of seepage and temperature through experiments we found that the preferential flow of the highly saturated and super hydrophilic porous media still exists under the condition of a continuous liquid supply and found the influence of preferential flow on the temperature distribution 3 1 1 verify the existence of the preferential flow water seepage in unsaturated porous media usually leads to preferential flow gravity fingering which is a hydrodynamic instability driven by gravity in seepage experiments on dry porous sand or soil the tracer flow rate is generally low and as the depth of infiltration increases there will be apparent fingers grant et al 2019 mallet et al 2020 tang et al 2020 experiments have found that the seepage and displacement of the solution at a high initial water content saturation and super hydrophilic porous media will also be affected by the preferential flow and the influence of the preferential flow on the flow field still exists after the flow field is stabilized in the agdd experiment the initial water content of the porous media is significant and the feed flow is large which makes the fingers wider and forms a richards wetting front bauters et al 2000 in contrast the concentration diffusion of the tracer and the dispersion of capillary force are very significant in super hydrophilic porous media with large porosity and it is challenging to form fingers fig 4 a shows that the binary image is the seepage process obtained using the dye tracking method left 60 294 s the image processing method is shown in section 2 4 1 the temperature cloud image is the seepage process brought by infrared imaging technology right 60 294 s 428 972 s it can be seen that the seepage process received by the dye tracking method does not form apparent fingers but forms an unstable richards wetting front however the existence of fingers can be observed in the temperature cloud chart the concentration diffusion of the tracer in the hydrophilic porous media leads to a weakening of the preferential flow characteristics shown by the dye tracking results comparing the development speed of the fronts in the binary and the temperature cloud image it can be seen that the development of the seepage fronts tracked by the tracer is ahead of the temperature fronts and their distance gradually increases with time at 294 s the seepage front touched the bottom at 428 s the temperature front touched the bottom and the temperature distribution did not stabilize until 972 s when the high temperature stream in the highly saturated porous media displaces the low temperature stream the temperature front will be weakened correspondingly owing to the influence of convection and heat conduction the concentration diffusion also causes the observed dyeing front to be ahead of the actual seepage front as the depth increased the saturation of the porous media increased and the influence of concentration diffusion was excellent it can be seen that the number of finger flows at different time points is unchanged and the profile of the wetting front does not change significantly this is because the continuous spray of the hot stream is equivalent to undergoing a repeated wetting process and the fingers will follow part or all of the previous flow path seep downward franklin et al 2021 wang et al 2003 and the finger flow that develops first will guide most of the flow beljadid et al 2020 cueto felgueroso and juanes 2009 therefore it is not easy to generate a new finger flow and in turn a profile of the wetting front in uniform porous media does not change significantly the depth values of the seepage front and temperature front were used to calculate the cv to evaluate the degree of development of the preferential flow during the seepage process cv is calculated as shown in section 2 4 1 fig 5 b and 4 c show the variation in cv with time and penetration depth respectively the seepage front gradually moves ahead in time and the overall temperature front cv is greater than the seepage front cv the change in the temperature front cv is affected by the seepage front cv and has the same change law as the seepage front cv this can also prove that infrared images can reflect the characteristics of seepage in porous media the shift of the cv in the process of high saturation and super hydrophilic porous media can be divided into three stages as shown in fig 5 c in the first stage at the top of the porous media the saturation of the porous media is low the preferential flow is mainly due to the instability of the wetting front caused by the displacement of low density air by high density water dicarlo 2004 and the cv increases at a steady rate the average slope is 0 74 in the second stage as the seepage depth increased the initial water content in front of the wetting front increased the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of porous media is extremely sensitive to the water content the saturation increases along the depth direction which means that the porous media have higher hydraulic conductivity and are easier to produce preferential paths nimmo 2021 chuoke et al 1959 hill and p 1952 saffman and sir geoffrey taylor 1988 given the stability criteria for the wetting front gravity driven fluid displacement the interface is stable if 3 μ 2 k 2 μ 1 k 1 v c ρ 2 ρ 1 g 0 and unstable if 4 μ 2 k 2 μ 1 k 1 v c ρ 2 ρ 1 g 0 where subscript 1 is the driving fluid subscript 2 is the driven fluid μ k ρ g are viscosity effective permeability density and gravitational acceleration and the critical velocity is defined as yadali jamaloei 2021 5 v c ρ 1 ρ 2 g μ 2 k 2 μ 1 k 1 when high temperature water displaces low temperature water and air it can be considered that the upper and lower of the interface are two fluids with different physical properties as the seepage velocity increases if the average velocity of the seepage front is more significant than a specific critical value the flow will also become unstable diment et al 1982 singh et al 2022 therefore the cv increased exponentially at this stage the average slope reaches 2 27 in the third stage the seepage front was close to the bottom of the porous media owing to the capillary rise of the hydrophilic porous media there will be a certain depth of saturation zone at the bottom of the porous media due to the phenomenon of saturation overshoot the finger flow has a saturated or nearly so tip in a uniform porous media driven by gravity dicarlo 2004 šír et al 2020 when the saturated finger flow tip hits the saturated porous media interface the gravity driven seepage flow is hindered however the development of the preferential flow is also temporarily hindered which is manifested by a period of fluctuation in cv owing to the continuous liquid supply the saturation height of the porous media exceeds the dynamic capillary rise height and the cold stream is discharged from the bottom of the porous media to realize the displacement of the cold stream by the hot stream the saturated area had a higher hydraulic conductivity and the seepage velocity increased rapidly after the seepage front passed the short term obstruction of the saturated interface the finger flow tip which first passed the interface grew the fastest and led most of the traffic this phenomenon is a winner take all process beljadid et al 2020 liyanage and juanes 2022 the development degree of preferential flow at this stage increases rapidly manifesting as an almost linear increase in cv average slope up to 10 49 the position of the interface between the first and second stages is related to the solution flow rate initial saturation the higher the initial saturation the shorter is the first stage and the interface moves upward in the direction of decreasing depth the position of the interface between the second and third stages is related to the properties of the porous material the greater the capillary rise height the longer is the third stage and the interface moves upward consequently the direction of decreasing depth after the temperature field was stabilized the temperature data at the same depth were used to calculate the cv to evaluate the effect of preferential flow on the temperature distribution of the porous media after stabilization as shown in fig 5 d the influence of preferential flow after stabilization can also be divided into three stages the saturation of the first stage was low and the third stage was fully saturated as the respective hydraulic conductivity in the two regions remains unchanged the development degree of the preferential flow also tends to stabilize after the flow field stabilizes hence cv fluctuated within the interval in the second stage the saturation of the porous media in the area has a slow increasing trend and the hydraulic conductivity increases with depth enhancing the intensity of the preferential flow with depth in the steady state the thermal conductivity of the porous media framework and the liquid will greatly weaken the intensity of the preferential flow after stabilization therefore the cv the maximum is approximately 6 after stabilization is smaller than the cv the maximum is approximately 65 of the initial seepage process 3 1 2 preferential flow characteristics in super hydrophilic porous media two representative studies were selected to compare the preferential flow in porous media with different properties and the experimental conditions are shown in table 4 the volume shrinkage of pvfm in the dry state is severe and the liquid cannot pass smoothly in the case of ensuring that the pvfm does not shrink a set of minimum saturation 13 5 was compared with the experiments of bauters et al 2000 the location of the seepage front is obtained as shown in section 2 4 1 it can be seen that under the same saturation 13 5 pvfm has obvious preferential flow characteristics and the finger width is only 2 94 cm fig 6 a while the fingers in the quartz sand have filled the whole chamber fig 6k and the actual finger width is at least 10 2 times that of pvfm but the wetting front speed of pvfm is only 1 3 times that of quartz sand fig 7 it is different from the previous conclusion that finger flow is not easily generated in hydrophilic porous media nimmo 2021 but as the saturation increases 13 5 69 7 the finger width in pvfm increases 2 94 13 6 cm fig 6a d showing the same trend as in quartz sand fig 6f k it indicated that the sensitivity of pvfm to saturation is hysteretic which is related to its larger porosity pore size and permeability however when the saturation reached 89 1 the preferential flow appeared again in the pvfm and the wetting front velocity also showed an upward trend which was 43 5 higher than when the saturation was 69 7 fig 7 this is completely different from the development trend of preferential flow in ordinary sand and soil it is such a characteristic that preferential flow can also occur in the process of high saturation agdd desalination the shape of the initial wetting front of pvfm fig 6a e was similar to that of wettable sandy soil fig 6l wallach 2010 the matrix potential of the hydrophilic porous medium drives the liquid to diffuse to the surroundings along the point source while the water repellent porous medium exhibits obvious gravity flow fig 6m n 3 1 3 preferential flow affects temperature distribution characteristics as the temperature distribution became stable we compared the surface temperature ts of the porous media recorded by infrared imaging with the average temperature ta of the porous media recorded by the thermistor as shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the temperature distribution law after stabilization is still affected by the three stages of preferential flow when the flow rate is low 2 5 5 10 l h the distinction between the first and second stages is obvious and the depth is approximately 0 1 m at this time owing to the low saturation in the first stage the speed of the hot fluid displacing the air is relatively large finger flow develops fast beljadid et al 2020 and the high temperature evaporation is extensive therefore both the temperature reduction rate maximum 20 7 and the temperature difference maximum 3 1 c between ta and ts are significant because the flow rate is too low the high temperature fluid cannot effectively displace the low temperature fluid and the preferential flow expressed by temperature has a high degree of development the temperature distribution of the porous media is uneven the ts fluctuates severely and the performance in the second stage is not apparent the distinction between the first and second stages is no longer evident when the flow rate is significant 15 and 20 l h approximately between 0 and 0 28 m in depth as the initial saturation of the porous media increases there is no longer a clear boundary between the low saturation area on the top of the porous media and the saturation gradually increases the area at the middle of the porous media then the seepage becomes continuous the initial decrease rate of ts was significant but the decrease rate gradually slowed as the seepage depth increased this is because evaporation heat conduction and convection heat dissipation and the continuous development of preferential flow make it difficult to maintain the surface temperature of the porous media it can also be found that the second stage of the porous media represented by ta ends at a depth of approximately 0 4 m as the depth of seepage increased the degree of preferential flow gradually increased and part of the high temperature fluid seeps down along the preferential path inside the porous media kang et al 2022 it does not play an influential role in maintaining the surface temperature of the porous media leading to the advancement of the ts change position approximately at a depth of 0 3 m when the flow rate is relatively large 10 15 20 l h the effect of the third stage of seepage flow is more prominent when the seepage front touches the saturated capillary rise area of the porous media the high temperature liquid flowed out from the bottom of the porous media quickly along the preferential path the capillary action in the saturated porous media is restricted the surface temperature of the porous media is tough to maintain consequently ts decreases rapidly and the maximum temperature difference between ta and ts is approximately 6 c when the flow rate was low 2 5 5 the heat dissipation in the seepage process was relatively large so the difference between ta and ts in the third stage was not apparent 0 3 2 6 c 3 2 factors affecting the preferential flow the operating parameters structural parameters and physical property parameters affect the preferential flow in porous media the temperature distribution on the surface of the porous media after the temperature field was stabilized to judge the development degree of preferential flow under different parameters in porous media the image processing method is shown in section 2 4 1 the temperature scale units of the temperature legend were all degrees celsius c use the depth value at the time when the temperature front touched the bottom to calculate the coefficient of variation cv section 2 4 2 and use the temperature distribution after the temperature field is stabilized to calculate the average range ar section 2 4 3 and then make histograms to quantify the degree of influence of each parameter on the preferential flow 3 2 1 stream temperature fig 9 shows the effect of thin on the surface temperature distribution preferential flow of the porous media it can be seen that when thin is low 50 55 c a preferential flow of temperature distribution appears even at high flow rates in fig 9 a and b the presence of fingers can be seen with the increase in thin 60 65 c the high temperature zone shifts downwards the finger shape of the temperature field becomes inconspicuous which eventually disappears fig 9a b when thin is low the temperature difference between the upper and lower sides of the porous media surface is significant and thermal diffusion and heat conduction cannot significantly increase the temperature around the finger the surface temperature distribution clearly shows the finger flow from the upper high temperature to the lower low temperature in addition low temperature reduces the hydraulic conductivity of porous media gharabaghi et al 2015 park et al 2021 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the seepage front that is close to saturation cannot pass through the bottom of the highly saturated porous medium in time and part of the high temperature liquid is forced to flow down from the surface of the porous medium forming new fingers in the form of surface temperature which we call saturated overshoot finger to distinguish it from the gravity finger fig 9a 0 3 m b 0 35 m when thin is taller the temperature difference above and below the porous media surface decreases heat diffusion and heat conduction raise the temperature of the area around the finger and the finger disappears in the temperature field fig 9c d at the same time the high temperature increases the hydraulic conductivity and weakens the saturated overshoot finger therefore increasing thin eliminates the effect of preferential flow in the apparent phenomenon and can improve the evaporation efficiency of the porous media surface however it cannot essentially eradicate preferential flow this view can also be verified from the change of cv as the inlet temperature increases 50 65 c cv increased by 244 5 fig 9e in the process of thermal seepage flow the influence of flow pattern on temperature distribution is dominant and the influence of heat diffusion and heat conduction on the temperature front is small as the inlet temperature increases the viscosity of the thermal fluid decreases and the interface is more likely to be unstable when the viscosity of the driving fluid is small hosseinalipoor et al 2020 kalde et al 2022 therefore preferential flow is more likely to occur when the inlet temperature is high and the cv is greater this is just the opposite of the change rule of the preferential flow degree of uneven temperature distribution in a steady state where increasing the temperature from 50 to 65 c reduces ar by 50 1 fig 9e 3 2 2 streamflow rate fig 10 shows the influence of qm on the surface temperature distribution preferential flow of the porous media it can be seen that the temperature distribution on the surface of the porous media under a small qm 2 5 l h shows an apparent preferential flow gravity fingering effect fig 10a the cv reached 41 3 and the ar reached 14 c when the temperature front touched the bottom fig 10d many finger like flows can also be observed in the initial stage of seepage at the top of the porous media 0 0 2 m in the lower half 0 2 0 5 m the fingers have entirely merged forming richards wetting front this phenomenon is a winner take all process where the fastest growing finger on the left guides most of the flow thereby inhibiting the growth of the other fingers on the right beljadid et al 2020 liyanage and juanes 2022 the preferential flow causes a significant temperature difference on the surface of the porous media and there is a large area of low temperature which is not conducive to evaporation with an increase in qm 10 l h the fingers develop into richards wetting front as the temperature difference in the x axis direction horizontal direction of the porous media surface decreases ar 6 3 c fig 10d the low temperature area decreases accordingly fig 10b when qm increases again 20 l h the richards wetting front is no longer evident and the temperature front tends to develop parallel to the x axis fig 10c at this time the ar is only 4 4 c and when the temperature front touched the bottom the cv is only 7 fig 10d compared to 2 5 l h ar is reduced by 68 6 and cv is reduced by 83 1 and the high temperature area on the surface of the porous media was the largest from the above increasing qm can weaken the preferential flow however with the increase of qm the surface temperature of the porous medium also increases from section 3 2 1 it can be known that increasing the temperature will also weaken the influence of the preferential flow in the apparent phenomenon ar so it is difficult to judge the contribution of qm and temperature to weakening the preferential flow through the cloud map ar however we note that elevated temperature can substantially enhance preferential flow increase cv during percolation section 3 2 1 fig 9e increasing the qm can still reduce the cv fig 10d under the side effect of the temperature increase preferential flow therefore it can be predicted that increasing the qm can attenuate the preferential flow to a greater extent when the temperature effect is excluded therefore it can be found that the increase of qm can effectively eliminate the negative effect of gravity fingering on the evaporation of porous media surfaces 3 2 3 porous media thickness fig 11 shows the effect of d on the surface temperature distribution preferential flow of the porous media it can be seen from fig 11 a that the porous media with low thickness 5 mm can easily form a stable seepage front the temperature difference in the horizontal direction x axis direction is minor ar is only 3 6 c and the overall surface temperature is higher cv is 8 5 fig 11d as the thickness of the porous media increases 10 mm the shape of the seepage front becomes sharp the temperature difference in the x axis direction increases and the richards wetting front appears fig 11b bauters et al 2000 ar increased to 6 3 c and cv increased to 17 fig 11d as shown in fig 11 c the thickness of the porous media continues to increase 20 mm at the top of the porous media about 0 0 03 m a short seepage front can be seen owing to the uniform spray of the inlet fluid which disappears as the seepage depth increases subsequently the high temperature liquid flowed downward along the preferential path inside the porous media resulting in a lower temperature on the surface of the porous media as a whole affected by heat conduction and capillary action an irregular high temperature zone appears on the outer surface of the preferential path the temperature on the surface of the porous media exhibited an unstable distribution ar reached 8 4 c as the seepage depth increased the saturation of the porous media increased the preferential seepage front was blocked at the upper interface of the second and third stages about 0 35 m and diffused along the x axis direction the width of the high temperature zone on the surface of the porous media increased consequently there is a saturated capillary rising zone at the bottom of the porous media usevičiūtė and baltrėnaitė gedienė 2022 and the hot stream flowed out quickly along the preferential path at the bottom of the porous media the hot fluid displaces only the liquid on the preferential path inside the porous media so there is a large area of low temperature because the porous media is saturated the capillary action is suppressed adegbule and kibbey 2020 the heat inside the porous media can only be transferred to the surface through the heat conduction of the porous material and the external low temperature liquid therefore an elliptical high temperature zone that spreads outward along the central area of the preferential path appears on the surface of the porous media the phenomenon of discontinuity in the high temperature zone at the bottom of the porous media was also observed increasing d increases the probability of preferential flow in the thickness direction of the porous medium from 5 mm to 20 mm ar increased by 133 3 and cv increased by 124 7 this makes a large part of the high temperature liquid not utilized by the evaporation surface which greatly weakens the desalination efficiency of agdd 3 2 4 porous media hydrophilicity fig 12 represents the seepage surface temperature distribution preferential flow of the three porous materials with different properties it can be seen that under the same working conditions the temperature distribution of pvfm with super hydrophilicity and hygroscopicity hardly shows the influence of preferential flow fig 12a the temperature distribution of ms which is hydrophilic but not hygroscopic shows a clear preferential flow finger flow fig 12b ogunmokun et al 2020 the non hydrophilic pu temperature distribution also shows preferential flow finger flow fig 12c and the surface temperature was significantly lower than that of other materials the cv of ms and pu reached 65 7 and 73 7 while the cv of pvfm was only 7 as the temperature field was stabilized the gap of preferential flow reflected by ar was still huge and the preferential flow development degree of pvfm is only 24 9 and 21 8 of ms and pu hydrophilicity provides a good passage of high temperature liquid in porous media so that the entire porous media maintains a higher temperature in a non hydrophilic pu gravity alone makes it challenging for the liquid to pass through and cannot maintain the surface temperature lourenço et al 2018 the high temperature liquid diffusion driven by the hygroscopic pvfm capillary action and the heat conduction between the fluids in contact with each other makes the temperature distribution of the porous media tend to be uniform and offset the influence of preferential flow on the temperature distribution non hygroscopic ms has a weak capillary effect and the width of the finger flow remains stable and does not spread the air gap between the finger flows in the porous media increases the thermal resistance resulting in a significantly low temperature area between the finger hovers the temperature distribution shows pronounced preferential flow finger flow characteristics 4 conclusion this work is based on the agdd desalination experiment using a combination of dye tracking and infrared imaging to discover and study the preferential flow phenomenon in highly saturated and super hydrophilic porous media furthermore the influence of preferential flow on the desalination evaporation efficiency of agdd are discussed by taking the surface temperature of porous media as the research object the following conclusions were drawn from this study point source infiltration experiments found that the sensitivity of pvfm to saturation lags behind and preferential flow reappeared in pvfm at high saturation it was consistent with the highly saturated agdd experimental results during the agdd desalination process a part of the high temperature liquid quickly passes along the preferential path in the porous medium this part of the high temperature liquid and the heat it contains cannot be effectively utilized by the desalination device which obviously weakens the desalination efficiency of agdd in the experiment we found that there is not only a preferential flow in the unsaturated porous medium but also found that in the saturated capillary rise zone at the bottom of the porous medium below the phreatic level the finger flow that first passes through the interface guides most of the flow to form preferential flow characteristics in the saturated porous media taking temperature as the research object we discuss the effect of preferential flow on the temperature distribution inhomogeneity to assess the degree to which it impairs desalination efficiency experiments found that with the increase of seepage depth increase of saturation the preferential flow can be divided into three stages according to the change of cv stable development stage exponential development stage high speed growth stage and the cv growth rate 0 74 2 27 10 49 respectively affected by this three stages the surface temperature of porous media also showed the same trend the surface temperature of the porous medium was much lower than the average temperature the greater the flow rate the more significant the temperature difference up to 6 c the test samples show that the preferential flow greatly influences the temperature distribution during the seepage process and the cv reaches a maximum of 65 after the temperature field becomes stabilized heat conduction and capillary action weaken the effect of preferential flow and the cv reaches a maximum of 6 increasing the temperature weakens the apparent phenomenon of preferential flow after the temperature field has stabilized increasing the temperature from 50 to 65 c reduces ar by 50 1 however the cv increased by 244 5 indicating that increasing the temperature essentially increases the preferential flow during seepage when the flow rate increased from 2 5 to 20 l h ar and cv decreased by 68 6 and 83 1 respectively under the side effect of temperature increase the impact of preferential flow can still be significantly weakened by increasing the flow rate increasing the thickness of porous media increases the probability of preferential flow in the thickness direction from 5 mm to 20 mm ar increased by 133 3 and cv increased by 124 7 increasing the hydrophilicity and hygroscopicity is also a way to weaken the preferential flow under the same conditions the ra of pvfm is 75 1 and 78 6 smaller than that of ms and pu respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

3169,air gap diffusion distillation agdd is a practical desalination technique the highly saturated super hydrophilic porous medium as its evaporation surface has a decisive influence on the desalination efficiency of agdd in experiments we found preferential flow in porous media however the preferential flow in highly saturated super hydrophilic porous media has not been studied and the effect of preferential paths on evaporation from porous media surfaces remains poorly understood the method of combining dye tracking and infrared imaging was used to visualize the process of thermal seepage in highly saturated super hydrophilic porous media under the condition of uniform and continuous liquid supply on the upper surface the preferential flow characteristics of hot stream seepage in porous media are tracked point source infiltration experiments were carried out at room temperature to compare the difference between preferential flow in super hydrophilic porous media and general soil sand the experimental results of thermal seepage showed that the preferential flow greatly influences the uneven temperature distribution of the porous media which directly impairs the desalination efficiency of agdd according to the coefficient of variation cv the preferential flow development process can be divided into three stages stable development exponential development and high speed growth as the seepage flow is stabilized the influence of preferential flow on the flow field and temperature field still exists and is affected by these three stages preferential flow characteristics were also captured in the saturated capillary rise zone at the bottom of the porous medium below the phreatic level the point source infiltration experiment found that the preferential flow in superhydrophilic porous medium will reappear at high saturation which is completely different from the soil sand studied by previous studies in addition the effects of inlet temperature flow rate thickness and hydrophilic hygroscopicity on preferential flow were discussed increasing the flow rate and inlet temperature and reducing the thickness of the porous media can weaken the influence of preferential flow on the temperature field but increasing the temperature only superficially weakens the preferential flow increasing hydrophilicity and hygroscopicity can also reduce the preferential flow keywords desalination air gap diffusion distillation agdd super hydrophilic porous media highly saturated preferential flow temperature distribution data availability the data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request 1 introduction air gap diffusion distillation agdd is a desalination device designed based on air gap membrane distillation agmd xu et al 2019 unlike agmd agdd uses super hydrophilic porous media instead of a hot stream channel and a membrane for the seepage and evaporation of the salt solution fig 1 since the water vapor diffuses directly from the surface of porous media into air gap the heat and mass transfer resistance in agdd can be reduced significantly in comparison with agmd xu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 reported that the gained output ratio gor of agdd can reach 2 53 times that of agmd industrial low grade heat sources and solar energy can be used as heat sources to achieve low temperature multi effect desalination under normal pressure because of its simple structure and low cost it can also be used to solve residential water shortages in remote areas which makes it has a high application and research value in the experiment we discovered the existence of preferential flow finger flow during the seepage process of super hydrophilic porous materials owing to the presence of preferential flow the feed stream is allowed to bypass part of the porous medium kang et al 2022 nimmo 2021 the distribution of the high temperature salt solution in the porous media is not uniform and cannot be fully utilized the temperature of the evaporation surface was affected by the distribution of the salt solution in the porous media it becomes uneven and low greatly impairing the desalination evaporation efficiency of agdd which is worthy of further exploration the non uniform transport mechanism of the finger flow is caused by the instability of the seepage flow itself or the instability of the wetting front when the wetting front becomes unstable the finger is formed and moves down through the seepage zone bypassing most of the unsaturated porous media to reach the phreatic surface glass et al 1989 liyanage and juanes 2022 in an unsaturated homogeneous porous media the generation of finger flow is related to the density and viscosity of the fluid hosseinalipoor et al 2020 jin et al 2021 parameters such as the hydrophilic water repellency saturation initial water content and hydraulic conductivity of porous media affect the generation of finger flow hardie et al 2011 jiang et al 2020 kang et al 2022 wang and wallach 2021 zhao and mohanty 2019 much discussion of the porous material s wettability has focused on water repellency ganz et al 2013 leuther et al 2018 li et al 2019 mao et al 2019 mirbabaei et al 2021 ogunmokun et al 2020 wang and wallach 2021 because finger flow is not easily formed in hydrophilic porous media nimmo 2021 wei et al 2014 fingering is promoted when the medium is quite dry even relatively low water saturations lead to a compact wetting front liyanage and juanes 2022 the higher the initial water content the wider is the finger width dicarlo 2004 dicarlo et al 1999 kang et al 2022 liu et al 1994 the continuous increase of the initial water content will weaken the finger flow as well as fill the flow channel forming an unstable wetting front called richards wetting front bauters et al 2000 however previous studies have focused on soils sands rocks and snow with low initial water content and poor hydrophilicity there were few studies on preferential flow in high initial water content saturation and super hydrophilic porous media porous foam materials beven and germann 2013 guo and lin 2018 mohammed et al 2018 nimmo 2021 although there have been a lot of studies on the effect of preferential flow on evaporation these studies mainly focus on the evaporation process on the natural surface of soil or sand li et al 2017 mirbabaei et al 2021 rye and smettem 2017 shao et al 2017 sidle and bogaard 2016 sprenger et al 2016 tran et al 2019 xu et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 which is completely different from the preferential flow longitudinal section evaporation process in agdd desalination it is worth mentioning that it is not easy to find relevant research on the seepage state of preferential flow reaching below the phreatic surface and its application in the heat and mass transfer of porous media therefore exploring the preferential flow phenomenon in highly saturated super hydrophilic porous media and its impact on the desalination evaporation efficiency of agdd can fill the gap of related research and has great practical significance dye tracking is a standard method for visualizing preferential flows brilliant blue fcf is widely used in dye tracking because of its prominent visibility high water solubility low toxicity low cost and robust stability guo et al 2019 li et al 2021 wu et al 2015 however this method is challenging to both achieve standardization and attain a quantitative comparison between different experimental results allaire et al 2009 usually the dye tracking experiment of preferential flow observes the transient seepage process or the final steady state result after the quantitative tracer is added in the agdd experiment continuous addition of the tracer will cause the surface of the porous media that has been dyed by capillary action and concentration diffusion to be unable to distinguish the subsequent seepage process infrared imaging methods can be used to make up for this shortcoming and are less affected by capillary action and concentration diffusion improving the accuracy of capturing seepage processes and through the two dimensional temperature distribution the preferential flow phenomenon below the phreatic surface and after the flow field is stabilized can be continuously tracked and compared to dye tracking it is easy to achieve standardization and attain a quantitative comparison the main purpose of this study is to investigate the preferential flow phenomenon in a super hydrophilic porous media with a high initial water content saturation and the effect of preferential flow on the desalination evaporation efficiency of agdd will be discussed to achieve this goal we performed a series of visualization experiments combining dye tracing and infrared imaging methods firstly the existence of the preferential flow has been proven and the characteristics of the preferential flow and its influence on the temperature of agdd have been discussed secondly four factors that affect the preferential flow were studied because preferential flow is a ubiquitous phenomenon it is impossible to directly reflect the influence degree of preferential flow on the agdd water production rate by comparison with experiments to achieve a uniform and stable seepage in porous media therefore this study took the porous medium evaporation surface temperature as the object of discussion by discussing the influence of preferential flow on the inhoogeneity of temperature distribution the influence of preferential flow on desalination evaporation efficiency of agdd was indirectly evaluated 2 material and methods 2 1 materials the super hydrophilic porous media material used in the experiment was polyvinyl alcohol dimethyl formal pvfm and hydrophilic but non hygroscopic melamine sponges ms and hydrophobic polyurethane pu foam were used for comparison experiments a scanning electron microscope sem tescan mira3 lmh czech republic was used to characterize the sponge surface morphology a video optical contact angle measuring instrument dataphysics oca50 germany was used to measure the contact angle of the pvfm fig 2 the contact angle of pvfm and ms is 0 and the contact angle of the pu is 123 2 2 experimental system to visualize the preferential flow the cold endplate cold stream channel and condensate plate of the agdd were removed xu et al 2019 this means that only the hot side remains including the hot endplate hot stream channel plate hot stream channel and cover plate fig 3 the structural parameters of the test system are listed in table 1 as shown in fig 4 0 5 g l brilliant blue fcf solution was used as a tracer which was transported by the solution pump to the hot side of the agdd and sprayed evenly to the top of the porous media through a sprayer the flow was controlled by a valve installed in the pipeline and the electric heating container controlled the inlet temperature the thermistor evenly distributed inside the porous media was used to measure the average temperature of the porous media a flow meter was used to record the flow of the solution the camera and infrared thermal imager recorded the flow pattern and temperature change process in the seepage process respectively the tricolor card was used to correct the color of the dyed picture and the shape of the dyed picture and the infrared picture were corrected using an orthogonally placed ruler all data were recorded by the data acquisition module and later saved on a personal computer a stabilized voltage supply machine was used to provide power for the precision measuring equipment and a 24 v dc stabilized voltage supply to provide power for the data acquisition unit the specifications of the principal components and the measurement instruments are listed in table 2 we also conducted a point source infiltration experiment to explore the difference between the finger flow in super hydrophilic porous media pvfm and soil which was commonly used by researchers in the past a 53 4 cm high 20 3 cm wide and 1 cm thick porous media flow chamber was used the porous media s front rear and lower surfaces are open to prevent air entrapment in the porous media flow chamber during water flow infiltrating experiments were performed by injecting 0 5 g l brilliant blue fcf solution at a 2 ml min as a point source through a hypodermic needle near the porous media surface the supply pipe was connected to a peristaltic pump table 2 a camera was used to record the infiltration process table 2 2 3 experimental procedures at the beginning of the experiment deionized water was used as the working fluid the valve and electric heating container were adjusted to ensure that the inlet flow and temperature of the working fluid reached the specified value and the valve opening and electric heating container values were kept unchanged the water bath heating pipeline was switched to the non heated state using the same flow rate of average temperature 25 c deionized water to cool the porous media allowing the overall temperature of the porous media to decrease to the average temperature then the camera and infrared thermal imager were turned on and the data acquisition unit was prepared to collect data later the water bath heating pipeline was changed to the heating state and connected with the brilliant blue fcf solution as the working fluid to start recording the camera continuously captures the dye tracking and the infrared thermal imager takes an infrared photo every 2 s owing to the continuous supply of the brilliant blue fcf solution after the surface of the porous media is dyed completely the dye tracking method cannot distinguish the subsequent stabilization process of preferential flow in the porous media then the camera is turned off at this time the infrared thermal imager can continue to track the stable process of the preferential flow in the porous media until the surface temperature of the porous media no longer changes then the thermal infrared camera and data acquisition unit were turned off the varying ranges of the experimental parameters are shown in table 3 infiltrating experiments were carried out using porous media with five saturation of 13 5 27 4 50 7 69 7 and 89 1 respectively and different saturations were obtained by weighing infiltration was carried out for 30 min and the total water volume added to the porous medium for all runs was 60 ml the camera takes a photo every 1 min 2 4 data processing methods 2 4 1 image processing methods photoshop application was used to correct the shape and color of the dye tracking image in photoshop the dye tracking image was first denoised and then binarized with a threshold of 80 the temperature cloud images were drawn based on infrared data in the origin the seepage and temperature front positions were also obtained using photoshop 2 4 2 coefficient of variation the coefficient of variation cv was used to evaluate the degree of development of the preferential flow and is defined as 1 c v 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 2 x where n is the number of samples when discussing the cv of the temperature front and the seepage front in the seepage process x i is the relative depth m of the i th sample point on the front and denoted as x i y i y min where y i is the depth m of this sample point and y min is the minimum depth m of the front sample point when discussing the cv of the temperature distribution after the temperature field is stabilized x i is the relative temperature of the i th sample point on the sectional line parallel to the x axis denoted as x i t i t min where t i is the temperature of this sample point and t min is the minimum temperature on the sectional line and x i is defined as 2 x i 1 n x i n 2 4 3 average range it is well known that except for porous media materials and liquid properties the surface evaporation efficiency of the porous medium under normal pressure is mainly related to the temperature attari moghaddam et al 2017 cabrera et al 2020 odagiri et al 2021 xu et al 2019 in the ideal state without preferential flow the temperature at any level in the agdd porous medium is uniformly distributed however this situation cannot be achieved experimentally therefore we use the average range ar to evaluate the degree of dispersion of the experimental temperature relative to the ideal state compared with cv ar can more intuitively represent the degree of temperature distribution non uniformity on the surface of porous media caused by preferential flow which is defined as 3 a r y 0 0 5 t max t min n where t max and t min are the maximum and minimum temperatures on any horizontal line of the porous medium surface n is the number of samples take 200 temperature lines at equal distances from 0 to 0 5 m on the surface of the porous medium 3 results and discussion 3 1 preferential flow characteristics of seepage and temperature through experiments we found that the preferential flow of the highly saturated and super hydrophilic porous media still exists under the condition of a continuous liquid supply and found the influence of preferential flow on the temperature distribution 3 1 1 verify the existence of the preferential flow water seepage in unsaturated porous media usually leads to preferential flow gravity fingering which is a hydrodynamic instability driven by gravity in seepage experiments on dry porous sand or soil the tracer flow rate is generally low and as the depth of infiltration increases there will be apparent fingers grant et al 2019 mallet et al 2020 tang et al 2020 experiments have found that the seepage and displacement of the solution at a high initial water content saturation and super hydrophilic porous media will also be affected by the preferential flow and the influence of the preferential flow on the flow field still exists after the flow field is stabilized in the agdd experiment the initial water content of the porous media is significant and the feed flow is large which makes the fingers wider and forms a richards wetting front bauters et al 2000 in contrast the concentration diffusion of the tracer and the dispersion of capillary force are very significant in super hydrophilic porous media with large porosity and it is challenging to form fingers fig 4 a shows that the binary image is the seepage process obtained using the dye tracking method left 60 294 s the image processing method is shown in section 2 4 1 the temperature cloud image is the seepage process brought by infrared imaging technology right 60 294 s 428 972 s it can be seen that the seepage process received by the dye tracking method does not form apparent fingers but forms an unstable richards wetting front however the existence of fingers can be observed in the temperature cloud chart the concentration diffusion of the tracer in the hydrophilic porous media leads to a weakening of the preferential flow characteristics shown by the dye tracking results comparing the development speed of the fronts in the binary and the temperature cloud image it can be seen that the development of the seepage fronts tracked by the tracer is ahead of the temperature fronts and their distance gradually increases with time at 294 s the seepage front touched the bottom at 428 s the temperature front touched the bottom and the temperature distribution did not stabilize until 972 s when the high temperature stream in the highly saturated porous media displaces the low temperature stream the temperature front will be weakened correspondingly owing to the influence of convection and heat conduction the concentration diffusion also causes the observed dyeing front to be ahead of the actual seepage front as the depth increased the saturation of the porous media increased and the influence of concentration diffusion was excellent it can be seen that the number of finger flows at different time points is unchanged and the profile of the wetting front does not change significantly this is because the continuous spray of the hot stream is equivalent to undergoing a repeated wetting process and the fingers will follow part or all of the previous flow path seep downward franklin et al 2021 wang et al 2003 and the finger flow that develops first will guide most of the flow beljadid et al 2020 cueto felgueroso and juanes 2009 therefore it is not easy to generate a new finger flow and in turn a profile of the wetting front in uniform porous media does not change significantly the depth values of the seepage front and temperature front were used to calculate the cv to evaluate the degree of development of the preferential flow during the seepage process cv is calculated as shown in section 2 4 1 fig 5 b and 4 c show the variation in cv with time and penetration depth respectively the seepage front gradually moves ahead in time and the overall temperature front cv is greater than the seepage front cv the change in the temperature front cv is affected by the seepage front cv and has the same change law as the seepage front cv this can also prove that infrared images can reflect the characteristics of seepage in porous media the shift of the cv in the process of high saturation and super hydrophilic porous media can be divided into three stages as shown in fig 5 c in the first stage at the top of the porous media the saturation of the porous media is low the preferential flow is mainly due to the instability of the wetting front caused by the displacement of low density air by high density water dicarlo 2004 and the cv increases at a steady rate the average slope is 0 74 in the second stage as the seepage depth increased the initial water content in front of the wetting front increased the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of porous media is extremely sensitive to the water content the saturation increases along the depth direction which means that the porous media have higher hydraulic conductivity and are easier to produce preferential paths nimmo 2021 chuoke et al 1959 hill and p 1952 saffman and sir geoffrey taylor 1988 given the stability criteria for the wetting front gravity driven fluid displacement the interface is stable if 3 μ 2 k 2 μ 1 k 1 v c ρ 2 ρ 1 g 0 and unstable if 4 μ 2 k 2 μ 1 k 1 v c ρ 2 ρ 1 g 0 where subscript 1 is the driving fluid subscript 2 is the driven fluid μ k ρ g are viscosity effective permeability density and gravitational acceleration and the critical velocity is defined as yadali jamaloei 2021 5 v c ρ 1 ρ 2 g μ 2 k 2 μ 1 k 1 when high temperature water displaces low temperature water and air it can be considered that the upper and lower of the interface are two fluids with different physical properties as the seepage velocity increases if the average velocity of the seepage front is more significant than a specific critical value the flow will also become unstable diment et al 1982 singh et al 2022 therefore the cv increased exponentially at this stage the average slope reaches 2 27 in the third stage the seepage front was close to the bottom of the porous media owing to the capillary rise of the hydrophilic porous media there will be a certain depth of saturation zone at the bottom of the porous media due to the phenomenon of saturation overshoot the finger flow has a saturated or nearly so tip in a uniform porous media driven by gravity dicarlo 2004 šír et al 2020 when the saturated finger flow tip hits the saturated porous media interface the gravity driven seepage flow is hindered however the development of the preferential flow is also temporarily hindered which is manifested by a period of fluctuation in cv owing to the continuous liquid supply the saturation height of the porous media exceeds the dynamic capillary rise height and the cold stream is discharged from the bottom of the porous media to realize the displacement of the cold stream by the hot stream the saturated area had a higher hydraulic conductivity and the seepage velocity increased rapidly after the seepage front passed the short term obstruction of the saturated interface the finger flow tip which first passed the interface grew the fastest and led most of the traffic this phenomenon is a winner take all process beljadid et al 2020 liyanage and juanes 2022 the development degree of preferential flow at this stage increases rapidly manifesting as an almost linear increase in cv average slope up to 10 49 the position of the interface between the first and second stages is related to the solution flow rate initial saturation the higher the initial saturation the shorter is the first stage and the interface moves upward in the direction of decreasing depth the position of the interface between the second and third stages is related to the properties of the porous material the greater the capillary rise height the longer is the third stage and the interface moves upward consequently the direction of decreasing depth after the temperature field was stabilized the temperature data at the same depth were used to calculate the cv to evaluate the effect of preferential flow on the temperature distribution of the porous media after stabilization as shown in fig 5 d the influence of preferential flow after stabilization can also be divided into three stages the saturation of the first stage was low and the third stage was fully saturated as the respective hydraulic conductivity in the two regions remains unchanged the development degree of the preferential flow also tends to stabilize after the flow field stabilizes hence cv fluctuated within the interval in the second stage the saturation of the porous media in the area has a slow increasing trend and the hydraulic conductivity increases with depth enhancing the intensity of the preferential flow with depth in the steady state the thermal conductivity of the porous media framework and the liquid will greatly weaken the intensity of the preferential flow after stabilization therefore the cv the maximum is approximately 6 after stabilization is smaller than the cv the maximum is approximately 65 of the initial seepage process 3 1 2 preferential flow characteristics in super hydrophilic porous media two representative studies were selected to compare the preferential flow in porous media with different properties and the experimental conditions are shown in table 4 the volume shrinkage of pvfm in the dry state is severe and the liquid cannot pass smoothly in the case of ensuring that the pvfm does not shrink a set of minimum saturation 13 5 was compared with the experiments of bauters et al 2000 the location of the seepage front is obtained as shown in section 2 4 1 it can be seen that under the same saturation 13 5 pvfm has obvious preferential flow characteristics and the finger width is only 2 94 cm fig 6 a while the fingers in the quartz sand have filled the whole chamber fig 6k and the actual finger width is at least 10 2 times that of pvfm but the wetting front speed of pvfm is only 1 3 times that of quartz sand fig 7 it is different from the previous conclusion that finger flow is not easily generated in hydrophilic porous media nimmo 2021 but as the saturation increases 13 5 69 7 the finger width in pvfm increases 2 94 13 6 cm fig 6a d showing the same trend as in quartz sand fig 6f k it indicated that the sensitivity of pvfm to saturation is hysteretic which is related to its larger porosity pore size and permeability however when the saturation reached 89 1 the preferential flow appeared again in the pvfm and the wetting front velocity also showed an upward trend which was 43 5 higher than when the saturation was 69 7 fig 7 this is completely different from the development trend of preferential flow in ordinary sand and soil it is such a characteristic that preferential flow can also occur in the process of high saturation agdd desalination the shape of the initial wetting front of pvfm fig 6a e was similar to that of wettable sandy soil fig 6l wallach 2010 the matrix potential of the hydrophilic porous medium drives the liquid to diffuse to the surroundings along the point source while the water repellent porous medium exhibits obvious gravity flow fig 6m n 3 1 3 preferential flow affects temperature distribution characteristics as the temperature distribution became stable we compared the surface temperature ts of the porous media recorded by infrared imaging with the average temperature ta of the porous media recorded by the thermistor as shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the temperature distribution law after stabilization is still affected by the three stages of preferential flow when the flow rate is low 2 5 5 10 l h the distinction between the first and second stages is obvious and the depth is approximately 0 1 m at this time owing to the low saturation in the first stage the speed of the hot fluid displacing the air is relatively large finger flow develops fast beljadid et al 2020 and the high temperature evaporation is extensive therefore both the temperature reduction rate maximum 20 7 and the temperature difference maximum 3 1 c between ta and ts are significant because the flow rate is too low the high temperature fluid cannot effectively displace the low temperature fluid and the preferential flow expressed by temperature has a high degree of development the temperature distribution of the porous media is uneven the ts fluctuates severely and the performance in the second stage is not apparent the distinction between the first and second stages is no longer evident when the flow rate is significant 15 and 20 l h approximately between 0 and 0 28 m in depth as the initial saturation of the porous media increases there is no longer a clear boundary between the low saturation area on the top of the porous media and the saturation gradually increases the area at the middle of the porous media then the seepage becomes continuous the initial decrease rate of ts was significant but the decrease rate gradually slowed as the seepage depth increased this is because evaporation heat conduction and convection heat dissipation and the continuous development of preferential flow make it difficult to maintain the surface temperature of the porous media it can also be found that the second stage of the porous media represented by ta ends at a depth of approximately 0 4 m as the depth of seepage increased the degree of preferential flow gradually increased and part of the high temperature fluid seeps down along the preferential path inside the porous media kang et al 2022 it does not play an influential role in maintaining the surface temperature of the porous media leading to the advancement of the ts change position approximately at a depth of 0 3 m when the flow rate is relatively large 10 15 20 l h the effect of the third stage of seepage flow is more prominent when the seepage front touches the saturated capillary rise area of the porous media the high temperature liquid flowed out from the bottom of the porous media quickly along the preferential path the capillary action in the saturated porous media is restricted the surface temperature of the porous media is tough to maintain consequently ts decreases rapidly and the maximum temperature difference between ta and ts is approximately 6 c when the flow rate was low 2 5 5 the heat dissipation in the seepage process was relatively large so the difference between ta and ts in the third stage was not apparent 0 3 2 6 c 3 2 factors affecting the preferential flow the operating parameters structural parameters and physical property parameters affect the preferential flow in porous media the temperature distribution on the surface of the porous media after the temperature field was stabilized to judge the development degree of preferential flow under different parameters in porous media the image processing method is shown in section 2 4 1 the temperature scale units of the temperature legend were all degrees celsius c use the depth value at the time when the temperature front touched the bottom to calculate the coefficient of variation cv section 2 4 2 and use the temperature distribution after the temperature field is stabilized to calculate the average range ar section 2 4 3 and then make histograms to quantify the degree of influence of each parameter on the preferential flow 3 2 1 stream temperature fig 9 shows the effect of thin on the surface temperature distribution preferential flow of the porous media it can be seen that when thin is low 50 55 c a preferential flow of temperature distribution appears even at high flow rates in fig 9 a and b the presence of fingers can be seen with the increase in thin 60 65 c the high temperature zone shifts downwards the finger shape of the temperature field becomes inconspicuous which eventually disappears fig 9a b when thin is low the temperature difference between the upper and lower sides of the porous media surface is significant and thermal diffusion and heat conduction cannot significantly increase the temperature around the finger the surface temperature distribution clearly shows the finger flow from the upper high temperature to the lower low temperature in addition low temperature reduces the hydraulic conductivity of porous media gharabaghi et al 2015 park et al 2021 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the seepage front that is close to saturation cannot pass through the bottom of the highly saturated porous medium in time and part of the high temperature liquid is forced to flow down from the surface of the porous medium forming new fingers in the form of surface temperature which we call saturated overshoot finger to distinguish it from the gravity finger fig 9a 0 3 m b 0 35 m when thin is taller the temperature difference above and below the porous media surface decreases heat diffusion and heat conduction raise the temperature of the area around the finger and the finger disappears in the temperature field fig 9c d at the same time the high temperature increases the hydraulic conductivity and weakens the saturated overshoot finger therefore increasing thin eliminates the effect of preferential flow in the apparent phenomenon and can improve the evaporation efficiency of the porous media surface however it cannot essentially eradicate preferential flow this view can also be verified from the change of cv as the inlet temperature increases 50 65 c cv increased by 244 5 fig 9e in the process of thermal seepage flow the influence of flow pattern on temperature distribution is dominant and the influence of heat diffusion and heat conduction on the temperature front is small as the inlet temperature increases the viscosity of the thermal fluid decreases and the interface is more likely to be unstable when the viscosity of the driving fluid is small hosseinalipoor et al 2020 kalde et al 2022 therefore preferential flow is more likely to occur when the inlet temperature is high and the cv is greater this is just the opposite of the change rule of the preferential flow degree of uneven temperature distribution in a steady state where increasing the temperature from 50 to 65 c reduces ar by 50 1 fig 9e 3 2 2 streamflow rate fig 10 shows the influence of qm on the surface temperature distribution preferential flow of the porous media it can be seen that the temperature distribution on the surface of the porous media under a small qm 2 5 l h shows an apparent preferential flow gravity fingering effect fig 10a the cv reached 41 3 and the ar reached 14 c when the temperature front touched the bottom fig 10d many finger like flows can also be observed in the initial stage of seepage at the top of the porous media 0 0 2 m in the lower half 0 2 0 5 m the fingers have entirely merged forming richards wetting front this phenomenon is a winner take all process where the fastest growing finger on the left guides most of the flow thereby inhibiting the growth of the other fingers on the right beljadid et al 2020 liyanage and juanes 2022 the preferential flow causes a significant temperature difference on the surface of the porous media and there is a large area of low temperature which is not conducive to evaporation with an increase in qm 10 l h the fingers develop into richards wetting front as the temperature difference in the x axis direction horizontal direction of the porous media surface decreases ar 6 3 c fig 10d the low temperature area decreases accordingly fig 10b when qm increases again 20 l h the richards wetting front is no longer evident and the temperature front tends to develop parallel to the x axis fig 10c at this time the ar is only 4 4 c and when the temperature front touched the bottom the cv is only 7 fig 10d compared to 2 5 l h ar is reduced by 68 6 and cv is reduced by 83 1 and the high temperature area on the surface of the porous media was the largest from the above increasing qm can weaken the preferential flow however with the increase of qm the surface temperature of the porous medium also increases from section 3 2 1 it can be known that increasing the temperature will also weaken the influence of the preferential flow in the apparent phenomenon ar so it is difficult to judge the contribution of qm and temperature to weakening the preferential flow through the cloud map ar however we note that elevated temperature can substantially enhance preferential flow increase cv during percolation section 3 2 1 fig 9e increasing the qm can still reduce the cv fig 10d under the side effect of the temperature increase preferential flow therefore it can be predicted that increasing the qm can attenuate the preferential flow to a greater extent when the temperature effect is excluded therefore it can be found that the increase of qm can effectively eliminate the negative effect of gravity fingering on the evaporation of porous media surfaces 3 2 3 porous media thickness fig 11 shows the effect of d on the surface temperature distribution preferential flow of the porous media it can be seen from fig 11 a that the porous media with low thickness 5 mm can easily form a stable seepage front the temperature difference in the horizontal direction x axis direction is minor ar is only 3 6 c and the overall surface temperature is higher cv is 8 5 fig 11d as the thickness of the porous media increases 10 mm the shape of the seepage front becomes sharp the temperature difference in the x axis direction increases and the richards wetting front appears fig 11b bauters et al 2000 ar increased to 6 3 c and cv increased to 17 fig 11d as shown in fig 11 c the thickness of the porous media continues to increase 20 mm at the top of the porous media about 0 0 03 m a short seepage front can be seen owing to the uniform spray of the inlet fluid which disappears as the seepage depth increases subsequently the high temperature liquid flowed downward along the preferential path inside the porous media resulting in a lower temperature on the surface of the porous media as a whole affected by heat conduction and capillary action an irregular high temperature zone appears on the outer surface of the preferential path the temperature on the surface of the porous media exhibited an unstable distribution ar reached 8 4 c as the seepage depth increased the saturation of the porous media increased the preferential seepage front was blocked at the upper interface of the second and third stages about 0 35 m and diffused along the x axis direction the width of the high temperature zone on the surface of the porous media increased consequently there is a saturated capillary rising zone at the bottom of the porous media usevičiūtė and baltrėnaitė gedienė 2022 and the hot stream flowed out quickly along the preferential path at the bottom of the porous media the hot fluid displaces only the liquid on the preferential path inside the porous media so there is a large area of low temperature because the porous media is saturated the capillary action is suppressed adegbule and kibbey 2020 the heat inside the porous media can only be transferred to the surface through the heat conduction of the porous material and the external low temperature liquid therefore an elliptical high temperature zone that spreads outward along the central area of the preferential path appears on the surface of the porous media the phenomenon of discontinuity in the high temperature zone at the bottom of the porous media was also observed increasing d increases the probability of preferential flow in the thickness direction of the porous medium from 5 mm to 20 mm ar increased by 133 3 and cv increased by 124 7 this makes a large part of the high temperature liquid not utilized by the evaporation surface which greatly weakens the desalination efficiency of agdd 3 2 4 porous media hydrophilicity fig 12 represents the seepage surface temperature distribution preferential flow of the three porous materials with different properties it can be seen that under the same working conditions the temperature distribution of pvfm with super hydrophilicity and hygroscopicity hardly shows the influence of preferential flow fig 12a the temperature distribution of ms which is hydrophilic but not hygroscopic shows a clear preferential flow finger flow fig 12b ogunmokun et al 2020 the non hydrophilic pu temperature distribution also shows preferential flow finger flow fig 12c and the surface temperature was significantly lower than that of other materials the cv of ms and pu reached 65 7 and 73 7 while the cv of pvfm was only 7 as the temperature field was stabilized the gap of preferential flow reflected by ar was still huge and the preferential flow development degree of pvfm is only 24 9 and 21 8 of ms and pu hydrophilicity provides a good passage of high temperature liquid in porous media so that the entire porous media maintains a higher temperature in a non hydrophilic pu gravity alone makes it challenging for the liquid to pass through and cannot maintain the surface temperature lourenço et al 2018 the high temperature liquid diffusion driven by the hygroscopic pvfm capillary action and the heat conduction between the fluids in contact with each other makes the temperature distribution of the porous media tend to be uniform and offset the influence of preferential flow on the temperature distribution non hygroscopic ms has a weak capillary effect and the width of the finger flow remains stable and does not spread the air gap between the finger flows in the porous media increases the thermal resistance resulting in a significantly low temperature area between the finger hovers the temperature distribution shows pronounced preferential flow finger flow characteristics 4 conclusion this work is based on the agdd desalination experiment using a combination of dye tracking and infrared imaging to discover and study the preferential flow phenomenon in highly saturated and super hydrophilic porous media furthermore the influence of preferential flow on the desalination evaporation efficiency of agdd are discussed by taking the surface temperature of porous media as the research object the following conclusions were drawn from this study point source infiltration experiments found that the sensitivity of pvfm to saturation lags behind and preferential flow reappeared in pvfm at high saturation it was consistent with the highly saturated agdd experimental results during the agdd desalination process a part of the high temperature liquid quickly passes along the preferential path in the porous medium this part of the high temperature liquid and the heat it contains cannot be effectively utilized by the desalination device which obviously weakens the desalination efficiency of agdd in the experiment we found that there is not only a preferential flow in the unsaturated porous medium but also found that in the saturated capillary rise zone at the bottom of the porous medium below the phreatic level the finger flow that first passes through the interface guides most of the flow to form preferential flow characteristics in the saturated porous media taking temperature as the research object we discuss the effect of preferential flow on the temperature distribution inhomogeneity to assess the degree to which it impairs desalination efficiency experiments found that with the increase of seepage depth increase of saturation the preferential flow can be divided into three stages according to the change of cv stable development stage exponential development stage high speed growth stage and the cv growth rate 0 74 2 27 10 49 respectively affected by this three stages the surface temperature of porous media also showed the same trend the surface temperature of the porous medium was much lower than the average temperature the greater the flow rate the more significant the temperature difference up to 6 c the test samples show that the preferential flow greatly influences the temperature distribution during the seepage process and the cv reaches a maximum of 65 after the temperature field becomes stabilized heat conduction and capillary action weaken the effect of preferential flow and the cv reaches a maximum of 6 increasing the temperature weakens the apparent phenomenon of preferential flow after the temperature field has stabilized increasing the temperature from 50 to 65 c reduces ar by 50 1 however the cv increased by 244 5 indicating that increasing the temperature essentially increases the preferential flow during seepage when the flow rate increased from 2 5 to 20 l h ar and cv decreased by 68 6 and 83 1 respectively under the side effect of temperature increase the impact of preferential flow can still be significantly weakened by increasing the flow rate increasing the thickness of porous media increases the probability of preferential flow in the thickness direction from 5 mm to 20 mm ar increased by 133 3 and cv increased by 124 7 increasing the hydrophilicity and hygroscopicity is also a way to weaken the preferential flow under the same conditions the ra of pvfm is 75 1 and 78 6 smaller than that of ms and pu respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
