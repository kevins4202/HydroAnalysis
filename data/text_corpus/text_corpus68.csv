340,riffle pool sequences are fundamental ubiquitous morphological features of alluvial rivers that are thoroughly studied in general and commonly incorporated into river restoration projects most previous investigations on the effect of riffle pool sequences on hyporheic exchanges focused on solely bed undulation because that is widely thought to be the defining feature of riffle pool sequences however riffle pool sequences also have significant width undulations that are vital to riffle pool sequences morphodynamics yet relatively few studies exist on the effect of such undulations on hyporheic exchanges thus in this study based on laboratory experiments and numerical simulations we investigate the effect of bed and width undulations on hyporheic zone characteristics for various ratio of width amplitude to bed amplitude the variation of hyporheic exchange characteristics i e hyporheic exchange flux and residence time for different riffle pool designs were also assessed by creating prescribed topography of synthetic river valleys the results showed that due to pressure variation along width undulations the upwelling and downwelling patterns can also be observed for only width undulations in rivers in the absence of bed undulations and as width undulation amplitude decreases the normalized hyporheic exchanges q hz increase and normalized median residence time rt decreases also simultaneous channel bed and width undulations result in higher q hz especially when a pool is located in an expansion aka oversized cross section and a riffle in a constriction nozzle our results suggest that river restoration project that artificially construct wide pools and constricted riffles will achieve maximum q hz and rt though they will not be geomorphically self sustainable keywords bed undulation width undulation hyporheic exchanges residence time 1 introduction multiple definitions for hyporheic zone hz have been proposed reflecting different purposes of previous studies ward 2016 in this study hz is defined as a saturated area beneath and adjacent to a river in which water can transfer into the riverbed to become subsurface flow and then return above the riverbed to be surface flow this process of movement in and out of the bed is named hyporheic exchange he tonina and buffington 2011 when stream water flows into the subsurface oxygen and nutrients transfer benefiting many biogeochemical ecological and biological processes battin et al 2008 bencala 2000 boulton et al 1998 zheng et al 2019 tonina and buffington 2009 expressed a mechanism for he based on three dominating drivers spatial changes of energy head gradient cross sectional area of alluvium and hydraulic conductivity there is a clear mechanistic chain of cause and effect between local fluvial topography he and ecological functionality in this study we focused on the effect of spatial changes in the energy head gradient due to coherently varying river topography river morphology commonly quantified with planform cross section and longitudinal profile metrics represents a primary control on he by affecting pressure amplitude variation river bed and width undulations make the channel and flow non uniform and cause spatial changes of acceleration and hydraulic gradient along the rivers the following sections present a literature for the impact of river morphology on he and the objectives of this study 1 1 effects of bed undulations previous studies show that the main driver of he is the pressure gradient along geomorphic features like bars dunes and riffle pool rp sequence buffington and tonina 2009 fehlman 1985 thibodeaux and boyle 1987 tonina and buffington 2009 trauth et al 2015 the upwelling and downwelling fluxes in hz induced by pressure gradients along rp sequences will improve river habitat gariglio et al 2013 and stimulate the denitrification process trauth et al 2014 they are also common features of river restoration projects emery et al 2003 schwartz and herricks 2007 schwartz et al 2015 sear and newson 2004 whiteway et al 2010 and therefore considered as the main focus of this study few laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have investigated he in rp morphologies tonina and buffington 2007 studied he in rp channels with alternate bars through laboratory experiments and numerical simulations the effects of flow discharge and bed form amplitude on hz characteristics were investigated by injection of fluorescein as a tracer to determine solute exchange between surface and subsurface flow their results showed that not only the bed form amplitude but also the interaction between bed form and discharge can drive he trauth et al 2013 investigated the effect of stream discharge and ambient groundwater on hz characteristics for rp sequences with various amplitudes their numerical simulation results showed that he increased with stream discharge and mean residence time decreased also by increasing the rp amplitude the he increased and residence time decreased also zhou and endreny 2013 investigated the effect of restoration structures on hyporheic exchanges rate and hyporheic penetration depth along sequences of rp the results of flume experiments and numerical simulations in their study showed that restoration structures increased the hyporheic exchanges and decreased the penetration depth 1 2 effects of width undulations similar to bedforms river irregular planform geometry also leads to formation of hyporheic zones along river banks cardenas 2009b flow convergence and divergence along channel width undulations affect pressure gradients and as a result drive he cardenas 2009a through 2d numerical simulations investigated the hyporheic fluxes along sinusoidal channel banks his results showed that lateral hyporheic fluxes increased by sinuosity where the stream has no net flux of water neutral conditions however the impact of both channel flow and sinusoidal banks on hes which lead to the formation of both horizontal and vertical fluxes was not considered in his study the effect of meander planform on hes has been studied by many balbarini et al 2017 boano et al 2006 gomez velez et al 2017 han and endreny 2014 pescimoro et al 2019 peterson and sickbert 2006 revelli et al 2008 stonedahl 2011 but these studies all assume a constant channel width 1 3 coherent bed and width undulations channel width undulations affect bed topography of many gravel bed rivers jacobson and gran 1999 literature shows that width undulations can create pools in width constrictions and riffles in width expansions bittner 1994 buckrell 2017 de almeida and rodríguez 2012 nelson et al 2015 repetto et al 2002 richards 1976a white et al 2010 wu and yeh 2005 in natural systems the locations of riffles and pools are frequently linked to planform geometry or the spatial pattern of river corridor morphology many river rehabilitation projects aim to re establish natural pool riffle sequences brown et al 2016 lane et al 2018 however there are disagreements in the literature on the morphodynamic processes that shape them and resultantly there is no widely adapted standardized systems approach for their design brown and pasternack 2019 wade et al 2002 to increase river channel stability and quality of aquatic habitat pool riffle sequences are being artificially constructed so considering form process interactions during restoration projects is vital schwindt et al 2020 during in channel discharges near bed velocity and shear stress are lower in pools than riffles but during floods usually 1 2 times bankfull discharge the location of peak velocity reverses such that near bed velocity and shear stresses are higher in the pool than over riffle de almeida and rodríguez 2011 pasternack et al 2008 it must be noted that the reversal phenomena can also occur during within bank flooding where there is sufficient shear force to effect the reversal pool aggradation and riffle erosion or just riffle armoring during low discharge and pool scour and riffle aggradation at high discharge in gravel bed systems yields a morphodynamic mechanisms responsible for the self maintenance of pools and riffles de almeida and rodríguez 2011 pasternack et al 2018b strom et al 2016 considering that riffles generally are shallower and pools deeper higher mean velocities in a pool are only possible in situations where the shape of the pool s cross section is more constricted than that of the riffle pasternack et al 2018a however this is often not minded in actual engineering construction practice during engineered channelization pool riffle structure is often modified with excavators these machines usually site on the bank adjacent to the pool and need to pull the bucket perpendicular to the channel to dig the pool this strategy often yields a wider deeper pool than suitable to have a velocity reversal the problem could be resolved if project designers and construction crews were mindful of the simple caamaño criterion caamaño et al 2009 provided a simplified one dimensional criterion in which velocity reversal occurrence is a function of residual pool depth the ratio of riffle to pool depth and the flow depth over a riffle and concluded that reversal are less likely in deeper pools so the question is that how the location of rp against channel width undulations can affect he 1 4 study objectives as mentioned many studies only characterized he processes at rp sequences due to bed undulations and little is known about effect of width undulation on hz characteristics also to our knowledge no study has yet considered the effect of relative width of pools and riffles some rivers meander over long distances with a constant width but many rivers do have regular width undulations and they are phased coherently with bed undulations so building on the first goal of the study to assess width undulations in isolation the second goal of our study was to investigate the simultaneous effect of channel bed and width undulations on hz characteristics for the second goal two scenarios were studied in order to investigate the interaction of rp location and width undulations in the first scenario the pool was deep but constricted and then riffle was shallow but wide and in the second scenario the pool was both deep and wide i e oversized while the riffle was narrow and shallow i e nozzle these alternatives have been thoroughly studied for their geomorphic effects brown et al 2016 jackson et al 2015 pasternack et al 2018a b but not for their hz characteristics so in order to generalize results for large scale cases the configurations studied by brown et al 2016 for investigating bed shear stress along the sequences of expansion constriction widths with riffle pool sequences and also with flat bed were examined numerically in general the following questions are addressed in this study how hz characteristics will be affected by only width undulations amplitude δwu how hz characteristics will be affected by width undulations amplitude δwu for a given bed undulations amplitude δbu how hz characteristics will be affected by relative location of rp over width undulations does the above results can also be found in large scale case for the above goals a series of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were performed to characterize he processes due to width undulations and also bed undulations with considering synchronous width undulations for each case the hydraulic heads along sediment water interface swi were coupled with a groundwater model and then a particle tracking method was used to derive hz characteristics i e hyporheic exchanges flow qhz residence time rt and hyporheic depth dhz the novelty of this study is that it provides the first assessment of investigating synchronous bed and width undulations in gravel bed rivers with rp morphology which is a hotspot for microorganism living in hz and widely constructed in river restoration projects 2 experimental design in order to meet study goals a combination of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were performed with various ratios for amplitude of channel width and bed undulations in the following sections after introducing the effective parameters within dimensional analysis the laboratory experiments and numerical simulations will be explained in detail 2 1 dimensional analysis generally hyporheic zone characteristics including hyporheic exchanges flow qhz residence time rt and hyporheic exchange depth dhz can be express as a function of the following parameters 1 q hz rt d hz f v h k d 50 n ρ μ λ δ b u δ w u a s

v h μ δ w u δ b u 0 2 2 laboratory experiments experiments were conducted in a straight recirculating flume 12 m long 1 m wide and 1 m deep the flow was supplied in the flume by a centrifugal pump and the discharge was measured with an ultrasonic flow meter the sediment bed was a mixture of gravels and sands with a median diameter of 6 8 mm a geometric standard deviation of σ g d 84 d 16 1 5 a porosity of 0 34 the water and sediment elevations were measured by a digital point gage resolution 0 1 mm the velocity measurement was done by micro propeller the following sections introduce the geometry of laboratory models 2 2 1 width undulations the first part of laboratory experiments was conducted to investigate the effect of width undulations on hz characteristics hereinafter the expansion constriction scenarios without bed forms are named ec scenarios five sequences of sinusoidal width undulations were created by polystyrene sheets fig 1 a cut with a hotwire system based on the following equation 4 y x δ w u 2 sin λ x where x and y are distance along flume length and width respectively the wavelength and amplitude were one meter and 0 125 m respectively for these laboratory experiments which lead to the ratio of constriction width to expansion width equal to the 0 7 this ratio is consistent with the natural conditions of rivers with a riffle pool morphology bayat et al 2017 nelson et al 2015 wu and yeh 2005 2 2 2 bed and width undulations to assess the simultaneous effect of channel bed and width undulations on hz characteristics rp sequences were constructed in two scenarios for one scenario pools were located in narrower constricted areas and riffle in wider expansion areas which hereafter named as pool constriction riffle expansion pcre scenarios for the vice versa phasing of width and bed undulations the name used was pool expansion riffle constriction perc rps were shaped by means of wooden rib in the expansion constriction channel according to the following equation 5 z x δ b u 2 sin λ x where x and z are distance along flume width and depth respectively the wavelength of rp sequences was equal to 1 m and the bed amplitude was 0 068 m selection of wavelength value was based on the montgomery et al 1995 results for channel width formed in rivers with large wood also bed form amplitude was chosen to yield a ratio of bed form amplitude to wavelength set within the range of values observed for natural rp systems buffington and montgomery 1999 the wavelength of both bed and width undulations was 1 m the bed and width amplitudes were 0 068 m and 0 125 m respectively which led to the δwu δbu 1 84 table 1 fig 1b shows the bed and width undulations formed in the channel for pcre scenario 2 2 3 experimental procedure after construction of each model the water was supplied through the flume by a centrifugal pump the downstream gate was held up in order to completely saturate the sediments then the discharge was increased to the desired value and the downstream gate completely lowered to create the underflow conditions as this study aims to quantify how the channel and flow no uniformity affects the hyporheic exchanges characteristics the following assumptions and limitations are used in this study 1 the flow is steady state and the approach flow is clear and does not contain sediment 2 the channel banks are assumed to be non erodible to avoid the effect of inter meander he on the results the flow depths and velocities were measured for all scenarios the reference level for measuring flow depth and flow velocity was the mean bed amplitude the monitoring section was located at the middle bed or width undulations which water surface elevations were measured every 5 cm along flume length and every 10 cm along flume width also the streamwise velocities u were measured at five cross sections it should be noted in order to observe hyporheic paths against the flume glass wall through the width undulation scenarios only half of the width undulations were constructed in the laboratory fig 1 surface subsurface exchange was visualized by injecting dye in different positions into the sediments and drawing the penetration paths on the flume glass wall through the time 2 3 numerical models two sets of numerical simulations were performed first numerical simulations were done for laboratory experiments with careful measurements enabling model validation for free surface and subsurface flow table 1 then after assessing the accuracy of the simulation model additional numerical models were performed with different ratios of width amplitude to bed amplitude i e δwu δbu 0 88 1 32 and 2 5 for all ec pcre and perc scenarios as well as the rp case with only bed undulation the combination of experimental results and numerical simulations provides valuable insight into hyporheic phenomena second numerical simulations were done to compare results to field scale cases for this purpose the study used the systematically varied configurations developed by brown et al 2016 for studying the effects of bed and width undulations on bed shear stress along rp sequences i e s2 s3 s4 and s5 in table 1 and fig 2 these were built using the synthetic river valley srv concept and software of brown et al 2014 based on hydraulic sedimentary and geometry data the river length and width were 2358 and 70 m respectively bank and bed wavelengths were 196 m and the discharge was 125 m3 s 2 3 1 surface flow model the surface flow simulations for all scenarios were performed with open source field operation and manipulation openfoam version 2 3 0 which employs the finite volume method greenshields 2015 the two phase solver named interfoam with the large eddy simulation les method for turbulence closure was used the interfoam solver is a transient solver for incompressible flow that was used with open channel flow and free surface model farshi et al 2018 jellesma 2013 shaheed 2016 for two phase flow simulation in this solver one fluid model was used which only needs one series of equations for both phases this solver uses the volume of fluid method for determining free water surface the boundary between the water and air which depends on determining the fraction of each fluid in every cell of the computational mesh shaheed 2016 the equation of volume fraction is 6 α t α u 0 where u is velocity field and α is volume fraction of water and air the value of α is one for liquid phase zero for air phase and between zero to one for the interphase eq 6 is also named as the interphase transport equation the density of the fluid inside each cell could be determined by volume fraction which is also known as the phase fraction α shaheed 2016 7 ρ α ρ w 1 α ρ a where ρa and ρw are density of air and water respectively the constant density continuity equation and the momentum equation can be expressed as eqs 8 and 9 respectively 8 t ρ ρ u 0 u 0 9 ρ u t ρ u u p μ u t u f σ the expression u u is reynolds stress tensor in the right hand of the above equation p is pressure the second terms are turbulent and viscose stresses and the last term is the surface tension force the surface tension is modelled as continuum surface force f σ σκ σ which σ is the surface tension constant and κ the curvature and can be approximated as 10 κ α α due to this fact that the application of 3d models for field scale simulations is computationally expensive srh 2d model which solved the depth averaged st venant equations was used to simulate free surface flow characteristics for scenarios s2 s3 s4 and s5 2 3 2 subsurface flow model subsurface flow was simulated using modflow which solves the governing equations based on finite difference method mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 11 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z w s s h t where kxx kyy and kzz are hydraulic conductivity in x y and z direction respectively h represents the hydraulic head w the volumetric flux ss the specific storage of the porous media and t the time the calculations were performed in hexahedral cells and the flow into and out of each cell was calculated using darcy s equation 12 q k a l h l h 0 r where q is the volumetric fluid discharge from the neighbor into the cell k is the hydraulic conductivity in the direction of flow a1 is the area of the shared side of the cell r is the distance between the centers of the cells h1 is the hydraulic head associated with the neighboring cell and h0 is the cell in unknown head 2 3 3 boundary conditions and mesh design the upstream and downstream sides of the free surface domain boundary conditions used a spatially periodic pressure condition so that our domain approximates a repeating domain in the flow direction from upstream to downstream in this type of boundary condition information obtained from one boundary is put as a boundary condition to the related boundary and one can model a large system by simulating a small part of system the right and left faces relative to the flow direction are considered symmetry boundaries a symmetry boundary i e no flux is applied at the top face of the water column a no slip wall boundary is set at the bottom face of free surface interface for surface simulations the mesh was constructed within the blockmesh dictionary in openfoam such that the hexahedral horizontal cell size was 0 02 0 02 m2 square in the vertical direction a higher density of grid nodes was applied for cells close to the swi the number of structured grid nodes of the whole domain varied from about 330 000 to near 460 000 depending on the geometric conditions for subsurface simulations in modflow calculations were performed in hexahedral cells using more than 180 840 and 378 777 elements for laboratory experiments scenarios and s series scenarios respectively porous domain boundary conditions are represented in fig 3 the thickness of porous domain for experimental and for s scenarios was 0 34 m and 126 m respectively the sediment thickness is adequately large that it no longer has an effect on the flow field near the swi we used tonina buffington s suggestion as a first assumption and then we examined this assumption by checking the pathlines whether they reached to the bottom of the domain or not tonina and buffington 2011 suggested that depth of alluvium has a substantial effect on hyporheic flow when alluvial depth is less than a third of the bed form wavelength so this criterion was considered in selecting the thickness of the porous domain also the porosity and hydraulic conductivity were considered as 0 3 and 5 6e 4 m s respectively based on 119 reach measurements in french rivers by stewardson et al 2016 2 4 data analysis in all numerical scenarios turbulent flow characteristics in the water column were simulated by solving reynolds averaged navier stokes equations and a steady state groundwater flow model was applied for the underlying permeable sediment these two sets of equations were coupled through the hydraulic head distribution along the swi which was obtained from simulating of free surface flow this one way sequential coupling approach captures only flow from the surface water domain into the porous domain due to the fact that hyporheic flow that enters the stream channel is only a small volume fraction of the total stream discharge it has negligible impacts on hydrodynamic flow in the channel cheng and chiew 1998 prinos 1995 then the modpath particle tracking method in modflow was used to extract path lines and residence times of fluid particles in the middle topographic cycle which was far enough from the inlet and outlet so that boundary conditions could not affect results in the particle tracking results analysis only particles that entered the streambed from surface flow remained in the streambed for a while and then returned to surface flow from the streambed were considered in calculations hyporheic exchanges flow qhz and median residence time mrt are normalized by the following equations 13 q hz q hz k a s 14 r t mrt k σ λ where σλ is the arc length along the sinusoidal width cardenas 2009a which is different for each ratio of δwu δbu since the particles travel in a three dimensional space the longitudinal and lateral travel distance were calculated based on initial and final coordinate of particles in the following we first report results of numerical model validation using laboratory data for surface flow model validation the observed and simulated water surface elevations and velocity distributions were compared to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of the numerical models the efficiency of model validation the root mean square error rmse and mean percentage error mpe indexes were used 15 r m s e i 1 n o i s i 2 n 16 m p e i 1 n o i s i o i n 100 where oi si and n refer to the observed value simulated value and number of samples respectively also for validation of subsurface model the emergence locations of injected dye for laboratory and field numerical simulations were compared results are presented and discussed for four scenarios named as rp ec pcre and perc for the last three scenarios four ratios of δwu δbu were compared for hz characteristics one ratio in both laboratory and numerical experiments and three more ratios with only numerical simulations 3 results 3 1 model validation results 3 1 1 surface flow the openfoam results were verified for surface flow using the laboratory observations comparison of observed versus simulated water surface elevations and streamwise velocities showed a good agreement fig 4 the observed water surface elevations and velocities agreed well with the simulated one with the overall rmse of 0 0034 m and 0 07 m s and also mpe of 3 55 and 15 31 respectively table 2 3 1 2 subsurface flow for subsurface flow the observed pathlines due to dye injection in laboratory experiments δwu δbu 1 84 and the simulated pathlines due to particle tracking in modpath for field scale model δwu δbu 7 are presented in figs 5 7 the observed pattern of dye tracks agrees well with simulated particle tracks such that the following pattern is obtained for ec pcre and perc scenarios for the ec scenario fig 5 results showed that when dye was injected in the expansion zone with maximum width some path lines traveled upstream and some traveled downstream by injecting dye at the width inflection point downstream from the maximum width location all path lines converged through the downstream constriction however when dye was injected at the width inflection point downstream of the minimum width location path lines traveled to the upstream constriction thus in the channel with only width undulations fluid particles entered the porous bed from the wider area high pressure zone and after traveling some distance through porous media returned to free surface flow at the narrower area low pressure zone therefore fluvial hyporheic flow can be induced with only width undulations in the absence of bed undulations for the pcre scenario fig 6 when dye was injected between the pool trough and downstream riffle crest the emergence point was near the downstream riffle crest however by injecting dye between the trough and the upstream riffle crest the emergence points would be on the lee side of the upstream riffle the hyporheic flow in this scenario was driven by hydraulic gradients resulting from both bed and width undulations because the upwelling region in this scenario was observed downstream of riffle crest located in an expansion the effect of bed undulation on hyporheic flow pattern was greater than the effect of width undulation with δwu δbu 1 84 for the perc scenario fig 7 because the riffle was constricted the minimum pressure occurred on the riffle crest this led to the emergence of the dye near the riffle crest so then free surface flow entered the porous bed from the pool downwelling and returned to free surface downstream of the riffle crest upwelling also for this scenario the observed hyporheic pathlines are compared with its simulated one in fig 8 which demonstrated that the numerical model capable to trace the path line for injection points 3 2 hydraulic head distributions at swi for submerged features i e dune riffle the variation of hydraulic head at swi is a main driver of hyporheic exchanges figs 9 and 10 show the plan view of hydraulic head h distribution at swi for different ratios of δwu δbu for pcre and perc scenarios respectively the dashed and continuous lines denote the pool and riffle positions respectively for pcre scenarios by increasing δwu δbu the location of maximum hydraulic head shifted from the width constriction to the width expansion fig 9 and also the distance between maximum and minimum hydraulic head increased lateral variations in hydraulic head were observed with particularly prominent high pressure zones on the channel edge of the expansion in the pcre scenario especially for larger values of δwu δbu lateral variations in hydraulic head can produce lateral hyporheic flow when the banks are permeable for perc scenarios of maximum hydraulic head was located at upstream of the riffle and close to the undulated bank and with increasing the ratio of δwu δbu the width of high pressure zone increased because as δwu δbu increased the width of constriction decreased so the portion of the bank facing the flow increased thus acted as a barrier and led to the stronger high pressure area behind the minimum constriction width which was in line with the high pressure zone created by riffle fig 10 also as the ratio of δwu δbu increased the distance between of maximum hydraulic head and of minimum hydraulic head decreased for both perc and pcre scenarios the minimum hydraulic head was located at the riffle crest also the longitudinal distance between of maximum hydraulic head and of minimum hydraulic head was longer in pcre scenarios in comparison with perc scenarios 3 3 hyporheic exchange flow and residence time as described in section 2 4 the hyporheic exchanges and residence time are computed for the particles that enter and subsequently exit the domain only from the streambed normalized exchange q hz and normalized median residence time rt are highly sensitive to different ratios of δwu δbu figs 11 and 12 for ec scenarios as the ratio of δwu δbu increased the q hz increased and rt decreased because by decreasing the width of the minimum constriction the average velocity of flow in constriction increased for a given flow discharge by increasing δwu δbu the contribution of bank undulation on local hydraulic head gradient increased which leads to the higher q hz and lower rt when bedforms were added to width undulations for both pcre and perc scenarios in comparison to ec scenarios the normalized hyporheic exchanges increased and normalized residence time decreased for all ratios of δwu δbu in other words presence of bedforms enhanced hyporheic exchange the highest hyporheic exchange was related to the perc for which both riffle and width constriction combined to increase the velocity variation through the constriction so the hydraulic head gradients increased and q hz increased for pcre scenarios with increasing the ratio of δwu δbu the hydraulic head gradients increased so q hz increased and rt decreased also for perc scenarios with increasing this ratio hyporheic exchanges increased but for the ratio of δwu δbu 2 5 as the area which riffle pool occupied was decreased the hydraulic head gradient decreased so the q hz decreased and rt increased by comparing rp and ec scenarios it can be concluded that bed undulations rp scenario led to higher q hz except for ratio of δwu δbu 2 5 whereas bank undulations ec scenarios led to higher median residence time for all modelled channels considering the brown et al 2016 models it was discovered that by adding bed undulations to bank undulations comparing s2 s4 and s5 q hz increased and rt decreased table 3 the maximum q hz occurred when the pool was in the width expansion and riffle in the constriction which shows the similar behavior to small scale models also maximum rt was achieved for the ec scenario by adding width undulations to bed undulations comparing s3 s4 and s5 the rt increased whether the riffle was constricted and pool expanded or vice versa the q hz for rp and perc scenarios were similar which showed that for small amplitude bed form as here for large scale the simultaneous effect of bed and width undulations had no significant effect on hyporheic exchanges when pools were located in width expansions and riffles in width constrictions hyporheic exchange and residence time was much more sensitive to variations in width amplitude in the absence of bed undulations 3 4 residence time distribution histograms of residence time distributions rtd and fitted log normal curves are plotted in fig 13 for pcre and perc scenarios for pcre scenarios all ratios of δwu δbu are well distributed with a log normal distribution for all ratios of δwu δbu the skewness is positive which means the number of path lines with long residence time is low and as δwu δbu increased the distributions become close to the symmetrical for perc scenarios a bimodal distribution was observed with two peaks the fitted log normal curve also proposed by other investigations for only riffle pool sequences tonina and buffington 2007 trauth et al 2013 histograms of residence time distributions for large scale models are also log normally distributed fig 14 but they show a negative skewness which means that the number of particles with long residence time is high 3 5 traveling distance due to the hydraulic head gradients that occurred laterally across the flume path lines also deviated in lateral direction the results showed that for ec scenarios the median lateral travel distance was always less the 80 of the median longitudinal travel distance and as the constriction width decreased higher ratio of the δwu δbu the median longitudinal and median lateral travel distances decreased for pcre scenarios the hydraulic head gradient across the flume was higher than perc scenarios and lead to the longer median lateral travel distance which increased with δwu δbu but for perc scenarios the hydraulic head distribution along channel width was more uniform in comparison with pcre scenarios and led to the shorter median lateral travel distance also as δwu δbu increased the hydraulic head distribution become more uniform and lead to the shorter median lateral travel distance 3 6 hyporheic exchanges depth for pcre and perc scenarios by average 93 percent of total exchange is transported by path lines within 20 cm below the mean bed form amplitude i e 58 8 percent of subsurface layer thickness and as the ratio of δwu δbu decreased the hyporheic exchange depth increased for bed form only scenario tonina and buffington 2011 indicated that in order to make sure that the depth of sediment layer did not affect hyporheic exchanges this depth should be more than one third of the wavelength but our results showed that for both bed and bank undulation scenarios the depth of sediment layer could be less than this criterion and further experiments are warranted to define a new criterion also the maximum exchange depth for perc scenarios were less than pcre scenarios 4 discussion 4 1 non uniform channel pattern bed undulations were the focus of early geomorphic research into riffle pool morphology fig 15 a e g keller 1971

mountains due to two regimes first coarse bedload in canyon confined bedrock rivers can scour out deep wide pools between steep confined shallow units riffles rapids steps and slides second small steep tributaries to wider mountain canyons can deliver sufficient coarse sediment to constrict a canyon to a small fraction of its width perc reaches can also occur naturally in small headland meadows and lowland valley streams due to local wood and boulder obstructions and resistant hardpans forming nozzles in engineering practice the perc configuration has come to dominate in whitewater park design kolden et al 2016 and a type of channel restoration called regenerative stormwater conveyance duan et al 2019 the latter is especially intended to drive hyporheic flow potentially enhancing denitrification in streams degraded by anthropogenic high nutrient loads craig et al 2008 klocker et al 2009 merill and tonjes 2014 tuttle et al 2014 the pcre configuration with wide bar and constricted pool units is naturally widespread in partially confined to unconfined valleys with alluvial self formed channels and riverbed slopes of 0 001 to 0 02 in the absence of fixed obstructions it is thought to be self maintaining due to energy minimization flow convergence routing and grain size differentiation between units bayat et al 2017 macwilliams jr et al 2006 yang 1971 mindful design of pcre is limited as of yet but advocated by academics due to its self sustainability based on flume field and numerical modeling studies e g jackson et al 2015 repetto and tubino 2001 wheaton et al 2010 while studies have investigated hyporheic and denitrification effects in reaches with constructed riffles and pools mendoza lera and datry 2017 merill and tonjes 2014 rivers et al 2018 care has not been taken to isolate the pcre configuration overall both perc and pcre configurations are widespread in nature and increasingly used in river engineering warranting a better understanding of their hyporheic flow processes 4 2 hyporheic response to channel non uniformity in this study for the first time we present the hydraulic head distribution along systematically varying channel bed and width undulations including those linked with two different phase angles commonly observed in nature the location of maximum and minimum hydraulic head distribution depends on bed or width amplitude our results show that for ec supplementary figure 1 and perc fig 10 scenarios the pattern of hydraulic head distributions does not change a lot for various ratios of δwu δbu but for pcre scenarios the location of minimum and maximum hydraulic head change for higher ratios of δwu δbu investigation of near bed velocities at different positions of pool trough and riffle crest along channel width reveal that for ratios of δwu δbu 1 84 2 5 the near bed velocities at distances near to the sinusoidal width are higher for pool in the narrowest width than riffle in the widest width so it can be concluded that not only flow discharge mentioned by previous studies but also ratio of width undulation amplitude to bed undulation amplitude has an effect on the velocity reversal hypothesis however for perc scenarios no reversal velocity was observed because according to the energy principle in subcritical flow constricting a riffle leads to higher velocities there than ate the pool further investigations are recommended to investigate the effect of reversal velocity on hyporheic exchanges under various ratios of δwu δbu and flow conditions as mentioned in the introduction section buffington and tonina 2009 stated that one of the mechanisms causing hyporheic exchange is spatial changes in alluvial area alluvial depth or the valley width for ec scenarios we find that the path lines are downwelled in expansion areas and upwelled in constriction areas which is in line with their findings in their 2011 paper they discussed about the effect of alluvial depth on he but in this paper we investigate the effect of alluvial width ec scenarios and we find that as the alluvial width decrease higher width amplitude the q hz increase and rt decrease for pcre scenarios the q hz increased with δwu δbu but for perc scenarios with increasing this ratio q hz increased up to δwu δbu 1 84 but then decreased for δwu δbu 2 5 it seemed that for perc scenario according to the energy principle the ratio of δwu δbu 2 5 was near to the choking condition this scenario associated with the nozzle effect which high velocity and low pressure after riffle crest can be led to the choking condition comparing ec scenarios with pcre and perc show that the simultaneous effects bed and width undulations lead to the higher q hz due to the higher hydraulic head gradients which correspond to the lower rt and is in line with the results of most of the hyporheic studies which showed higher qhz with lower residence time and vice versa tonina and buffington 2011 trauth et al 2013 but comparison between perc and pcre scenarios reveal that however the perc scenarios show higher q hz but they don t produce lower rt due to longer flow paths stonedahl et al 2013 for various ratio of meander sinusitis showed that presence of dune at meanders led to the higher he in comparison to the only meander cases our results also demonstrate that he increases as bed undulations are added to width undulations in order to extend the results for large scale cases in rivers the configurations studied by brown et al 2016 for investigating bed shear stress along the sequences of expansion constriction widths with riffle pool sequences and also with flat bed were examined numerically due to this fact that the application of 3d models for field scale simulations is computationally expensive srh 2d model which solved the depth averaged st venant equations was used to simulate free surface flow characteristics for scenarios s2 s3 s4 and s5 to extend the research methodology to rivers a 2d surface flow simulation model can be run to calculate hydraulic head at swi which needs less input parameters to calibrate the model and is less expensive in compare with 3d cfd models after calculation of hydraulic head the flow through porous media can be determined by assigning the calculated hydraulic head as a dirichlet boundary at swi and computing the hyporheic exchange metrics the results of field scale scenarios show that there is good agreement with experimental and numerical simulation scenarios in terms of variations of q hz and rt as demonstrated in table 2 the ratio of δwu δbu are not identical for both large field and small scale cases for field cases the amplitude of width undulation is much more than bed undulation and for small scale cases we have some case with δwu δbu 1 and some cases with δwu δbu 1 for both of these two scales the simultaneous effect of channel bed and width undulations reveal that maximum q hz achieve when pool is located in expansion and riffle in constriction as both constriction and shallowness converge flow in the same way the residence time distribution for field scale scenarios shows log normally distributed with negative skewness which is due to high frequency of longer and deeper path lines further investigations are needed to specifically determine whether bed amplitude is more effective in he or width amplitude the results of this study showed for all scenarios the residence time can well represented by log normal distribution which also proposed in literature tonina and buffington 2007 trauth et al 2013 5 conclusion in this paper a series of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were done to investigate the effect of channel width undulation and also simultaneous effect of channel bed and width undulations on hyporheic exchanges the openfoam and modflow software were applied for surface water and subsurface water simulations respectively also the particle tracking method in modpath was used to derive hyporheic zone characteristics the laboratory observations and also numerical simulations showed that at least for the geometric conditions of this study the location of the upwelling hyporheic flow paths depends on the location of riffle crest rather than the location of riffle crest relative to the sinusoidal banks we found that for ec scenarios the normalized hyporheic exchanges q ex increased with δwu δbu while normalized median residence time rt decreased we also found that by adding bed forms to the bank undulations the q ex increased and rt decreased for a given δwu δbu for pcre scenarios the q ex increased with δwu δbu while rt decreased but for perc scenarios the q ex increased with δwu δbu until the ratio of δwu δbu 1 84 and then decreased for δwu δbu 2 5 from the hydraulic point of view it seems that this ratio is a threshold for starting choking conditions further investigations are needed to determine on which ratio between bank and bed amplitude these conditions occur and the effect of one of them dominated by the other one our results demonstrated that for both small scale and large scale models the only width undulations scenarios have longest residence time and the scenarios which pool located in expansion and riffle in constriction had the highest hyporheic exchange the findings of this study will be applicable for river restoration projects in general in rivers which have width undulations constructing artificial riffle pool sequences in both positions pcre or perc lead to the higher hyporheic exchanges which would be beneficial for the project aiming to intensify oxygen rate for microorganism living in the streambed however by artificially construction of pool in expansion areas and riffle in constriction areas the maximum q ex and rt will be occur in this study the channel bank was assumed rigid and laterally hyporheic flow was ignored so effect of porous bank on hyporheic flow characteristics is proposed for future study also construction of pool in expansion areas and riffle in contraction areas of rivers may develop the secondary currents in rivers so 3d velocity measurement to assess the secondary flow and the rule of turbulence on he characteristics should be addressed in future works credit authorship contribution statement neshat movahedi conceptualization software formal analysis data

340,riffle pool sequences are fundamental ubiquitous morphological features of alluvial rivers that are thoroughly studied in general and commonly incorporated into river restoration projects most previous investigations on the effect of riffle pool sequences on hyporheic exchanges focused on solely bed undulation because that is widely thought to be the defining feature of riffle pool sequences however riffle pool sequences also have significant width undulations that are vital to riffle pool sequences morphodynamics yet relatively few studies exist on the effect of such undulations on hyporheic exchanges thus in this study based on laboratory experiments and numerical simulations we investigate the effect of bed and width undulations on hyporheic zone characteristics for various ratio of width amplitude to bed amplitude the variation of hyporheic exchange characteristics i e hyporheic exchange flux and residence time for different riffle pool designs were also assessed by creating prescribed topography of synthetic river valleys the results showed that due to pressure variation along width undulations the upwelling and downwelling patterns can also be observed for only width undulations in rivers in the absence of bed undulations and as width undulation amplitude decreases the normalized hyporheic exchanges q hz increase and normalized median residence time rt decreases also simultaneous channel bed and width undulations result in higher q hz especially when a pool is located in an expansion aka oversized cross section and a riffle in a constriction nozzle our results suggest that river restoration project that artificially construct wide pools and constricted riffles will achieve maximum q hz and rt though they will not be geomorphically self sustainable keywords bed undulation width undulation hyporheic exchanges residence time 1 introduction multiple definitions for hyporheic zone hz have been proposed reflecting different purposes of previous studies ward 2016 in this study hz is defined as a saturated area beneath and adjacent to a river in which water can transfer into the riverbed to become subsurface flow and then return above the riverbed to be surface flow this process of movement in and out of the bed is named hyporheic exchange he tonina and buffington 2011 when stream water flows into the subsurface oxygen and nutrients transfer benefiting many biogeochemical ecological and biological processes battin et al 2008 bencala 2000 boulton et al 1998 zheng et al 2019 tonina and buffington 2009 expressed a mechanism for he based on three dominating drivers spatial changes of energy head gradient cross sectional area of alluvium and hydraulic conductivity there is a clear mechanistic chain of cause and effect between local fluvial topography he and ecological functionality in this study we focused on the effect of spatial changes in the energy head gradient due to coherently varying river topography river morphology commonly quantified with planform cross section and longitudinal profile metrics represents a primary control on he by affecting pressure amplitude variation river bed and width undulations make the channel and flow non uniform and cause spatial changes of acceleration and hydraulic gradient along the rivers the following sections present a literature for the impact of river morphology on he and the objectives of this study 1 1 effects of bed undulations previous studies show that the main driver of he is the pressure gradient along geomorphic features like bars dunes and riffle pool rp sequence buffington and tonina 2009 fehlman 1985 thibodeaux and boyle 1987 tonina and buffington 2009 trauth et al 2015 the upwelling and downwelling fluxes in hz induced by pressure gradients along rp sequences will improve river habitat gariglio et al 2013 and stimulate the denitrification process trauth et al 2014 they are also common features of river restoration projects emery et al 2003 schwartz and herricks 2007 schwartz et al 2015 sear and newson 2004 whiteway et al 2010 and therefore considered as the main focus of this study few laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have investigated he in rp morphologies tonina and buffington 2007 studied he in rp channels with alternate bars through laboratory experiments and numerical simulations the effects of flow discharge and bed form amplitude on hz characteristics were investigated by injection of fluorescein as a tracer to determine solute exchange between surface and subsurface flow their results showed that not only the bed form amplitude but also the interaction between bed form and discharge can drive he trauth et al 2013 investigated the effect of stream discharge and ambient groundwater on hz characteristics for rp sequences with various amplitudes their numerical simulation results showed that he increased with stream discharge and mean residence time decreased also by increasing the rp amplitude the he increased and residence time decreased also zhou and endreny 2013 investigated the effect of restoration structures on hyporheic exchanges rate and hyporheic penetration depth along sequences of rp the results of flume experiments and numerical simulations in their study showed that restoration structures increased the hyporheic exchanges and decreased the penetration depth 1 2 effects of width undulations similar to bedforms river irregular planform geometry also leads to formation of hyporheic zones along river banks cardenas 2009b flow convergence and divergence along channel width undulations affect pressure gradients and as a result drive he cardenas 2009a through 2d numerical simulations investigated the hyporheic fluxes along sinusoidal channel banks his results showed that lateral hyporheic fluxes increased by sinuosity where the stream has no net flux of water neutral conditions however the impact of both channel flow and sinusoidal banks on hes which lead to the formation of both horizontal and vertical fluxes was not considered in his study the effect of meander planform on hes has been studied by many balbarini et al 2017 boano et al 2006 gomez velez et al 2017 han and endreny 2014 pescimoro et al 2019 peterson and sickbert 2006 revelli et al 2008 stonedahl 2011 but these studies all assume a constant channel width 1 3 coherent bed and width undulations channel width undulations affect bed topography of many gravel bed rivers jacobson and gran 1999 literature shows that width undulations can create pools in width constrictions and riffles in width expansions bittner 1994 buckrell 2017 de almeida and rodríguez 2012 nelson et al 2015 repetto et al 2002 richards 1976a white et al 2010 wu and yeh 2005 in natural systems the locations of riffles and pools are frequently linked to planform geometry or the spatial pattern of river corridor morphology many river rehabilitation projects aim to re establish natural pool riffle sequences brown et al 2016 lane et al 2018 however there are disagreements in the literature on the morphodynamic processes that shape them and resultantly there is no widely adapted standardized systems approach for their design brown and pasternack 2019 wade et al 2002 to increase river channel stability and quality of aquatic habitat pool riffle sequences are being artificially constructed so considering form process interactions during restoration projects is vital schwindt et al 2020 during in channel discharges near bed velocity and shear stress are lower in pools than riffles but during floods usually 1 2 times bankfull discharge the location of peak velocity reverses such that near bed velocity and shear stresses are higher in the pool than over riffle de almeida and rodríguez 2011 pasternack et al 2008 it must be noted that the reversal phenomena can also occur during within bank flooding where there is sufficient shear force to effect the reversal pool aggradation and riffle erosion or just riffle armoring during low discharge and pool scour and riffle aggradation at high discharge in gravel bed systems yields a morphodynamic mechanisms responsible for the self maintenance of pools and riffles de almeida and rodríguez 2011 pasternack et al 2018b strom et al 2016 considering that riffles generally are shallower and pools deeper higher mean velocities in a pool are only possible in situations where the shape of the pool s cross section is more constricted than that of the riffle pasternack et al 2018a however this is often not minded in actual engineering construction practice during engineered channelization pool riffle structure is often modified with excavators these machines usually site on the bank adjacent to the pool and need to pull the bucket perpendicular to the channel to dig the pool this strategy often yields a wider deeper pool than suitable to have a velocity reversal the problem could be resolved if project designers and construction crews were mindful of the simple caamaño criterion caamaño et al 2009 provided a simplified one dimensional criterion in which velocity reversal occurrence is a function of residual pool depth the ratio of riffle to pool depth and the flow depth over a riffle and concluded that reversal are less likely in deeper pools so the question is that how the location of rp against channel width undulations can affect he 1 4 study objectives as mentioned many studies only characterized he processes at rp sequences due to bed undulations and little is known about effect of width undulation on hz characteristics also to our knowledge no study has yet considered the effect of relative width of pools and riffles some rivers meander over long distances with a constant width but many rivers do have regular width undulations and they are phased coherently with bed undulations so building on the first goal of the study to assess width undulations in isolation the second goal of our study was to investigate the simultaneous effect of channel bed and width undulations on hz characteristics for the second goal two scenarios were studied in order to investigate the interaction of rp location and width undulations in the first scenario the pool was deep but constricted and then riffle was shallow but wide and in the second scenario the pool was both deep and wide i e oversized while the riffle was narrow and shallow i e nozzle these alternatives have been thoroughly studied for their geomorphic effects brown et al 2016 jackson et al 2015 pasternack et al 2018a b but not for their hz characteristics so in order to generalize results for large scale cases the configurations studied by brown et al 2016 for investigating bed shear stress along the sequences of expansion constriction widths with riffle pool sequences and also with flat bed were examined numerically in general the following questions are addressed in this study how hz characteristics will be affected by only width undulations amplitude δwu how hz characteristics will be affected by width undulations amplitude δwu for a given bed undulations amplitude δbu how hz characteristics will be affected by relative location of rp over width undulations does the above results can also be found in large scale case for the above goals a series of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were performed to characterize he processes due to width undulations and also bed undulations with considering synchronous width undulations for each case the hydraulic heads along sediment water interface swi were coupled with a groundwater model and then a particle tracking method was used to derive hz characteristics i e hyporheic exchanges flow qhz residence time rt and hyporheic depth dhz the novelty of this study is that it provides the first assessment of investigating synchronous bed and width undulations in gravel bed rivers with rp morphology which is a hotspot for microorganism living in hz and widely constructed in river restoration projects 2 experimental design in order to meet study goals a combination of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were performed with various ratios for amplitude of channel width and bed undulations in the following sections after introducing the effective parameters within dimensional analysis the laboratory experiments and numerical simulations will be explained in detail 2 1 dimensional analysis generally hyporheic zone characteristics including hyporheic exchanges flow qhz residence time rt and hyporheic exchange depth dhz can be express as a function of the following parameters 1 q hz rt d hz f v h k d 50 n ρ μ λ δ b u δ w u a s where ƒ the unknown function v mean flow velocity m s h mean flow depth m k hydraulic conductivity m s d50 the median sediment size m n porosity ρ the water density kg m3 μ dynamic viscosity λ wavelength of bed or width undulations m δbu amplitude of bed undulations m riffle crest to pool trough δwu amplitude of width undulations m as surface and subsurface interface area m2 by applying the buckingham π theorem to eq 1 the dimensionless relationship becomes 2 f q h z k λ 2 r t k λ d h z λ v k h λ μ ρ k λ δ b u λ δ w u λ λ 2 a s d 50 λ n 0 due to the use of one sediment size and a constant porosity and wavelength the last two terms of above equation can be omitted combining the rest of dimensionless parameters the following equation is obtained 3 f q h z k a s r t k λ d h z λ ρ v h μ δ w u δ b u 0 2 2 laboratory experiments experiments were conducted in a straight recirculating flume 12 m long 1 m wide and 1 m deep the flow was supplied in the flume by a centrifugal pump and the discharge was measured with an ultrasonic flow meter the sediment bed was a mixture of gravels and sands with a median diameter of 6 8 mm a geometric standard deviation of σ g d 84 d 16 1 5 a porosity of 0 34 the water and sediment elevations were measured by a digital point gage resolution 0 1 mm the velocity measurement was done by micro propeller the following sections introduce the geometry of laboratory models 2 2 1 width undulations the first part of laboratory experiments was conducted to investigate the effect of width undulations on hz characteristics hereinafter the expansion constriction scenarios without bed forms are named ec scenarios five sequences of sinusoidal width undulations were created by polystyrene sheets fig 1 a cut with a hotwire system based on the following equation 4 y x δ w u 2 sin λ x where x and y are distance along flume length and width respectively the wavelength and amplitude were one meter and 0 125 m respectively for these laboratory experiments which lead to the ratio of constriction width to expansion width equal to the 0 7 this ratio is consistent with the natural conditions of rivers with a riffle pool morphology bayat et al 2017 nelson et al 2015 wu and yeh 2005 2 2 2 bed and width undulations to assess the simultaneous effect of channel bed and width undulations on hz characteristics rp sequences were constructed in two scenarios for one scenario pools were located in narrower constricted areas and riffle in wider expansion areas which hereafter named as pool constriction riffle expansion pcre scenarios for the vice versa phasing of width and bed undulations the name used was pool expansion riffle constriction perc rps were shaped by means of wooden rib in the expansion constriction channel according to the following equation 5 z x δ b u 2 sin λ x where x and z are distance along flume width and depth respectively the wavelength of rp sequences was equal to 1 m and the bed amplitude was 0 068 m selection of wavelength value was based on the montgomery et al 1995 results for channel width formed in rivers with large wood also bed form amplitude was chosen to yield a ratio of bed form amplitude to wavelength set within the range of values observed for natural rp systems buffington and montgomery 1999 the wavelength of both bed and width undulations was 1 m the bed and width amplitudes were 0 068 m and 0 125 m respectively which led to the δwu δbu 1 84 table 1 fig 1b shows the bed and width undulations formed in the channel for pcre scenario 2 2 3 experimental procedure after construction of each model the water was supplied through the flume by a centrifugal pump the downstream gate was held up in order to completely saturate the sediments then the discharge was increased to the desired value and the downstream gate completely lowered to create the underflow conditions as this study aims to quantify how the channel and flow no uniformity affects the hyporheic exchanges characteristics the following assumptions and limitations are used in this study 1 the flow is steady state and the approach flow is clear and does not contain sediment 2 the channel banks are assumed to be non erodible to avoid the effect of inter meander he on the results the flow depths and velocities were measured for all scenarios the reference level for measuring flow depth and flow velocity was the mean bed amplitude the monitoring section was located at the middle bed or width undulations which water surface elevations were measured every 5 cm along flume length and every 10 cm along flume width also the streamwise velocities u were measured at five cross sections it should be noted in order to observe hyporheic paths against the flume glass wall through the width undulation scenarios only half of the width undulations were constructed in the laboratory fig 1 surface subsurface exchange was visualized by injecting dye in different positions into the sediments and drawing the penetration paths on the flume glass wall through the time 2 3 numerical models two sets of numerical simulations were performed first numerical simulations were done for laboratory experiments with careful measurements enabling model validation for free surface and subsurface flow table 1 then after assessing the accuracy of the simulation model additional numerical models were performed with different ratios of width amplitude to bed amplitude i e δwu δbu 0 88 1 32 and 2 5 for all ec pcre and perc scenarios as well as the rp case with only bed undulation the combination of experimental results and numerical simulations provides valuable insight into hyporheic phenomena second numerical simulations were done to compare results to field scale cases for this purpose the study used the systematically varied configurations developed by brown et al 2016 for studying the effects of bed and width undulations on bed shear stress along rp sequences i e s2 s3 s4 and s5 in table 1 and fig 2 these were built using the synthetic river valley srv concept and software of brown et al 2014 based on hydraulic sedimentary and geometry data the river length and width were 2358 and 70 m respectively bank and bed wavelengths were 196 m and the discharge was 125 m3 s 2 3 1 surface flow model the surface flow simulations for all scenarios were performed with open source field operation and manipulation openfoam version 2 3 0 which employs the finite volume method greenshields 2015 the two phase solver named interfoam with the large eddy simulation les method for turbulence closure was used the interfoam solver is a transient solver for incompressible flow that was used with open channel flow and free surface model farshi et al 2018 jellesma 2013 shaheed 2016 for two phase flow simulation in this solver one fluid model was used which only needs one series of equations for both phases this solver uses the volume of fluid method for determining free water surface the boundary between the water and air which depends on determining the fraction of each fluid in every cell of the computational mesh shaheed 2016 the equation of volume fraction is 6 α t α u 0 where u is velocity field and α is volume fraction of water and air the value of α is one for liquid phase zero for air phase and between zero to one for the interphase eq 6 is also named as the interphase transport equation the density of the fluid inside each cell could be determined by volume fraction which is also known as the phase fraction α shaheed 2016 7 ρ α ρ w 1 α ρ a where ρa and ρw are density of air and water respectively the constant density continuity equation and the momentum equation can be expressed as eqs 8 and 9 respectively 8 t ρ ρ u 0 u 0 9 ρ u t ρ u u p μ u t u f σ the expression u u is reynolds stress tensor in the right hand of the above equation p is pressure the second terms are turbulent and viscose stresses and the last term is the surface tension force the surface tension is modelled as continuum surface force f σ σκ σ which σ is the surface tension constant and κ the curvature and can be approximated as 10 κ α α due to this fact that the application of 3d models for field scale simulations is computationally expensive srh 2d model which solved the depth averaged st venant equations was used to simulate free surface flow characteristics for scenarios s2 s3 s4 and s5 2 3 2 subsurface flow model subsurface flow was simulated using modflow which solves the governing equations based on finite difference method mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 11 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z w s s h t where kxx kyy and kzz are hydraulic conductivity in x y and z direction respectively h represents the hydraulic head w the volumetric flux ss the specific storage of the porous media and t the time the calculations were performed in hexahedral cells and the flow into and out of each cell was calculated using darcy s equation 12 q k a l h l h 0 r where q is the volumetric fluid discharge from the neighbor into the cell k is the hydraulic conductivity in the direction of flow a1 is the area of the shared side of the cell r is the distance between the centers of the cells h1 is the hydraulic head associated with the neighboring cell and h0 is the cell in unknown head 2 3 3 boundary conditions and mesh design the upstream and downstream sides of the free surface domain boundary conditions used a spatially periodic pressure condition so that our domain approximates a repeating domain in the flow direction from upstream to downstream in this type of boundary condition information obtained from one boundary is put as a boundary condition to the related boundary and one can model a large system by simulating a small part of system the right and left faces relative to the flow direction are considered symmetry boundaries a symmetry boundary i e no flux is applied at the top face of the water column a no slip wall boundary is set at the bottom face of free surface interface for surface simulations the mesh was constructed within the blockmesh dictionary in openfoam such that the hexahedral horizontal cell size was 0 02 0 02 m2 square in the vertical direction a higher density of grid nodes was applied for cells close to the swi the number of structured grid nodes of the whole domain varied from about 330 000 to near 460 000 depending on the geometric conditions for subsurface simulations in modflow calculations were performed in hexahedral cells using more than 180 840 and 378 777 elements for laboratory experiments scenarios and s series scenarios respectively porous domain boundary conditions are represented in fig 3 the thickness of porous domain for experimental and for s scenarios was 0 34 m and 126 m respectively the sediment thickness is adequately large that it no longer has an effect on the flow field near the swi we used tonina buffington s suggestion as a first assumption and then we examined this assumption by checking the pathlines whether they reached to the bottom of the domain or not tonina and buffington 2011 suggested that depth of alluvium has a substantial effect on hyporheic flow when alluvial depth is less than a third of the bed form wavelength so this criterion was considered in selecting the thickness of the porous domain also the porosity and hydraulic conductivity were considered as 0 3 and 5 6e 4 m s respectively based on 119 reach measurements in french rivers by stewardson et al 2016 2 4 data analysis in all numerical scenarios turbulent flow characteristics in the water column were simulated by solving reynolds averaged navier stokes equations and a steady state groundwater flow model was applied for the underlying permeable sediment these two sets of equations were coupled through the hydraulic head distribution along the swi which was obtained from simulating of free surface flow this one way sequential coupling approach captures only flow from the surface water domain into the porous domain due to the fact that hyporheic flow that enters the stream channel is only a small volume fraction of the total stream discharge it has negligible impacts on hydrodynamic flow in the channel cheng and chiew 1998 prinos 1995 then the modpath particle tracking method in modflow was used to extract path lines and residence times of fluid particles in the middle topographic cycle which was far enough from the inlet and outlet so that boundary conditions could not affect results in the particle tracking results analysis only particles that entered the streambed from surface flow remained in the streambed for a while and then returned to surface flow from the streambed were considered in calculations hyporheic exchanges flow qhz and median residence time mrt are normalized by the following equations 13 q hz q hz k a s 14 r t mrt k σ λ where σλ is the arc length along the sinusoidal width cardenas 2009a which is different for each ratio of δwu δbu since the particles travel in a three dimensional space the longitudinal and lateral travel distance were calculated based on initial and final coordinate of particles in the following we first report results of numerical model validation using laboratory data for surface flow model validation the observed and simulated water surface elevations and velocity distributions were compared to quantitatively

for laboratory and field numerical simulations were compared results are presented and discussed for four scenarios named as rp ec pcre and perc for the last three scenarios four ratios of δwu δbu were compared for hz characteristics one ratio in both laboratory and numerical experiments and three more ratios with only numerical simulations 3 results 3 1 model validation results 3 1 1 surface flow the openfoam results were verified for surface flow using the laboratory observations comparison of observed versus simulated water surface elevations and streamwise velocities showed a good agreement fig 4 the observed water surface elevations and velocities agreed well with the simulated one with the overall rmse of 0 0034 m and 0 07 m s and also mpe of 3 55 and 15 31 respectively table 2 3 1 2 subsurface flow for subsurface flow the observed pathlines due to dye injection in laboratory experiments δwu δbu 1 84 and the simulated pathlines due to particle tracking in modpath for field scale model δwu δbu 7 are presented in figs 5 7 the observed pattern of dye tracks agrees well with simulated particle tracks such that the following pattern is obtained for ec pcre and perc scenarios for the ec scenario fig 5 results showed that when dye was injected in the expansion zone with maximum width some path lines traveled upstream and some traveled downstream by injecting dye at the width inflection point downstream from the maximum width location all path lines converged through the downstream constriction however when dye was injected at the width inflection point downstream of the minimum width location path lines traveled to the upstream constriction thus in the channel with only width undulations fluid particles entered the porous bed from the wider area high pressure zone and after traveling some distance through porous media returned to free surface flow at the narrower area low pressure zone therefore fluvial hyporheic flow can be induced with only width undulations in the absence of bed undulations for the pcre scenario fig 6 when dye was injected between the pool trough and downstream riffle crest the emergence point was near the downstream riffle crest however by injecting dye between the trough and the upstream riffle crest the emergence points would be on the lee side of the upstream riffle the hyporheic flow in this scenario was driven by hydraulic gradients resulting from both bed and width undulations because the upwelling region in this scenario was observed downstream of riffle crest located in an expansion the effect of bed undulation on hyporheic flow pattern was greater than the effect of width undulation with δwu δbu 1 84 for the perc scenario fig 7 because the riffle was constricted the minimum pressure occurred on the riffle crest this led to the emergence of the dye near the riffle crest so then free surface flow entered the porous bed from the pool downwelling and returned to free surface downstream of the riffle crest upwelling also for this scenario the observed hyporheic pathlines are compared with its simulated one in fig 8 which demonstrated that the numerical model capable to trace the path line for injection points 3 2 hydraulic head distributions at swi for submerged features i e dune riffle the variation of hydraulic head at swi is a main driver of hyporheic exchanges figs 9 and 10 show the plan view of hydraulic head h distribution at swi for different ratios of δwu δbu for pcre and perc scenarios respectively the dashed and continuous lines denote the pool and riffle positions respectively for pcre scenarios by increasing δwu δbu the location of maximum hydraulic head shifted from the width constriction to the width expansion fig 9 and also the distance between maximum and minimum hydraulic head increased lateral variations in hydraulic head were observed with particularly prominent high pressure zones on the channel edge of the expansion in the pcre scenario especially for larger values of δwu δbu lateral variations in hydraulic head can produce lateral hyporheic flow when the banks are permeable for perc scenarios of maximum hydraulic head was located at upstream of the riffle and close to the undulated bank and with increasing the ratio of δwu δbu the width of high pressure zone increased because as δwu δbu increased the width of constriction decreased so the portion of the bank facing the flow increased thus acted as a barrier and led to the stronger high pressure area behind the minimum constriction width which was in line with the high pressure zone created by riffle fig 10 also as the ratio of δwu δbu increased the distance between of maximum hydraulic head and of minimum hydraulic head decreased for both perc and pcre scenarios the minimum hydraulic head was located at the riffle crest also the longitudinal distance between of maximum hydraulic head and of minimum hydraulic head was longer in pcre scenarios in comparison with perc scenarios 3 3 hyporheic exchange flow and residence time as described in section 2 4 the hyporheic exchanges and residence time are computed for the particles that enter and subsequently exit the domain only from the streambed normalized exchange q hz and normalized median residence time rt are highly sensitive to different ratios of δwu δbu figs 11 and 12 for ec scenarios as the ratio of δwu δbu increased the q hz increased and rt decreased because by decreasing the width of the minimum constriction the average velocity of flow in constriction increased for a given flow discharge by increasing δwu δbu the contribution of bank undulation on local hydraulic head gradient increased which leads to the higher q hz and lower rt when bedforms were added to width undulations for both pcre and perc scenarios in comparison to ec scenarios the normalized hyporheic exchanges increased and normalized residence time decreased for all ratios of δwu δbu in other words presence of bedforms enhanced hyporheic exchange the highest hyporheic exchange was related to the perc for which both riffle and width constriction combined to increase the velocity variation through the constriction so the hydraulic head gradients increased and q hz increased for pcre scenarios with increasing the ratio of δwu δbu the hydraulic head gradients increased so q hz increased and rt decreased also for perc scenarios with increasing this ratio hyporheic exchanges increased but for the ratio of δwu δbu 2 5 as the area which riffle pool occupied was decreased the hydraulic head gradient decreased so the q hz decreased and rt increased by comparing rp and ec scenarios it can be concluded that bed undulations rp scenario led to higher q hz except for ratio of δwu δbu 2 5 whereas bank undulations ec scenarios led to higher median residence time for all modelled channels considering the brown et al 2016 models it was discovered that by adding bed undulations to bank undulations comparing s2 s4 and s5 q hz increased and rt decreased table 3 the maximum q hz occurred when the pool was in the width expansion and riffle in the constriction which shows the similar behavior to small scale models also maximum rt was achieved for the ec scenario by adding width undulations to bed undulations comparing s3 s4 and s5 the rt increased whether the riffle was constricted and pool expanded or vice versa the q hz for rp and perc scenarios were similar which showed that for small amplitude bed form as here for large scale the simultaneous effect of bed and width undulations had no significant effect on hyporheic exchanges when pools were located in width expansions and riffles in width constrictions hyporheic exchange and residence time was much more sensitive to variations in width amplitude in the absence of bed undulations 3 4 residence time distribution histograms of residence time distributions rtd and fitted log normal curves are plotted in fig 13 for pcre and perc scenarios for pcre scenarios all ratios of δwu δbu are well distributed with a log normal distribution for all ratios of δwu δbu the skewness is positive which means the number of path lines with long residence time is low and as δwu δbu increased the distributions become close to the symmetrical for perc scenarios a bimodal distribution was observed with two peaks the fitted log normal curve also proposed by other investigations for only riffle pool sequences tonina and buffington 2007 trauth et al 2013 histograms of residence time distributions for large scale models are also log normally distributed fig 14 but they show a negative skewness which means that the number of particles with long residence time is high 3 5 traveling distance due to the hydraulic head gradients that occurred laterally across the flume path lines also deviated in lateral direction the results showed that for ec scenarios the median lateral travel distance was always less the 80 of the median longitudinal travel distance and as the constriction width decreased higher ratio of the δwu δbu the median longitudinal and median lateral travel distances decreased for pcre scenarios the hydraulic head gradient across the flume was higher than perc scenarios and lead to the longer median lateral travel distance which increased with δwu δbu but for perc scenarios the hydraulic head distribution along channel width was more uniform in comparison with pcre scenarios and led to the shorter median lateral travel distance also as δwu δbu increased the hydraulic head distribution become more uniform and lead to the shorter median lateral travel distance 3 6 hyporheic exchanges depth for pcre and perc scenarios by average 93 percent of total exchange is transported by path lines within 20 cm below the mean bed form amplitude i e 58 8 percent of subsurface layer thickness and as the ratio of δwu δbu decreased the hyporheic exchange depth increased for bed form only scenario tonina and buffington 2011 indicated that in order to make sure that the depth of sediment layer did not affect hyporheic exchanges this depth should be more than one third of the wavelength but our results showed that for both bed and bank undulation scenarios the depth of sediment layer could be less than this criterion and further experiments are warranted to define a new criterion also the maximum exchange depth for perc scenarios were less than pcre scenarios 4 discussion 4 1 non uniform channel pattern bed undulations were the focus of early geomorphic research into riffle pool morphology fig 15 a e g keller 1971

exist e g merritt and wohl 2003 richards 1976a stewardson 2005 trainor and church 2003 today widespread availability of meter resolution digital elevation models of rivers enables a fresh deeper look at patterns of topographic variability scown et al 2015 and the processes they contribute to strom et al 2016 wyrick and pasternack 2016 river classifications and scientific studies are increasingly embracing new fluvial metrics of geometric variability e g byrne et al 2020 pasternack et al 2018a wohl 2016 leading to a greater understanding of the scope of variability in rivers the typical patterns in different settings and the environmental roles variability play individual river reaches exhibit a wide range of values for depth and width variability metrics byrne et al 2020 laub et al 2012 but there are two common endmembers associated with distinct valley settings pcre and perc fig 15c and d respectively the perc configuration with nozzles and oversized units is widespread in mountains due to two regimes first coarse bedload in canyon confined bedrock rivers can scour out deep wide pools between steep confined shallow units riffles rapids steps and slides second small steep tributaries to wider mountain canyons can deliver sufficient coarse sediment to constrict a canyon to a small fraction of its width perc reaches can also occur naturally in small headland meadows and lowland valley streams due to local wood and boulder obstructions and resistant hardpans forming nozzles in engineering practice the perc configuration has come to dominate in whitewater park design kolden et al 2016 and a type of channel restoration called regenerative stormwater conveyance duan et al 2019 the latter is especially intended to drive hyporheic flow potentially enhancing denitrification in streams degraded by anthropogenic high nutrient loads craig et al 2008 klocker et al 2009 merill and tonjes 2014 tuttle et al 2014 the pcre configuration with wide bar and constricted pool units is naturally widespread in partially confined to unconfined valleys with alluvial self formed channels and riverbed slopes of 0 001 to 0 02 in the absence of fixed obstructions it is thought to be self maintaining due to energy minimization flow convergence routing and grain size differentiation between units bayat et al 2017 macwilliams jr et al 2006 yang 1971 mindful design of pcre is limited as of yet but advocated by academics due to its self sustainability based on flume field and numerical modeling studies e g jackson et al 2015 repetto and tubino 2001 wheaton et al 2010 while studies have investigated hyporheic and denitrification effects in reaches with constructed riffles and pools mendoza lera and datry 2017 merill and tonjes 2014 rivers et al 2018 care has not been taken to isolate the pcre configuration overall both perc and pcre configurations are widespread in nature and increasingly used in river engineering warranting a better understanding of their hyporheic flow processes 4 2 hyporheic response to channel non uniformity in this study for the first time we present the hydraulic head distribution along systematically varying channel bed and width undulations including those linked with two different phase angles commonly observed in nature the location of maximum and minimum hydraulic head distribution depends on bed or width amplitude our results show that for ec supplementary figure 1 and perc fig 10 scenarios the pattern of hydraulic head distributions does not change a lot for various ratios of δwu δbu but for pcre scenarios the location of minimum and maximum hydraulic head change for higher ratios of δwu δbu investigation of near bed velocities at different positions of pool trough and riffle crest along channel width reveal that for ratios of δwu δbu 1 84 2 5 the near bed velocities at distances near to the sinusoidal width are higher for pool in the narrowest width than riffle in the widest width so it can be concluded that not only flow discharge mentioned by previous studies but also ratio of width undulation amplitude to bed undulation amplitude has an effect on the velocity reversal hypothesis however for perc scenarios no reversal velocity was observed because according to the energy principle in subcritical flow constricting a riffle leads to higher velocities there than ate the pool further investigations are recommended to investigate the effect of reversal velocity on hyporheic exchanges under various ratios of δwu δbu and flow conditions as mentioned in the introduction section buffington and tonina 2009 stated that one of the mechanisms causing hyporheic exchange is spatial changes in alluvial area alluvial depth or the valley width for ec scenarios we find that the path lines are downwelled in expansion areas and upwelled in constriction areas which is in line with their findings in their 2011 paper they discussed about the effect of alluvial depth on he but in this paper we investigate the effect of alluvial width ec scenarios and we find that as the alluvial width decrease higher width amplitude the q hz increase and rt decrease for pcre scenarios the q hz increased with δwu δbu but for perc scenarios with increasing this ratio q hz increased up to δwu δbu 1 84 but then decreased for δwu δbu 2 5 it seemed that for perc scenario according to the energy principle the ratio of δwu δbu 2 5 was near to the choking condition this scenario associated with the nozzle effect which high velocity and low pressure after riffle crest can be led to the choking condition comparing ec scenarios with pcre and perc show that the simultaneous effects bed and width undulations lead to the higher q hz due to the higher hydraulic head gradients which correspond to the lower rt and is in line with the results of most of the hyporheic studies which showed higher qhz with lower residence time and vice versa tonina and buffington 2011 trauth et al 2013 but comparison between perc and pcre scenarios reveal that however the perc scenarios show higher q hz but they don t produce lower rt due to longer flow paths stonedahl et al 2013 for various ratio of meander sinusitis showed that presence of dune at meanders led to the higher he in comparison to the only meander cases our results also demonstrate that he increases as bed undulations are added to width undulations in order to extend the results for large scale cases in rivers the configurations studied by brown et al 2016 for investigating bed shear stress along the sequences of expansion constriction widths with riffle pool sequences and also with flat bed were examined numerically due to this fact that the application of 3d models for field scale simulations is computationally expensive srh 2d model which solved the depth averaged st venant equations was used to simulate free surface flow characteristics for scenarios s2 s3 s4 and s5 to extend the research methodology to rivers a 2d surface flow simulation model can be run to calculate hydraulic head at swi which needs less input parameters to calibrate the model and is less expensive in compare with 3d cfd models after calculation of hydraulic head the flow through porous media can be determined by assigning the calculated hydraulic head as a dirichlet boundary at swi and computing the hyporheic exchange metrics the results of field scale scenarios show that there is good agreement with experimental and numerical simulation scenarios in terms of variations of q hz and rt as demonstrated in table 2 the ratio of δwu δbu are not identical for both large field and small scale cases for field cases the amplitude of width undulation is much more than bed undulation and for small scale cases we have some case with δwu δbu 1 and some cases with δwu δbu 1 for both of these two scales the simultaneous effect of channel bed and width undulations reveal that maximum q hz achieve when pool is located in expansion and riffle in constriction as both constriction and shallowness converge flow in the same way the residence time distribution for field scale scenarios shows log normally distributed with negative skewness which is due to high frequency of longer and deeper path lines further investigations are needed to specifically determine whether bed amplitude is more effective in he or width amplitude the results of this study showed for all scenarios the residence time can well represented by log normal distribution which also proposed in literature tonina and buffington 2007 trauth et al 2013 5 conclusion in this paper a series of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were done to investigate the effect of channel width undulation and also simultaneous effect of channel bed and width undulations on hyporheic exchanges the openfoam and modflow software were applied for surface water and subsurface water simulations respectively also the particle tracking method in modpath was used to derive hyporheic zone characteristics the laboratory observations and also numerical simulations showed that at least for the geometric conditions of this study the location of the upwelling hyporheic flow paths depends on the location of riffle crest rather than the location of riffle crest relative to the sinusoidal banks we found that for ec scenarios the normalized hyporheic exchanges q ex increased with δwu δbu while normalized median residence time rt decreased we also found that by adding bed forms to the bank undulations the q ex increased and rt decreased for a given δwu δbu for pcre scenarios the q ex increased with δwu δbu while rt decreased but for perc scenarios the q ex increased with δwu δbu until the ratio of δwu δbu 1 84 and then decreased for δwu δbu 2 5 from the hydraulic point of view it seems that this ratio is a threshold for starting choking conditions further investigations are needed to determine on which ratio between bank and bed amplitude these conditions occur and the effect of one of them dominated by the other one our results demonstrated that for both small scale and large scale models the only width undulations scenarios have longest residence time and the scenarios which pool located in expansion and riffle in constriction had the highest hyporheic exchange the findings of this study will be applicable for river restoration projects in general in rivers which have width undulations constructing artificial riffle pool sequences in both positions pcre or perc lead to the higher hyporheic exchanges which would be beneficial for the project aiming to intensify oxygen rate for microorganism living in the streambed however by artificially construction of pool in expansion areas and riffle in constriction areas the maximum q ex and rt will be occur in this study the channel bank was assumed rigid and laterally hyporheic flow was ignored so effect of porous bank on hyporheic flow characteristics is proposed for future study also construction of pool in expansion areas and riffle in contraction areas of rivers may develop the secondary currents in rivers so 3d velocity measurement to assess the secondary flow and the rule of turbulence on he characteristics should be addressed in future works credit authorship contribution statement neshat movahedi conceptualization software formal analysis data

341,in this work different generalized double porosity models for anomalous fluid flow in fractured porous media are presented and transient production decline applications discussed the effects of subdiffusive and superdiffusive flows in fracture networks coupled to subdiffusive transport inside the matrix are explored and some insights into how to identify these types of flow in geological formations like aquifers and oil fields through transient production decline analysis are given additionally we discuss different interpretations of the models parameters that allow under the same analysis to estimate the length scales of the system main heterogeneities moreover we show that superdiffusive flow regimes could be a consequence of highly heterogeneous porous systems described by scale free permeability distributions finally we show that the use of non local models of the type herein discussed admit a novel way to construct effective single porosity models for the long time description of double porosity systems keywords anomalous transport double porosity fluid flow non local diffusion porous media 1 introduction the advection diffusion equation paradigm for modelling transport phenomena has been tremendously successful in many branches of scientific knowledge and their respective applications in particular it permitted the construction of a firm theoretical basis for transport phenomena and pressure spatio temporal dynamics in porous media with applications ranging from geophysical characterization of geological formations like aquifers and oil fields and the description of contaminant dispersion in underground water berkowitz et al 2008 sahimi 1995 bear 1971 to improved catalysis in heterogeneous chemical reactors gogate 2016 keil 2013 waclawek et al 2018 and drug release from porous reservoirs or membranes winters 2009 spiepmann and siepmann 2008 however since the second half of last century it became clear that such paradigm has serious drawbacks when applied to situations with strong spatial disorder e g porous media with heterogeneities at a wide range of length scales or long range spatial correlations in some of its physical properties like permeability ben avraham and havlin 2000 bouchaud and georges 1990 dykhne et al 2005 hernández et al 2018 matheron and de marsily 1980 as a consequence alternative models to the advection diffusion equation have been proposed in order to improve the description of transport processes in this type of medium and shed light into the physical mechanisms responsible for transport anomalies berkowitz et al 2006 berkowitz and scher 1998 hernández coronado et al 2012 herrera hernández et al 2013 metzler and klafter 2000 o shaughnessy and procaccia 1985 scher et al 2002 tartakovsky et al 2008 among such anomalies the temporal behaviour of the dispersion suffered by the transported quantity e g chemical substances tracers or pressure disturbances is the most recognized and typically takes the following asymptotic form in unbounded domains 1 r 2 t r t 2 t α α 1 where 2 r i t r n ρ r t r i d ω i 1 2 n n in eq 2 ρ r t denotes the concentration at time t of the transported quantity at a spatial location given by r whereas r 2 and r 2 denotes respectively the squared euclidean norm of the position vector and its average 1 in eq 1 α is usually called anomalous exponent and classifies diffusion processes in two broad transport regimes superdiffusive for α 1 and subdiffusive when α 1 among the generalized diffusion advection equations that have been proposed for transport regimes characterized by eq 1 del castillo negrete 2010 dentz and tartakovsky 2006 hernández coronado et al 2012 herrera hernández et al 2013 mosco 1997 o shaughnessy and procaccia 1985 the most successful in terms of predictions and understanding of such processes are based on continuous time random walks ctrw and the generalized master equation gme berkowitz et al 2006 dentz and tartakovsky 2006 klafter and silbey 1980 metzler and klafter 2000 scher et al 2002 under the assumption of statistical independence between waiting times and jumps and a symmetric jump probability density with finite variance the ctrw formalism allows the deduction of the following equivalent forms of a generalized diffusion equation sokolov and klafter 2005 3 0 t κ t t ρ r t t d t d 2 ρ and 4 ρ t d d d t 0 t k t t 2 ρ d t the above expressions are non local in time evolution equations and d a parameter whose physical interpretation depends on the memory kernel details and the transported quantity and usually taken as a generalized permeability or diffusion coefficient eq 3 is known as the normal form of the generalized diffusion equation whereas eq 4 is usually referred as the modified form the integral kernel of both equations contain the information of the system disorder and are related to the waiting time probability density ψ t of ctrw formalism through well defined mathematical expressions berkowitz et al 2006 klafter and silbey 1980 sokolov and klafter 2005 for power law kernels eqs 3 and 4 give rise to the well known fractional subdiffusion equations in terms of caputo and riemman liouville fractional derivates metzler and klafter 2000 2004 on the other hand it is well known that ctrw basic theory is equivalent to the gme formalism which describe the typical behaviour of a transported quantity in a disordered medium klafter and silbey 1980 for constant transition probabilities between adjacent sites the continuum limit of this equation can be written as 5 ρ t d 0 t m t t 2 ρ d t where the memory kernel and the waiting time probability density are related through the following expression in laplace space kenkre et al 1973 berkowitz et al 2006 6 m s s ψ s 1 ψ s however eq 5 has a more general footing than uncouple ctrw theory allowing the description of correlated and wave like propagating phenomena associated with superdifussive transport like sub ballistic and ballistic superdiffusion metzler and klafter 2000 metzler and nonnenmacher 2002 west et al 1997 this type of transport would be expected for pressure disturbance propagation in fluid saturated fractured porous media particularly in situations where strong pressure gradients or fluid discharge are imposed at some parts of the domain boundary as occur in pressure tests a type of field test designed to characterize geological formations like aquifers and oil fields and to predict their behaviour under exploitation da prat 1990 prats et al 2020 nonetheless pressure behaviour in fractured media is usually described through normal diffusive double porosity models or generalized and multirate double porosity models which only include the possibility of subdiffusive transport yin et al 2020 da prat 1990 prats et al 2020 barenblatt et al 1960 warren and root 1963 gerke and van genuchten 1993 chang and yortsos 1990 haggerty and gorenlick 1995 dentz and berkowitz 2003 on the other hand the few works that do address superdiffusive transport in this context raghavan et al 2017 raghavan and chen 2017 usually use space fractional operators for its description with the underlying assumption of scale free displacements lévy flights as the cause of anomalous behaviour therefore in this work we propose a generalization of the double porosity model that allow ballistic and sub ballistic superdiffusion through the fractures network and subdiffusive transport inside the matrix the type of superdiffusion herein considered is not related to lévy flights and its description does not include space fractional operators instead anomalous transport is modeled by using eqs 4 and 5 with different kernels some of which have been discussed in the literature but not applied to any specific problem in this regard it is important to have in mind that the memory kernels associated with superdiffusive motion are dangerous in the sense that they do not guarantee the positivity of the solutions of the gme for all spatial dimentions parameter values and all initial and boundary conditions kenkre et al 1973 sokolov 2002 nevertheless we think it will be useful to explore these type of dynamics in the context of fluid saturated fractured porous media and pressure tests although several kernels are discussed the main focus of the work are the models corresponding to the mittag leffler memory kernels their interpretation and implications for transport processes in fractured porous media and pressure tests the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the generalized double porosity model gdpm is presented and a brief discussion of the used kernels and their corresponding transport properties are given in section 3 pressure tests under consideration are discussed including the general solution of the gdpm for such tests in section 4 the gdpm is interpreted and analysed under pressure test conditions for each memory kernel in particular we show that for a mittag leffler kernel the model can be written as a fractional telegraphic double porosity model in section 5 the results associated to pressure tests are presented and analysed under the conceptual framework of previous sections and finally in section 6 we give some conclusions and discuss future work 2 generalized double porosity models the generalized double porosity models gdpm we discuss in

reasons and to avoid the use of generalized permeabilities for kernels with only one characteristic time scale we assume that m β t 1 τ f β t τ and show that τ can be attached with different physical meanings depending on the time non locality interpretation it can be associated either with the medium heterogeneities and fractal geometric characteristics or the fluid inertial properties matrix dynamics is defined in terms of a riemann liouville fractional derivative implying that throughout this work transport inside the matrix is assumed subdiffusive for γ 1 or normal diffusive when γ 1 for γ 1 τ 1 can be associated with the waiting time distribution underlying matrix subdiffusive dynamics metzler and klafter 2000 for similar descriptions of pressure subdiffusive behaviour in

time scales with their associated dimensionless parameters τ d i τ d l and τ d the intermediate and long characteristic time scales control the beginning of the inverse power law behaviour and the crossover from the inverse power law to the exponential kernel decay the remaining time scale is treated as a generalized geometric average of the other two see section 4 4 the transport regimes associated to this kernel are ballistic sub ballistic and normal diffusive with the exception of the gdpm with mittag leffler memory kernel and η 1 the evolution equations associated with each kernel and zero interporosity flow λ 0 have been proposed in the scientific literature as plausible models for anomalous diffusion compte and metzler 1997 metzler and klafter 2000 and in some cases as specific models for anomalous transport in porous media dentz and tartakovsky 2006 hernández et al 2013 moreover each case represent different physical situations for η 1 and m β t d t d β 1 with 0 β 1 eq 8 describes a situation where subdiffusive transport is present in both the matrix and the fractures network and takes the form 10 ω p 2 d t 1 β t d 1 β 1 r d r d r d p 2 d r d 1 ω p 1 d t d 1 ω p 1 d t d λ 1 γ t d 1 γ p 2 d p 1 d 0 γ β 1 on the other hand the model corresponding to the mittag leffler memory kernel with η 0 describes a transport process with superdiffusion along the fractures network and subdiffusion inside the matrix whereas for η 1 gives normal diffusive behaviour at short times with subdiffusive dynamics at long times finally the model with the truncated power law kernel gives superdiffusive transport at short and intermediate times for the fractures network and a normal diffusive behaviour for long times due to the exponential cutoff it is important to recall that the presence of subdiffusive transport inside the matrix is a consequence of the fractional derivative in the second expression of eq 7 for γ 1 normal diffusion inside the matrix is recovered in each case the type of transport along the fractures can be seen by studying the time evolution of the pressure mean square displacement when it is not coupled to the matrix for the power law memory kernel and its associated gdpm eq 10 it is well known that when λ 0 the pressure mean square displacement is metzler and klafter 2000 11 r 2 t t β β 1 therefore as already stated eq 10 is a model for subdiffusive transport in double porosity systems for the remaining kernels which are not scale free and are bounded for short times it is straightforward to see that if η 0 and m β t d 1 τ d f β t d τ d i t d τ d l then 12 d r d 2 t d d t d 0 t d f β t d t d τ d i t d t τ d l d t d hence for t d τ d i τ d l eq 12 give short time ballistic behaviour 13 r d 2 t d t 2 on the other hand the long time behaviour of eq 12 depends on the decaying properties of the particular kernels if lim t d 0 t d f β t d t τ d i t d t τ d l d t anomalous dynamics is responsible for transport within the fractures network whereas if lim t d 0 t d f β t d t τ d t d t τ d l d t long time normal diffusive dynamics is established taking into account the asymptotic form of the the mittag leffler function e β t d τ d β t d τ d β mainardi and gorenflo 2007 eq 12 can be written as 14 d r d 2 t d d t d 0 t 0 e β 1 t d t τ d d t τ d β t 0 t d t β d t t d 1 β τ d t 0 t d therefore integrating eq 14 gives a long time superdiffusive behaviour for transport inside the fractures network i e 15 r d 2 t d t d 2 β τ d t d 0 β 1 however for the same kernel with η 1 and due to the differential operator acting on the time integral it is straightforward to see that transport is normal diffusive for short times and subdiffusive for long times for the truncated power law kernel there are three different transport regimes the first two are superdiffusive and correspond to the short time ballistic and intermediate time sub ballistic behaviours of eqs 13 and 15 the third regime associated to long times is normal diffusive i e 16 r d 2 t d t d 2 t d τ d i t d 2 β τ d i t d τ d l t d τ d l t d eqs 13 and 15 are consistent with a wave like propagating phenomena moving at well defined velocities and can be associated to few dispersive events e g few fracture intersections or crossed matrix blocks during propagation on the other hand the long time limit of eqs 11 and 16 is consistent with diffusive like propagating phenomena anomalous or normal and could be associated to many dispersive events during propagation in the following section we introduce the pressure test conditions under which the gdpm is analysed and interpreted for each kernel at section 4 3 pressure tests transient production decline analysis the field tests we are interested in are usually known as transient production decline curve analysis and are generally speaking a small subset of a group of tests designed for characterizing geological formations like aquifers and oil fields including their transport properties and future behaviour under exploitation conditions usually such tests consist on forcing initial and boundary conditions on the system through wellbore manipulations followed by the monitoring of specific observables like fluid flow or fluid pressure at definite locations for long time periods after proper treatment the obtained data are analysed and compared to known solutions of specific transport models da prat 1990 warren and root 1963 in particular for transient production decline curve analysis the pressure at the wellbore is fixed while the fluid flow at that same location monitored these conditions are particularly well suited for the mathematical structure of the gdpm and are consistent with the following initial boundary value problem 17 ω p 2 d t d τ d γ β η d η d t d η 0 t d m β t d t d 1 r d r d r d p 2 d r d d t 1 ω p 1 d t d 1 ω p 1 d t d λ 1 γ t d 1 γ p 2 d p 1 d 0 γ β 1 p i d t d 0 p i d r d 0 0 i 1 2 p 2 d 1 t d 1 notice that because eq 17 is a linear system with time convolutions it can be easily written in laplace space and solved for p 1 d giving the following boundary value problem for the fractures network pressure 18 d 2 p 2 d d r d 2 1 r d d p 2 d d r d t s p 2 d i s 0 p 2 d 1 s 1 s p 2 d s 0 where p 2 d denotes the laplace transform of p 2 d with t s and i s functions of the laplace variable the explicit form of these functions are model dependent and carries the information of the system temporal evolution as will be shown in the next section i s 0 for the considered initial conditions and kernels hence the solution of eq 18 is given by 19 p 2 d r d s k 0 t s r d s k 0 t s where k 0 x is the modified bessel function of zero order lebedev 1965 on the other hand writing the memory kernel laplace transform as m β s f β s τ d the dimensionless mass flux in laplace space at each domain point can be written as 20 j r d θ s 1 τ d τ d s γ β η f β s p 2 d r d therefore the fluid flow at the wellbore in laplace space is 21 q s 1 τ d τ d s γ β η f β s p 2 d r d r d 1 τ d s γ β η f β s k 1 t s t s τ d s k 0 t s where k 1 x is the modified bessel function of first order eq 21 was obtained through eqs 19 and 20 and known properties of the modified bessel functions lebedev 1965 notice that the fluid flow at the wellbore depends explicitly on the memory kernel implying different temporal behaviours for each type of transport in the fractures network 4 models discussion and interpretation under pressure test conditions 4 1 power law kernel subdiffusive subdiffusive case as already stated the gdpm with η 1 and m β t d t d β 1 is a model for subdiffusive transport in double porosity systems it would be associated with porous media with strong heterogeneities and tortuosities in their main transport paths or with scale free heterogeneities ben avraham and havlin 2000 klemm et al 2002 the explicit form of the model is given by eq 10 where β and γ are considered independent parameters that quantifies subdiffusion inside the fractures network and matrix hence from this model flow behaviour the following scenarios for transient production decline curve analysis can be explored β γ 1 stonger subdiffusion inside the fractures network than in the matrix γ β 1 stronger subdiffusion inside the matrix than in the fractures network γ β 1 equally strong subdiffusion in matrix and fractures network γ β 1 subdiffusion inside the matrix normal diffusion in the fractures network β γ 1 subdiffusion inside the fractures network normal diffusion in the matrix in this case the functions t s and i s defined at eq 18 have the following explicit form 22 t s ω 1 ω s γ λ 1 ω s γ λ s β i s ω s β 1 p 2 d r d 0 1 ω s β a s i β 1 r d r d r d r d p 2 d t d 0 a s 1 ω p 1 d r d 0 λ i γ p 2 d p 1 d t d 0 1 ω s λ s 1 γ where i β and i γ are fractional integral operators of order β and γ notice that for the initial conditions of eq 17 and the definition of fractional integration given in appendix a it is straightforward to see that i s 0 for this model the kernel in laplace space takes the form f s γ β s β then substituting in eq 21 gives the following expression for the flow at the wellbore 23 q s s β k 1 t s t s k 0 t s t s ω 1 ω s γ λ 1 ω s γ λ s β 4 2 mittag leffler kernel superdiffusive subdiffusive case the transport regimes associated to the gdpm with a mittag leffler memory kernel are ballistic and sub ballistic for short and long time scales in the fractures network and subdiffusive in the matrix as discussed in section 2 ballistic behaviour is associated to the bounded nature of the kernel at short times while sub ballistic diffusion is due the long time decay of the mittag leffler function see eq 15 this model would be associated to situations with strong positive correlations in the diffusive particles or fluid movement inside the fractures network it could be applied to situations with strong hydrodynamic dispersion in the case of tracer tests or strong correlations in the fluid velocity field dykhne et al 2005 hernández et al 2018 matheron and de marsily 1980 for this kernel the dimensionless form of the model is 24 ω p 2 d t d 1 τ d 0 t d e β t d t τ d β 1 r d r d r d p 2 d r d d t 1 ω p 1 d t d 1 ω p 1 d t d λ 1 γ t d 1 γ p 2 d p 1 d 0 γ β 1 the functions t s and i s defined by the boundary value problem of eq 18 are now given by the expressions 25 t s s γ ω 1 ω λ s γ 1 ω λ s τ d β 1 τ d s 2 i s ω p 2 d r d 0 1 ω a s s 1 ω p 1 d r d 0 1 τ d β s β τ d β 1 s β 1 a s 1 ω p 1 d r d 0 λ i γ p 2 d p 1 d t d 0 1 ω s λ s 1 γ taking into account the initial conditions it is straightforward to see that i s 0 in this case the flow rate at the wellbore in laplace space takes the form 26 q s τ d β 1 s β 2 k 1 t s t s τ d s β 1 k 0 t s for transient production decline analysis it is of particular interest to study eq 26 under the following scenarios superdiffusive transport in the fractures network stonger than subdiffusive transport in the matrix β γ 1 subdiffusive transport within the matrix stronger than superdiffusive transport in the fractures network γ β 1 equally strong super and subdiffusive transport in fractures and matrix β γ 1 it is important to emphasize that when we say that subdiffusion is stronger than superdiffusion or the other way around we mean that such transport process is farther from normal diffusion than the corresponding superdiffusive process i e the parameter quantifying subdiffusion is farther from one than the parameter quantifying superdiffusion this last parameter corresponds to the order of the mittag leffler function and coincides with the exponent of its power law asymptotic form using the initial conditions of eq 17 and the composition formulas for fractional operators eq 24 can be written as a system of fractional evolution equations 27 τ d β ω 2 p 2 d t d 2 ω 2 β p 2 d t d 2 β τ d β λ 2 γ p 2 d t d 2 γ τ d β 1 1 r d r d r d p 2 d r d 1 ω 2 β p 1 d t d 2 β τ d β λ 2 γ p 1 d t d 2 γ 1 ω p 1 d t d λ 1 γ t d 1 γ p 2 d p 1 d 0 γ β 1 notice that eq 27 reduces to the telegraphic double porosity model studied at ref hernández et al 2013 for β γ 1 for a detailed deduction of eq 27 see appendix b a first thing to notice about eq 27 is that for β γ there is a specific value for τ d which uncouple the fractures and matrix dynamics this value is given by τ d 1 ω λ 1 β and marks the moment at which the system start behaving as a single porosity medium see section 5 and ref hernández et al 2013 discussion writing this value in dimensional form gives a characteristic time scale for pressure dynamics in fractured porous media τ m μ ϕ 1 c 1 k 1 α 1 β moreover taking into account that matrix blocks average surface area 1 α is related to their characteristic length scales l c by the euclidean scaling relation g l c 2 1 α with g a geometric proportionality constant it is straightforward to see that such time scale is the solution of the following equation 28 l c 2 k 1 g μ ϕ 1 c 1 τ m β notice that eq 28 defines the time needed for a subdiffusive pressure disturbance to traverse the matrix blocks therefore τ parameter that quantifies flux relaxation and the transition from wave like to diffusive behaviour can be understood as a time scale associated to the medium heterogeneities in particular when it is associated to the main heterogeneities of the fractured porous media in this case the matrix we have τ τ m an interesting consequence of the existence of τ m is that an effective single porosity evolution equation can be constructed in order to describe the long time dynamics of double porosity systems this idea is discussed in appendix c for a completely impermeable matrix or zero interporosity flow i e for λ 0 τ must be associated with a different type of heterogeneity like fracture intersections this can be done by noticing that in this case eq 27 becomes a fractional telegraphic equation the transport properties associated to this equation were studied in ref compte and metzler 1997 where among other things it is shown that for t τ a constant speed propagation is the main transport mechanism in our case such speed takes the following form c k μ τ ϕ 2 c 2 hence trough the equation c τ l c with l c a characteristic spatial scale of the medium heterogeneities τ can be written as 29 τ μ l c 2 ϕ 2 c 2 k the above expression quantifies the time needed for an isotropic pressure disturbance moving at constant speed to traverse the heterogeneities responsible for the beginning of its superdiffusive or dispersive behaviour e g the time needed for the pressure disturbance to encounter the first intersections between fractures when the characteristic length scales of eqs 28 and 29 are similar and given the enormous difference usually encountered between fractures network and rock matrix permeabilities it is straightforward to see that τ τ m moreover taking into account that the characteristic length scale of eq 29 is usually unknown and that matrix blocks are the main heterogeneities of naturally fractured porous media and are explicitly included in the model τ can be taken as a free parameter with upper bound given by τ m for a permeable matrix and γ β τ m takes the form 30 τ m μ ϕ 1 c 1 k 1 α 1 γ in section 5 we show that through transient production decline analysis it is possible to find and approximate value for τ hence the spatial scale of the heterogeneities responsible for the emergence of the pressure dispersive behaviour could be estimated using non local diffusive models for λ 0 the long time evolution of eq 24 and its fractional form eq 27 are given by the fractional wave equation shneider and wyss 1989 which has been associated to wave propagation in fractal domains and viscoelastic media mainardi 2010 metzler and nonnenmacher 2002 west and nonnenmacher 2001 under this interpretation and the results discussed at ref hernández et al 2013 an expression relating β and some fractal measures of the network can be obtained 31 β 2 1 d d f where d denotes the network backbone chemical dimension and d f the network backbone mass fractal dimension ben avraham and havlin 2000 given that 0 β 1 eq 31 if valid could be applied only to fracture networks with 1 2 d d f 1 notice that if equations 29 and 31 are taken into account the parameters responsible for anomalous transport in the gdpm can be written in terms of well defined physical and geometrical quantities whose values could be estimated trough transient production decline analysis and proper fitting to real data additionally when writing the model in fractional form it is necessary to include the pressure rate of change respect time as an initial condition this physical piece of information an obviously important one for accurate prediction at short times in field tests is usually missing in standard diffusive models regarding the initial conditions associated to decline curve analysis the fractional derivatives of eq 27 can be taken as riemann liouville or caputo fractional derivatives however for different initial conditions the model should be written in terms of caputo fractional derivatives see appendix b finally it is important to remark that the interpretation of τ as a time scale associated to the medium heterogeneities is in accordance with other works berkowitz et al 2006 dentz and tartakovsky 2006 however in the same context of porous media different interpretations of this parameter has been used in particular in ref pascal 1986 an alternative form of the telegraphic model for pressure evolution in porous media was proposed using this alternative form of the telegraphic model in section 4 2 1 we give a different interpretation of eq 24 and show that sub ballistic diffusion in fractured media could be associated to heterogeneous media with scale free permeability distributions 4 2 1 alternative interpretation of gdpm with mittag leffler memory kernel in the former sections time non locality and τ were associated to medium heterogeneities here they are considered to be a consequence of the fluid inertial properties as we will show this idea allows to construct a link between the mittag leffler and exponential kernels that goes beyond the mere mathematical generalization moreover it permits to identify the long time power law decay of a memory kernel and its associated superdiffusive properties with the average transport behaviour in an heterogeneous medium with a scale free permeability distribution consider the isotropic dimensional form of eq 24 for β 1 and τ k 2 ν ϕ 2 where k 2 denotes the fractures network permeability and ν the fluid kinematic viscosity given by ν μ ρ with ρ the fluid mass density then the gdpm is given by the following expressions 32 ϕ 2 c 2 p 2 t ϕ 2 ρ 0 t exp t t τ 2 p 2 d t ϕ 1 c 1 p 1 t τ k 2 ν ϕ 2 ϕ 1 c 1 p 1 t k 1 α μ 1 γ t 1 γ p 2 p 1 notice that the fractures network permeability appears only in the exponential kernel and that the system dynamics is essentially τ independent for t τ this can be easily seen in laplace space the differential form of eq 32 is again a fractional telegraphic model 33 ρ c 2 2 p 2 t 2 k 1 α ρ μ ϕ 2 2 γ p 2 t 2 γ μ ϕ 2 c 2 k 2 p 2 t 1 r d r d r d p 2 d r d k 1 α ρ ϕ 2 μ 2 γ p 1 t 2 γ μ ϕ 1 c 1 k 2 p 1 t ϕ 1 c 1 p 1 t k 1 α μ 1 γ t 1 γ p 2 p 1 which for a completely impermeable matrix gives the same evolution equation used in ref pascal 1986 for studying pressure wave propagation in porous media moreover for γ 1 it reduces to the usual double porosity model when τ t for an heterogeneous fractures network with a wide range of local permeability values a way of describing pressure dynamics is through the ensemble average of eq 32 over a proper permeability distribution 34 ϕ 2 c 2 p 2 t ϕ 2 ρ 0 t exp t t τ 2 p 2 d t ϕ 1 c 1 p 1 t τ k 2 ν ϕ 2 ϕ 1 c 1 p 1 t k 1 α μ 1 γ t 1 γ p 2 p 1 notice that if the permeability distribution is scale free τ inherits this property and the system dynamics within the fractures network evolves without any characteristic time scale giving rise to the typical scenario for anomalous transport emergence pagnini 2014 now because of the telegraphic nature of eq 32 the system short time evolution t τ is given by a pressure wave driven by the fluid density and medium compressibility whereas for long times it evolves trough a diffusive process controlled by the medium permeability therefore for t τ eq 34 short time behaviour can be approximated by 35 ϕ 2 c 2 p 2 t ϕ 2 ρ 0 t ξ t t 2 p 2 d t ϕ 1 c 1 p 1 t ϕ 1 c 1 p 1 t k 1 α μ 1 γ t 1 γ p 2 p 1 where ξ t is the ensemble average of the memory kernel 36 ξ t t exp ν ϕ 2 t t k 2 using the following distribution for eq 36 explicit evaluation 37 λ β k 2 1 π k 0 k 0 k 2 β 1 sin β π 1 2 k 0 k 2 β cos β π k 0 k 2 2 β 0 β 1 where k 0 is a free parameter with permeability units we have 38 ξ t t 0 λ β k 2 exp ν ϕ 2 t t k 2 d k 2 0 κ β ξ exp ν ϕ 2 ξ k 0 t t d ξ where ξ k 0 k 2 and κ β ξ is a dimensionless probability density given by 39 κ β ξ 1 π sin β π ξ β 1 1 2 ξ β cos π β ξ 2 β the function κ β ξ is a well known probability density in the fractional kinetics literature mainardi and gorenflo 2007 pagnini 2014 and has the following property 40 0 κ β ξ exp ξ t d ξ e β t β where e β t is the mittag leffler function hence the approximate average behaviour of a pressure disturbance propagating in an heterogeneous double porosity medium with a permeability distribution given by eq 37 would be given by 41 ϕ 2 c 2 p 2 t ϕ 2 ρ 0 t e β t t τ 0 β 2 p 2 d t ϕ 1 c 1 p 1 t τ 0 k 0 ν ϕ 2 ϕ 1 c 1 p 1 t k 1 α μ 1 γ t 1 γ p 2 p 1 notice that eq 41 is an alternative form of the gdpm discussed in the previous section and as previously stated for a completely impermeable matrix this model has a long time superdiffusive behaviour and a differential form given by a generalized telegraphic equation whose long time evolution is controlled by the fractional wave equation see eq 27 although the approximation used to obtain eq 41 form eq 34 is uncontrolled and not rigorously justified from a mathematical perspective we think it gives and appealing and worth exploring explanation for the emergence of superdiffusive behaviour in heterogeneous fractured porous media i e the existence of a heavy tail or scale free permeability distributions the fact that λ β k 2 is indeed a particular case of these type of distributions is easily seen by realizing that for k 0 k 2 the asymptotic behaviour of eq 37 is λ β k 2 k 2 1 β and therefore k 2 writting ρ in terms of τ 0 in eq 41 allows to write the dimensionless form of eq 41 as eq 24 with λ k 1 α r w 2 k 0 and τ d τ 0 t 0 where t 0 is now defined by t 0 μ r w 2 ϕ 1 c 1 ϕ 2 c 2 k 0 4 3 mittag leffler kernel subdiffusive subdiffusive case in this section the gdpm describe a transport scenario within the fractures network given by short time normal diffusion and long time subdiffusion the explicit form of the dimensionless model is 42 ω p 2 d t d 1 γ 1 β d d t d 0 t d e β t d t τ d β 1 r d r d r d p 2 d r d d t 1 ω p 1 d t d 1 ω p 1 d t d λ 1 γ t d 1 γ p 2 d p 1 d 0 γ β 1 notice that because of the power law asymptotic behaviour of the mittag leffler function eq 42 becomes an equivalent expression to the one shown at eq 10 for long times therefore when t d τ d and 1 γ β subdiffusion inside fractures is stronger than inside the matrix whereas for β 1 γ we have the opposite situation when β 1 γ subdiffusive transport is equally strong in fractures and matrix because subdiffusion is usually associated with medium fractal properties ben avraham and havlin 2000 the free parameter τ d which corresponds to the crossover time scale from normal to subdiffusive transport could be associated with the minimum length scale at which the typical geometric features associated to fractal structures cease to exist i e the time needed for the pressure disturbance to traverse diffusively the length scales of the geometric elementary units of the medium fractal structure notice that when τ d eq 42 reduce to the usual double porosity model as far as we know the expression for the fractures pressure dynamics shown at eq 42 has not been studied in the corresponding scientific literature and although it fulfills the necessary conditions for being the long time description of a ctrw sokolov and klafter 2005 sokolov 2002 see eq 4 it must be taken with care until this is formally proved however we think it is of interest to include the equation in this work and study how a normal diffusion subdiffusion transition is seen in pressure tests like transient production decline curve analysis for this gdpm the functions t s and i s defined by the boundary value problem of eq 18 are now 43 t s s γ ω 1 ω λ s γ 1 ω λ γ 1 β s 1 τ d s β i s 1 ω γ 1 β 1 τ d s β s a s p 1 d r d 0 ω 1 ω p 2 d r d 0 a s λ 1 ω s λ s i γ p 2 d p 1 d t d 0 1 ω λ p 1 d r d 0 as before from the initial conditions corresponding to transient production decline analysis it is straightforward to see that i s 0 hence the dimensionless flow rate at the wellbore in laplace space is given by 44 q s τ d β s β 1 γ 1 β 1 s τ d β k 1 t s t s k 0 t s for this model the interpretation of τ d in relation to τ m d is also valid so for transient production decline analysis we study eq 44 behaviour for τ d τ m d 4 4 truncated power law kernel normal diffusive subdiffusive case in this section we discuss the following particular case of eq 8 45 ω p 2 d t d 1 τ d 0 t d exp t d t τ d l 1 t d t τ d i β 1 r d r d r d p 2 d r d d t 1 ω p 1 d t d 1 ω p 1 d t d λ 1 γ t d 1 γ p 2 d p 1 d 0 β γ 1 the memory kernel now given by a truncated power law has three characteristic time scales when the long time scale is τ l the kernel has the same qualitative behaviour of the mittag leffler function bounded for short times and a power law decaying for long times thus implying that at t d τ d i a crossover from ballistic to sub ballistic transport occurs as already discussed in sections 4 2 and 4 2 1 such transition between transport regimes can be understood as the heterogeneities dispersive effects on the fluid positively correlated movement or as energy dissipation effects on the fluid inertial movement through its interaction with heterogeneous porous media described by scale free permeability distributions however despite the interpretation for the sub ballistic flow regime emergence it is not physically plausible for it to maintain for very long times i e infinite correlation times or scale free permeability distributions are only ideal scenarios for this reason the long time exponential decay is included in the kernel so that when τ d l the model describes another flow regime transition at t d τ d l this time from sub ballistic to normal diffusive for this model the flow rate at the wellbore is given by the inverse laplace transform of 46 q s τ d i e ζ γ 1 β ζ k 1 t s t s τ d s ζ 1 β k 0 t s ζ τ d i s 1 τ d l with t s given by 47 t s s γ ω 1 ω λ s γ 1 ω λ τ d τ d i s ζ 1 β e ζ γ 1 β ζ where γ is the incomplete gamma function for transient production decline analysis we study the inverse laplace transform of eq 46 as a function of the model parameters and in accordance with the previous discussions we take τ d l τ m d and τ d i τ m d because now it is not clear how to choose τ d we assume it is a generalized geometric average of the long and intermediate time scales τ d τ d i ξ τ d l 2 ξ with ξ 0 2 and study the effects of varying ξ 5 transient production decline analysis numerical results in this section we show the numerical result obtained from studying eq 21 for each kernel discussed at section 4 the flow in dimensionless time was obtainded through the stehfest algorithm stehfest 1970 and its behaviour as a function of β and γ analysed in all figures the discontinuous black dotted blue and dot dashed gray lines are associated to the smallest medium and biggest values in the parameters varied vertical lines indicate the characteristic time scales τ d τ d i and τ m d the numerical values of such time scales were chosen so that different flow regimes were clearly differentiated in the figures but always taking as upper bound τ m d in figs 2 and 3 we show flow behaviour of gdpm with long time subdiffusion in the fractures network η 1 whereas in figs 4 and 5 flow associated to models describing intermediate and long time superdiffusion η 0 is presented in every figure the flow corresponding to the warren and root classical model is included for comparison notice that a clear qualitative difference between the flow in both pairs of figures is clearly seen in figs 2 and 3 the flow start at a maximum value for small times and decreases monotonically always taking values below the classical behaviour on the other hand in figs 4 and 5 the flow is zero at t d 0 and increases in time until a maximum is reached then depending on how strong matrix subdiffusion is it starts decaying taking values above or below the prediction of the classical model the short time differences between flow rate behaviour for gdpm with η 1 or η 0 are due to the fact that in the subdiffusive cases and because of the strong gradient imposed at the inner domain boundary at zero time the flow is infinite at t 0 whereas for the superdiffusive flow models we have a delay flow response with vanishing flow at zero time in fig 2 we show the results obtained from the power law memory kernel in this model the only characteristic time scale is τ m d and is marked with a vertical line notice that as expected the vertical lines always appear at the end of the flow regime associated to matrix production indicating the beginning of the system homogeneous response this is particularly clear in fig 2b and e where the only parameter varied is γ notice also that for decreasing γ values matrix production regime becomes longer and its slope steeper in fig 3 fluid flow behaviour corresponding to the mittag leffler memory kernel with η 1 is presented contrary to the power law kernel case here there are two vertical lines in the figures one for τ d when a transition from normal diffusion to subdiffusion occur and τ m d as before notice that τ m d coincide with the end of the matrix production regime and the duration of such flow regime increases while its slope decreases for decreasing γ values i e as matrix subdiffusion becomes stronger on the other hand note that for different β values the system behaviour is affected at all times with a considerable decrease in flow as this parameter increases see fig 3c this behaviour is also observed in fig 2 with the difference that for the power law kernel case fractures subdiffusion is stronger for decreasing β values interestingly when t τ d there is no sign of the transition between normal and subdiffusive regimes in flow behaviour as will be discussed shortly this is not the case for the models with η 0 where flow regime transitions can be clearly distinguished in fig 3d flow behaviour from power law and mittag leffler models with η 1 are plotted for comparison notice that both models coincide at long times when the subdiffusive regime is established the magnitude difference between the classical flow regime and the mittag leffler model at short times is a consequence of the value chosen for the time scale associated with the transition from normal diffusion to subdiffusion τ d 10 recall that this gdpm reduces to the warren and root model when τ d this can be seen in fig 3e and f in fig 4 we show the results obtained from the mittag leffler memory kernel with η 0 as before these figures show that the beginning of the system homogeneous response coincides with τ m d and that as γ decreases this flow regime appears at later times this is particularly clear in fig 4b and e however because of the long time superdiffusive behaviour of the model when t d τ m d the predicted flow is always above the classical value moreover contrary to flow behaviour during matrix production in the previous subdiffusive models here the slope associated to such flow regime is positive and increases for decreasing β values hence as superdiffusion increases matrix production increases and its flow regime becomes steeper when plotted as a function of time a clear interplay between matrix subdiffusive and fractures superdiffusive flow regimes can be seen in fig 4b where the flow during the matrix production regime is stronger or weaker than the classical prediction according to the values of β and γ i e is stronger or weaker than the classical prediction depending on the competition between superdiffusive and subdiffusive effects in fractures and matrix the vertical blue solid lines in the figures correspond to t d τ d when the transition from ballistic to sub ballistic flow regimes occur in all cases τ d 10 notice that when t d τ d i e when the pressure disturbance propagates as a wave with a velocity that does not depend on β see the discussion regarding eq 29 the flow is essentially β independent notice also that at t d τ d there is an inflection point where the concavity of the flow curves change this implies that by analysing real flow time series and their second derivative the value of τ could be estimated and through such value and eq 29 it could be possible to find the approximate length scales of the heterogeneities responsible for the beginning of the dispersive flow regime for the alternative interpretation of the model an estimation of τ would allow to find a numerical value for k 0 the free parameter of the probability distribution shown at eq 37 and used for the ensemble average of the heterogeneous system with such a value an estimation of statistical measures like the median and mode for the medium permeability distribution could be obtained in fig 5 we show the flow corresponding to the truncated power law kernel its qualitative behaviour for t d τ d l τ m d is similar to the one shown in fig 4 but in this case the transition from ballistic to sub ballistic flow regimes occurs at t d τ d i notice that at this specific time there is also an inflection point with a concavity change in the flow curves however unlike the previous models in this case the flow is more sensitive to changes in γ values see fig 5b this is because τ d is taken as a generalized geometric average of τ d l and τ d i τ d τ d i ξ τ d l 2 ξ hence it becomes an implicit function of γ also through eq 21 it is easy to see that τ d directly affects the flow magnitude at all times see for example figs 5 and 6 for every curve in fig 5 the intermediate and long characteristic time scales values are τ d l τ m d and τ d i 10 the values of τ d were calculated with ξ 1 5 in fig 5 the value of ξ was chosen in order to show that for t d τ d l the model recover the classical normal diffusive flow behaviour and that even with the existence of intermediate time superdiffusive flow regimes the flow can take values above or below the classical long time prediction fig 5a c leaving the positive slope of the matrix production regime as the only unequivocal feature associated to superdiffusive flow regimes finally in fig 6 we show flow behaviour as a function of ξ 6 conclusions in this work we propose several models of anomalous flow for naturally fractured porous media and discuss different physical interpretations for their relevant parameters in particular we show that the characteristic time scales of the models can be associated to characteristic length scales of the porous medium heterogeneities or in some cases with the inertial properties of the fluid these interpretations have interesting results in terms of pressure tests applications and allow the construction of an effective single porosity model for double porosity systems moreover we show that a particular equation previously proposed in the anomalous diffusion literature as a plausible model for superdiffusion and as a generalization of the cattaneo equation compte and metzler 1997 can be associated to flow behaviour in heterogeneous porous media described by a scale free permeability distribution although the emergence of supperdiffusive flow behaviour as a consequence of a heavy tail permeability distribution is obtained from a particular model we believe it is a more general result this will be addressed in future work in the context of pressure tests we show that in transient production decline analysis the slope of the matrix production regime is a good indicator to establish the existence of anomalous diffusion negative slopes can be associated to subdiffusive flow regimes whereas positive slopes to superdiffusive regimes in both cases more pronounced slopes correspond to more anomalous diffusive behaviours in this same context we propose that through the estimation of the models time scales which can be done by looking for the existence of inflection points in the flow time series and the usual fitting to model curves like the ones shown at section 5 the length scales of the system main heterogeneities and some statistical measures of the permeability distribution could be obtained these result and their future theoretical development could be useful for describing aquifers and oil reservoirs when the usual warren and root or multirate double porosity models give poor results finally notice that the used kernels and their interpretation in terms of anomalous flow and characteristic time scales can also be used for studying different interporosity flows associated to anomalous behaviour within the matrix this will be addressed in future work credit authorship contribution statement d hernández conceptualization

the definition notation and principal properties of the fractional operators are given the material presented herein was taken from refs podlubny 1999 mainardi 1995 mainardi and gorenflo 2007 throughout this section the function f t is assumed integrable and continious and if required sufficiently smooth the integral of order p or p fold integration is defined as a 1 a i t p f t 1 γ p a t

important property a 3 a i t p a i t q f t a i t p q f t p q 0 notice that eq a 3 implies that integrations of arbitrary order commute differentiation of order p with p any real number is defined through the riemann liouville fractional derivative whose explicit form is given by the following expression a 4 a d t p f t 1 γ k p d k d t k a t t η k p 1 f η d η k 1 p k with k a natural number the riemann liouville fractional derivative can be seen as an interpolation between consecutive ordinary differential operators and generalizes several of their properties for example the fractional derivative of a power law is given by a 5 a d t p t a ν γ 1 ν γ 1 ν p t a ν p ν 1 moreover using the definitions of p fold integration and differentiation it can be shown that a generalized version of the fundamental theorem of calculus is valid a 6 a d t p a i t p f t f t and that as in classical calculus p fold integration and differentiation do not commute as the following expression shows a 7 a

appears as initial conditions for time evolution equations for this reason an alternative fractional diffentiation known as caputo fractional derivative is often used in those cases and is given by a

for simplicity a 20 0 d t p f t d p f t d t p 0 i t p f t i p f t appendix b deduction of the fractional telegraphic form of the gdpm with mittag leffler kernel the first step needed to transform eq 24 into a fractional telegraphic double porosity model is the application of the riemann liouville fractional differential operator of order β to the evolution equation for p 2 d and after using the formula shown at eq a 13 it follows that b 1 ω 1 β p 2 d t d 1 β ω γ β p 2 d r d 0 t d β 1 1 τ d h t d 1 ω β t d β p 1 d t d where h t d is given by b 2 h t d 1 γ 1 β d d t d 0 t d t d η β 0 η e β η t

be shown that each of the terms composing i c are zero hence for the application discussed in this work i c 0 therefore the fractional derivative representation of eq 24 under pressure test condition

effective single porosity model for the description of double porosity systems the ideas discussed herein are only valid when β γ and η 0 although for brevity and clarity of exposition we only discuss the case corresponding to β γ 1 i e the telegraphic double porosity model hernández et al 2013 we start with the dimensional form of eq 24 with β 1 and τ τ m c 1 ϕ 2 c 2 p 2 t k μ τ m 0 t exp t t τ m 2 p 2 r t d t ϕ 1 c 1 p 1 t ϕ 1 c 1 p 1 t k 1 α μ p 2 p 1 τ m μ ϕ 1 c 1 k 1 α writting eq c 1 in differential form and recalling that for τ τ m the evolution equations for the matrix and fractures network become uncouple equations it follows that fractures network pressure dynamic behaviour is given by c 2 ϕ 2 c 2 2 p 2 t 2 ϕ 2 c 2 τ m k 1 α μ p 2 t k τ m μ 2 p 2 dividing by ϕ 2 c 2 and substituting the explicit form of τ m we have c 3 2 p 2 t 2 k 1 α μ ϕ 1 c 1 ϕ 2 c 2 ϕ 1 c 1 ϕ 2 c 2 p 2 t k k 1 α ϕ 1 ϕ 2 c 1 c 2 μ 2 2 p 2 now writing a non local effective equation as c 4 ϕ e c e p

ϕ 2 c 2 k e k τ e μ k 1 α ϕ 1 c 1 ϕ 2 c 2 ϕ 1 c 1 ϕ 2 c 2 notice that eq c 6 allow to define the following effective coefficients for the non local model c 7 ϕ e ϕ 2 c 1 c 2 ϕ 1 τ e ϕ 2 ϕ e τ m with the effective compressibility and permeability taking the same values of the fractured medium i e c e c 2 and k e k it is interesting to note that contrary to the usual approach of finding an effective permeability for the description of a double porosity media through a single porosity model here an effective porosity and characteristic time scale are used for the same purpose notice that the effective coefficients are defined in terms of the physical properties of the matrix effective equations like eq c 5 could be useful for exploring different definitions of effective parameters describing complex porous media and for accelerating the numerical implementations of their respective models 
341,in this work different generalized double porosity models for anomalous fluid flow in fractured porous media are presented and transient production decline applications discussed the effects of subdiffusive and superdiffusive flows in fracture networks coupled to subdiffusive transport inside the matrix are explored and some insights into how to identify these types of flow in geological formations like aquifers and oil fields through transient production decline analysis are given additionally we discuss different interpretations of the models parameters that allow under the same analysis to estimate the length scales of the system main heterogeneities moreover we show that superdiffusive flow regimes could be a consequence of highly heterogeneous porous systems described by scale free permeability distributions finally we show that the use of non local models of the type herein discussed admit a novel way to construct effective single porosity models for the long time description of double porosity systems keywords anomalous transport double porosity fluid flow non local diffusion porous media 1 introduction the advection diffusion equation paradigm for modelling transport phenomena has been tremendously successful in many branches of scientific knowledge and their respective applications in particular it permitted the construction of a firm theoretical basis for transport phenomena and pressure spatio temporal dynamics in porous media with applications ranging from geophysical characterization of geological formations like aquifers and oil fields and the description of contaminant dispersion in underground water berkowitz et al 2008 sahimi 1995 bear 1971 to improved catalysis in heterogeneous chemical reactors gogate 2016 keil 2013 waclawek et al 2018 and drug release from porous reservoirs or membranes winters 2009 spiepmann and siepmann 2008 however since the second half of last century it became clear that such paradigm has serious drawbacks when applied to situations with strong spatial disorder e g porous media with heterogeneities at a wide range of length scales or long range spatial correlations in some of its physical properties like permeability ben avraham and havlin 2000 bouchaud and georges 1990 dykhne et al 2005 hernández et al 2018 matheron and de marsily 1980 as a consequence alternative models to the advection diffusion equation have been proposed in order to improve the description of transport processes in this type of medium and shed light into the physical mechanisms responsible for transport anomalies berkowitz et al 2006 berkowitz and scher 1998 hernández coronado et al 2012 herrera hernández et al 2013 metzler and klafter 2000 o shaughnessy and procaccia 1985 scher et al 2002 tartakovsky et al 2008 among such anomalies the temporal behaviour of the dispersion suffered by the transported quantity e g chemical substances tracers or pressure disturbances is the most recognized and typically takes the following asymptotic form in unbounded domains 1 r 2 t r t 2 t α α 1 where 2 r i t r n ρ r t r i d ω i 1 2 n n in eq 2 ρ r t denotes the concentration at time t of the transported quantity at a spatial location given by r whereas r 2 and r 2 denotes respectively the squared euclidean norm of the position vector and its average 1 in eq 1 α is usually called anomalous exponent and classifies diffusion processes in two broad transport regimes superdiffusive for α 1 and subdiffusive when α 1 among the generalized diffusion advection equations that have been proposed for transport regimes characterized by eq 1 del castillo negrete 2010 dentz and tartakovsky 2006 hernández coronado et al 2012 herrera hernández et al 2013 mosco 1997 o shaughnessy and procaccia 1985 the most successful in terms of predictions and understanding of such processes are based on continuous time random walks ctrw and the generalized master equation gme berkowitz et al 2006 dentz and tartakovsky 2006 klafter and silbey 1980 metzler and klafter 2000 scher et al 2002 under the assumption of statistical independence between waiting times and jumps and a symmetric jump probability density with finite variance the ctrw formalism allows the deduction of the following equivalent forms of a generalized diffusion equation sokolov and klafter 2005 3 0 t κ t t ρ r t t d t d 2 ρ and 4 ρ t d d d t 0 t k t t 2 ρ d t the above expressions are non local in time evolution equations and d a parameter whose physical interpretation depends on the memory kernel details and the transported quantity and usually taken as a generalized permeability or diffusion coefficient eq 3 is known as the normal form of the generalized diffusion equation whereas eq 4 is usually referred as the modified form the integral kernel of both equations contain the information of the system disorder and are related to the waiting time probability density ψ t of ctrw formalism through well defined mathematical expressions berkowitz et al 2006 klafter and silbey 1980 sokolov and klafter 2005 for power law kernels eqs 3 and 4 give rise to the well known fractional subdiffusion equations in terms of caputo and riemman liouville fractional derivates metzler and klafter 2000 2004 on the other hand it is well known that ctrw basic theory is equivalent to the gme formalism which describe the typical behaviour of a transported quantity in a disordered medium klafter and silbey 1980 for constant transition probabilities between adjacent sites the continuum limit of this equation can be written as 5 ρ t d 0 t m t t 2 ρ d t where the memory kernel and the waiting time probability density are related through the following expression in laplace space kenkre et al 1973 berkowitz et al 2006 6 m s s ψ s 1 ψ s however eq 5 has a more general footing than uncouple ctrw theory allowing the description of correlated and wave like propagating phenomena associated with superdifussive transport like sub ballistic and ballistic superdiffusion metzler and klafter 2000 metzler and nonnenmacher 2002 west et al 1997 this type of transport would be expected for pressure disturbance propagation in fluid saturated fractured porous media particularly in situations where strong pressure gradients or fluid discharge are imposed at some parts of the domain boundary as occur in pressure tests a type of field test designed to characterize geological formations like aquifers and oil fields and to predict their behaviour under exploitation da prat 1990 prats et al 2020 nonetheless pressure behaviour in fractured media is usually described through normal diffusive double porosity models or generalized and multirate double porosity models which only include the possibility of subdiffusive transport yin et al 2020 da prat 1990 prats et al 2020 barenblatt et al 1960 warren and root 1963 gerke and van genuchten 1993 chang and yortsos 1990 haggerty and gorenlick 1995 dentz and berkowitz 2003 on the other hand the few works that do address superdiffusive transport in this context raghavan et al 2017 raghavan and chen 2017 usually use space fractional operators for its description with the underlying assumption of scale free displacements lévy flights as the cause of anomalous behaviour therefore in this work we propose a generalization of the double porosity model that allow ballistic and sub ballistic superdiffusion through the fractures network and subdiffusive transport inside the matrix the type of superdiffusion herein considered is not related to lévy flights and its description does not include space fractional operators instead anomalous transport is modeled by using eqs 4 and 5 with different kernels some of which have been discussed in the literature but not applied to any specific problem in this regard it is important to have in mind that the memory kernels associated with superdiffusive motion are dangerous in the sense that they do not guarantee the positivity of the solutions of the gme for all spatial dimentions parameter values and all initial and boundary conditions kenkre et al 1973 sokolov 2002 nevertheless we think it will be useful to explore these type of dynamics in the context of fluid saturated fractured porous media and pressure tests although several kernels are discussed the main focus of the work are the models corresponding to the mittag leffler memory kernels their interpretation and implications for transport processes in fractured porous media and pressure tests the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the generalized double porosity model gdpm is presented and a brief discussion of the used kernels and their corresponding transport properties are given in section 3 pressure tests under consideration are discussed including the general solution of the gdpm for such tests in section 4 the gdpm is interpreted and analysed under pressure test conditions for each memory kernel in particular we show that for a mittag leffler kernel the model can be written as a fractional telegraphic double porosity model in section 5 the results associated to pressure tests are presented and analysed under the conceptual framework of previous sections and finally in section 6 we give some conclusions and discuss future work 2 generalized double porosity models the generalized double porosity models gdpm we discuss in this and following sections describe the spatio temporal behaviour of fluid pressure within fluid saturated fractured porous media fig 1 and are particular cases of the expression 7 ϕ 2 c 2 p 2 t τ γ

β t 1 τ f β t τ i t τ l with τ i and τ l specific and model dependent intermediate and long characteristic time scales the parameters denoted by τ and τ 1 are time scales introduced for dimensional reasons and to avoid the use of generalized permeabilities for kernels with only one characteristic time scale we assume that m β t 1 τ f β t τ and show that τ can be attached with different physical meanings depending on the time non locality interpretation it can be associated either with the medium heterogeneities and fractal geometric characteristics or the fluid inertial properties matrix dynamics is defined in terms of a riemann liouville fractional derivative implying that throughout this work transport inside the matrix is assumed subdiffusive for γ 1 or normal diffusive when γ 1 for γ 1 τ 1 can be associated with the waiting time distribution underlying matrix subdiffusive dynamics metzler and klafter 2000 for similar descriptions of pressure subdiffusive behaviour in fractured porous media see refs raghavan et al 2017 raghavan and chen 2020 notice that for η 0 γ 1 and a kernel given by a dirac delta function eq 7 gives the usual local form of the double porosity

1 m t d τ d β t d β 1 0 β 1 this kernel gives a purely fractional gdpm with subdiffusive dynamics metzler and klafter 2000 as already mentioned in this case there are no characteristic time scales so we take τ d τ d i τ d l 1 η 1 m β t d γ β τ d γ 1 β e β t d τ d β 0 β 1 here e β t denotes the mittag leffler function a well known generalization of the exponential function see appendix a the gamma functions appearing as factors of the mittag leffler function are introduced in order to obtain an asymptotic fractional subdiffusion equation for long times this will be clarified in sections 4 3 and 5 η 0 m t d 1 τ d e β t d τ d β 0 β 1 the gdpm associated with this kernel can be written as a fractional telegraphic equation and reduces to the telegraphic double porosity model for β 1 compte and metzler 1997 hernández et al 2013 its transport regimes are ballistic and sub ballistic i e superdiffusive η 0 m β t d 1 t d τ d i β exp t d τ d l τ d 0 β 1 for this kernel there are three different time scales with their associated dimensionless parameters τ d i τ d l and τ d the intermediate and long characteristic time scales control the beginning of the inverse power law behaviour and the crossover from the inverse power law to the exponential kernel decay the remaining time scale is treated as a generalized geometric average of the other two see section 4 4 the transport regimes associated to this kernel are ballistic sub ballistic and normal diffusive with the exception of the gdpm with mittag leffler memory kernel and η 1 the evolution equations associated with each kernel and zero interporosity flow λ 0 have been proposed in the scientific literature as plausible models for anomalous diffusion compte and metzler 1997 metzler and klafter 2000 and in some cases as specific models for anomalous transport in porous media dentz and tartakovsky 2006 hernández et al 2013 moreover each case represent different physical situations for η 1 and m β t d t d β 1 with 0 β 1 eq 8 describes a situation where subdiffusive transport is present in both the matrix and the fractures network and takes the form 10 ω p 2 d t 1 β t d 1 β 1 r d r d r d p 2 d r d 1 ω p 1 d t d 1 ω p 1 d t d λ 1 γ t d 1 γ p 2 d p 1 d 0 γ β 1 on the other hand the model corresponding to the mittag leffler memory kernel with η 0 describes a transport process with superdiffusion along the fractures network and subdiffusion inside the matrix whereas for η 1 gives normal diffusive behaviour at short times with subdiffusive dynamics at long times finally the model with the truncated power law kernel gives superdiffusive transport at short and intermediate times for the fractures network and a normal diffusive behaviour for long times due to the exponential cutoff it is important to recall that the presence of subdiffusive transport inside the matrix is a consequence of the fractional derivative in the second expression of eq 7 for γ 1 normal diffusion inside the matrix is recovered in each case the type of transport along the fractures can be seen by studying the time evolution of the pressure mean square displacement when it is not coupled to the matrix for the power law memory kernel and its associated gdpm eq 10 it is well known that when λ 0 the pressure mean square displacement is metzler and klafter 2000 11 r 2 t t β β 1 therefore as already stated eq 10 is a model for subdiffusive transport in double porosity systems for the remaining kernels which are not scale free and are bounded for short times it is straightforward to see that if η 0 and m β t d 1 τ d f β t d τ d i t d τ d l then 12 d r d 2 t d d t d 0 t d f β t d t d τ d i t d t τ d l d t d hence for t d τ d i τ d l eq 12 give short time ballistic behaviour 13 r d 2 t d t 2 on the other hand the long time behaviour of eq 12 depends on the decaying properties of the particular kernels if lim t d 0 t d f β t d t τ d i t d t τ d l d t anomalous dynamics is responsible for transport within the fractures network whereas if lim t d 0 t d f β t d t τ d t d t τ d l d t long time normal diffusive dynamics is established taking into account the asymptotic form of the the mittag leffler function e β t d τ d β t d τ d β mainardi and gorenflo 2007 eq 12 can be written as 14 d r d 2 t d d t d 0 t 0 e β 1 t d t τ d d t τ d β t 0 t d t β d t t d 1 β τ d t 0 t d therefore integrating eq 14 gives a long time superdiffusive behaviour for transport inside the fractures network i e 15 r d 2 t d t d 2 β τ d t d 0 β 1 however for the same kernel with η 1 and due to the differential operator acting on the time integral it is straightforward to see that transport is normal diffusive for short times and subdiffusive for long times for the truncated power law kernel there are three different transport regimes the first two are superdiffusive and correspond to the short time ballistic and intermediate time sub ballistic behaviours of eqs 13 and 15 the third regime associated to long times is normal diffusive i e 16 r d 2 t d t d 2 t d τ d i t d 2 β τ d i t d τ d l t d τ d l t d eqs 13 and 15 are consistent with a wave like propagating phenomena moving at well defined velocities and can be associated to few dispersive events e g few fracture intersections or crossed matrix blocks during propagation on the other hand the long time limit of eqs 11 and 16 is consistent with diffusive like propagating phenomena anomalous or normal and could be associated to many dispersive events during propagation in the following section we introduce the pressure test conditions under which the gdpm is analysed and interpreted for each kernel at section 4 3 pressure tests transient production decline analysis the field tests we are interested in are usually known as transient production decline curve analysis and are generally speaking a small subset of a group of tests designed for characterizing geological formations like aquifers and oil fields including their transport properties and future behaviour under exploitation conditions usually such tests consist on forcing initial and boundary conditions on the system through wellbore manipulations followed by the monitoring of specific observables like fluid flow or fluid pressure at definite locations for long time periods after proper treatment the obtained data are analysed and compared to known solutions of specific transport models da prat 1990 warren and root 1963 in particular for transient production decline curve analysis the pressure at the wellbore is fixed while the fluid flow at that same location monitored these conditions are particularly well suited for the mathematical structure of the gdpm and are consistent with the following initial boundary value problem 17 ω p 2 d t d τ d γ β η d η d t d η 0 t d m β t d t d 1 r d r d r d p 2 d r d d t 1 ω p 1 d t d 1 ω p 1 d t d λ 1 γ t d 1 γ p 2 d p 1 d 0 γ β 1 p i d t d 0 p i d r d 0 0 i 1 2 p 2 d 1 t d 1 notice that because eq 17 is a linear system with time convolutions it can be easily written in laplace space and solved for p 1 d giving the following boundary value problem for the fractures network pressure 18 d 2 p 2 d d r d 2 1 r d d p 2 d d r d t s p 2 d i s 0 p 2 d 1 s 1 s p 2 d s 0 where p 2 d denotes the laplace transform of p 2 d with t s and i s functions of the laplace variable the explicit form of these functions are model dependent and carries the information of the system temporal evolution as will be shown in the next section i s 0 for the considered initial conditions and kernels hence the solution of eq 18 is given by 19 p 2 d r d s k 0 t s r d s k 0 t s where k 0 x is the modified bessel function of zero order lebedev 1965 on the other hand writing the memory kernel laplace transform as m β s f β s τ d the dimensionless mass flux in laplace space at each domain point can be written as 20 j r d θ s 1 τ d τ d s γ β η f β s p 2 d r d therefore the fluid flow at the wellbore in laplace space is 21 q s 1 τ d τ d s γ β η f β s p 2 d r d r d 1 τ d s γ β η f β s k 1 t s t s τ d s k 0 t s where k 1 x is the modified bessel function of first order eq 21 was obtained through eqs 19 and 20 and known properties of the modified bessel functions lebedev 1965 notice that the fluid flow at the wellbore depends explicitly on the memory kernel implying different temporal behaviours for each type of transport in the fractures network 4 models discussion and interpretation under pressure test conditions 4 1 power law kernel subdiffusive subdiffusive case as already stated the gdpm with η 1 and m β t d t d β 1 is a model for subdiffusive transport in double porosity systems it would be associated with porous media with strong heterogeneities and tortuosities in their main transport paths or with scale free heterogeneities ben avraham and havlin 2000 klemm et al 2002 the explicit form of the model is given by eq 10 where β and γ are considered independent parameters that quantifies subdiffusion inside the fractures network and matrix hence from this model flow behaviour the following scenarios for transient production decline curve analysis can be explored β γ 1 stonger subdiffusion inside the fractures network than in the matrix γ β 1 stronger subdiffusion inside the matrix than in the fractures network γ β 1 equally strong subdiffusion in matrix and fractures network γ β 1 subdiffusion inside the matrix normal diffusion in the fractures network β γ 1 subdiffusion inside the fractures network normal diffusion in the matrix in this case the functions t s and i s defined at eq 18 have the following explicit form 22 t s ω 1 ω s γ λ 1 ω s γ λ s β i s ω s β 1 p 2 d r d 0 1 ω s β a s i β 1 r d r d r d r d p 2 d t d 0 a s 1 ω p 1 d r d 0 λ i γ p 2 d p 1 d t d 0 1 ω s λ s 1 γ where i β and i γ are fractional integral operators of order β and γ notice that for the initial conditions of eq 17 and the definition of fractional integration given in appendix a it is straightforward to see that i s 0 for this model the kernel in laplace space takes the form f s γ β s β then substituting in eq 21 gives the following expression for the flow at the wellbore 23 q s s β k 1 t s t s k 0 t s t s ω 1 ω s γ λ 1 ω s γ λ s β 4 2 mittag leffler kernel superdiffusive subdiffusive case the transport regimes associated to the gdpm with a mittag leffler memory kernel are ballistic and sub ballistic for short and long time scales in the fractures network and subdiffusive in the matrix as discussed in section 2 ballistic behaviour is associated to the bounded nature of the kernel at short times while sub ballistic diffusion is due the long time decay of the mittag leffler function see eq 15 this model would be associated to situations with strong positive correlations in the diffusive particles or fluid movement inside the fractures network it could be applied to situations with strong hydrodynamic dispersion in the case of tracer tests or strong correlations in the fluid velocity field dykhne et al 2005 hernández et al 2018 matheron and de marsily 1980 for this kernel the dimensionless form of the model is 24 ω p 2 d t d 1 τ d 0 t d e β t d t τ d β 1 r d r d r d p 2 d r d d t 1 ω p 1 d t d 1 ω p 1 d t d λ 1 γ t d 1 γ p 2 d p 1 d 0 γ β 1 the functions t s and i s defined by the boundary value problem of eq 18 are now given by the expressions 25 t s s γ ω 1 ω λ s γ 1 ω λ s τ d β 1 τ d s 2 i s ω p 2 d r d 0 1 ω a s s 1 ω p 1 d r d 0 1 τ d β s β τ d β 1 s β 1 a s 1 ω p 1 d r d 0 λ i γ p 2 d p 1 d t d 0 1 ω s λ s 1 γ taking into account the initial conditions it is straightforward to see that i s 0 in this case the flow rate at the wellbore in laplace space takes the form 26 q s τ d β 1 s β 2 k 1 t s t s τ d s β 1 k 0 t s for transient production decline analysis it is of particular interest to study eq 26 under the following scenarios superdiffusive transport in the fractures network stonger than subdiffusive transport in the matrix β γ 1 subdiffusive transport within the matrix stronger than superdiffusive transport in the fractures network γ β 1 equally strong super and subdiffusive transport in fractures and matrix β γ 1 it is important to emphasize that when we say that subdiffusion is stronger than superdiffusion or the other way around we mean that such transport process is farther from normal diffusion than the corresponding superdiffusive process i e the parameter quantifying subdiffusion is farther from one than the parameter quantifying superdiffusion this last parameter corresponds to the order of the mittag leffler function and coincides with the exponent of its power law asymptotic form using the initial conditions of eq 17 and the composition formulas for fractional operators eq 24 can be written as a system of fractional evolution equations 27 τ d β ω 2 p 2 d t d 2 ω 2 β p 2 d t d 2 β τ d β λ 2 γ p 2 d t d 2 γ τ d β 1 1 r d r d r d p 2 d r d 1 ω 2 β p 1 d t d 2 β τ d β λ 2 γ p 1 d t d 2 γ 1 ω p 1 d t d λ 1 γ t d 1 γ p 2 d p 1 d 0 γ β 1 notice that eq 27 reduces to the telegraphic double porosity model studied at ref hernández et al 2013 for β γ 1 for a detailed deduction of eq 27 see appendix b a first thing to notice about eq 27 is that for β γ there is a specific value for τ d which uncouple the fractures and matrix dynamics this value is given by τ d 1 ω λ 1 β and marks the moment at which the system start behaving as a single porosity medium see section 5 and ref hernández et al 2013 discussion writing this value in dimensional form gives a characteristic time scale for pressure dynamics in fractured porous media τ m μ ϕ 1 c 1 k 1 α 1 β moreover taking into account that matrix blocks average surface area 1 α is related to their characteristic length scales l c by the euclidean scaling relation g l c 2 1 α with g a geometric proportionality constant it is straightforward to see that such time scale is the solution of the following equation 28 l c 2 k 1 g μ ϕ 1 c 1 τ m β notice that eq 28 defines the time needed for a subdiffusive pressure disturbance to traverse the matrix blocks therefore τ parameter that quantifies flux relaxation and the transition from wave like to diffusive behaviour can be understood as a time scale associated to the medium heterogeneities in particular when it is associated to the main heterogeneities of the fractured porous media in this case the matrix we have τ τ m an interesting consequence of the existence of τ m is that an effective single porosity evolution equation can be constructed in order to describe the long time dynamics of double porosity systems this idea is discussed in appendix c for a completely impermeable matrix or zero interporosity flow i e for λ 0 τ must be associated with a different type of heterogeneity like fracture intersections this can be done by noticing that in this case eq 27 becomes a fractional telegraphic equation the transport properties associated to this equation were studied in ref compte and metzler 1997 where among other things it is shown that for t τ a constant speed propagation is the main transport mechanism in our case such speed takes the following form c k μ τ ϕ 2 c 2 hence trough the equation c τ l c with l c a characteristic spatial scale of the medium heterogeneities τ can be written as 29 τ μ l c 2 ϕ 2 c 2 k the above expression quantifies the time needed for an isotropic pressure disturbance moving at constant speed to traverse the heterogeneities responsible for the beginning of its superdiffusive or dispersive behaviour e g the time needed for the pressure disturbance to encounter the first intersections between fractures when the characteristic length scales of eqs 28 and 29 are similar and given the enormous difference usually encountered between fractures network and rock matrix permeabilities it is straightforward to see that τ τ m moreover taking into account that the characteristic length scale of eq 29 is usually unknown and that matrix blocks are the main heterogeneities of naturally fractured porous media and are explicitly included in the model τ can be taken as a free parameter with upper bound given by τ m for a permeable matrix and γ β τ m takes the form 30 τ m μ ϕ 1 c 1 k 1 α 1 γ in section 5 we show that through transient production decline analysis it is possible to find and approximate value for τ hence the spatial scale of the heterogeneities responsible for the emergence of the pressure dispersive behaviour could be estimated using non local diffusive models for λ 0 the long time evolution of eq 24 and its fractional form eq 27 are given by the fractional wave equation shneider and wyss 1989 which has been associated to wave propagation in fractal domains and viscoelastic media mainardi 2010 metzler and nonnenmacher 2002 west and nonnenmacher 2001 under this interpretation and the results discussed at ref hernández et al 2013 an expression relating β and some fractal measures of the network can be obtained 31 β 2 1 d d f where d denotes the network backbone chemical dimension and d f the network backbone mass fractal dimension ben avraham and havlin 2000 given that 0 β 1 eq 31 if valid could be applied only to fracture networks with 1 2 d d f 1 notice that if equations 29 and 31 are taken into account the parameters responsible for anomalous transport in the gdpm can be written in terms of well defined physical and geometrical quantities whose values could be estimated trough transient production decline analysis and proper fitting to real data additionally when writing the model in fractional form it is necessary to include the pressure rate of change respect time as an initial condition this physical piece of information an obviously important one for accurate prediction at short times in field tests is usually missing in standard diffusive models regarding the initial conditions associated to decline curve analysis the fractional derivatives of eq 27 can be taken as riemann liouville or caputo fractional derivatives however for different initial conditions the model should be written in terms of caputo fractional derivatives see appendix b finally it is important to remark that the interpretation of τ as a time scale associated to the medium heterogeneities is in accordance with other works berkowitz et al 2006 dentz and tartakovsky 2006 however in the same context of porous media different interpretations of this parameter has been used in particular in ref pascal 1986 an alternative form of the telegraphic model for pressure evolution in porous media was proposed using this alternative form of the telegraphic model in section 4 2 1 we give a different interpretation of eq 24 and show that sub ballistic diffusion in fractured media could be associated to heterogeneous media with scale free permeability distributions 4 2 1 alternative interpretation of gdpm with mittag leffler memory kernel in the former sections time non locality and τ were associated to medium heterogeneities here they are considered to be a consequence of the fluid inertial properties as we will show this idea allows to construct a link between the mittag leffler and exponential kernels that goes beyond the mere mathematical generalization moreover it permits to identify the long time power law decay of a memory kernel and its associated superdiffusive properties with the average transport behaviour in an heterogeneous medium with a scale free permeability distribution consider the isotropic dimensional form of eq 24 for β 1 and τ k 2 ν ϕ 2 where k 2 denotes the fractures network permeability and ν the fluid kinematic viscosity given by ν μ ρ with ρ the fluid mass density then the gdpm is given by the following expressions 32 ϕ 2 c 2 p 2 t ϕ 2 ρ 0 t exp t t τ 2 p 2 d t ϕ 1 c 1 p 1 t τ k 2 ν ϕ 2 ϕ 1 c 1 p 1 t k 1 α μ 1 γ t 1 γ p 2 p 1 notice that the fractures network permeability appears only in the exponential kernel and that the system dynamics is essentially τ independent for t τ this can be easily seen in laplace space the differential form of eq 32 is again a fractional telegraphic model 33 ρ c 2 2 p 2 t 2 k 1 α ρ μ ϕ 2 2 γ p 2 t 2 γ μ ϕ 2 c 2 k 2 p 2 t 1 r d r d r d p 2 d r d k 1 α ρ ϕ 2 μ 2 γ p 1 t 2 γ μ ϕ 1 c 1 k 2 p 1 t ϕ 1 c 1 p 1 t k 1 α μ 1 γ t 1 γ p 2 p 1 which for a completely impermeable matrix gives the same evolution equation used in ref pascal 1986 for studying pressure wave propagation in porous media moreover for γ 1 it reduces to the usual double porosity model when τ t for an heterogeneous fractures network with a wide range of local permeability values a way of describing pressure dynamics is through the ensemble average of eq 32 over a proper permeability distribution 34 ϕ 2 c 2 p 2 t ϕ 2 ρ 0 t exp t t τ 2 p 2 d t ϕ 1 c 1 p 1 t τ k 2 ν ϕ 2 ϕ 1 c 1 p 1 t k 1 α μ 1 γ t 1 γ p 2 p 1 notice that if the permeability distribution is scale free τ inherits this property and the system dynamics within the fractures network evolves without any characteristic time scale giving rise to the typical scenario for anomalous transport emergence pagnini 2014 now because of the telegraphic nature of eq 32 the system short time evolution t τ is given by a pressure wave driven by the fluid density and medium compressibility whereas for long times it evolves trough a diffusive process controlled by the medium permeability therefore for t τ eq 34 short time behaviour can be approximated by 35 ϕ 2 c 2 p 2 t ϕ 2 ρ 0 t ξ t t 2 p 2 d t ϕ 1 c 1 p 1 t ϕ 1 c 1 p 1 t k 1 α μ 1 γ t 1 γ p 2 p 1 where ξ t is the ensemble average of the memory kernel 36 ξ t t exp ν ϕ 2 t t k 2 using the following distribution for eq 36 explicit evaluation 37 λ β k 2 1 π k 0 k 0 k 2 β 1 sin β π 1 2 k 0 k 2 β cos β π k 0 k 2 2 β 0 β 1 where k 0 is a free parameter with permeability units we have 38 ξ t t 0 λ β k 2 exp ν ϕ 2 t t k 2 d k 2 0 κ β ξ exp ν ϕ 2 ξ k 0 t t d ξ where ξ k 0 k 2 and κ β ξ is a dimensionless probability density given by 39 κ β ξ 1 π sin β π ξ β 1 1 2 ξ β cos π β ξ 2 β the function κ β ξ is a well known probability density in the fractional kinetics literature mainardi and gorenflo 2007 pagnini 2014 and has the following property 40 0 κ β ξ exp ξ t d ξ e β t β where e β t is the mittag leffler function hence the approximate average behaviour of a pressure disturbance propagating in an heterogeneous double porosity medium with a permeability distribution given by eq 37 would be given by 41 ϕ 2 c 2 p 2 t ϕ 2 ρ 0 t e β t t τ 0 β 2 p 2 d t ϕ 1 c 1 p 1 t τ 0 k 0 ν ϕ 2 ϕ 1 c 1 p 1 t k 1 α μ 1 γ t 1 γ p 2 p 1 notice that eq 41 is an alternative form of the gdpm discussed in the previous section and as previously stated for a completely impermeable matrix this model has a long time superdiffusive behaviour and a differential form given by a generalized telegraphic equation whose long time evolution is controlled by the fractional wave equation see eq 27 although the approximation used to obtain eq 41 form eq 34 is uncontrolled and not rigorously justified from a mathematical perspective we think it gives and appealing and worth exploring explanation for the emergence of superdiffusive behaviour in heterogeneous fractured porous media i e the existence of a heavy tail or scale free permeability distributions the fact that λ β k 2 is indeed a particular case of these type of distributions is easily seen by realizing that for k 0 k 2 the asymptotic behaviour of eq 37 is λ β k 2 k 2 1 β and therefore k 2 writting ρ in terms of τ 0 in eq 41 allows to write the dimensionless form of eq 41 as eq 24 with λ k 1 α r w 2 k 0 and τ d τ 0 t 0 where t 0 is now defined by t 0 μ r w 2 ϕ 1 c 1 ϕ 2 c 2 k 0 4 3 mittag leffler kernel subdiffusive subdiffusive case in this section the gdpm describe a transport scenario within the fractures network given by short time normal diffusion and long time subdiffusion the explicit form of the dimensionless model is 42 ω p 2 d t d 1 γ 1 β d d t d 0 t d e β t d t τ d β 1 r d r d r d p 2 d r d d t 1 ω p 1 d t d 1 ω p 1 d t d λ 1 γ t d 1 γ p 2 d p 1 d 0 γ β 1 notice that because of the power law asymptotic behaviour of the mittag leffler function eq 42 becomes an equivalent expression to the one shown at eq 10 for long times therefore when t d τ d and 1 γ β subdiffusion inside fractures is stronger than inside the matrix whereas for β 1 γ we have the opposite situation when β 1 γ subdiffusive transport is equally strong in fractures and matrix because subdiffusion is usually associated with medium fractal properties ben avraham and havlin 2000 the free parameter τ d which corresponds to the crossover time scale from normal to subdiffusive transport could be associated with the minimum length scale at which the typical geometric features associated to fractal structures cease to exist i e the time needed for the pressure disturbance to traverse diffusively the length scales of the geometric elementary units of the medium fractal structure notice that when τ d eq 42 reduce to the usual double porosity model as far as we know the expression for the fractures pressure dynamics shown at eq 42 has not been studied in the corresponding scientific literature and although it fulfills the necessary conditions for being the long time description of a ctrw sokolov and klafter 2005 sokolov 2002 see eq 4 it must be taken with care until this is formally proved however we think it is of interest to include the equation in this work and study how a normal diffusion subdiffusion transition is seen in pressure tests like transient production decline curve analysis for this gdpm the functions t s and i s defined by the boundary value problem of eq 18 are now 43 t s s γ ω 1 ω λ s γ 1 ω λ γ 1 β s 1 τ d s β i s 1 ω γ 1 β 1 τ d s β s a s p 1 d r d 0 ω 1 ω p 2 d r d 0 a s λ 1 ω s λ s i γ p 2 d p 1 d t d 0 1 ω λ p 1 d r d 0 as before from the initial conditions corresponding to transient production decline analysis it is straightforward to see that i s 0 hence the dimensionless flow rate at the wellbore in laplace space is given by 44 q s τ d β s β 1 γ 1 β 1 s τ d β k 1 t s t s k 0 t s for this model the interpretation of τ d in relation to τ m d is also valid so for transient production decline analysis we study eq 44 behaviour for τ d τ m d 4 4 truncated power law kernel normal diffusive subdiffusive case in this section we discuss the following particular case of eq 8 45 ω p 2 d t d 1 τ d 0 t d exp t d t τ d l 1 t d t τ d i β 1 r d r d r d p 2 d r d d t 1 ω p 1 d t d 1 ω p 1 d t d λ 1 γ t d 1 γ p 2 d p 1 d 0 β γ 1 the memory kernel now given by a truncated power law has three characteristic time scales when the long time scale is τ l the kernel has the same qualitative behaviour of the mittag leffler function bounded for short times and a power law decaying for long times thus implying that at t d τ d i a crossover from ballistic to sub ballistic transport occurs as already discussed in sections 4 2 and 4 2 1 such transition between transport regimes can be understood as the heterogeneities dispersive effects on the fluid positively correlated movement or as energy dissipation effects on the fluid inertial movement through its interaction with heterogeneous porous media described by scale free permeability distributions however despite the interpretation for the sub ballistic flow regime emergence it is not physically plausible for it to maintain for very long times i e infinite correlation times or scale free permeability distributions are only ideal scenarios for this reason the long time exponential decay is included in the kernel so that when τ d l the model describes another flow regime transition at t d τ d l this time from sub ballistic to normal diffusive for this model the flow rate at the wellbore is given by the inverse laplace transform of 46 q s τ d i e ζ γ 1 β ζ k 1 t s t s τ d s ζ 1 β k 0 t s ζ τ d i s 1 τ d l with t s given by 47 t s s γ ω 1 ω λ s γ 1 ω λ τ d τ d i s ζ 1 β e ζ γ 1 β ζ where γ is the incomplete gamma function for transient production decline analysis we study the inverse laplace transform of eq 46 as a function of the model parameters and in accordance with the previous discussions we take τ d l τ m d and τ d i τ m d because now it is not clear how to choose τ d we assume it is a generalized geometric average of the long and intermediate time scales τ d τ d i ξ τ d l 2 ξ with ξ 0 2 and study the effects of varying ξ 5 transient production decline analysis numerical results in this section we show the numerical result obtained from studying eq 21 for each kernel discussed at section 4 the flow in dimensionless time was obtainded through the stehfest algorithm stehfest 1970 and its behaviour as a function of β and γ analysed in all figures the discontinuous black dotted blue and dot dashed gray lines are associated to the smallest medium and biggest values in the parameters varied vertical lines indicate the characteristic time scales τ d τ d i and τ m d the numerical values of such time scales were chosen so that different flow regimes were clearly differentiated in the figures but always taking as upper bound τ m d in figs 2 and 3 we show flow behaviour of gdpm with long time subdiffusion in the fractures network η 1 whereas in figs 4 and 5 flow associated to models describing intermediate and long time superdiffusion η 0 is presented in every figure the flow corresponding to the warren and root classical model is included for comparison notice that a clear qualitative difference between the flow in both pairs of figures is clearly seen in figs 2 and 3 the flow start at a maximum value for small times and decreases monotonically always taking values below the classical behaviour on the other hand in figs 4 and 5 the flow is zero at t d 0 and increases in time until a maximum is reached then depending on how strong matrix subdiffusion is it starts decaying taking values above or below the prediction of the classical model the short time differences between flow rate behaviour for gdpm with η 1 or η 0 are due to the fact that in the subdiffusive cases and because of the strong gradient imposed at the inner domain boundary at zero time the flow is infinite at t 0 whereas for the superdiffusive flow models we have a delay flow response with vanishing flow at zero time in fig 2 we show the results obtained from the power law memory kernel in this model the only characteristic time scale is τ m d and is marked with a vertical line notice that as expected the vertical lines always appear at the end of the flow regime associated to matrix production indicating the beginning of the system homogeneous response this is particularly clear in fig 2b and e where the only parameter varied is γ notice also that for decreasing γ values matrix production regime becomes longer and its slope steeper in fig 3 fluid flow behaviour corresponding to the mittag leffler memory kernel with η 1 is presented contrary to the power law kernel case here there are two vertical lines in the figures one for τ d when a transition from normal diffusion to subdiffusion occur and τ m d as before notice that τ m d coincide with the end of the matrix production regime and the duration of such flow regime increases while its slope decreases for decreasing γ values i e as matrix subdiffusion becomes stronger on the other hand note that for different β values the system behaviour is affected at all times with a considerable decrease in flow as this parameter increases see fig 3c this behaviour is also observed in fig 2 with the difference that for the power law kernel case fractures subdiffusion is stronger for decreasing β values interestingly when t τ d there is no sign of the transition between normal and subdiffusive regimes in flow behaviour as will be discussed shortly this is not the case for the models with η 0 where flow regime transitions can be clearly distinguished in fig 3d flow behaviour from power law and mittag leffler models with η 1 are plotted for comparison notice that both models coincide at long times when the subdiffusive regime is established the magnitude difference between the classical flow regime and the mittag leffler model at short times is a consequence of the value chosen for the time scale associated with the transition from normal diffusion to subdiffusion τ d 10 recall that this gdpm reduces to the warren and root model when τ d this can be seen in fig 3e and f in fig 4 we show the results obtained from the mittag leffler memory kernel with η 0 as before these figures show that the beginning of the system homogeneous response coincides with τ m d and that as γ decreases this flow regime appears at later times this is particularly clear in fig 4b and e however because of the long time superdiffusive behaviour of the model when t d τ m d the predicted flow is always above the classical value moreover contrary to flow behaviour during matrix production in the previous subdiffusive models here the slope associated to such flow regime is positive and increases for decreasing β values hence as superdiffusion increases matrix production increases and its flow regime becomes steeper when plotted as a function of time a clear interplay between matrix subdiffusive and fractures superdiffusive flow regimes can be seen in fig 4b where the flow during the matrix production regime is stronger or weaker than the classical prediction according to the values of β and γ i e is stronger or weaker than the classical prediction depending on the competition between superdiffusive and subdiffusive effects in fractures and matrix the vertical blue solid lines in the figures correspond to t d τ d when the transition from ballistic to sub ballistic flow regimes occur in all cases τ d 10 notice that when t d τ d i e when the pressure disturbance propagates as a wave with a velocity that does not depend on β see the discussion regarding eq 29 the flow is essentially β independent notice also that at t d τ d there is an inflection point where the concavity of the flow curves change this implies that by analysing real flow time series and their second derivative the value of τ could be estimated and through such value and eq 29 it could be possible to find the approximate length scales of the heterogeneities responsible for the beginning of the dispersive flow regime for the alternative interpretation of the model an estimation of τ would allow to find a numerical value for k 0 the free parameter of the probability distribution shown at eq 37 and used for the ensemble average of the heterogeneous system with such a value an estimation of statistical measures like the median and mode for the medium permeability distribution could be obtained in fig 5 we show the flow corresponding to the truncated power law kernel its qualitative behaviour for t d τ d l τ m d is similar to the one shown in fig 4 but in this case the transition from ballistic to sub ballistic flow regimes occurs at t d τ d i notice that at this specific time there is also an inflection point with a concavity change in the flow curves however unlike the previous models in this case the flow is more sensitive to changes in γ values see fig 5b this is because τ d is taken as a generalized geometric average of τ d l and τ d i τ d τ d i ξ τ d l 2 ξ hence it becomes an implicit function of γ also through eq 21 it is easy to see that τ d directly affects the flow magnitude at all times see for example figs 5 and 6 for every curve in fig 5 the intermediate and long characteristic time scales values are τ d l τ m d and τ d i 10 the values of τ d were calculated with ξ 1 5 in fig 5 the value of ξ was chosen in order to show that for t d τ d l the model recover the classical normal diffusive flow behaviour and that even with the existence of intermediate time superdiffusive flow regimes the flow can take values above or below the classical long time prediction fig 5a c leaving the positive slope of the matrix production regime as the only unequivocal feature associated to superdiffusive flow regimes finally in fig 6 we show flow behaviour as a function of ξ 6 conclusions in this work we propose several models of anomalous flow for naturally fractured porous media and discuss different physical interpretations for their relevant parameters in particular we show that the characteristic time scales of the models can be associated to characteristic length scales of the porous medium heterogeneities or in some cases with the inertial properties of the fluid these interpretations have interesting results in terms of pressure tests applications and allow the construction of an effective single porosity model for double porosity systems moreover we show that a particular equation previously proposed in the anomalous diffusion literature as a plausible model for superdiffusion and as a generalization of the cattaneo equation compte and metzler 1997 can be associated to flow behaviour in heterogeneous porous media described by a scale free permeability distribution although the emergence of supperdiffusive flow behaviour as a consequence of a heavy tail permeability distribution is obtained from a particular model we believe it is a more general result this will be addressed in future work in the context of pressure tests we show that in transient production decline analysis the slope of the matrix production regime is a good indicator to establish the existence of anomalous diffusion negative slopes can be associated to subdiffusive flow regimes whereas positive slopes to superdiffusive regimes in both cases more pronounced slopes correspond to more anomalous diffusive behaviours in this same context we propose that through the estimation of the models time scales which can be done by looking for the existence of inflection points in the flow time series and the usual fitting to model curves like the ones shown at section 5 the length scales of the system main heterogeneities and some statistical measures of the permeability distribution could be obtained these result and their future theoretical development could be useful for describing aquifers and oil reservoirs when the usual warren and root or multirate double porosity models give poor results finally notice that the used kernels and their interpretation in terms of anomalous flow and characteristic time scales can also be used for studying different interporosity flows associated to anomalous behaviour within the matrix this will be addressed in future work credit authorship contribution statement d hernández conceptualization

the definition notation and principal properties of the fractional operators are given the material presented herein was taken from refs podlubny 1999 mainardi 1995 mainardi and gorenflo 2007 throughout this section the function f t is assumed integrable and continious and if required sufficiently smooth the integral of order p or p fold integration is defined as a 1 a i t p f t 1 γ p a t

important property a 3 a i t p a i t q f t a i t p q f t p q 0 notice that eq a 3 implies that integrations of arbitrary order commute differentiation of order p with p any real number is defined through the riemann liouville fractional derivative whose explicit form is given by the following expression a 4 a d t p f t 1 γ k p d k d t k a t t η k p 1 f η d η k 1 p k with k a natural number the riemann liouville fractional derivative can be seen as an interpolation between consecutive ordinary differential operators and generalizes several of their properties for example the fractional derivative of a power law is given by a 5 a d t p t a ν γ 1 ν γ 1 ν p t a ν p ν 1 moreover using the definitions of p fold integration and differentiation it can be shown that a generalized version of the fundamental theorem of calculus is valid a 6 a d t p a i t p f t f t and that as in classical calculus p fold integration and differentiation do not commute as the following expression shows a 7 a

appears as initial conditions for time evolution equations for this reason an alternative fractional diffentiation known as caputo fractional derivative is often used in those cases and is given by a

for simplicity a 20 0 d t p f t d p f t d t p 0 i t p f t i p f t appendix b deduction of the fractional telegraphic form of the gdpm with mittag leffler kernel the first step needed to transform eq 24 into a fractional telegraphic double porosity model is the application of the riemann liouville fractional differential operator of order β to the evolution equation for p 2 d and after using the formula shown at eq a 13 it follows that b 1 ω 1 β p 2 d t d 1 β ω γ β p 2 d r d 0 t d β 1 1 τ d h t d 1 ω β t d β p 1 d t d where h t d is given by b 2 h t d 1 γ 1 β d d t d 0 t d t d η β 0 η e β η t

r d t d for i 1 2 and their first time partial derivatives are zero at zero time then under such initial conditions and the assumption that the pressure time partial derivatives are continious it can be shown that each of the terms composing i c are zero hence for the application discussed in this work i c 0 therefore the fractional derivative representation of eq 24 under pressure test condition

effective single porosity model for the description of double porosity systems the ideas discussed herein are only valid when β γ and η 0 although for brevity and clarity of exposition we only discuss the case corresponding to β γ 1 i e the telegraphic double porosity model hernández et al 2013 we start with the dimensional form of eq 24 with β 1 and τ τ m c 1 ϕ 2 c 2 p 2 t k μ τ m 0 t exp t t τ m 2 p 2 r t d t ϕ 1 c 1 p 1 t ϕ 1 c 1 p 1 t k 1 α μ p 2 p 1 τ m μ ϕ 1 c 1 k 1 α writting eq c 1 in differential form and recalling that for τ τ m the evolution equations for the matrix and fractures network become uncouple equations it follows that fractures network pressure dynamic behaviour is given by c 2 ϕ 2 c 2 2 p 2 t 2 ϕ 2 c 2 τ m k 1 α μ p 2 t k τ m μ 2 p 2 dividing by ϕ 2 c 2 and substituting the explicit form of τ m we have c 3 2 p 2 t 2 k 1 α μ ϕ 1 c 1 ϕ 2 c 2 ϕ 1 c 1 ϕ 2 c 2 p 2 t k k 1 α ϕ 1 ϕ 2 c 1 c 2 μ 2 2 p 2 now writing a non local effective equation as c 4 ϕ e c e p

ϕ 2 c 2 k e k τ e μ k 1 α ϕ 1 c 1 ϕ 2 c 2 ϕ 1 c 1 ϕ 2 c 2 notice that eq c 6 allow to define the following effective coefficients for the non local model c 7 ϕ e ϕ 2 c 1 c 2 ϕ 1 τ e ϕ 2 ϕ e τ m with the effective compressibility and permeability taking the same values of the fractured medium i e c e c 2 and k e k it is interesting to note that contrary to the usual approach of finding an effective permeability for the description of a double porosity media through a single porosity model here an effective porosity and characteristic time scale are used for the same purpose notice that the effective coefficients are defined in terms of the physical properties of the matrix effective equations like eq c 5 could be useful for exploring different definitions of effective parameters describing complex porous media and for accelerating the numerical implementations of their respective models 
342,besides other environmental tracers the use of the 3h 3he method enables the estimation of modern groundwater ages widely used in fresh groundwater studies the combination of tritium 3h and its stable daughter product tritiogenic helium 3 3hetrit however has so far only been applied in a few studies to date groundwater in coastal aquifers the coastal aquifer presented in this study is located at the very young eastern part of the north sea barrier island spiekeroog the so called ostplate that is characterized by a currently developing freshwater lens previously field and numerical modeling studies showed that the groundwater salinity distribution within this coastal aquifer is largely determined by seawater infiltration during storm tides the main aim of this study was to characterize the groundwater age distribution in a highly dynamic coastal aquifer using the 3h 3he age dating method in addition a transient 2 d density dependent flow and transport model that was calibrated to groundwater heads and salinity was utilized to assess whether measured 3h 3he ages can be reliably simulated despite the mixing of distinctly different and time variable 3h endmembers i e freshwater and seawater the numerical calculation of the 3h 3he age distribution thereby was based on the simulation of the fictive tracer stable tritium sum of 3h and 3hetrit and 3h even though the freshwater lens is very young both field observations and simulation results indicate notably lower ages within the freshwater lens as compared to the age of the lens itself simulation results show that frequent seawater infiltration most importantly during winter storm tides and discharging water from the freshwater lens lead to a disturbance of the vertical age stratification below the beach a comparison with direct ages shows that the chosen 2 tracer approach improves system understanding especially with regard to dispersion effects keywords 3h 3he age dating numerical modeling seawater

and long well screens the resulting ages may consist of a large range of ages and are therefore termed apparent ages these ages describe the time elapsed since the water entered the saturated zone and

environmental tracer to estimate modern groundwater ages is tritium 3h in combination with its stable decay product tritiogenic helium 3 3hetrit whereby the apparent age is calculated based on the ratio of 3hetrit to 3h accounting for the half life constant schlosser et al 1988 the radioactive isotope of hydrogen 3h is naturally produced in the upper layers of the atmosphere but high

due to its relatively short half life of 12 32 years lucas and unterweger 2000 the ³h concentration has been continuously decreasing since reaching a concentration peak so called tritium bomb peak

back to the atmosphere while it accumulates in the groundwater within the saturated zone where gas exchange with the atmosphere is inhibited solomon et al 1993 sültenfuß et al 2010 although widely used in fresh groundwater studies the 3h 3he method was only applied to date groundwater in coastal aquifers in a limited number of studies post et al 2019 coastal aquifers are complex systems that comprise fresh groundwater and intruded seawater and are therefore characterized by variable density flow in tidal systems like barrier islands the density differences between these two endmembers impact the groundwater dynamics leading to the formation of typical hydraulic characteristics in the subterranean estuary ste where terrestrial groundwater and circulating seawater mix fig 1 fresh groundwater discharge on barrier islands from a freshwater lens fwl generally occurs near the low water line through a so called fresh groundwater discharge tube the latter is restricted from above by a tide induced upper saline plume of infiltrating recirculating seawater and from below by a density induced saltwater wedge where dispersion effects lead to seawater recirculation jiao and post 2019 moore 1999 robinson et al 2006 robinson et al 2007 robinson et al 2018 vandenbohede and lebbe 2006 2007 the combined discharge of recirculating seawater and fresh groundwater in the ste was termed submarine groundwater discharge burnett et al 2003 han et al 2012 and sivan et al 2005 for example used 3h to investigate mixing processes and timescales of seawater intrusion into a coastal aquifer caschetto et al 2016 were able to validate an existing conceptual model of aquifer salinization and to quantify recharge rates and flow patterns by the use of 3h as one of multiple tracers vandenbohede et al 2011 applied 3h 3he ages as a tracer for investigations concerning flow and transport of a coastal aquifer system in the belgian plain while sültenfuß et al 2010 obtained knowledge about groundwater dynamics on a regional scale and present day saltwater freshwater distributions in marshlands at the river ems estuary by using 3h 3he ages among other tracers focusing on fwls the 3h 3he age dating method was also used in coastal aquifers on the east frisian islands of langeoog and spiekeroog houben et al 2014 röper et al 2012 seibert et al 2018 the groundwater age dating thereby provided insights into internal flow dynamics of the investigated fwls revealed the influence of land use on the fwl thickness and enabled the calculation of groundwater recharge rates houben et al 2014 röper et al 2012 investigations by seibert et al 2018 showed that the hydrochemical evolution of a fwl in a homogeneous sandy aquifer is a function of the residence time and hydrochemical data correlates with the groundwater age compared to the unknown true mean age of a water parcel a calculated age based on a decaying radioactive tracer such as 3h is biased caused by the non linear decrease of the tracer along the flow path dispersive mixing leads to a higher tracer concentration than the water parcel would have without dispersion thus the radio active tracer age is biased towards a younger age this has been elaborated already in many previous studies e g bethke and johnson 2008 another problem arises if a water parcel contains endmembers of different age and of very different initial tracer concentrations in this case the tracer age of the water parcel is biased towards the endmember with the highest initial tracer concentrations for instance the 3h 3he ages of groundwaters that were affected by the tritium bomb peak are biased towards its respective peak time 3h 3he ages of samples older than bomb peak groundwater are therefore biased towards a younger and samples younger than bomb peak groundwater are biased towards an older age solomon and sudicky 1991 the bias thereby increases with increasing dispersive mixing the direct age after goode 1996 can be interpreted as the true mean age of groundwater but it cannot be measured directly the 3h 3he age and the direct age likely compare only well for samples that do not contain a mix of waters that are considerably different in both age and concentrations of stable tritium sum of 3h and 3hetrit only very few numerical modeling studies investigating on 3h 3hetrit and 3h 3he ages exist and hardly any study has used the 3h 3he method to date brackish groundwater at the land sea interface post et al 2013 were the first to conduct generic numerical studies on the steady state groundwater age distribution in coastal aquifers in their study the authors investigated how mixing and selected hydrogeological factors affect the groundwater age distribution in coastal aquifers comparing the approaches of piston flow age direct age and tracer based age 3h 3he and 14c the results of post et al 2013 show differences between the age distributions of the different methods applied in domains of the aquifer where mixing occurs triggered by dispersion and diffusion these differences become larger with increasing mixing they suggest that when comparing field data to modeled ages tracer based ages are more suitable in a recently published study post et al 2019 conducted numerical simulations to investigate the fate of 3h and 3hetrit in the fwl transition zone and saltwater wedge on the east frisian island langeoog their findings show that 3hetrit produced during the 3h bomb peak is still present in the studied fwl and can be used as a tracer for groundwater with an age under 60 years furthermore they discovered that on langeoog the bomb peak related age bias can be as high as 10 years although implementing a comparatively large longitudinal dispersivitiy 3h concentrations measured in the transition zone could not be replicated by their simulation and the authors suggested further work on studying mixing processes in the transition zone subject of the study presented here is a coastal aquifer located on the eastern part of the east frisian island spiekeroog the so called ostplate that is characterized by highly dynamic conditions although connected to the older main part of the island the ostplate represents a young dune island environment where dune formation only began in the 1940s below these dunes a fwl started to evolve in the mid of the 1970s because of its location within the lower saxon wadden sea national park which is acknowledged as a unesco world heritage site the study area is largely unaffected by human activities strict nature conservation regulations are in place and no groundwater abstraction for public water supply or any other infrastructure in the area is allowed in the absence of coastal protection measures the fwl development is influenced by natural dynamic changes storm tides occur roughly twice per year and inundate the entire ostplate except for the elevated dunes and geomorphology varies frequently holt et al 2019 röper et al 2013 using field data and a transient numerical density variable model holt et al 2017 and holt et al 2019 were able to reconstruct the evolution of this currently developing fwl and to assess the impact of the aforementioned dynamic conditions on the fwl formation and the present groundwater salinity distribution within the aquifer the present study aims at unraveling the overall flow and transport time scales in this aquifer applying numerical reactive transport modeling supported by groundwater age dating during a field campaign in september 2016 groundwater was sampled and analyzed with regard to 3h and 3hetrit concentrations to estimate the apparent 3h 3he groundwater ages numerical simulations with transient atmospheric and seawater 3h concentrations were conducted based on the model of holt et al 2019 to estimate the spatial groundwater age distribution and its development over time within the currently evolving fwl and the entire coastal aquifer as the 3h 3he age is affected by the aforementioned complications of endmember mixing and bomb peak related effects it may not represent the true mean age of a water sample well thus only the combined evaluation of reactive transport modeling accounting for the different endmembers transient 3h time series and 3h decay on the one hand and direct age simulations on the other in comparison with measured 3h 3he data will enable us to determine the real groundwater age distribution in the aquifer the specific aims of the study were i to characterize the groundwater age distribution in a highly dynamic coastal aquifer and ii to assess whether measured 3h 3he ages can reliably be simulated with an existing calibrated flow and transport model despite intense dynamics and distinctly different and time variable 3h endmembers i e seawater and freshwater of the system 2 study area 2 1 geology and geomorphology the study was conducted at the eastern part of the barrier island spiekeroog the ostplate spiekeroog is part of the east frisian island chain and is located 6 5 km in front of the coastline of northwest germany between the islands of langeoog to the west and wangerooge to the east fig 2 the total surface area of the present island is about 21 3 km² the older western part of spiekeroog 4 5 km in west east direction is inhabited while the remaining 5 3 km belong to the younger uninhabited and highly protected ostplate petersen and pott 2005 streif 1990 the oldest part of western spiekeroog was formed due to the aggregation of aeolian and marine sands in the mid 16th century sindowski 1970 the development of the ostplate however has started more recently and was caused by land reclamation and embankment activities at the mainland within the past 80 years the ostplate has evolved from a periodically flooded sand flat bare of dunes and vegetation towards a dune island röper et al 2013 the present prominent dune ridge that started forming in the 1970s has reached a maximum height of 11 m above sea level asl röper et al 2013 sheltered by the growing dunes the tidal flat has continuously risen above mean high water mhw which enabled the establishment of expansive salt marshes holt et al 2017 röper et al 2013 for further detailed information on the development of the ostplate refer to holt et al 2017 röper et al 2013 and seibert et al 2019 the subsurface of the western area of spiekeroog is composed of fluviatile pliocene sand deposits with local embeddings of peat at greater depths that are overlain by sandy glaciofluvial pleistocene deposits and fine to coarse grained holocene sands the sand deposits are underlain by a clay layer ranging from 1 5 15 m thickness at depths between 40 to 60 m oldenburg east frisian water association oowv 2009 röper et al 2012 seibert et al 2018 sediment cores taken on the ostplate showed that the aquifer at the eastern part of the island likewise consists of fine to coarse grained holocene sand deposits with minor fractions of clay and silt and comparatively higher fractions of shells in greater depth holt et al 2019 seibert et al 2019 2 2 hydrogeology affected by semidiurnal tides with a mean tidal range of 2 72 m the tidal regime of spiekeroog is classified as mesotidal according to the classification by hayes 1979 mhw is 1 39 m asl and mean low water mlw is 1 33 m below sea level bsl mean spring range and mean neap range are 3 09 m and 2 23 m respectively wasser und schifffahrtsverwaltung des bundes wsv federal waterways and shipping administration 2017 bundesamt für seeschifffahrt und hydrographie bsh federal maritime and hydrographic agency 2017 the average annual precipitation amounts to 808 mm a 1 at spiekeroog from 1984 to 2011 oowv 2012 groundwater recharge rates ranging between 300 and 640 mm a 1 were reported by röper et al 2012 the state office for mining energy and geology lbeg 2018 and the oowv 2009 for the dune area given the less permeable fine grained clayey and silty sediments as well as drainage by tidal creeks the salt marsh areas are characterized by lower recharge rates as suggested by sulzbacher et al 2012 and wiederhold et al 2015 located below the dunes at the western part of the island the present main fwl reaches a depth of 44 m bsl and is used for public water supply röper et al 2012 using the 3h 3hetrit method röper et al 2012 and seibert et al 2018 determined apparent 3h 3he groundwater ages within the main fwl at the western part of spiekeroog that increase with depth ranging between 4 and 51 years the formation of freshwater bodies below the dunes at the ostplate started in the 1970s and several fwls exist at present these fwls are restricted to the elevated dune areas exceeding the storm tide level 3 m asl holt et al 2017 reconstructions of past shallow groundwater salinities revealed an expansion of the areas underlain by freshwater in the past 15 years holt et al 2017 the asymmetrical fwl at the ostplate subject of this study has a maximum vertical extent of 4 m fig 3 while the transition zone is several meters thick with salinities increasing with depth the fwl extent in horizontal direction is 50 m and hence approximately 25 times smaller than the main fwl in the west holt et al 2019 röper et al 2012 tronicke 1997 field data and numerical simulations of holt et al 2017 and holt et al 2019 clearly indicate that the fwl is very sensitive to storm tides and seawater inundation both the near surface extent and the lateral and vertical extent of the fwl are largely a function of seawater infiltration during inundation events which mainly occur in winter and lead to salinization of former fresh parts of the lens see also seibert et al 2019 and thus to a lens shrinkage due to continuous mixing with infiltrating seawater during annual storm tides that inhibits further growth under the present geomorphological situation the fwl has already reached quasi steady state conditions 35 years after formation furthermore the numerical simulation results of holt et al 2019 suggest the occurrence of saltwater fingering flow especially below the beach north of the dunes a phenomenon previously proposed by modeling and laboratory studies in the context of coastal aquifers e g greskowiak 2014 and röper et al 2015 such saltwater fingers develop due to density differences between the infiltrating seawater and the discharging fresh brackish groundwater the fingers move downwards but also migrate horizontally from the upper beach towards northern coastline locally leading to substantial variabilities of groundwater salinity over time holt et al 2019 the common concept of a tide induced upper saline recirculation cell overlying groundwater discharge from the fwl as suggested by e g robinson et al 2006 robinson et al 2007 vandenbohede and lebbe 2006 is not clearly discernible in the model due to these instabilities 3 material and methods 3 1 instrumentation and sampling groundwater samples for 3h 3he age dating were collected at six monitoring sites in september 2016 the monitoring sites were installed in a transect that is oriented along the assumed north south groundwater flow direction following the general topographic gradient at the western part of the study area holt et al 2019 fig 2 the depth specific samples n 10 were extracted from multi level observation wells ows installed at the beach monitoring site b three piezometers with a single screen each and at the northern monitoring site dn four piezometers with a single screen each and southern monitoring site ds three piezometers with a single screen each dune base respectively fig 3 supplementary material table s 1 1 three additional samples were collected at shallow single screen ows installed within the salt marsh south of the dunes fig 2 table s 1 1 the screen length of all ows is 1 m with a 2 inch diameter using also the direct push method probe water sampler dp32 42 with 1 inch internal filter of 0 5 m length stitz at the monitoring sites bn dn and ds fig 2 allowed for depth specific extraction of additional groundwater samples n 11 in a higher spatial resolution every meter compared to the permanent ows dn and ds alone fig 3 table s 1 1 groundwater samples were extracted from all ows using either a submersible pump gigant eijkelkamp or a foot valve pump s 60 stitz within the direct push method respectively the samples for the 3h analysis were stored in 1 l polyethylene bottles whereas samples for the 3hetrit analysis were filled in two 40 ml copper tubes after flushing the tubes with the water to be sampled a transparent tube was attached at the inlet of the copper tubes and controlled while sampling to ensure a bubble free filling of the helium samples a clamp at the outlet of the copper tubes was used to regulate the flow rate and to increase the pressure in order to prevent potential degassing during sampling the tubes were pinched off at both sides starting with the outlet while pumping similar to e g solomon et al 1992 sültenfuß 2009 szabo et al 1996 duplicate samples were taken for each sampling site the 3h and 3hetrit analysis as well as determination of the apparent 3h 3he ages was subsequently conducted at the institute of environmental physics university of bremen sültenfuß et al 2009 3 2 groundwater age dating with 3h and 3hetrit a groundwater age dating method using both 3h and its decay product 3hetrit was first introduced by tolstikhin and kamenskij 1969 using eq 1 the relationship between 3h and 3hetrit gives a time parameter reflecting the residence time in the saturated zone i e the elapsed time between recharge last contact with atmosphere and sampling which is independent of the ³h input concentration and seasonal or regional variations respectively cook and solomon 1997 schlosser et al 1988 sültenfuß and massmann 2004 1 τ 1 λ ln 1 3 h e t r i t 3 h with τ 3h 3he age yrs λ decay constant 0 05626 yr 1 λ ln 2 t1 2 3h concentration of 3h tu 3hetrit concentration of 3hetrit tu produced by radioactive decay of 3h however according to schlosser et al 1988 and solomon and sudicky 1991 dispersive mixing of the 3h bomb peak leads to a bias of 3h 3he ages towards the highest 3h concentration resulting in 3h 3he ages younger than actual ages in groundwater older than the bomb peak the ages calculated with eq 1 are generally referred to as apparent 3h 3he ages within analysis 3hetrit must be separated from 3he sources other than 3h decay in the water solomon et al 1992 sültenfuß et al 2010 further detailed information about the 3h 3he age dating method can be found in e g poreda et al 1988 schlosser et al 1988 solomon et al 1992 solomon and sudicky 1991 sültenfuß et al 2010 and sültenfuß and massmann 2004 in the following these apparent 3h 3he ages are referred to as observed 3h 3he ages as compared to numerically simulated 3h 3he ages 3 3 numerical model holt et al 2019 generated a transient vertical density dependent 2 d groundwater flow and transport model for the n s cross section a a i e along the transect of ows fig 2 using the software seawat langevin et al 2008 the model simulates the evolution of the fwl over several decades 1975 2016 and the present day groundwater salinity distribution and extent of the young fwl considering annually storm tides and assuming a constant geomorphology the model was calibrated to match present day groundwater levels and groundwater salinities in the present study the model by holt et al 2019 was extended to simulate the groundwater ages 3 3 1 model extent boundary conditions and parameter setting the model is north south oriented and ends at the mhw marks fig 2 fig s 3 1 with an extent of 2 230 m in horizontal direction including the beach of 520 m length with a slope of 0 002 the dune area of 100 m length and the southern salt marsh areas of 1 610 m length fig s 3 1 discretization is 10 m horizontally and 1 m vertically to circumvent the seawat specific rewetting process of dry cells during groundwater table movement across model layers the thickness of layer 1 ranges from 0 75 m to 8 m as a function of the topography and the thickness of layer 2 is 0 9 m at maximum assuming a continuous clay layer see section 2 1 at 40 m depth a no flow boundary condition was applied at the bottom boundary as described in holt et al 2019 tide averaged constant heads rather than real tides following the approach of vandenbohede and lebbe 2006 2007 were assigned to the vertical model boundaries at the mhw mark fig s 3 1 non dispersive flux boundary conditions were assigned to the vertical boundaries for the transport model water entering the model domain through the constant head flow boundaries had a salinity of 32 g l 1 while the salinity of discharging water was set to the salinity of the water computed at the boundary cell a specified flux boundary simulating the recharge along the top boundary was divided into recharge zones fig s 3 1 characterized by different recharge rates table s 3 1 the recharge salinities defined for the non dispersive flux boundary at the top boundary are mainly a function of ground surface elevation and resulting inundation frequency holt et al 2017 and follow a gradient from fresh recharge 0 g l 1 in the elevated dunes to increasing salinities with increasing distance from the dunes towards the lower lying beach and salt marsh areas table s 3 1 fig s 3 1 further model parameters are given in table 1 to account for the storm tides inundating the entire ostplate except for the elevated dune areas 3 m asl on average two times per year transient recharge rates based on the thickness of the unsaturated zone and porosity referred to as infiltration rates in the following and recharge salinities inundated domains seawater salinity non inundated dune domains freshwater salinity were implemented into the model infiltration recharge rates total infiltration recharge and corresponding recharge salinity distribution during storm tides as well as during the remainder of the year are listed in table s 3 1 refer to the supplementary material s 3 and holt et al 2019 for more information on boundary conditions 3 3 2 simulation of the groundwater age distribution the flow and transport model formed the basis for the calculation of the spatial and temporal distribution and development of the apparent 3h 3he ages in the following referred to as tritium helium model trhe model whereby we chose not to adjust any of the previously calibrated flow and transport parameters table 1 table s 3 1 groundwater ages were also calculated using the direct age approach after goode 1996 in an additional model case in the following referred to as direct age model da model for comparison with the results of the trhe model both model cases were conducted using seawat langevin et al 2008 the transient simulations covered the period from 1975 assumed start of fwl development to 2016 time of sampling the geometric multigrid solver gmg was used for the numerical solution of the groundwater flow in conjunction with the generalized conjugate gradient gcg the hybrid method of characteristics hmoc was used to solve the transport equation according to zheng and bennett 1995 the hmoc scheme provides a solution with virtually no numerical dispersion independent from the grid peclet number but is prone to small mass balance errors in all our simulations a mass balance error of 1 1 was ensured 3 3 2 1 tritium helium trhe model to calculate the apparent 3h 3he age distribution numerically both the transport of the fictive tracer stable 3h as well as 3h was simulated the latter is characterized by a 1st order decay λ 0 05626 yr 1 while the stable 3h is not subject to decay and is therefore a conservative tracer instead of directly simulating 3hetrit which is formed by the decay of 3h the 3hetrit concentration was obtained by subtracting the remaining 3h from the stable 3h concentration the stable 3h is equivalent to the sum of 3h and 3hetrit i e the initial concentration of 3h of water recharging the aquifer meteoric water and seawater respectively this approach was chosen because the hydrodynamic dispersion outweighs the effect of the different molecular diffusion coefficients of 3h and 3hetrit on the 3h 3he age this assumption is valid if the pore water flow velocities exceed 0 3 m a 1 solomon and sudicky 1991 which is the case at the here investigated field site the simulated apparent 3h 3he ages were subsequently determined based on the ratio of the calculated 3hetrit to simulated 3h concentration using eq 1 similar to post et al 2013 we assumed that 3hetrit only emerged from the 3h decay and no other sources the yearly varying atmospheric and seawater 3h concentrations were applied to the non dispersive flux boundary at the top similar to koh et al 2018 whereby they were assigned based on the mixing ratio of fresh and seawater inferred by the salinity of the recharging water fig s 3 1 3h records of the german rainfall station cuxhaven time series since 1978 and the dutch rainfall station groningen time series since 1970 iaea 2019 were merged to provide a continuous time series from 1975 2016 fig 4 assuming that the travel time across the unsaturated zone was short the mean concentration in precipitation of the respective year was assigned to the freshwater recharge salinity 0 g l 1 for the respective year as done in the similar approach by post et al 2019 the higher the recharge salinities the larger the content of seawater see section 3 3 1 mean 3h concentrations that were measured in the german bight bundesamt für strahlenschutz bfs federal office for radiation protection meyerjürgens 2016 nies et al 2010 sültenfuß pers comm 2019 wedekind 1982 were assigned to the seawater salinity 32 g l 1 recharging the aquifer water entering the model domain across the constant head flow boundaries had a 3h concentration of seawater of the respective year while water discharging through this boundary had a concentration computed at the boundary cell fig 4 shows the annually varying 3h concentrations that were applied to the input boundaries for meteoric water and seawater because the nuclear reprocessing plant la hague france started increasingly discharging effluents to the english channel around 1995 3h concentrations in seawater increased significantly in the mid of the 1990s and have been larger than 3h concentrations in precipitation ever since nies et al 2010 beyond that the 3h concentration of the north sea is also influenced by nuclear power plants along rivers discharging into the north sea nies et al 2010 during the two storm tides each year 3h concentrations corresponding to seawater of the respective year fig 4 were assigned to inundated areas along the cross section a a salinity of 32 g l 1 fig s 3 1 table s 3 2 gives an overview on the 3h concentration time series in recharge that were applied to the non dispersive flux boundary at the model top during storm tides as well as during the remainder of the year 3 3 2 2 direct age da model based on the concept of age mass after goode 1996 the groundwater age distribution in the da model was simulated by using age as a species undergoing zero order production with an increase of one concentration unit per one year elapsed e g engesgaard and molson 1998 greskowiak et al 2013 post et al 2013 sánchez et al 2018 initially an age of zero was assigned which also holds for water entering the model domain across the top boundary and at the vertical model boundaries respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 observed spatial groundwater age distribution the observed 3h 3he ages of the freshwater samples range between 0 3 years near the water table ow dn a and 4 9 years at the bottom of the fwl dn b which reflects an estimate of the maximum travel time within the fwl measured 3h and 3hetrit concentrations are shown in table s 1 1 and fig s 4 1 the fact that ages are stratified vertically fig 3 is in line with findings reported for fwls at the neighboring east frisian islands of langeoog and baltrum houben et al 2014 post and houben 2017 for the western fwl at spiekeroog röper et al 2012 seibert et al 2018 as well as with groundwater age stratifications proposed by modeling and laboratory studies of e g greskowiak et al 2013 and stoeckl and houben 2012 measured stable 3h concentrations in the fwl table s 1 1 fig s 4 1 match the 3h concentrations in precipitation recorded for cuxhaven fig 4 similar to shallow wells screened within the fwl at the western part of spiekeroog röper et al 2012 the high stable 3h concentration measured at ow dn a compared to the other fresh samples is attributed to the higher monthly atmospheric 3h concentration recorded for the calculated infiltration point in time fig 4 apparent 3h 3he ages increasing with depth were also observed for saline groundwater samples below the beach fig 3 ranging between 2 6 years ow b a and 18 years ow b c saline samples collected at the most northern sampling point ow bn show an age of 0 years at the top indicating recently infiltrated water both the 3h and stable 3h concentrations of the saline samples clearly show the influence of the north sea with its higher 3h concentration as concentrations are notable larger than the freshwater values table s 1 1 fig s 4 1 and stable 3h concentrations are close to the seawater concentration of 3h at the calculated infiltration point in time fig 4 the highest stable 3h concentration of the saline samples was measured in the deepest ow 29 tu b c since this sample also contains a freshwater ratio of 30 40 the stable 3h concentration plots in between the freshwater and seawater input curve fig 4 in the upper transition zone at the northern and southern margin of the fwl dn 6 ds b the general trend of increasing 3h 3he ages with depth maximum observed age of 12 1 and 3 1 years respectively fig 3 continues between a depth of 2 6 m asl ow dn 6 and 4 6 m asl ow dn c however the trend reverses at the northern margin of the fwl increasing 3h concentrations in samples with a larger fraction of younger seawater with higher 3h content are associated with decreasing 3h 3he ages 8 5 years ow dn c and ow dn d this contradicts the conceptual assumption of increasing age with depth due to the location of the groundwater divide south of the dunes the groundwater flow direction in this part of the aquifer is towards the northern sea boundary the decreasing 3h 3he ages at greater depths might be the result of fast flowing groundwater originating from south of the dunes ds b ds c where very high seawater infiltration rates are assumed during yearly storm tides 4 2 simulated spatial groundwater age distribution the simulation results trhe model reveal the spatial distribution of groundwater ages within the entire aquifer it indicates an age stratification across the entire aquifer with younger water 0 5 years at the top becoming older with increasing depth fig 5 a as a result of simulated 3h and 3hetrit distributions in fig s 5 1 a b oldest groundwater ages of 40 years being the result of the simulation time of 42 years are found along the southern aquifer base indicating that the old saline groundwater in the model domain has not been flushed out by younger water recharging the aquifer in the 42 years of simulation time the simulated distribution of the stable 3h concentrations represents the 3h concentration of the recharging water meteoric and seawater at the time of infiltration fig s 5 1 c elevated atmospheric 3h concentrations of the 1970s fig 4 originating from the bomb tests in the 1950s and 60s can no longer be found in the aquifer today as stable 3h fig s 5 1 c as they have already been flushed out video s 6 1 depending on the mixing ratio of fresh and saline recharge fig s 3 1 differences regarding the stable 3h i e stable 3h and 3h concentration between the non inundated dune area only recharged by meteoric water as compared to the beach and salt marsh areas subject to storm tides are apparent fig s 5 1 a c video s 6 1 furthermore the simulated spatial and temporal distribution of stable 3h video s 6 1 clearly indicates the influence of the elevated 3h concentration of the north sea compared to the 3h concentration in precipitation see section 3 3 2 1 despite the indicated age stratification the simulation results fig 5 a suggest that fingering flow partly leads to a distortion of the vertical age stratification normally found in aquifers e g sültenfuß et al 2010 szabo et al 1996 vogel 1967 the flow and transport model holt et al 2019 suggests the occurrence of saltwater fingers due to seawater infiltration most apparent during storm tides in winter due to fingering associated 3h concentrations reach deeper parts of the aquifer being larger than the 3h concentrations of the surrounding groundwater at these depths fig s 5 1 a the evolving 3hetrit concentrations are consequently smaller within these saltwater fingers than concentrations in comparable depths fig s 5 1 b resulting in younger apparent 3h 3he ages in greater depths interrupting the age stratification fig 5 a to assess the model performance observed and simulated apparent ages at the ows were compared fig s 7 1 d note that the simulated mean ages of the last five years were used for the comparison with the observed ages to even out the strong variations in time caused by saltwater fingering flow which impedes a direct comparison fig s 2 1 and shown by the vertical error bars in fig s 7 1 d the comparison shows that despite some differences between simulated and measured data root mean square error rmse 3 88 years fig s 7 1 d the general trend is reasonable fig 3 simulated ages within the fwl are slightly overestimated and range between 1 6 and 5 5 years compared to the observed values larger ages are simulated especially for the ows of monitoring site ds fig 3 both the field and modeled maximum freshwater ages are considerably younger than the existence of the lens itself given that the fwl formation already started around 1975 holt et al 2019 the finding shows that the total fwl pore volume has been exchanged 8 times since the start of the fwl formation according to the observed simulated age of 5 years which indicates that its growth stagnates holt et al 2019 already concluded that the fwl has nearly reached quasi steady state conditions after 35 years of formation based on the salinity distribution this is due to the rather narrow fresh recharge area under present geomorphological conditions in combination with continuous mixing with seawater infiltrating during storm tides since reaching the quasi steady state condition the fwl pore volume was exchanged 1 5 times the fact that observed ages near the water table are younger than simulated ages could be attributed to 3hetrit loss due to incomplete confinement of 3hetrit in the groundwater which has not been considered in the simulation and would lead to lower apparent ages schlosser et al 1988 however this is unlikely as the confinement of 3hetrit is a function of vertical flow velocity schlosser et al 1989 with 0 7 m a 1 estimated by means of particle tracking the vertical flow velocity is comparable to the value described by szabo et al 1996 and above the critical value of 0 25 0 5 m a 1 below which 3hetrit loss increases rapidly schlosser et al 1989 notable differences are also encountered at the deepest ow b c below the beach the distinctly younger simulated age 8 years at ow b c as compared to the observed one 18 years fig 3 and fig s 7 1 d is caused by considering the mean age if taking the maximum simulated age upper part of the vertical error bar in fig s 7 1 d the deviation between observed and simulated age would be distinctly lower except for the upper parts ow dn 6 simulated 3h 3he ages are also overestimated within the transition zone fig 3 contrary to the observed 3h concentrations within the transition zone simulated values decrease with depth and simulated 3h 3he ages increase fig 3 which is what is expected but is not the case for the observations showing the reverse age stratification however simulated depth profiles over the entire aquifer thickness at the locations of ows dn and ds in fig 6 show that the observed depth dependent pattern of 3h and 3h 3he ages see section 4 1 is also indicated in the simulation but less pronounced and only visible at greater depth at a depth of 10 m bsl 3h concentrations increase again until 16 m bsl ow dn a similar pattern is found at ow ds between 6 m bsl and 15 m bsl fig 6 the observed reversing age gradient after increasing up to a certain age fig 3 can also be found in the simulated depth profiles fig 6 after reaching an age plateau i e constant ages at 10 m bsl ow dn and 8 m bsl ow ds simulated 3h 3he ages slightly decrease again beginning at a depth of 12 m bsl ow dn and 10 m bsl ow ds before they increase with depth again at 17 m bsl and 15 m bsl respectively fig 6 particle tracking fig s 8 1 suggests that this depth dependent pattern within the transition zone ow dn ds results from specific travel times of flow paths of brackish groundwater below the fwl originating south of the dunes constant ages are due to equally fast travel times of flow paths reaching the simulated profile at the same time the slightly decrease of the ages that is associated with an increase of 3h fig 6 is due to faster travel times of underneath flow paths we assume that this pattern is associated with seawater infiltration south of the dunes during storm tides the fact that its higher density leads to a more rapid downward transport and the location of the water divide south of the dunes it is possible that this simulated pattern also appears in reality but at a lesser depth which would explain the observed reversing age gradient differences between observed and simulated values might also be explained by wrong mixing ratios of the two endmembers fresh and saline groundwater compared to other studies post and houben 2017 röper et al 2013 vandenbohede and lebbe 2007 the assigned dispersivity values αl 4 m αvt 0 04 m are large but were chosen due to the large scale of the entire model area and the reasonable calibration of groundwater salinities holt et al 2019 the model holt et al 2019 however does not capture the dispersive mixing effects within the transition zone very well and the salinities were underestimated by the model fig s 9 1 according to post et al 2013 dispersive mixing is a significant parameter required to simulate groundwater salinity and age distributions realistically moreover the dispersivity appears to be a key parameter for the flow and transport in coastal aquifers a reduced dispersivity αl 0 5 m and αt 0 05 m in an additional model run captured freshwater ages and stable 3h concentrations better to some degree but only at monitoring site ds given the lower dispersivity mixing with underlying saline groundwater decreased to an extent that the resulting salinities were underestimated even more in the transition zone results not shown this finding supports the statement of post et al 2013 and also suggests that the longitudinal dispersivity should probably not be set uniformly across the entire model if mixing zones with large salinity ranges are present since the extent and the salinities of the fwl largely depend on the amount of meteoric recharge comte et al 2010 and therefore also the location of the transition zone reduced recharge rates could also impact the stable 3h concentrations and 3h 3he ages within the transition zone results suggest that the model parameters dispersivity in combination with recharge rates should be reconsidered in order to delineate observed 3h 3he ages in such a highly dynamic system characterized by time variable 3h endmembers however lacking sufficient data and knowledge about real dispersivity values and recharge infiltration rates we refrained from further modification of the calibrated flow and transport model instead of implementing real tides tide averaged heads were defined at the vertical model boundaries this was done due to the large computing effort that would be needed to resolve the tidal signal which is not feasible considering the decadal timescale of the simulation holt et al 2019 post et al 2019 data logger installed within the transition zone however showed that the groundwater salinities are related to the daily average sea level and are characterized by fluctuations on a daily time scale results not shown these salinity fluctuations suggest an oscillating transition zone with an alternating rise and fall of the fwl which presumably leads to more mixing of stable 3h and 3hetrit and resulting 3h 3he ages which was not considered in the simulation some uncertainty is also due to the 3h input concentrations in recharge fig 4 which were derived from measurements at the nearest rainfall stations and in the north sea however monthly measurements in precipitation show some scattering which was not considered because yearly averages were implemented in the simulation further assigned 3h concentrations in seawater are based on measurements at different locations in the north sea which reveal a large spatial variability similar to the meteoric recharge the 3h concentration of the recharging seawater is based on the mean recorded values of the respective simulation year exact concentrations of the actual infiltrating seawater at this site are therefore unknown 4 3 temporal development of the groundwater ages fig 6 illustrates the temporal development of simulated 3h stable 3h 3hetrit concentrations apparent 3h 3he ages average of ten and twelve years of simulation as well as observed values from 2016 equal to the last year of simulation as a function of depth at the locations of the monitoring sites due to the elevated atmospheric 3h concentrations in the 1970s maximum values of stable 3h are present near the water table in the years 1975 1984 the concentrations decline with depth to reach initial values of the simulation the 3h decline with depth is accompanied by an increase of the decay product 3hetrit given the short simulation time the vertical groundwater age distribution for the years 1975 1984 is rather uniform with largest ages in domains of the aquifer that have not been reached by infiltrating water yet the input concentration declines with time following the atmospheric decrease of 3h due to their increase in the north sea resulting from the enhanced discharge of tritium by reprocessing power plants nies et al 2010 input concentrations of stable 3h are greatest in the years 1995 2004 at monitoring site bn as compared to the other monitoring sites as the site has the highest salinities and hence the greatest influence of seawater in the years after the onset of the simulation the 3h bomb signal i e in this case elevated 3h in the 1970s as a consequence of the bomb tests is relocated and transported downwards whereby the signal plume widens due to dispersion as also suggested by post et al 2019 schlosser et al 1988 solomon et al 1992 among others this progress is also reflected in 3hetrit due to its production with time video s 6 1 while the 3h 3he ages generally increase with depth from 1975 onwards the shape of the average age for the years 2005 2016 is somewhat surprising fig 6 while the depth profiles for the monitoring sites dn and ds show the aforementioned depth dependent pattern see section 4 2 the depth profiles for monitoring sites bn and b show that the ages are more or less stagnant in the middle of the profiles 6 22 m bsl a similar pattern is found for the stable 3h concentration in the years 2005 2016 fig 6 temporal changes of the groundwater ages remain restricted to the deeper parts of the aquifer which have not been completely flushed out yet by younger water recharging the aquifer a 3h 3he age bias evoked by dispersive mixing as reported by post et al 2019 and solomon and sudicky 1991 among others as the reason for these characteristic depth profiles can probably be excluded since the direct ages of the da model are similar albeit slightly larger than the 3h 3he ages 4 4 comparison of the 3h 3he and direct age approach the simulated direct age distribution fig 5 b closely resembles the simulated 3h 3he age distribution fig 5 a similar to the model outcomes of the trhe model the simulation result of the da model also shows a distortion of the vertical age distribution pattern in aquifers due to fingering flow moreover the age distribution pattern below the salt marsh areas and the dunes of the da model is visually fairly congruent with the simulation results of the trhe model the comparison of the mean direct ages average of the last five years of simulation and the observed apparent 3h 3he ages fig s 7 1 e shows a comparable correlation rmse 3 66 years as for simulated and observed apparent 3h 3he ages fig s 7 1 d subtracting the simulated 3h 3he ages from the direct ages fig 5 c shows relatively large discrepancies near the mixing zones at the northern and southern vertical model boundary discrepancies of up to 8 years as well as in parts of the aquifer which are characterized by fingering flow these discrepancies are also visible in the comparison of simulated ages of both age approaches fig s 7 1 f although generally showing a good agreement direct ages are slightly older than the 3h 3he ages especially below the beach differences between both age approaches are also visible in the depth profiles in fig 6 these differences are attributable to the seawater intrusion during tides and most importantly during storm tides as well as due to seawater flowing into the model area along the vertical model boundaries the infiltration of young seawater with elevated stable 3h concentrations see section 3 3 2 1 leads to a concentration gradient between seawater and surrounding groundwater with lower stable 3h concentration the resulting hydrodynamic dispersion causes a mixing of the different water bodies with varying stable 3h concentrations and ages since the 3h 3he age of a sample mainly refers to the higher 3h concentration sültenfuß et al 2010 a bias towards the endmember with the younger ages occurs bethke and johnson 2008 post et al 2013 in deeper parts of the depth profiles for dn and ds the strong elevated 3h concentration la hague see section 3 3 2 1 mixes with older water that contains less stable 3h concentrations resulting in artificial younger ages compared to the direct ages similar to the age bias evoked by the 3h bomb peak described in solomon and sudicky 1991 at the ows bn and b the saltwater fingering flow leads to younger 3h 3he ages along the entire depth profile as young seawater that contains more stable 3h is mixed with older groundwater from deeper parts of the aquifer that exhibits less stable 3h this effect can also be seen in fig s 2 1 indicating a larger amplitude of the direct ages with larger maximum values compared to the 3h 3he ages dispersion of course may also affect the direct age concentration however due to the linear increase of the direct age zero order production rate i e a production rate of one year per one year elapsed the mixing effect caused by the hydrodynamic dispersion is less pronounced resulting in older direct ages compared to the 3h 3he ages shown in figs 5 c 6 and fig s 7 1 f 5 conclusions the groundwater of a young barrier island where a fwl recently formed was dated with the 3h 3he method comprehensive field data and numerical simulations allowed for a first depiction of the spatial distribution of groundwater ages 3h 3hetrit and stable 3h concentrations in a highly dynamic coastal aquifer characterized by mixing processes provoked mostly by inundations following storm tides the main conclusions of this study are areas subject to frequent seawater inundations and thus large infiltration rates as well as discharging freshwater from the fwl are characterized by the development of saltwater fingers disturbing to some extent the vertical age stratification observed and simulated groundwater ages at the bottom of the fwl are distinctly lower than the age of the fwl itself even though the investigated fwl itself is still very young since the start of the formation the freshwater volume got exchanged several times which might also be the case in comparable young fwls in similar coastal environments although chosen dispersivity values allowed for satisfactory description of the groundwater salinity distribution deviations between observed and simulated 3h 3he ages suggest the need to assign spatially variable and scale dependent i e travel distance based dispersivities this supports the statement of post et al 2013 that ages could be considered to estimate dispersivities however in a transient system as the one presented here this is likely not possible furthermore the deviations might also be due to the chosen model grid of 10 m in horizontal direction leading to an overestimated mixing of the 3h endmembers on the subgrid scale the simulation results of the 3h 3he ages and the comparison with direct ages show that the 3h 3he age dating method is applicable for coastal aquifers despite the evident mixing of saline and fresh groundwater at the study site in particular this is accompanied by mixing of different 3h concentrations depending on the mixing ratio of the two endmembers modeling the age distribution with the chosen 2 tracer approach helps to gain a better system understanding especially with respect to dispersion effects credit authorship contribution statement

342,besides other environmental tracers the use of the 3h 3he method enables the estimation of modern groundwater ages widely used in fresh groundwater studies the combination of tritium 3h and its stable daughter product tritiogenic helium 3 3hetrit however has so far only been applied in a few studies to date groundwater in coastal aquifers the coastal aquifer presented in this study is located at the very young eastern part of the north sea barrier island spiekeroog the so called ostplate that is characterized by a currently developing freshwater lens previously field and numerical modeling studies showed that the groundwater salinity distribution within this coastal aquifer is largely determined by seawater infiltration during storm tides the main aim of this study was to characterize the groundwater age distribution in a highly dynamic coastal aquifer using the 3h 3he age dating method in addition a transient 2 d density dependent flow and transport model that was calibrated to groundwater heads and salinity was utilized to assess whether measured 3h 3he ages can be reliably simulated despite the mixing of distinctly different and time variable 3h endmembers i e freshwater and seawater the numerical calculation of the 3h 3he age distribution thereby was based on the simulation of the fictive tracer stable tritium sum of 3h and 3hetrit and 3h even though the freshwater lens is very young both field observations and simulation results indicate notably lower ages within the freshwater lens as compared to the age of the lens itself simulation results show that frequent seawater infiltration most importantly during winter storm tides and discharging water from the freshwater lens lead to a disturbance of the vertical age stratification below the beach a

time e g due to variations in recharge conditions radioactive decay accumulation of a daughter isotope or a combination of the aforementioned measured tracer concentrations in groundwater can be related to a groundwater age mccallum et al 2015 given that the measured environmental tracer concentrations are subject to mixing of different flow paths due to e g hydrodynamic dispersion diffusion and long well screens the resulting ages may consist of a large range of ages and are therefore termed apparent ages these ages describe the time elapsed since the water entered the saturated zone and got isolated from the atmosphere due to recharge mccallum et al 2015 suckow 2014 szabo et al 1996 besides other environmental tracers e g cfcs 14c 36cl 85kr 39ar 18o 2h a widely used and reliable environmental tracer to estimate modern groundwater ages is tritium 3h in combination with its stable decay product tritiogenic helium 3 3hetrit whereby the apparent age is calculated based on the ratio of 3hetrit to 3h accounting for the half life constant schlosser et al 1988 the radioactive isotope of hydrogen 3h is naturally produced in the upper layers of the atmosphere but high concentrations were also released into the atmosphere by aboveground hydrogen bomb tests during the 1950s and early 1960s schlosser et al 1988 3h decays to the lighter stable isotope of helium 3hetrit due to its relatively short half life of 12 32 years lucas and unterweger 2000 the ³h concentration has been continuously decreasing since reaching a concentration peak so called tritium bomb peak with concentrations of about 10 000 tu in precipitation in 1962 1963 poreda et al 1988 schlosser et al 1988 since 3h is incorporated in the water molecule it is washed out from the atmosphere by precipitation and deposited in oceans lakes rivers and groundwater poreda et al 1988 sültenfuß and massmann 2004 dissolved 3hetrit originating from 3h decay in the unsaturated zone can be released back to the atmosphere while it accumulates in the groundwater within the saturated zone where gas exchange with the atmosphere is inhibited solomon et al 1993 sültenfuß et al 2010 although widely used in fresh groundwater studies the 3h 3he method was only applied to date groundwater in coastal aquifers in a limited number of studies post et al 2019 coastal aquifers are complex systems that comprise fresh groundwater and intruded seawater and are therefore characterized by variable density flow in tidal systems like barrier islands the density differences between these two endmembers impact the groundwater dynamics leading to the formation of typical hydraulic characteristics in the subterranean estuary ste where terrestrial groundwater and circulating seawater mix fig 1 fresh groundwater discharge on barrier islands from a freshwater lens fwl generally occurs near the low water line through a so called fresh groundwater discharge tube the latter is restricted from above by a tide induced upper saline plume of infiltrating recirculating seawater and from below by a density induced saltwater wedge where dispersion effects lead to seawater recirculation jiao and post 2019 moore 1999 robinson et al 2006 robinson et al 2007 robinson et al 2018 vandenbohede and lebbe 2006 2007 the combined discharge of recirculating seawater and fresh groundwater in the ste was termed submarine groundwater discharge burnett et al 2003 han et al 2012 and sivan et al 2005 for example used 3h to investigate mixing processes and timescales of seawater intrusion into a coastal aquifer caschetto et al 2016 were able to validate an existing conceptual model of aquifer salinization and to quantify recharge rates and flow patterns by the use of 3h as one of multiple tracers vandenbohede et al 2011 applied 3h 3he ages as a tracer for investigations concerning flow and transport of a coastal aquifer system in the belgian plain while sültenfuß et al 2010 obtained knowledge about groundwater dynamics on a regional scale and present day saltwater freshwater distributions in marshlands at the river ems estuary by using 3h 3he ages among other tracers focusing on fwls the 3h 3he age dating method was also used in coastal aquifers on the east frisian islands of langeoog and spiekeroog houben et al 2014 röper et al 2012 seibert et al 2018 the groundwater age dating thereby provided insights into internal flow dynamics of the investigated fwls revealed the influence of land use on the fwl thickness and enabled the calculation of groundwater recharge rates houben et al 2014 röper et al 2012 investigations by seibert et al 2018 showed that the hydrochemical evolution of a fwl in a homogeneous sandy aquifer is a function of the residence time and hydrochemical data correlates with the groundwater age compared to the unknown true mean age of a water parcel a calculated age based on a decaying radioactive tracer such as 3h is biased caused by the non linear decrease of the tracer along the flow path dispersive mixing leads to a higher tracer concentration than the water parcel would have without dispersion thus the radio active tracer age is biased towards a younger age this has been elaborated already in many previous studies e g bethke and johnson 2008 another problem arises if a water parcel contains endmembers of different age and of very different initial tracer concentrations in this case the tracer age of the water parcel is biased towards the endmember with the highest initial tracer concentrations for instance the 3h 3he ages of groundwaters that were affected by the tritium bomb peak are biased towards its respective peak time 3h 3he ages of samples older than bomb peak groundwater are therefore biased towards a younger and samples younger than bomb peak groundwater are biased towards an older age solomon and sudicky 1991 the bias thereby increases with increasing dispersive mixing the direct age after goode 1996 can be interpreted as the true mean age of groundwater but it cannot be measured directly the 3h 3he age and the direct age likely compare only well for samples that do not contain a mix of waters that are considerably different in both age and concentrations of stable tritium sum of 3h and 3hetrit only very few numerical modeling studies investigating on 3h 3hetrit and 3h 3he ages exist and hardly any study has used the 3h 3he method to date brackish groundwater at the land sea interface post et al 2013 were the first to conduct generic numerical studies on the steady state groundwater age distribution in coastal aquifers in their study the authors investigated how mixing and selected hydrogeological factors affect the groundwater age distribution in coastal aquifers comparing the approaches of piston flow age direct age and tracer based age 3h 3he and 14c the results of post et al 2013 show differences between the age distributions of the different methods applied in domains of the aquifer where mixing occurs triggered by dispersion and diffusion these differences become larger with increasing mixing they suggest that when comparing field data to modeled ages tracer based ages are more suitable in a recently published study post et al 2019 conducted numerical simulations to investigate the fate of 3h and 3hetrit in the fwl transition zone and saltwater wedge on the east frisian island langeoog their findings show that 3hetrit produced during the 3h bomb peak is still present in the studied fwl and can be used as a tracer for groundwater with an age under 60 years furthermore they discovered that on langeoog the bomb peak related age bias can be as high as 10 years although implementing a comparatively large longitudinal dispersivitiy 3h concentrations measured in the transition zone could not be replicated by their simulation and the authors suggested further work on studying mixing processes in the transition zone subject of the study presented here is a coastal aquifer located on the eastern part of the east frisian island spiekeroog the so called ostplate that is characterized by highly dynamic conditions although connected to the older main part of the island the ostplate represents a young dune island environment where dune formation only began in the 1940s below these dunes a fwl started to evolve in the mid of the 1970s because of its location within the lower saxon wadden sea national park which is acknowledged as a unesco world heritage site the study area is largely unaffected by human activities strict nature conservation regulations are in place and no groundwater abstraction for public water supply or any other infrastructure in the area is allowed in the absence of coastal protection measures the fwl development is influenced by natural dynamic changes storm tides occur roughly twice per year and inundate the entire ostplate except for the elevated dunes and geomorphology varies frequently holt et al 2019 röper et al 2013 using field data and a transient numerical density variable model holt et al 2017 and holt et al 2019 were able to reconstruct the evolution of this currently developing fwl and to assess the impact of the aforementioned dynamic conditions on the fwl formation and the present groundwater salinity distribution within the aquifer the present study aims at unraveling the overall flow and transport time scales in this aquifer applying numerical reactive transport modeling supported by groundwater age dating during a field campaign in september 2016 groundwater was sampled and analyzed with regard to 3h and 3hetrit concentrations to estimate the apparent 3h 3he groundwater ages numerical simulations with transient atmospheric and seawater 3h concentrations were conducted based on the model of holt et al 2019 to estimate the spatial groundwater age distribution and its development over time within the currently evolving fwl and the entire coastal aquifer as the 3h 3he age is affected by the aforementioned complications of endmember mixing and bomb peak related effects it may not represent the true mean age of a water sample well thus only the combined evaluation of reactive transport modeling accounting for the different endmembers transient 3h time series and 3h decay on the one hand and direct age simulations on the other in comparison with measured 3h 3he data will enable us to determine the real groundwater age distribution in the aquifer the specific aims of the study were i to characterize the groundwater age distribution in a highly dynamic coastal aquifer and ii to assess whether measured 3h 3he ages can reliably be simulated with an existing calibrated flow and transport model despite intense dynamics and distinctly different and time variable 3h endmembers i e seawater and freshwater of the system 2 study area 2 1 geology and geomorphology the study was conducted at the eastern part of the barrier island spiekeroog the ostplate spiekeroog is part of the east frisian island chain and is located 6 5 km in front of the coastline of northwest germany between the islands of langeoog to the west and wangerooge to the east fig 2 the total surface area of the present island is about 21 3 km² the older western part of spiekeroog 4 5 km in west east direction is inhabited while the remaining 5 3 km belong to the younger uninhabited and highly protected ostplate petersen and pott 2005 streif 1990 the oldest part of western spiekeroog was formed due to the aggregation of aeolian and marine sands in the mid 16th century sindowski 1970 the development of the ostplate however has started more recently and was caused by land reclamation and embankment activities at the mainland within the past 80 years the ostplate has evolved from a periodically flooded sand flat bare of dunes and vegetation towards a dune island röper et al 2013 the present prominent dune ridge that started forming in the 1970s has reached a maximum height of 11 m above sea level asl röper et al 2013 sheltered by the growing dunes the tidal flat has continuously risen above mean high water mhw which enabled the establishment of expansive salt marshes holt et al 2017 röper et al 2013 for further detailed information on the development of the ostplate refer to holt et al 2017 röper et al 2013 and seibert et al 2019 the subsurface of the western area of spiekeroog is composed of fluviatile pliocene sand deposits with local embeddings of peat at greater depths that are overlain by sandy glaciofluvial pleistocene deposits and fine to coarse grained holocene sands the sand deposits are underlain by a clay layer ranging from 1 5 15 m thickness at depths between 40 to 60 m oldenburg east frisian water association oowv 2009 röper et al 2012 seibert et al 2018 sediment cores taken on the ostplate showed that the aquifer at the eastern part of the island likewise consists of fine to coarse grained holocene sand deposits with minor fractions of clay and silt and comparatively higher fractions of shells in greater depth holt et al 2019 seibert et al 2019 2 2 hydrogeology affected by semidiurnal tides with a mean tidal range of 2 72 m the tidal regime of spiekeroog is classified as mesotidal according to the classification by hayes 1979 mhw is 1 39 m asl and mean low water mlw is 1 33 m below sea level bsl mean spring range and mean neap range are 3 09 m and 2 23 m respectively wasser und schifffahrtsverwaltung des bundes wsv federal waterways and shipping administration 2017 bundesamt für seeschifffahrt und hydrographie bsh federal maritime and hydrographic agency 2017 the average annual precipitation amounts to 808 mm a 1 at spiekeroog from 1984 to 2011 oowv 2012 groundwater recharge rates ranging between 300 and 640 mm a 1 were reported by röper et al 2012 the state office for mining energy and geology lbeg 2018 and the oowv 2009 for the dune area given the less permeable fine grained clayey and silty sediments as well as drainage by tidal creeks the salt marsh areas are characterized by lower recharge rates as suggested by sulzbacher et al 2012 and wiederhold et al 2015 located below the dunes at the western part of the island the present main fwl reaches a depth of 44 m bsl and is used for public water supply röper et al 2012 using the 3h 3hetrit method röper et al 2012 and seibert et al 2018 determined apparent 3h 3he groundwater ages within the main fwl at the western part of spiekeroog that increase with depth ranging between 4 and 51 years the formation of freshwater bodies below the dunes at the ostplate started in the 1970s and several fwls exist at present these fwls are restricted to the elevated dune areas exceeding the storm tide level 3 m asl holt et al 2017 reconstructions of past shallow groundwater salinities revealed an expansion of the areas underlain by freshwater in the past 15 years holt et al 2017 the asymmetrical fwl at the ostplate subject of this study has a maximum vertical extent of 4 m fig 3 while the transition zone is several meters thick with salinities increasing with depth the fwl extent in horizontal direction is 50 m and hence approximately 25 times smaller than the main fwl in the west holt et al 2019 röper et al 2012 tronicke 1997 field data and numerical simulations of holt et al 2017 and holt et al 2019 clearly indicate that the fwl is very sensitive to storm tides and seawater inundation both the near surface extent and the lateral and vertical extent of the fwl are largely a function of seawater infiltration during inundation events which mainly occur in winter and lead to salinization of former fresh parts of the lens see also seibert et al 2019 and thus to a lens shrinkage due to continuous mixing with infiltrating seawater during annual storm tides that inhibits further growth under the present geomorphological situation the fwl has already reached quasi steady state conditions 35 years after formation furthermore the numerical simulation results of holt et al 2019 suggest the occurrence of saltwater fingering flow especially below the beach north of the dunes a phenomenon previously proposed by modeling and laboratory studies in the context of coastal aquifers e g greskowiak 2014 and röper et al 2015 such saltwater fingers develop due to density differences between the infiltrating seawater and the discharging fresh brackish groundwater the fingers move downwards but also migrate horizontally from the upper beach towards northern coastline locally leading to substantial variabilities of groundwater salinity over time holt et al 2019 the common concept of a tide induced upper saline recirculation cell overlying groundwater discharge from the fwl as suggested by e g robinson et al 2006 robinson et al 2007 vandenbohede and lebbe 2006 is not clearly discernible in the model due to these instabilities 3 material and methods 3 1 instrumentation and sampling groundwater samples for 3h 3he age dating were collected at six monitoring sites in september 2016 the monitoring sites were installed in a transect that is oriented along the assumed north south groundwater flow direction following the general topographic gradient at the western part of the study area holt et al 2019 fig 2 the depth specific samples n 10 were extracted from multi level observation wells ows installed at the beach monitoring site b three piezometers with a single screen each and at the northern monitoring site dn four piezometers with a single screen each and southern monitoring site ds three piezometers with a single screen each dune base respectively fig 3 supplementary material table s 1 1 three additional samples were collected at shallow single screen ows installed within the salt marsh south of the dunes fig 2 table s 1 1 the screen length of all ows is 1 m with a 2 inch diameter using also the direct push method probe water sampler dp32 42 with 1 inch internal filter of 0 5 m

permanent ows dn and ds alone fig 3 table s 1 1 groundwater samples were extracted from all ows using either a submersible pump gigant eijkelkamp or a foot valve pump s 60 stitz within the direct push method respectively the samples for the 3h analysis were stored in 1 l polyethylene bottles whereas samples for the 3hetrit analysis were filled in two 40 ml copper tubes after flushing the tubes with the water to be sampled a transparent tube was attached at the inlet of the copper tubes and controlled while sampling to ensure a bubble free filling of the helium samples a clamp at the outlet of the copper tubes was used to regulate the flow rate and to increase the pressure in order to prevent potential degassing during sampling the tubes were pinched off at both sides starting with the outlet while pumping similar to e g solomon et al 1992 sültenfuß 2009 szabo et al 1996 duplicate samples were taken for each sampling site the 3h and 3hetrit analysis as well as determination of the apparent 3h 3he ages was subsequently conducted at the institute of environmental physics university of bremen sültenfuß et al 2009 3 2 groundwater age dating with 3h and 3hetrit a groundwater age dating method using both 3h and its decay product 3hetrit was first introduced by tolstikhin and kamenskij 1969 using eq 1 the relationship between 3h and 3hetrit gives a time parameter reflecting the residence time in the saturated zone i e the elapsed time between recharge last contact with atmosphere and sampling which is independent of the ³h input concentration and seasonal or regional variations respectively cook and solomon 1997 schlosser et al 1988 sültenfuß and massmann 2004 1 τ 1 λ ln 1 3 h e t r i t 3 h with τ 3h 3he age yrs λ decay constant 0 05626 yr 1 λ ln 2 t1 2 3h concentration of 3h tu 3hetrit concentration of 3hetrit tu produced by radioactive decay of 3h however according to schlosser et al 1988 and solomon and sudicky 1991 dispersive mixing of the 3h bomb peak leads to a bias of 3h 3he ages towards the highest 3h concentration resulting in 3h 3he ages younger than actual ages in groundwater older than the bomb peak the ages calculated with eq 1 are generally referred to as apparent 3h 3he ages within analysis 3hetrit must be separated from 3he sources other than 3h decay in the water solomon et al 1992 sültenfuß et al 2010 further detailed information about the 3h 3he age dating method can be found in e g poreda et al 1988 schlosser et al 1988 solomon et al 1992 solomon and sudicky 1991 sültenfuß et al 2010 and sültenfuß and massmann 2004 in the following these apparent 3h 3he ages are referred to as observed 3h 3he ages as compared to numerically simulated 3h 3he ages 3 3 numerical model holt et al 2019 generated a transient

described in holt et al 2019 tide averaged constant heads rather than real tides following the approach of vandenbohede and lebbe 2006 2007 were assigned to the vertical model boundaries at the mhw mark fig s 3 1 non dispersive flux boundary conditions were assigned to the vertical boundaries for the transport model water entering the model domain through the constant head flow boundaries had a salinity of 32 g l 1 while the salinity of discharging water was set to the salinity of the water computed at the boundary cell a specified flux boundary simulating the recharge along the top boundary was divided into recharge zones fig s 3 1 characterized by different recharge rates table s 3 1 the recharge salinities defined for the non dispersive flux boundary at the top boundary are mainly a function of ground surface elevation and resulting inundation frequency holt et al 2017 and follow a gradient from fresh recharge 0 g l 1 in the elevated dunes to increasing salinities with increasing distance from the dunes towards the lower lying beach and salt marsh areas table s 3 1 fig s 3 1 further model parameters are given in table 1 to account for the storm tides inundating the entire ostplate except for the elevated dune areas 3 m asl on average two times per year transient recharge rates based on the thickness of the unsaturated zone and porosity referred to as infiltration rates

infiltration recharge and corresponding recharge salinity distribution during storm tides as well as during the remainder of the year are listed in table s 3 1 refer to the supplementary material s 3 and holt et al 2019 for more information on boundary conditions 3 3 2 simulation of the groundwater age distribution the flow and transport model formed the basis for the calculation of the spatial and temporal distribution and development of the apparent 3h 3he ages in the following referred to as tritium helium model trhe model whereby we chose not to adjust any of the previously calibrated flow and transport parameters table 1 table s 3 1 groundwater ages were also calculated using the direct age approach after goode 1996 in an additional model case in the following referred to as direct age model da model for comparison with the results of the trhe model both model cases were conducted using seawat langevin et al 2008 the transient simulations covered the period from 1975 assumed start of fwl development to 2016 time of sampling the geometric multigrid solver gmg was used for the numerical solution of the groundwater flow in conjunction with the generalized conjugate gradient gcg the hybrid method of characteristics hmoc was used to solve the transport equation according to zheng and bennett 1995 the hmoc scheme provides a solution with virtually no numerical dispersion independent from the grid peclet number but is prone to small mass balance errors in all our simulations a mass balance error of 1 1 was ensured 3 3 2 1 tritium helium trhe model to calculate the apparent 3h 3he age distribution numerically both the transport of the fictive tracer stable 3h as well as 3h was simulated the latter is characterized by a 1st order decay λ 0 05626 yr 1 while the stable 3h is not subject to decay and is therefore a conservative tracer instead of directly simulating 3hetrit which is formed by the decay of 3h the 3hetrit concentration was obtained by subtracting the remaining 3h from the stable 3h concentration the stable 3h is equivalent to the sum of 3h and 3hetrit i e the initial concentration of 3h of water recharging the aquifer meteoric water and seawater respectively this approach was chosen because the hydrodynamic dispersion outweighs the effect of the different molecular diffusion coefficients of 3h and 3hetrit on the 3h 3he age this assumption is valid if the pore water flow velocities exceed 0 3 m a 1 solomon and sudicky 1991 which is the case at the here investigated field site the simulated apparent 3h 3he ages were subsequently determined based on the ratio of the calculated 3hetrit to simulated 3h concentration using eq 1 similar to post et al 2013 we assumed that 3hetrit only emerged from the 3h decay and no other sources the yearly varying atmospheric and seawater 3h concentrations were applied to the non dispersive flux boundary at the top similar to koh et al 2018 whereby they were assigned based on the mixing ratio of fresh and seawater inferred by the salinity of the recharging water fig s 3 1 3h records of the german rainfall station cuxhaven time series since 1978 and the dutch rainfall station groningen time series since 1970 iaea 2019 were merged to provide a continuous time series from 1975 2016 fig 4 assuming that the travel time across the unsaturated zone was short the mean concentration in precipitation of the respective year was assigned to the freshwater recharge salinity 0 g l 1 for the respective year as done in the similar approach by post et al 2019 the higher the recharge salinities the larger the content of seawater see section 3 3 1 mean 3h concentrations that were measured in the german bight bundesamt für strahlenschutz bfs federal office for radiation protection meyerjürgens 2016 nies et al 2010 sültenfuß pers comm 2019 wedekind 1982 were assigned to the seawater salinity 32 g l 1 recharging the aquifer water entering the model domain across the constant head flow boundaries had a 3h concentration of seawater of the respective year while water discharging through this boundary had a concentration computed at the boundary cell fig 4 shows the annually varying 3h concentrations that were applied to the input boundaries for meteoric water and seawater because the nuclear reprocessing plant la hague france started increasingly discharging effluents to the english channel around 1995 3h concentrations in seawater increased significantly in the mid of the 1990s and have been larger than 3h concentrations in precipitation ever since nies et al 2010 beyond that the 3h concentration of the north sea is also influenced by nuclear power plants along rivers discharging into the north sea nies et al 2010 during the two storm tides each year 3h concentrations corresponding to seawater of the respective year fig 4 were assigned to inundated areas along the cross section a a salinity of 32 g l 1 fig s 3 1 table s 3 2 gives an overview on the 3h concentration time series in recharge that were applied to the non dispersive flux boundary at the model top during storm tides as well as during the remainder of the year 3 3 2 2 direct age da model based on the concept of age mass after goode 1996 the groundwater age distribution in the da model was simulated by using age as a species undergoing zero order production with an increase of one concentration unit per one year elapsed e g engesgaard and molson 1998 greskowiak et al 2013 post et al 2013 sánchez et al 2018 initially an age of zero was assigned which also holds for water entering the model domain across the top boundary and at the vertical model boundaries respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 observed spatial groundwater age distribution the observed 3h 3he ages of the freshwater samples range between 0 3 years near the water table ow dn a and 4 9 years at the bottom of the fwl dn b which reflects an estimate of the maximum travel time within the fwl measured 3h and 3hetrit concentrations are shown in table s 1 1 and fig s 4 1 the fact that ages are stratified vertically fig 3 is in line with findings reported for fwls at the neighboring east frisian islands of langeoog and baltrum houben et al 2014 post and houben 2017 for the western fwl at spiekeroog röper et al 2012 seibert et al 2018 as well as with groundwater age stratifications proposed by modeling and laboratory studies of e g greskowiak et al 2013 and stoeckl and houben 2012 measured stable 3h concentrations in the fwl table s 1 1 fig s 4 1 match the 3h concentrations in precipitation recorded for cuxhaven fig 4 similar to shallow wells screened within the fwl at the western part of spiekeroog röper et al 2012 the high stable 3h concentration measured at ow dn a compared to the other fresh samples is attributed to the higher monthly atmospheric 3h concentration recorded for the calculated infiltration point in time fig 4 apparent 3h 3he ages increasing with depth were also observed for saline groundwater samples below the beach fig 3 ranging between 2 6 years ow b a and 18 years ow b c saline samples collected at the most northern sampling point ow bn show an age of 0 years at the top indicating recently infiltrated water both the 3h and stable 3h concentrations of the saline samples clearly show the influence of the north sea with its higher 3h concentration as concentrations are notable larger than the freshwater values table s 1 1 fig s 4 1 and stable 3h concentrations are close to the seawater concentration of 3h at the calculated infiltration point in time fig 4 the highest stable 3h concentration of the saline samples was measured in the deepest ow 29 tu b c since this sample also contains a freshwater ratio of 30 40 the stable 3h concentration plots in between the freshwater and seawater input curve fig 4 in the upper transition zone at the northern and southern margin of the fwl dn 6 ds b the general trend of increasing 3h 3he ages with depth maximum observed age of 12 1 and 3 1 years respectively fig 3 continues between a depth of 2 6 m asl ow dn 6 and 4 6 m asl ow dn c however the trend reverses at the northern margin of the fwl increasing 3h concentrations in samples with a larger fraction of younger seawater with higher 3h content are associated with decreasing 3h 3he ages 8 5 years ow dn c and ow dn d this contradicts the conceptual assumption of increasing age with depth due to the location of the groundwater divide south of the dunes the groundwater flow direction in this part of the aquifer is towards the northern sea boundary the decreasing 3h 3he ages at greater depths might be the result of fast flowing groundwater originating from south of the dunes ds b ds c where very high seawater infiltration rates are assumed during yearly storm tides 4 2 simulated spatial groundwater age distribution the simulation results trhe model reveal the spatial distribution of groundwater ages within the entire aquifer it indicates an age stratification across the entire aquifer with younger water 0 5 years at the top becoming older with increasing depth fig 5 a as a result of simulated 3h and 3hetrit distributions in fig s 5 1 a b oldest groundwater ages of 40 years being the result of the simulation time of 42 years are found along the southern aquifer base indicating that the old saline groundwater in the model domain has not been flushed out by younger water recharging the aquifer in the 42 years of simulation time the simulated distribution of the stable 3h concentrations represents the 3h concentration of the recharging water meteoric and seawater at the time of infiltration fig s 5 1 c elevated atmospheric 3h concentrations of the 1970s fig 4 originating from the bomb tests in the 1950s and 60s can no longer be found in the aquifer today as stable 3h fig s 5 1 c as they have already been flushed out video s 6 1 depending on the mixing ratio of fresh and saline recharge fig s 3 1 differences regarding the stable 3h i e stable 3h and 3h concentration between the non inundated dune area only recharged by meteoric water as compared to the beach and salt marsh areas subject to storm tides are apparent fig s 5 1 a c video s 6 1 furthermore the simulated spatial and temporal distribution of stable 3h video s 6 1 clearly indicates the influence of the elevated 3h concentration of the north sea compared to the 3h concentration in precipitation see section 3 3 2 1 despite the indicated age stratification the simulation results fig 5 a suggest that fingering flow partly leads to a distortion of the vertical age stratification normally found in aquifers e g sültenfuß et al 2010 szabo et al 1996 vogel 1967 the flow and transport model holt et al 2019 suggests the occurrence of saltwater fingers due to seawater infiltration most apparent during storm tides in winter due to fingering associated 3h concentrations reach deeper parts of the aquifer being larger than the 3h concentrations of the surrounding groundwater at these depths fig s 5 1 a the evolving 3hetrit concentrations are consequently smaller within these saltwater fingers than concentrations in comparable depths fig s 5 1 b resulting in younger apparent 3h 3he ages in greater depths interrupting the age stratification fig 5 a to assess the model performance observed and simulated apparent ages at the ows were compared fig s 7 1 d note that the simulated mean ages of the last five years were used for the comparison with the observed ages to even out the strong variations in time caused by saltwater fingering flow which impedes a direct comparison fig s 2 1 and shown by the vertical error bars in fig s 7 1 d the comparison shows that despite some differences between simulated and measured data root mean square error rmse 3 88 years fig s 7 1 d the general trend is reasonable fig 3 simulated ages within the fwl are slightly overestimated and range between 1 6 and 5 5 years compared to the observed values larger ages are simulated especially for the ows of monitoring site ds fig 3 both the field and modeled maximum freshwater ages are considerably younger than the existence of the lens itself given that the fwl formation already started around 1975 holt et al 2019 the finding shows that the total fwl pore volume has been exchanged 8 times since the start of the fwl formation according to the observed simulated age of 5 years which indicates that its growth stagnates holt et al 2019 already concluded that the fwl has nearly reached quasi steady state conditions after 35 years of formation based on the salinity distribution this is due to the rather narrow fresh recharge area under present geomorphological conditions in combination with continuous mixing with seawater infiltrating during storm tides since reaching the quasi steady state condition the fwl pore volume was exchanged 1 5 times the fact that observed ages near the water table are younger than simulated ages could be attributed to 3hetrit loss due to incomplete confinement of 3hetrit in the groundwater which has not been considered in the simulation and would lead to lower apparent ages schlosser et al 1988 however this is unlikely as the confinement of 3hetrit is a function of vertical flow velocity schlosser et al 1989 with 0 7 m a 1 estimated by means of particle tracking the vertical flow velocity is comparable to the value described by szabo et al 1996 and above the critical value of 0 25 0 5 m a 1 below which 3hetrit loss increases rapidly schlosser et al 1989 notable differences are also encountered at the deepest ow b c below the beach the distinctly younger simulated age 8 years at ow b c as compared to the observed one 18 years fig 3 and fig s 7 1 d is caused by considering the mean age if taking the maximum simulated age upper part of the vertical error bar in fig s 7 1 d the deviation between observed and simulated age would be distinctly lower except for the upper parts ow dn 6 simulated 3h 3he ages are also overestimated within the transition zone fig 3 contrary to the observed 3h concentrations within the transition zone simulated values decrease with depth and simulated 3h 3he ages increase fig 3 which is what is expected but is not the case for the observations showing the reverse age stratification however simulated depth profiles over the entire aquifer thickness at the locations of ows dn and ds in fig 6 show that the observed depth dependent pattern of 3h and 3h 3he ages see section 4 1 is also indicated in the simulation but less pronounced and only visible at greater depth at a depth of 10 m bsl 3h concentrations increase again until 16 m bsl ow dn a similar pattern is found at ow ds between 6 m bsl and 15 m bsl fig 6 the observed reversing age gradient after increasing up to a certain age fig 3 can also be found in the simulated depth profiles fig 6 after reaching an age plateau i e constant ages at 10 m bsl ow dn and 8 m bsl ow ds simulated 3h 3he ages slightly decrease again beginning at a depth of 12 m bsl ow dn and 10 m bsl ow ds before they increase with depth again at 17 m bsl and 15 m bsl respectively fig 6 particle tracking fig s 8 1 suggests that this depth dependent pattern within the transition zone ow dn ds results from specific travel times of flow paths of brackish groundwater below the fwl originating south of the dunes constant ages are due to equally fast travel times of flow paths reaching the simulated profile at the same time the slightly decrease of the ages that is associated with an increase of 3h fig 6 is due to faster travel times of underneath flow paths we assume that this pattern is associated with seawater infiltration south of the dunes during storm tides the fact that its higher density leads to a more rapid downward transport and the location of the water divide south of the dunes it is possible that this simulated pattern also appears in reality but at a lesser depth which would explain the observed reversing age gradient differences between observed and simulated values might also be explained by wrong mixing ratios of the two endmembers fresh and saline groundwater compared to other studies post and houben 2017 röper et al 2013 vandenbohede and lebbe 2007 the assigned dispersivity values αl 4 m αvt 0 04 m are large but were chosen due to the large scale of the entire model area and the reasonable calibration of groundwater salinities holt et al 2019 the model holt et al 2019 however does not capture the dispersive mixing effects within the transition zone very well and the salinities were underestimated by the model fig s 9 1 according to post et al 2013 dispersive mixing is a significant parameter required to simulate groundwater salinity and age distributions realistically moreover the dispersivity appears to be a key parameter for the flow and transport in coastal aquifers a reduced dispersivity αl 0 5 m and αt 0 05 m in an additional model run captured freshwater ages and stable 3h concentrations better to some degree but only at monitoring site ds given the lower dispersivity mixing with underlying saline groundwater decreased to an extent that the resulting salinities were underestimated even more in the transition zone results not shown this finding supports the statement of post et al 2013 and also suggests that the longitudinal dispersivity should probably not be set uniformly across the entire model if mixing zones with large salinity ranges are present since the extent and the salinities of the fwl largely depend on the amount of meteoric recharge comte et al 2010 and therefore also the location of the transition zone reduced recharge rates could also impact the stable 3h concentrations and 3h 3he ages within the transition zone results suggest that the model parameters dispersivity in combination with recharge rates should be reconsidered in order to delineate observed 3h 3he ages in such a highly dynamic system characterized by time variable 3h endmembers however lacking sufficient data and knowledge about real dispersivity values and recharge infiltration rates we refrained from further modification of the calibrated flow and transport model instead of implementing real tides tide averaged heads were defined at the vertical model boundaries this was done due to the large computing effort that would be needed to resolve the tidal signal which is not feasible considering the decadal timescale of the simulation holt et al 2019 post et al 2019 data logger installed within the transition zone however showed that the groundwater salinities are related to the daily average sea level and are characterized by fluctuations on a daily time scale results not shown these salinity fluctuations suggest an oscillating transition zone with an alternating rise and fall of the fwl which presumably leads to more mixing of stable 3h and 3hetrit and resulting 3h 3he ages which was not considered in the simulation some uncertainty is also due to the 3h input concentrations in recharge fig 4 which were derived from measurements at the nearest rainfall stations and in the north sea however monthly measurements in precipitation show some scattering which was not considered because yearly averages were implemented in the simulation further assigned 3h concentrations in seawater are based on measurements at different locations in the north sea which reveal a large spatial variability similar to the meteoric recharge the 3h concentration of the recharging seawater is based on the mean recorded values of the respective simulation year exact concentrations of the actual infiltrating seawater at this site are therefore unknown 4 3 temporal development of the groundwater ages fig 6 illustrates the temporal development of simulated 3h stable 3h 3hetrit concentrations apparent 3h 3he ages average of ten and twelve years of simulation as well as observed values from 2016 equal to the last year of simulation as a function of depth at the locations of the monitoring sites due to the elevated atmospheric 3h concentrations in the 1970s maximum values of stable 3h are present near the water table in the years 1975 1984 the concentrations decline with depth to reach initial values of the simulation the 3h decline with depth is accompanied by an increase of the decay product 3hetrit given the short simulation time the vertical groundwater age distribution for the years 1975 1984 is rather uniform with largest ages in domains of the aquifer that have not been reached by infiltrating water yet the input concentration declines with time following the atmospheric decrease of 3h due to their increase in the north sea resulting from the enhanced discharge of tritium by reprocessing power plants nies et al 2010 input concentrations of stable 3h are greatest in the years 1995 2004 at monitoring site bn as compared to the other monitoring sites as the site has the highest salinities and hence the greatest influence of seawater in the years after the onset of the simulation the 3h bomb signal i e in this case elevated 3h in the 1970s as a consequence of the bomb tests is relocated and transported downwards whereby the signal plume widens due to dispersion as also suggested by post et al 2019 schlosser et al 1988 solomon et al 1992 among others this progress is also reflected in 3hetrit due to its production with time video s 6 1 while the 3h 3he ages generally increase with depth from 1975 onwards the shape of the average age for the years 2005 2016 is somewhat surprising fig 6 while the depth profiles for the monitoring sites dn and ds show the aforementioned depth dependent pattern see section 4 2 the depth profiles for monitoring sites bn and b show that the ages are more or less stagnant in the middle of the profiles 6 22 m bsl a similar pattern is found for the stable 3h concentration in the years 2005 2016 fig 6 temporal changes of the groundwater ages remain restricted to the deeper parts of the aquifer which have not been completely flushed out yet by younger water recharging the aquifer a 3h 3he age bias evoked by dispersive mixing as reported by post et al 2019 and solomon and sudicky 1991 among others as the reason for these characteristic depth profiles can probably be excluded since the direct ages of the da model are similar albeit slightly larger than the 3h 3he ages 4 4 comparison of the 3h 3he and direct age approach the simulated direct age distribution fig 5 b closely resembles the simulated 3h 3he age distribution fig 5 a similar to the model outcomes of the trhe model the simulation result of the da model also shows a distortion of the vertical age distribution pattern in aquifers due to fingering flow moreover the age distribution pattern below the salt marsh areas and the dunes of the da model is visually fairly congruent with the simulation results of the trhe model the comparison of the mean direct ages average of the last five years of simulation and the observed apparent 3h 3he ages fig s 7 1 e shows a comparable correlation rmse 3 66 years as for simulated and observed apparent 3h 3he ages fig s 7 1 d subtracting the simulated 3h 3he ages from the direct ages fig 5 c shows relatively large discrepancies near the mixing zones at the northern and southern vertical model boundary discrepancies of up to 8 years as well as in parts of the aquifer which are characterized by fingering flow these discrepancies are also visible in the comparison of simulated ages of both age approaches fig s 7 1 f although generally showing a good agreement direct ages are slightly older than the 3h 3he ages especially below the beach differences between both age approaches are also visible in the depth profiles in fig 6 these differences are attributable to the seawater intrusion during tides and most importantly during storm tides as well as due to seawater flowing into the model area along the vertical model boundaries the infiltration of young seawater with elevated stable 3h concentrations see section 3 3 2 1 leads to a concentration gradient between seawater and surrounding groundwater with lower stable 3h concentration the resulting hydrodynamic dispersion causes a mixing of the different water bodies with varying stable 3h concentrations and ages since the 3h 3he age of a sample mainly refers to the higher 3h concentration sültenfuß et al 2010 a bias towards the endmember with the younger ages occurs bethke and johnson 2008 post et al 2013 in deeper parts of the depth profiles for dn and ds the strong elevated 3h concentration la hague see section 3 3 2 1 mixes with older water that contains less stable 3h concentrations resulting in artificial younger ages compared to the direct ages similar to the age bias evoked by the 3h bomb peak described in solomon and sudicky 1991 at the ows bn and b the saltwater fingering flow leads to younger 3h 3he ages along the entire depth profile as young seawater that contains more stable 3h is mixed with older groundwater from deeper parts of the aquifer that exhibits less stable 3h this effect can also be seen in fig s 2 1 indicating a larger amplitude of the direct ages with larger maximum values compared to the 3h 3he ages dispersion of course may also affect the direct age concentration however due to the linear increase of the direct age zero order production rate i e a production rate of one year per one year elapsed the mixing effect caused by the hydrodynamic dispersion is less pronounced resulting in older direct ages compared to the 3h 3he ages shown in figs 5 c 6 and fig s 7 1 f 5 conclusions the groundwater of a young barrier island where a fwl recently formed was dated with the 3h 3he method comprehensive field data and numerical simulations allowed for a first depiction of the spatial distribution of groundwater ages 3h 3hetrit and stable 3h concentrations in a highly dynamic coastal aquifer characterized by mixing processes provoked mostly by inundations following storm tides the main conclusions of this study are areas subject to frequent seawater inundations and thus large infiltration rates as well as discharging freshwater from the fwl are characterized by the development of saltwater fingers disturbing to some extent the vertical age stratification observed and simulated groundwater ages at the bottom of the fwl are distinctly lower than the age of the fwl itself even though the investigated fwl itself is still very young since the start of the formation the freshwater volume got exchanged several times which might also be the case in comparable young fwls in similar coastal environments although chosen dispersivity values allowed for satisfactory description of the groundwater salinity distribution deviations between observed and simulated 3h 3he ages suggest the need to assign spatially variable and scale dependent i e travel distance based dispersivities this supports the statement of post et al 2013 that ages could be considered to estimate dispersivities however in a transient system as the one presented here this is likely not possible furthermore the deviations might also be due to the chosen model grid of 10 m in horizontal direction leading to an overestimated mixing of the 3h endmembers on the subgrid scale the simulation results of the 3h 3he ages and the comparison with direct ages show that the 3h 3he age dating method is applicable for coastal aquifers despite the evident mixing of saline and fresh groundwater at the study site in particular this is accompanied by mixing of different 3h concentrations depending on the mixing ratio of the two endmembers modeling the age distribution with the chosen 2 tracer approach helps to gain a better system understanding especially with respect to dispersion effects credit authorship contribution statement

evaluated the influence of each individual animal performance and type of diet this study calculated the volumetric water footprint wf in its three dimensions green blue and grey the reference units were l kg lw 1 liters per kg of live weight and l kg cw 1 liters per kg of carcass weight this study used a population of 52 nelore bulls bos taurus indicus in the feedlot phase cattle were divided into two subgroups by weight each subgroup was further divided into nutritional treatment groups co product feed light animals cop l and heavy cop h and conventional feed light animals con l and heavy con h co product diet consisted of corn silage corn germ citrus pulp peanut meal conventional diet consisted of corn silage maize soybean meal the type of diet did not significant affect carcass weight and live weight p 0 05 the individual animal wf varied from 32 569 l 29 923 l kg cw 1 and from 18 279 16 803 l kg lw 1 the weight of animals did not significantly affect performance indicators and water footprints for conventional diet p 0 05 but the green and total water footprints were significantly affected for co product diets p 0 05 this information could be used to support improvements in policies and good practices for farmers and policy makers to enhance the beef water efficiency the study also contributed to produce data that are still scarce in science about the use of water along beef chain and benchmark water footprint the generation of information about meat water footprint and practices that can make the product more water efficient will have immediate value

society development and for world food commerce brazil has the second largest cattle herd in the world being the largest exporter and the second largest producer of beef the brazilian cattle population is estimated to be 214 9 million animals and is responsible for 6 of the gross domestic product ibge 2019 of the brazilian cattle herd about 80 is composed of bos indicus and of this percentage about 90 are the nelore breed associação brasileira de inseminação artificial asbia 2019 the brazilian beef production system is considered to be grass fed animals but the reality is that many animals finish in feedlots pereira 2004 ferraz and felicio 2010 from 2000 to 2018 the number of feedlot cattle in brazil grew by about 64 6 this represents an average annual increase of around 7

advances in animal performance indicators increase of productivity per area and expansion of the feedlot system but the quantitative and qualitative impact of these aspects on water use has not been assessed brazil has abundant water availability in quantity and quality which helps the competitive framework for brazilian animal products agência nacional de águas ana 2019 accounted that brazilian agriculture was responsible for 79 of total water consumption irrigation being responsible for 68 4 and animal drinking for 10 8 of the total animal consumption cattle represent 88 followed by pigs 5 and poultry 2 flachsbarth et al 2015 brazil is an important international player supporting food security for the world due its availability of water resources water use quantification in beef meat production is important because it is a commodity often criticized for inefficient input conversion baxter et al 2017 water footprint analysis can be used to understand the water demand for beef production systems from an individual farm perspective and freshwater demands due to intensification murphy et al 2017 there are substantial knowledge gaps about water footprint of beef production because it is new field of research and there are few management practices that could enhance the efficiency of conversion of water to marketable beef quantifying water use in ruminant production is a crucial step for identifying strategies for water use in other meat legesse et al 2017 west and baxter 2018 spore et al 2020 it is paramount to understand where and how water is used by the beef industry because it will enable obtaining knowledge to improve resource use maré et al 2020 argue that a bottom up approach to evaluate beef water footprint promote accurate estimations and can be used to recommend best practices west and baxter 2018 suggest that animal management must be optimized to enhance water efficiency in beef cattle sector we are researching how to improve livestock water efficiency and what management decisions or technological solutions farmers can utilize to promote this efficiency optimizing animal nutrition is one practice of improving sustainability of ruminant production systems white et al 2015 animal nutrition research has focused on improving energy and protein use efficiency however the potential environmental benefit of these research avenues has not been well investigated white 2016 changes in ruminant diet are necessary to improve environmental value of their products livestock play a critical role in adding value to agrifood residual products mottet et al 2017 cattle can upcycle human inedible feeds and convert them into a high quality beef co products as cattle feed decrease agroindustry waste by providing an alternative use andreini 2019 and may replace up to 100 of cereal grains in ruminant nutrition knaus 2012 crop residues and by products are opportunities to reduce the water footprint of animal production mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 the aims of this study were to calculate the water footprint for a tropical cow calf stocker feedlot production system and to evaluate the influence of each individual animal performance and type of diet we also analyse the impact of these production aspects in the water consumed by feedlot cattle slaughtered in the year 2018 in brazil there are not studies addressing the water demands of brazilian pasture feedlot based beef using farm specific data and the water consumed in the processing plant the results presented are a realistic evaluation of the water footprint for brazilian beef because fewer assumptions were required due to the nature of data collected this was especially the case for feed and water consumption at the feedlot because they were measured individually this study evaluate the water footprint with a new approach individual animal and nutritional management to assess water use in beef meat enabling farmers companies and consumers improve and evaluate the water management and commodity efficiency we discuss the results from the perspectives of the production system farmers trade and consumption perspective 2 material and methods this study calculated the volumetric water footprint wf with a product focused assessment water footprint network approach 2012 lathuillière et al 2018a the water consumed was considered to be the sum of feed crop evapotranspiration plus water in the feed green water consumption of ground and surface waters blue water from production system and processing plant and consumption of water by nature to depurate the effluent from processing plant grey water the boundaries of the system were cradle to processing plant which involved meat production at farm level and manufacturing process at slaughter the wf calculation in the farm system considered the three main phases of beef production cow calf stocker and feedlot this study applies a bottom up approach where farm and processing plant specific data were used to calculate a detailed wf this study works with two reference units in order to increase comparability with other studies the reference units were l kg lw 1 liters per kg of live weight and l kg cw 1 liters per kg of carcass weight 2 1 study design this study used a population of 52 nelore bulls bos taurus indicus born in 2014 and slaughtered in 2016 animals grazed in extensive unmodified pasture without artificial fertilizer or irrigation from december 2014 to july 2016 before transfer to a feedlot this production system is representative of typical beef cattle in brazil feed requirements to meet maintenance growth gestation and or lactation needs during the cow calf and stocker phases were calculated using nrc 2016 equations predicted dry matter intake was determined according to the weighing events for each cow up to weaning calf and calf weaning to feedlot table s1 supplementary file the dry matter intake dmi of grass was estimated according to the net energy ne required for animal growth and maintenance the quantity of grass fed to the animals was then calculated by the difference between the ne demands for animal growth and maintenance table s2 supplementary file the feedlot facility contained 4 separate pens of 400 m2 and an animal load of one per 30 8 m2 cattle were divided into two subgroups of 26 animals by weight light and heavy each subgroup was further divided into nutritional treatment groups of 13 animals each co product feed light animals cop l and heavy cop h and conventional feed light animals con l and heavy con h total mixed ration was provided ad libitum twice a day at 0900 and 1600 h co product diet consisted of corn silage corn germ citrus pulp peanut meal conventional diet consisted of corn silage maize soybean meal feedlot feed and water intakes were collected over a 90 day period for heavy animals and 121 day period for light animals both groups had an acclimation period of 10 days growing period was 29 days for heavy animals and 55 days for light animals finishing period was 51 days for heavy animals and 56 days for light animals each feedlot pen had an electronic feeder and waterer individual feed intake was monitored by growsafe automated feeding system model 6000 growsafe systems ltd airdrie alberta canada the water monitoring system model wd 1000 master intergado ltd was used to evaluate individual water intake chizzotti et al 2015 each day dry matter and water intake events of each individual were summed for daily dry matter intake and water intake all animal procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at faculdade de medicina veterinaria e zootecnia da universidade de são paulo document number 004 451 2 2 calculation of water footprint dimensions the calculation of green water footprint considered the sum of evapotranspiration plus the water content in the animal feed the dry matter content of it each feed was considered to evaluate the water content in the feed the value for each feed was taken from the brazilian table of composition of animal feed valadares filho et al 2017 all feedstuffs cultivated on farm pasture and corn silage and off farm soya maize corn germ citrus pulp and peanut meal were considered to calculate the green water crop planting and harvesting dates were obtained from the brazilian agriculture and livestock agency 2015 and marked the points at which green water footprint accounting was initiated and finalized land occupation for feed production was estimated from grass roughage and concentrate intake by the herd during all phases across the productive years biomass produced per hectare was taken into consideration green water footprint greenwf was calculated as 1 g r e e n w f p 1 n e t c p r o d u c t l p r o d u c t i o n u n i t k g where etc is the potential crop evapotranspiration of each feed ingredient p and product is water content in p only the mass of dry matter intake was considered in the calculation of green water from rain fed pasture grazed pasture brachiaria decumbens evapotranspiration was calculated using crop coefficients to each season dry 0 74 and wet 0 80 the potential crop evapotranspiration was calculated based on the crop coefficient method kc the crop evapotranspiration requirement was calculated using the crop coefficient kc for the respective growth period and reference crop evaporation eto summed over the period from sowing to harvest allen et al 1998 with regional climate data et0 a grass reference surface was calculated using the fao penman monteith equation the crop coefficient is crop specific and varies over time depending on the growth stages of the crop initial crop development mid season and late season et0 was adjusted for the individual crop with plant specific parameters the calculations were performed using climate data from the nearest and most representative meteorological stations and a specific cropping pattern for each crop according to the type of climate brazilian agriculture and livestock agency 2015 monthly values of major climatic parameters were obtained from agritempo 2017 to calculate etc of concentrate feed the productive conditions considered were soybean produced in sinop mato grosso maize and corn germ produced in francisco beltrao parana citrus pulp produced in pradopolis sao paulo and peanut meal produced in the monte alto sao paulo we assumed that all feeds were produced in a rain fed system to calculate the wf for each crop we used the state average yield for the last ten years standard yields were calculated considering the local where they have been purchased conab 2015 soybean crop produce two products meal and oil meal is the form that cows feed it we use the technical conversion factors for agricultural commodities fao 2013 to calculate the water quantity from evapotranspiration that is used to yield meal considering the brazilian case each grain produces 77 as meal and 23 as oil for the assessment of the wf of co products we allocated the wfs of mass basic crops over the crop residues fao 2013 this strategy is known as the mass fraction method this method calculates the total mass associated with a primary product and generates proportions based on the percentage of total mass each co product represents we considered that corn germ was 5 citrus pulp 28 and peanut meal 56 of the primary product thus the total amount of water required to produce the primary product is multiplied by each factor to arrive at the water footprint for corn germ citrus pulp and peanut meal the blue water footprint considered the animal drinking and processing plant water consumptions blue water footprint bluewf was calculated as 2 b l u e w f a n i m a l d r i n k i n g w a t e r l p r o c e s s i n g p l a n t w a t e r l p r o d u c t i o n u n i t k g the cow daily drinking water consumption was determined according national research council 2016 considering milk yield of 5 l cow 1 day 1 in the first four months and 4 l cow 1 day 1 in the last four months of lactation the equation uses milk yield dry matter intake sodium intake and average minimum temperature calf drinking water consumption was determined by the equation of hicks et al 1988 recommended by the national research council 2016 the equation considers dry matter and sodium intakes average maximum temperature and precipitation average daily water intake for each phase is presented in table s3 supplementary file as previously mentioned in the feedlot the drinking water consumption was monitored daily by the use of an individual drinker the blue water consumption was monitored monthly using water meters from 2012 to 2015 at two processing plants the consumption of blue water was calculated for each year and the average for the period was used to calculate the blue water footprint the grey water is related to water pollution it was calculated only for processing plant because in the farm system there was not runoff from the pasture and feedlot grey water consumption was calculated monthly from 2012 to 2014 via a water metre monitoring effluent volume and sampling the effluent for total phosphorus concentration the median grey water footprint and production of carcass production unit in the period was used to calculate the grey water footprint the calculation was made to a point pollution source according to franke et al 2013 grey water footprint greywf to processing plant was calculated as 3 g r e y w f e f u x c e f u c m a x c n a t l p r o d u c t i o n u n i t k g where eflu is

considered to be zero 2 3 statistical analysis the data from cw cms greenwf bluewf wf and wf s followed a 2 2 factorial design diet con cop and animal weight light and heavy were analysed via generalized linear model sas institute inc 2012 considering four treatments t1 t2 t3 t4 and combination diet and weight the effect of contrast within diet con l vs h and cop l vs h and within weight l cop vs con and h cop vs con was studied we used a tukey test for multiple comparisons of means and contrasts α 0 05 a comparison was also made between cw cms greenwf bluewf wf and wf s from blocks b1 b2 b3 and b4 respectively considering only the mean weight effect l and h finally a t2 multivariate hypothesis test α 0 05 hotelling 1947 was applied for comparison of population mean vectors colenghi and mingoti 2008 of heavy animals h against light animals l 3 results and discussion the type of diet did not significant affect carcass weight and live weight p 0 05 the maximum carcass weight was 261 8 kg cop h and the minimum 253 0 kg con h these values to live weight were 461 6 cop l and 451 0 con h respectively table s4 supplementary file the dry matter intake of feed in the feedlot phase only shows significance between cop l and con h p 0 05 one concern of farmers and animal nutritionists is that co products in cattle diets could reduce performance indicators and promote economic losses the results show that the use of co products did decrease product efficiency thus a substitution of traditional products such as soybean meal and maize is possible in productive and environmental dimensions descheemaeker et al 2010 suggest farmers use feed ingredients with low water footprint in order to reduce the total wf of animal products ibidhi et al 2018a point out that a lower impact on the total wf of cattle could be achieved by the use of crop residues table 1 shows average water footprint values considering each diet and reference unit the wf varied from 32 470 l 29 828 l kg cw 1 and from 18 279 16 803 l kg lw 1 independent of the reference unit the average water footprint was not significantly different for co product conventional diets in light animals the heavy animals on the conventional diet had a higher water footprint than the other three diets due their lower performance indicators a similar difference pattern between diets was observed for green water footprint but was not verified for blue water footprint for both reference units mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 calculated the water footprint for beef produced on feedlots in brazil 8 568 l kg 1 meat this study observed an average from 2 386 to 2 864 l kg 1 meat for co product diet and from 2 029 to 2 320 l kg 1 meat for conventional diet mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 considered consumptions like crop irrigation and water consumed in feed processing consumptions that were not considered in this study besides that mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 did not specify the type of cow breed period in days in the feedlot phase slaughter weight the carcass yield and the amount of meat produced by each carcass for brazil these information will have a high influence on the water footprint values lathuillière et al 2019 calculated the water footprint for nelore breed produced in mato grosso brazil with animals in the cow calf stocker phases in pasture and finished in a feedlot that were fed a diet with 70 feed and 30 silage the green water footprint reached 47 500 l kg lw 1 and blue water footprint reached 142 l kg lw 1 the green and blue wf values of lathuillière et al 2019 are higher than reported in our study because the authors considered a cattle development model in which pasture and feed productivity were very low compared with the productivity index of this study for example lathuillière et al 2019 considered pasture productivity of 3 tons of dm ha 1 low productivity and 5 3 tons of dm ha 1 high productivity we considered 7 7 tons of dm ha 1 145 higher than lathuillière et al 2019 high productivity lathuillière et al 2019 make unclear whether they considered pasture consumption efficiency or attributed the entire pasture area to wf value also the type of concentrate considered by lathuillière et al 2019 in the feedlot 61 maize 10 sorghum 8 soy meal 8 cottonseed 8 soybean was very different that we considered to the both diets we did not use sorghum and cottonseed and the proportion of corn and soybean meal was different different diets for the same type of animal and to the same production system are common even when considering the same country for example the lathuillière et al 2019 study was carried out in the state of mato grosso which is the highest brazilian cotton producer so having cotton co products as ingredient in the cattle diet is a common practice in this region due it low cost lathuillière et al 2019 also considered the practice of irrigation in the production of soya and corn and water consumption in the feed processing according to feed industry professionals water consumption in grain processing is negligible on the average green water accounts for 99 3 of co product and conventional diets to both reference units table 2 shows the average percentage of green and blue water consumption during pasture and feedlot phases green water consumed by livestock systems often comes from other regions or countries in the tropics this reflects the importance of rain fed agriculture as a main source of water provided by the natural water cycle ruminant production systems based on the natural or semi natural vegetation through grazing will have a sustainable advantage over systems that purchase off farm feed and other products blue water accounts for 0 31 of total water footprint blue and grey water consumed in the slaughter house accounts for 0 39 of the total water footprint blue water consumption represents less than 9 1 in the feedlot but it had a minimum of 91 in the pasture phases the green and blue water consumptions at the cow calf stocker phases represent more than 90 of the total water consumption if we do not consider the water consumed by the cows blue and green there were no differences between the average water footprints to all diets and reference units the cow calf phase was responsible for the greatest wf value cow water footprint ranged from 52 to 0 2 and 49 6 52 7 of the total water to carcass weight and live weight respectively these results demonstrated that to achieve significant water efficiency in a cow calf stocker feedlot beef production system cow management is very important therefore a high quality pasture means high dry matter productivity with high nutritional value and high grazing efficiency are options to reduce green water consumption by the cows and consequently the cattle meat water footprint water efficiency is pasture system can be also achieved with increasing soil quality nutrient replenishment in the soil and the right type pasture for the production system water use efficiency of plants is highly dependant on plant species and climatic conditions such that increases in forage production decrease the proportion of green water used by beef production andreini et al 2019 there are already management practices available to farmers to optimize forage production and reduce water inputs through selecting appropriate forages to the climatic and agronomic conditions rogers et al 2017 one of the main propositions to reduce the environmental impact of animal protein is the reduction of production cycle duration in the case of water footprint animals with shorter production cycles will consume less feed and water which will increase water efficiency table 3 shows a statistical comparison between light and heavy animals considering the types of diet and reference units the weight of animals did not significantly affect performance indicators and water footprints for conventional diet p 0 05 but the green and total water footprints were significantly affected for co product diets p 0 05 increasing these values to heavy animals for both reference units considering the two diets heavy animals had green blue and total water footprint values higher than light animals although the productive cycle of the heavy animals was 90 days compared to 120 days for light animals heavy animals on co product diet had a dry matter intake 5 3 higher than light animals for conventional diet heavy animals consume 1 8 more dry matter than light animals higher dry matter intakes mean higher consumption of green water it is important to highlight that the dry matter intake presented in table 3 refers to the sum of the consumption of all phases cow calf stocker feedlot if we consider only the average dry matter consumption in the feedlot heavy animals consume less feed and have a lower wf for the co product diet the average consumptions were 957 kg light animal 1 and 804 kg heavy animal 1 with wfs of 2011 l kg cw 1 and 1671 l kg cw 1 for light and heavy animals respectively the consumptions for conventional diet were 849 kg light animal 1 and 769 kg heavy animal 1 with wf values 1613 l kg cw 1 and 1410 l kg cw 1 for light and heavy animals respectively the feed consumption pasture to cows and calves in the early phases determined higher total dry matter consumption for heavy animals these animals presented higher weight because they and their mothers were larger consequently they have higher feed intake to maintain their development maintenance and lactation requirements results presented in table 4 show that the water footprint values for individual animal were too random around 50 of animals were located in group 2 table 4 next to the wf average on the other hand 50 of animals are in group 1 or 3 below or above wf average there are animals that had a wf value much higher than average for example an animal from treatment con l had a wf of 39 123 l kg cw 1 which is 7664 l higher than the average this reflects the influence of each animal performance and productivity aspects in the green and blue water consumptions the influence of cattle s individual metabolism and behaviour on its development is not well known zanetti et al 2019 variability in individual animal indicators has been attributed to differences caused by breed environment and social interactions shane et al 2016 maré and jordaan 2019 calculate the wf for seven cattle breeds and showed large variations in the total wf per animal for each breed the results of table 4 use of wf average as a reference for calculating water demand in regions watersheds or countries or as a reference for proposing actions and policies can lead to significant errors the use of the wf average would not be recommended in studies that intend to evaluate the impact of beef water footprint on a region s water scarcity index or when the study wants to influence policies and consumer behaviour the overall wf beef water footprint across 14 countries varied from 9249 to 23 521 m3 ton 1 product mourad et al 2019 the authors considered the same animal performance indicators to all countries phenotype can affect water efficiency rotz et al 2019 as such general recommendations cannot be made at a national level improvements must be made on an individual operation maré and jordaan 2019 estimated wf of beef production in a country level but did not consider different production performance indicators as type of breed feed conversion ratio and days on feedlot these authors concluded these results could not be used to formulate policy recommendations there was a wf variation between individuals from the same group therefore average national regional or local wf values calculated based on the same performance indicators can increase the error in designing policies and will not promote expected impacts on reducing water consumption ideally we should work with primary and individual data from the production systems under analysis and measure the range of the amplitude between the minimum and maximum individual water footprints often a small increment in farm efficiency results in increasing absolute consumption of inputs and natural resources increasing external dependence of inputs and increasing waste production per area all of these aspects can negatively impact water footprint as well as other environmental and economic aspects breeding for improved water efficiency could be a manner to increase the production system efficiency without impacting these negative aspects in 2018 5 58 million of animals from feedlot system were slaughtered in brazil abiec 2019 table 5 shows how much water would be consumed to produce these animals considering different diets and variation in footprint values if we considered the average water footprint values the water consumed by animals fed with co product diets would range from 43 3 to 46 7 teraliters and by animals fed conventional diets it would range from 45 1 to 46 0 teraliters using the animals with the highest footprints as references the maximum consumption will be 53 7 teraliters for co product diets and 55 1 teraliters for conventional diets the differences are 7 and 9 1 teraliters to co product and conventional diets respectively for the reference unit carcass weight the water consumed with co product diet ranged from 37 6 to 54 5 teraliters and with conventional diet from 38 6 to 56 1 teraliters considering the average minus minimum wf these result in water savings from 4 6 to 5 8 teraliters and 2 5 to 6 5 teraliters for co product and conventional diets respectively live weight reference unit presented a water consumption variation from 37 7 to 53 7 teraliters and from 39 9 to 55 1 teraliters for co product and conventional diets respectively considering the maximum minus the average water consumptions it represents additional water expenditure from 5 9 to 7 0 teraliters for co product diets and from 4 2 to 10 0 teraliters for conventional diets the results demonstrate how the decision by which water footprint as a reference for calculation can result in scenarios that induce the proposition of actions and policies with considerable variation we also verified how the type of diet is an important mitigating action simulations show that the type of diet could decrease water consumption by 1 8 teraliters annually therefore having greater precision in decision and policy making based on water footprint approaches to livestock and poultry products means making calculations from highly detailed data from supply chains working with primary and regionalized data and considering animal individuality especially for ruminants 3 1 green water footprint kannan et al 2017 estimate the green water for grass production to be 0 5 m3 kg 1 of feed dry matter for native grasses and 1 0 m3 kg 1 for introduced grasses pasture green water footprint ranged from 297 m3 ton 1 to 1010 m3 ton 1 depending on grazing vegetation quality and time grazing in a system where the highest yield had the lowest footprint ibidhi and salem 2018b ibidhi et al 2018a found that natural pasture crop water use cwu in a humid region was 5825 m3 ha 1 and wf was 0 71 m3 ha 1 martínez mamian et al 2016 show a total grasslands water requirement of 7823 m3 ha 1 for a chilean farm with cynodon nlemfuensis our results were 2 1 m3 kg 1 feed dry matter 532 m3 ton 1 fresh biomass and 7235 m3 ha 1 cwu during the wet season in the dry season the values were 1 3 m3 kg 1 feed dry matter 398 m3 ton 1 fresh biomass and 5287 m3 ha 1 cwu the studies did not always identify the pasture type crop coefficients and dry matter production that they use these agronomic and production indicators add to climatic conditions to determine the green water consumed and water footprint values considering the variability of pasture types that exist in tropical regions the comparison between wf in these conditions should only be done when one has access to all the agronomic productive and climatic information used in the studies another important point that must be considered in wf calculations for pasture systems is pasture intake in this study only the dry matter intake of the animals was considered this approach understands that unconsumed grass will provide other ecosystem services mainly to soil quality there are studies that calculated green water by total area occupied for grazing and or grazing efficiency mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 verified a global average green and blue wf in maize and soybean of 1028 m3 ton 1 and 2107 m3 ton 1 respectively fig 1 shows the wf of each concentrate feed in our study maize wf was 647 m3 ton 1 for an average productivity of 7 4 ton ha 1 lathuillière et al 2018b calculated the water efficiency to a soybean rain feed system on a farm in mato grosso brazil to production cycles in 2015 and 2016 the values were 732 m3 ton 1 106 days 809 m3 ton 1 106 days and 1057 m3 ton 1 122 days huang et al 2012 observed that the wf of soybean was 1816 m3 ton 1 the value calculated by us to soybean was 1121 m3 ton 1 140 days for an average productivity of 3 0 ton ha 1 brazil soybeans can be produced with earlier and later productive cycles due to the long summer period which is also the rainy season for the most states with higher productivities lathuillière et al 2018b this situation demonstrates the importance of knowing the crop management the option for an earlier or later productive cycle will determine a lower or higher footprint tropical regions have a water availability advantage due to the rainfall regime that is well distributed and abundant during the production season of grain crops thus the availability of green water is an opportunity that these regions have to produce feed with little to no dependence of blue water the concentrate of the conventional feedlot diet had total green water consumption 9146 m3 8 8 higher than co products diet 9957 m3 for total wf conventional diet 1768 m3 ton 1 was 11 9 higher than co product diet 1978 m3 ton 1 fig 1 shows that the peanut meal had green water consumption higher than the soybean meal and both had the same productivity per hectare 3 ton ha 1 which determined a higher peanut meal water footprint value peanut meal had a higher percentage than soybean meal in adaptation growing and finishing feedlot diets therefore the substitution of soybean meal for the peanut meal did not show a water advantage despite the latter being a co product the substitution of peanut meal for another co product with similar protein content could be a practice to reduce the water footprint of the co product diet several authors have verified that the use of co products to reduce the wf of animal products mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 palhares et al 2017 ibidhi and salem 2018b this will depend on the type of co product its productivity the agronomic and weather conditions of the area and the conversion rate used during the same periods of sowing and harvesting used in the calculations for the states of mato grosso and paraná if soybean and corn were produced on farm the soybean wf would be 922 m3 ton 1 17 7 lower than that calculated for mato grosso and the corn wf 1558 m3 ton 1 141 higher than that calculated for paraná this demonstrates how study choices can influence the water footprint value when you do not have the exact information of feed production region and it is not possible to trace the production supply chain animal diet and feed origin are crucial for calculating wf of animal products hoekstra 2017 but in most of the cases identification of the precise composition and origin of feed is not a common routine in farm documentation 3 2 blue water footprint diet treatment did not significantly affect blue water footprint for both reference units table 1 co product diet had a bwf range of 79 115 l kg cw 1 and a 44 63 l kg lw 1 conventional diet had a bwf range of 84 116 l kg cw 1 and 48 64 l kg lw 1 on average the blue water consumption of cow calf phase represented from 51 to 56 of total blue water the stocker phase from 34 8 to 39 4 and feedlot from 7 to 9 reduction of blue water consumption will have positive impacts to the cost of production and in the environmental aspects the blue water footprint was 119 l kg cw 1 for an extensive feedlot system where animal had a final carcass weight of 268 kg and the majority of feed in the feedlot was maize and soya broom 2019 the light animals that fed on a conventional diet had a final average carcass weight of 257 kg and the blue water footprint varied from 84 to 116 l kg cw 1 the heavy animals had a final average carcass weight of 253 kg and the blue water footprint varied from 91 to 104 l kg cw 1 the reason for the lower footprint values in our study although the final carcass weight is lower is due to lower drinking water consumption of the animals throughout the production cycle rotz et al 2015 reported a blue water footprint from birth to fattened product of 3100 l kg 1 of carcass weight in our study the averages were 210 and 212 l kg 1 of carcass weight to light and heavy animals respectively this difference is related to the types of consumption considered in the blue water calculation this study only calculated the animal drinking water and the consumption during slaughter studies that consider the use of irrigation in crop production the water consumed in the feed processing and the water content in the animal product will have higher blue water footprint calves from birth to weaning consumed 23 l day 1 of blue water and in the stocker phase the blue water consumption varied from 20 4 to 29 7 l day 1 depending on intake grass sodium and climate indicators mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 verified a drinking water intake of 20 l day 1 for a grazing system baxter et al 2017 reported animals grazing in grass consumed 32 l d 1 these authors did not specify the breed dry matter intake and weather conditions the relationship between water intake and indicators of production and performance are cited by ahlberg et al 2018 sexson et al 2012 arias and mader 2011 meyer et al 2004 the average daily water intake for nellore cattle in feedlot under tropical conditions was 16 7 l day 1 zanetti et al 2019 animals fed with conventional diet had an average daily water intake of 19 7 l day 1 and compared to 23 1 l day 1 for animals with co product diet ammer et al 2017 observed that variation in the dry matter content of the diet silage type and concentrate ratio might have influenced the water intake of cattle on a feedlot 3 3 limitations of the study livestock and poultry systems are usually divided into extensive mixed and intensive industrial feedlot in the case of cattle production this division hides an enormous variability of productive and environmental aspects within and between systems therefore the water footprint calculation to cattle meat product is continuous work mainly for tropical regions with greater variability of pastures and types of feed another limitation of this study is that it was made for one type of beef production system in the future studies need to address other types of production and acknowledge inter variability between farms the higher generation of primary data about water consumption in tropical agriculture and livestock the organization of these in databases and the increase in wf studies for the meat product will allow a better understanding of how water efficiency can be improved 4 conclusion beef cattle production generates environmental economic and social positive and negative impacts that need to be accurately measured to support best practices policies and regulations that enhance water use efficiency and conserve water in quantity and quality the results of this study highlight animal individual aspects and nutritional practices that impact the footprint value water footprint was not different for diets with co product and conventional feed except when animal performance indicators were different this study detected the influence of each animal performance and productivity aspects in green and blue water footprints this information can be used to help identify improvements to beef water efficiency and could be considered as good practices for farmers and policy makers to support beef systems in regions exposed to climate change and water scarcity the study also contributed to produce data about the use of water along beef food chain and benchmark water footprint information in two reference units that can support discussion between consumption patterns and environmental consequences one of the reasons for conflicts between farmers agroindustries and consumers is due to miscommunication and or interpretation of research results therefore the generation of information about meat water footprint and practices that can make the product more water efficient will help to reduce these conflicts government and private institutions may use this information to understand and demonstrate the relationship between beef cattle production and water use improving environmental marketability of meat to national and international markets finally our results could support future studies about water use in beef production because carefully quantified consumption data this could allow animal scientists to propose breeding studies that consider animal performance and water efficiency therefore the results have immediate value for decision making about present

343,beef cattle production systems hide an enormous variability of productive and management aspects that impact the water footprint value to have a greater precision in decision making based on water footprint we should consider animal individuality and propose managements solutions the aims of this study were to calculate the water footprint for a tropical cattle production system and to evaluated the influence of each individual animal performance and type of diet this study calculated the volumetric water footprint wf in its three dimensions green blue and grey the reference units were l kg lw 1 liters per kg of live weight and l kg cw 1 liters per kg of carcass weight this study used a population of 52 nelore bulls bos taurus indicus in the feedlot phase cattle were divided into two subgroups by weight each subgroup was further divided into nutritional treatment groups co product feed light animals cop l and heavy cop h and conventional feed light animals con l and heavy con h co product diet consisted of corn silage corn germ citrus pulp peanut meal conventional diet consisted of corn silage maize soybean meal the type of diet did not significant affect carcass weight and live weight p 0 05 the individual animal wf varied from 32 569 l 29 923 l kg cw 1 and from 18 279 16 803 l kg lw 1 the weight of animals did not significantly affect performance indicators and water footprints for conventional diet p 0 05 but the green and total water footprints were significantly affected for co product diets p 0 05 this information could be used to support improvements in policies and good practices for farmers and policy makers to enhance the beef water efficiency the study also contributed to produce data that are still scarce in science about the use of water along beef chain and benchmark water footprint the generation of information about meat water footprint and practices that can make the product more water efficient will have immediate value for decision making about present and future beef meat sustainability keywords blue co product diet feedlot green pasture 1 introduction cattle production is important to economic and social brazilian society development and for world food commerce brazil has the second largest cattle herd in the world being the largest exporter and the second largest producer of beef the brazilian cattle population is estimated to be 214 9 million animals and is responsible for 6 of the gross domestic product ibge 2019 of the brazilian cattle herd about 80 is composed of bos indicus and of this percentage about 90 are the nelore breed associação brasileira de inseminação artificial asbia 2019 the brazilian beef production system is considered to be grass fed animals but the reality is that many animals finish in feedlots pereira 2004 ferraz and felicio 2010 from 2000 to 2018 the number of feedlot cattle in brazil grew by about 64 6 this represents an average annual increase of around 7 0 in 2018 5 58 million cattle from feedlots were slaughtered in brazil abiec 2019 it represented 12 6 of all meat slaughter in the country structural changes in brazilian beef cattle have included advances in animal performance indicators increase of productivity per area and expansion of the feedlot system but the quantitative and qualitative impact of these aspects on water use has not been assessed brazil has abundant water availability in quantity and quality which helps the competitive framework for brazilian animal products agência nacional de águas ana 2019 accounted that brazilian agriculture was responsible for 79 of total water consumption irrigation being responsible for 68 4 and animal drinking for 10 8 of the total animal consumption cattle represent 88 followed by pigs 5 and poultry 2 flachsbarth et al 2015 brazil is an important international player supporting food security for the world due its availability of water resources water use quantification in beef meat production is important because it is a commodity often criticized for inefficient input conversion baxter et al 2017 water footprint analysis can be used to understand the water demand for beef production systems from an individual farm perspective and freshwater demands due to intensification murphy et al 2017 there are substantial knowledge gaps about water footprint of beef production because it is new field of research and there are few management practices that could enhance the efficiency of conversion of water to marketable beef quantifying water use in ruminant production is a crucial step for identifying strategies for water use in other meat legesse et al 2017 west and baxter 2018 spore et al 2020 it is paramount to understand where and how water is used by the beef industry because it will enable obtaining knowledge to improve resource use maré et al 2020 argue that a bottom up approach to evaluate beef water footprint promote accurate estimations and can be used to recommend best practices west and baxter 2018 suggest that animal management must be optimized to enhance water efficiency in beef cattle sector we are researching how to improve livestock water efficiency and what management decisions or technological solutions farmers can utilize to promote this efficiency optimizing animal nutrition is one practice of improving sustainability of ruminant production systems white et al 2015 animal nutrition research has focused on improving energy and protein use efficiency however the potential environmental benefit of these research avenues has not been well investigated white 2016 changes in ruminant diet are necessary to improve environmental value of their products livestock play a critical role in adding value to agrifood residual products mottet et al 2017 cattle can upcycle human inedible feeds and convert them into a high quality beef co products as cattle feed decrease agroindustry waste by providing an alternative use andreini 2019 and may replace up to 100 of cereal grains in ruminant nutrition knaus 2012 crop residues and by products are opportunities to reduce the water footprint of animal production mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 the aims of this study were to calculate the water footprint for a tropical cow calf stocker feedlot production system and to evaluate the influence of each individual animal performance and type of diet we also analyse the impact of these production aspects in the water consumed by feedlot cattle slaughtered in the year 2018 in brazil there are not studies addressing the water demands of brazilian pasture feedlot based beef using farm specific data and the water consumed in the processing plant the results presented are a realistic evaluation of the water footprint for brazilian beef because fewer assumptions were required due to the nature of data collected this was especially the case for feed and water consumption at the feedlot because they were measured individually this study evaluate the water footprint with a new approach individual animal and nutritional management to assess water use in beef meat enabling farmers companies and consumers improve and evaluate the water management and commodity efficiency we discuss the results from the perspectives of the production system farmers trade and consumption perspective 2 material and methods this study calculated the volumetric water footprint wf with a product focused assessment water footprint network approach 2012 lathuillière et al 2018a the water consumed was considered to be the sum of feed crop evapotranspiration plus water in the feed green water consumption of ground and surface waters blue water from production system and processing plant and consumption of water by nature to depurate the effluent from processing plant grey water the boundaries of the system were cradle to processing plant which involved meat production at farm level and manufacturing process at slaughter the wf calculation in the farm system considered the three main phases of beef production cow calf stocker and feedlot this study applies a bottom up approach where farm and processing plant specific data were used to calculate a detailed wf this study works with two reference units in order to increase comparability with other studies the reference units were l kg lw 1 liters per kg of live weight and l kg cw 1 liters per kg of carcass weight 2 1 study design this study used a population of 52 nelore bulls bos taurus indicus born in 2014 and slaughtered in 2016 animals grazed in extensive unmodified pasture without artificial fertilizer or irrigation from december 2014 to july 2016 before transfer to a feedlot this production system is representative of typical beef cattle in brazil feed requirements to meet maintenance growth gestation and or lactation needs during the cow calf and stocker phases were calculated using nrc 2016 equations predicted dry matter intake was determined according to the weighing events for each cow up to weaning calf and calf weaning to feedlot table s1 supplementary file the dry matter intake dmi of grass was estimated according to the net energy ne required for animal growth and maintenance the quantity of grass fed to the animals was then calculated by the difference between the ne demands for animal growth and maintenance table s2 supplementary file the feedlot facility contained 4 separate pens of 400 m2 and an animal load of one per 30 8 m2 cattle were divided into two subgroups of 26 animals by weight light and heavy each subgroup was further divided into nutritional treatment groups of 13 animals each co product feed light animals cop l and heavy cop h and conventional feed light animals con l and heavy con h total mixed ration was provided ad libitum twice a day at 0900 and 1600 h co product diet consisted of corn silage corn germ citrus pulp peanut meal conventional diet consisted of corn silage maize soybean meal feedlot feed and water intakes were collected over a 90 day period for heavy animals and 121 day period for light animals both groups had an acclimation period of 10 days growing period was 29 days for heavy animals and 55 days for light animals finishing period was 51 days for heavy animals and 56 days for light animals each feedlot pen had an electronic feeder and waterer individual feed intake was monitored by growsafe automated feeding system model 6000 growsafe systems ltd airdrie alberta canada the water monitoring system model wd 1000 master intergado ltd was used to evaluate individual water intake chizzotti et al 2015 each day dry matter and water intake events of each individual were summed for daily dry matter intake and water intake all animal procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at faculdade de medicina veterinaria e zootecnia da universidade de são paulo document number 004 451 2 2 calculation of water footprint dimensions the calculation of green water footprint considered the sum of evapotranspiration plus the water content in the animal feed the dry matter content of it each feed was considered to evaluate the water content in the feed the value for each feed was taken from the brazilian table of composition of animal feed valadares filho et al 2017 all feedstuffs cultivated on farm pasture and corn silage and off farm soya maize corn germ citrus pulp and peanut meal were considered to calculate the green water crop planting and harvesting dates were obtained from the brazilian agriculture and livestock agency 2015 and marked the points at which green water footprint accounting was initiated and finalized land occupation for feed production was estimated from grass roughage and concentrate intake by the herd during all phases across the productive years biomass produced per hectare was taken into consideration green water footprint greenwf was calculated as 1 g r e e n w f p 1 n e t c p r o d u c t l p r o d u c t i o n u n i t k g where etc is the potential crop evapotranspiration of each feed ingredient p and product is water content in p only the mass of dry matter intake was considered in the calculation of green water from rain fed pasture grazed pasture brachiaria decumbens evapotranspiration was calculated using crop coefficients to each season dry 0 74 and wet 0 80 the potential crop evapotranspiration was calculated based on the crop coefficient method kc the crop evapotranspiration requirement was calculated using the crop coefficient kc for the respective growth period and reference crop evaporation eto summed over the period from sowing to harvest allen et al 1998 with regional climate data et0 a grass reference surface was calculated using the fao penman monteith equation the crop coefficient is crop specific and varies over time depending on the growth stages of the crop initial crop development mid season and late season et0 was adjusted for the individual crop with plant specific parameters the calculations were performed using climate data from the nearest and most representative meteorological stations and a specific cropping pattern for each crop according to the type of climate brazilian agriculture and livestock agency 2015 monthly values of major climatic parameters were obtained from agritempo 2017 to calculate etc of concentrate feed the productive conditions considered were soybean produced in sinop mato grosso maize and corn germ produced in francisco beltrao parana citrus pulp produced in pradopolis sao paulo and peanut meal produced in the monte alto sao paulo we assumed that all feeds were produced in a rain fed system to calculate the wf for each crop we used the state average yield for the last ten years standard yields were calculated considering the local where they have been purchased conab 2015 soybean crop produce two products meal and oil meal is the form that cows feed it we use the technical conversion factors for agricultural commodities fao 2013 to calculate the water quantity from evapotranspiration that is used to yield meal considering the brazilian case each grain produces 77 as meal and 23 as oil for the assessment of the wf of co products we allocated the wfs of mass basic crops over the crop residues fao 2013 this strategy is known as the mass fraction method this method calculates the total mass associated with a primary product and generates proportions based on the percentage of total mass each co product represents we considered that corn germ was 5 citrus pulp 28 and peanut meal 56 of the primary product thus the total amount of water required to produce the primary product is multiplied by each factor to arrive at the water footprint for corn germ citrus pulp and peanut meal the blue water footprint considered the animal drinking and processing plant water consumptions blue water footprint bluewf was calculated as 2 b l u e w f a n i m a l d r i n k i n g w a t e r l p r o c e s s i n g p l a n t w a t e r l p r o d u c t i o n u n i t k g the cow daily drinking water consumption was determined according national research council 2016 considering milk yield of 5 l cow 1 day 1 in the first four months and 4 l cow 1 day 1 in the last four months of lactation the equation uses milk yield dry matter intake sodium intake and average minimum temperature calf drinking water consumption was determined by the equation of hicks et al 1988 recommended by the national research council 2016 the equation considers dry matter and sodium intakes average maximum temperature and precipitation average daily water intake for each phase is presented in table s3 supplementary file as previously mentioned in the feedlot the drinking water consumption was monitored daily by the use of an individual drinker the blue water consumption was monitored monthly using water meters from 2012 to 2015 at two processing plants the consumption of blue water was calculated for each year and the average for the period was used to calculate the blue water footprint the grey water is related to water pollution it was calculated only for processing plant because in the farm system there was not runoff from the pasture and feedlot grey water consumption was calculated monthly from 2012 to 2014 via a water metre monitoring effluent volume and sampling the effluent for total phosphorus concentration the median grey water footprint and production of carcass production unit in the period was used to calculate the grey water footprint the calculation was made to a point pollution source according to franke et al 2013 grey water footprint greywf to processing plant was calculated as 3 g r e y w f e f u x c e f u c m a x c n a t l p r o d u c t i o n u n i t k g where eflu is the average volume l of effluent ceflu is the average total phosphorus concentration in the effluent cmax is maximum acceptable concentration 0 1 mg l 1 ptotal conama resolution 357 2005 and cnat was considered to be zero 2 3 statistical analysis the data from cw cms greenwf bluewf wf and wf s followed a 2 2 factorial design diet con cop and animal weight light and heavy were analysed via generalized linear model sas institute inc 2012 considering four treatments t1 t2 t3 t4 and combination diet and weight the effect of contrast within diet con l vs h and cop l vs h and within weight l cop vs con and h cop vs con was studied we used a tukey test for multiple comparisons of means and contrasts α 0 05 a comparison was also made between cw cms greenwf bluewf wf and wf s from blocks b1 b2 b3 and b4 respectively considering only the mean weight effect l and h finally a t2 multivariate hypothesis test α 0 05 hotelling 1947 was applied for comparison of population mean vectors colenghi and mingoti 2008 of heavy animals h against light animals l 3 results and discussion the type of diet did not significant affect carcass weight and live weight p 0 05 the maximum carcass weight was 261 8 kg cop h and the minimum 253 0 kg con h these values to live weight were 461 6 cop l and 451 0 con h respectively table s4 supplementary file the dry matter intake of feed in the feedlot phase only shows significance between cop l and con h p 0 05 one concern of farmers and animal nutritionists is that co products in cattle diets could reduce performance indicators and promote economic losses the results show that the use of co products did decrease product efficiency thus a substitution of traditional products such as soybean meal and maize is possible in productive and environmental dimensions descheemaeker et al 2010 suggest farmers use feed ingredients with low water footprint in order to reduce the total wf of animal products ibidhi et al 2018a point out that a lower impact on the total wf of cattle could be achieved by the use of crop residues table 1 shows average water footprint values considering each diet and reference unit the wf varied from 32 470 l 29 828 l kg cw 1 and from 18 279 16 803 l kg lw 1 independent of the reference unit the average water footprint was not significantly different for co product conventional diets in light animals the heavy animals on the conventional diet had a higher water footprint than the other three diets due their lower performance indicators a similar difference pattern between diets was observed for green water footprint but was not verified for blue water footprint for both reference units mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 calculated the water footprint for beef produced on feedlots in brazil 8 568 l kg 1 meat this study observed an average from 2 386 to 2 864 l kg 1 meat for co product diet and from 2 029 to 2 320 l kg 1 meat for conventional diet mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 considered consumptions like crop irrigation and water consumed in feed processing consumptions that were not considered in this study besides that mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 did not specify the type of cow breed period in days in the feedlot phase slaughter weight the carcass yield and the amount of meat produced by each carcass for brazil these information will have a high influence on the water footprint values lathuillière et al 2019 calculated the water footprint for nelore breed produced in mato grosso brazil with animals in the cow calf stocker phases in pasture and finished in a feedlot that were fed a diet with 70 feed and 30 silage the green water footprint reached 47 500 l kg lw 1 and blue water footprint reached 142 l kg lw 1 the green and blue wf values of lathuillière et al 2019 are higher than reported in our study because the authors considered a cattle development model in which pasture and feed productivity were very low compared with the productivity index of this study for example lathuillière et al 2019 considered pasture productivity of 3 tons of dm ha 1 low productivity and 5 3 tons of dm ha 1 high productivity we considered 7 7 tons of dm ha 1 145 higher than lathuillière et al 2019 high productivity lathuillière et al 2019 make unclear whether they considered pasture consumption efficiency or attributed the entire pasture area to wf value also the type of concentrate considered by lathuillière et al 2019 in the feedlot 61 maize 10 sorghum 8 soy meal 8 cottonseed 8 soybean was very different that we considered to the both diets we did not use sorghum and cottonseed and the proportion of corn and soybean meal was different different diets for the same type of animal and to the same production system are common even when considering the same country for example the lathuillière et al 2019 study was carried out in the state of mato grosso which is the highest brazilian cotton producer so having cotton co products as ingredient in the cattle diet is a common practice in this region due it low cost lathuillière et al 2019 also considered the practice of irrigation in the production of soya and corn and water consumption in the feed processing according to feed industry professionals water consumption in grain processing is negligible on the average green water accounts for 99 3 of co product and conventional diets to both reference units table 2 shows the average percentage of green and blue water consumption during pasture and feedlot phases green water consumed by livestock systems often comes from other regions or countries in the tropics this reflects the importance of rain fed agriculture as a main source of water provided by the natural water cycle ruminant production systems based on the natural or semi natural vegetation through grazing will have a sustainable advantage over systems that purchase off farm feed and other products blue water accounts for 0 31 of total water footprint blue and grey water consumed in the slaughter house accounts for 0 39 of the total water footprint blue water consumption represents less than 9 1 in the feedlot but it had a minimum of 91 in the pasture phases the green and blue water consumptions at the cow calf stocker phases represent more than 90 of the total water consumption if we do not consider the water consumed by the cows blue and green there were no differences between the average water footprints to all diets and reference units the cow calf phase was responsible for the greatest wf value cow water footprint ranged from 52 to 0 2 and 49 6 52 7 of the total water to carcass weight and live weight respectively these results demonstrated that to achieve significant water efficiency in a cow calf stocker feedlot beef production system cow management is very important therefore a high quality pasture means high dry matter productivity with high nutritional value and high grazing efficiency are options to reduce green water consumption by the cows and consequently the cattle meat water footprint water efficiency is pasture system can be also achieved with increasing soil quality nutrient replenishment in the soil and the right type pasture for the production system water use efficiency of plants is highly dependant on plant species and climatic conditions such that increases in forage production decrease the proportion of green water used by beef production andreini et al 2019 there are already management practices available to farmers to optimize forage production and reduce water inputs through selecting appropriate forages to the climatic and agronomic conditions rogers et al 2017 one of the main propositions to reduce the environmental impact of animal protein is the reduction of production cycle duration in the case of water footprint animals with shorter production cycles will consume less feed and water which will increase water efficiency table 3 shows a statistical comparison between light and heavy animals considering the types of diet and reference units the weight of animals did not significantly affect performance indicators and water footprints for conventional diet p 0 05 but the green and total water footprints were significantly affected for co product diets p 0 05 increasing these values to heavy animals for both reference units considering the two diets heavy animals had green blue and total water footprint values higher than light animals although the productive cycle of the heavy animals was 90 days compared to 120 days for light animals heavy animals on co product diet had a dry matter intake 5 3 higher than light animals for conventional diet heavy animals consume 1 8 more dry matter than light animals higher dry matter intakes mean higher consumption of green water it is important to highlight that the dry matter intake presented in table 3 refers to the sum of the consumption of all phases cow calf stocker feedlot if we consider only the average dry matter consumption in the feedlot heavy animals consume less feed and have a lower wf for the co product diet the average consumptions were 957 kg light animal 1 and 804 kg heavy animal 1 with wfs of 2011 l kg cw 1 and 1671 l kg cw 1 for light and heavy animals respectively the consumptions for conventional diet were 849 kg light animal 1 and 769 kg heavy animal 1 with wf values 1613 l kg cw 1 and 1410 l kg cw 1 for light and heavy animals respectively the feed consumption pasture to cows and calves in the early phases determined higher total dry matter consumption for heavy animals these animals presented higher weight because they and their mothers were larger consequently they have higher feed intake to maintain their development maintenance and lactation requirements results presented in table 4 show that the water footprint values for individual animal were too random around 50 of animals were located in group 2 table 4 next to the wf average on the other hand 50 of animals are in group 1 or 3 below or above wf average there are animals that had a wf value much higher than average for example an animal from treatment con l had a wf of 39 123 l kg cw 1 which is 7664 l higher than the average this reflects the influence of each animal performance and productivity aspects in the green and blue water consumptions the influence of cattle s individual metabolism and behaviour on its development is not well known zanetti et al 2019 variability in individual animal indicators has been attributed to differences caused by breed environment and social interactions shane et al 2016 maré and jordaan 2019 calculate the wf for seven cattle breeds and showed large variations in the total wf per animal for each breed the results of table 4 use of wf average as a reference for calculating water demand in regions watersheds or countries or as a reference for proposing actions and policies can lead to significant errors the use of the wf average would not be recommended in studies that intend to evaluate the impact of beef water footprint on a region s water scarcity index or when the study wants to influence policies and consumer behaviour the overall wf beef water footprint across 14 countries varied from 9249 to 23 521 m3 ton 1 product mourad et al 2019 the authors considered the same animal performance indicators to all countries phenotype can affect water efficiency rotz et al 2019 as such general recommendations cannot be made at a national level improvements must be made on an individual operation maré and jordaan 2019 estimated wf of beef production in a country level but did not consider different production performance indicators as type of breed feed conversion ratio and days on feedlot these authors concluded these results could not be used to formulate policy recommendations there was a wf variation between individuals from the same group therefore average national regional or local wf values calculated based on the same performance indicators can increase the error in designing policies and will not promote expected impacts on reducing water consumption ideally we should work with primary and individual data from the production systems under analysis and measure the range of the amplitude between the minimum and maximum individual water footprints often a small increment in farm efficiency results in increasing absolute consumption of inputs and natural resources increasing external dependence of inputs and increasing waste production per area all of these aspects can negatively impact water footprint as well as other environmental and economic aspects breeding for improved water efficiency could be a manner to increase the production system efficiency without impacting these negative aspects in 2018 5 58 million of animals from feedlot system were slaughtered in brazil abiec 2019 table 5 shows how much water would be consumed to produce these animals considering different diets and variation in footprint values if we considered the average water footprint values the water consumed by animals fed with co product diets would range from 43 3 to 46 7 teraliters and by animals fed conventional diets it would range from 45 1 to 46 0 teraliters using the animals with the highest footprints as references the maximum consumption will be 53 7 teraliters for co product diets and 55 1 teraliters for conventional diets the differences are 7 and 9 1 teraliters to co product and conventional diets respectively for the reference unit carcass weight the water consumed with co product diet ranged from 37 6 to 54 5 teraliters and with conventional diet from 38 6 to 56 1 teraliters considering the average minus minimum wf these result in water savings from 4 6 to 5 8 teraliters and 2 5 to 6 5 teraliters for co product and conventional diets respectively live weight reference unit presented a water consumption variation from 37 7 to 53 7 teraliters and from 39 9 to 55 1 teraliters for co product and conventional diets respectively considering the maximum minus the average water consumptions it represents additional water expenditure from 5 9 to 7 0 teraliters for co product diets and from 4 2 to 10 0 teraliters for conventional diets the results demonstrate how the decision by which water footprint as a reference for calculation can result in scenarios that induce the proposition of actions and policies with considerable variation we also verified how the type of diet is an important mitigating action simulations show that the type of diet could decrease water consumption by 1 8 teraliters annually therefore having greater precision in decision and policy making based on water footprint approaches to livestock and poultry products means making calculations from highly detailed data from supply chains working with primary and regionalized data and considering animal individuality especially for ruminants 3 1 green water footprint kannan et al 2017 estimate the green water for grass production to be 0 5 m3 kg 1 of feed dry matter for native grasses and 1 0 m3 kg 1 for introduced grasses pasture green water footprint ranged from 297 m3 ton 1 to 1010 m3 ton 1 depending on grazing vegetation quality and time grazing in a system where the highest yield had the lowest footprint ibidhi and salem 2018b ibidhi et al 2018a found that natural pasture crop water use cwu in a humid region was 5825 m3 ha 1 and wf was 0 71 m3 ha 1 martínez mamian et al 2016 show a total grasslands water requirement of 7823 m3 ha 1 for a chilean farm with cynodon nlemfuensis our results were 2 1 m3 kg 1 feed dry matter 532 m3 ton 1 fresh biomass and 7235 m3 ha 1 cwu during the wet season in the dry season the values were 1 3 m3 kg 1 feed dry matter 398 m3 ton 1 fresh biomass and 5287 m3 ha 1 cwu the studies did not always identify the pasture type crop coefficients and dry matter production that they use these agronomic and production indicators add to climatic conditions to determine the green water consumed and water footprint values considering the variability of pasture types that exist in tropical regions the comparison between wf in these conditions should only be done when one has access to all the agronomic productive and climatic information used in the studies another important point that must be considered in wf calculations for pasture systems is pasture intake in this study only the dry matter intake of the animals was considered this approach understands that unconsumed grass will provide other ecosystem services mainly to soil quality there are studies that calculated green water by total area occupied for grazing and or grazing efficiency mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 verified a global average green and blue wf in maize and soybean of 1028 m3 ton 1 and 2107 m3 ton 1 respectively fig 1 shows the wf of each concentrate feed in our study maize wf was 647 m3 ton 1 for an average productivity of 7 4 ton ha 1 lathuillière et al 2018b calculated the water efficiency to a soybean rain feed system on a farm in mato grosso brazil to production cycles in 2015 and 2016 the values were 732 m3 ton 1 106 days 809 m3 ton 1 106 days and 1057 m3 ton 1 122 days huang et al 2012 observed that the wf of soybean was 1816 m3 ton 1 the value calculated by us to soybean was 1121 m3 ton 1 140 days for an average productivity of 3 0 ton ha 1 brazil soybeans can be produced with earlier and later productive cycles due to the long summer period which is also the rainy season for the most states with higher productivities lathuillière et al 2018b this situation demonstrates the importance of knowing the crop management the option for an earlier or later productive cycle will determine a lower or higher footprint tropical regions have a water availability advantage due to the rainfall regime that is well distributed and abundant during the production season of grain crops thus the availability of green water is an opportunity that these regions have to produce feed with little to no dependence of blue water the concentrate of the conventional feedlot diet had total green water consumption 9146 m3 8 8 higher than co products diet 9957 m3 for total wf conventional diet 1768 m3 ton 1 was 11 9 higher than co product diet 1978 m3 ton 1 fig 1 shows that the peanut meal had green water consumption higher than the soybean meal and both had the same productivity per hectare 3 ton ha 1 which determined a higher peanut meal water footprint value peanut meal had a higher percentage than soybean meal in adaptation growing and finishing feedlot diets therefore the substitution of soybean meal for the peanut meal did not show a water advantage despite the latter being a co product the substitution of peanut meal for another co product with similar protein content could be a practice to reduce the water footprint of the co product diet several authors have verified that the use of co products to reduce the wf of animal products mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 palhares et al 2017 ibidhi and salem 2018b this will depend on the type of co product its productivity the agronomic and weather conditions of the area and the conversion rate used during the same periods of sowing and harvesting used in the calculations for the states of mato grosso and paraná if soybean and corn were produced on farm the soybean wf would be 922 m3 ton 1 17 7 lower than that calculated for mato grosso and the corn wf 1558 m3 ton 1 141 higher than that calculated for paraná this demonstrates how study choices can influence the water footprint value when you do not have the exact information of feed production region and it is not possible to trace the production supply chain animal diet and feed origin are crucial for calculating wf of animal products hoekstra 2017 but in most of the cases identification of the precise composition and origin of feed is not a common routine in farm documentation 3 2 blue water footprint diet treatment did not significantly affect blue water footprint for both reference units table 1 co product diet had a bwf range of 79 115 l kg cw 1 and a 44 63 l kg lw 1 conventional diet had a bwf range of 84 116 l kg cw 1 and 48 64 l kg lw 1 on average the blue water consumption of cow calf phase represented from 51 to 56 of total blue water the stocker phase from 34 8 to 39 4 and feedlot from 7 to 9 reduction of blue water consumption will have positive impacts to the cost of production and in the environmental aspects the blue water footprint was 119 l kg cw 1 for an extensive feedlot system where animal had a final carcass weight of 268 kg and the majority of feed in the feedlot was maize and soya broom 2019 the light animals that fed on a conventional diet had a final average carcass weight of 257 kg and the blue water footprint varied from 84 to 116 l kg cw 1 the heavy animals had a final average carcass weight of 253 kg and the blue water footprint varied from 91 to 104 l kg cw 1 the reason for the lower footprint values in our study although the final carcass weight is lower is due to lower drinking water consumption of the animals throughout the production cycle rotz et al 2015 reported a blue water footprint from birth to fattened product of 3100 l kg 1 of carcass weight in our study the averages were 210 and 212 l kg 1 of carcass weight to light and heavy animals respectively this difference is related to the types of consumption considered in the blue water calculation this study only calculated the animal drinking water and the consumption during slaughter studies that consider the use of irrigation in crop production the water consumed in the feed processing and the water content in the animal product will have higher blue water footprint calves from birth to weaning consumed 23 l day 1 of blue water and in the stocker phase the blue water consumption varied from 20 4 to 29 7 l day 1 depending on intake grass sodium and climate indicators mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 verified a drinking water intake of 20 l day 1 for a grazing system baxter et al 2017 reported animals grazing in grass consumed 32 l d 1 these authors did not specify the breed dry matter intake and weather conditions the relationship between water intake and indicators of production and performance are cited by ahlberg et al 2018 sexson et al 2012 arias and mader 2011 meyer et al 2004 the average daily water intake for nellore cattle in feedlot under tropical conditions was 16 7 l day 1 zanetti et al 2019 animals fed with conventional diet had an average daily water intake of 19 7 l day 1 and compared to 23 1 l day 1 for animals with co product diet ammer et al 2017 observed that variation in the dry matter content of the diet silage type and concentrate ratio might have influenced the water intake of cattle on a feedlot 3 3 limitations of the study livestock and poultry systems are usually divided into extensive mixed and intensive industrial feedlot in the case of cattle production this division hides an enormous variability of productive and environmental aspects within and between systems therefore the water footprint calculation to cattle meat product is continuous work mainly for tropical regions with greater variability of pastures and types of feed another limitation of this study is that it was made for one type of beef production system in the future studies need to address other types of production and acknowledge inter variability between farms the higher generation of primary data about water consumption in tropical agriculture and livestock the organization of these in databases and the increase in wf studies for the meat product will allow a better understanding of how water efficiency can be improved 4 conclusion beef cattle production generates environmental economic and social positive and negative impacts that need to be accurately measured to support best practices policies and regulations that enhance water use efficiency and conserve water in quantity and quality the results of this study highlight animal individual aspects and nutritional practices that impact the footprint value water footprint was not different for diets with co product and conventional feed except when animal performance indicators were different this study detected the influence of each animal performance and productivity aspects in green and blue water footprints this information can be used to help identify improvements to beef water efficiency and could be considered as good practices for farmers and policy makers to support beef systems in regions exposed to climate change and water scarcity the study also contributed to produce data about the use of water along beef food chain and benchmark water footprint information in two reference units that can support discussion between consumption patterns and environmental consequences one of the reasons for conflicts between farmers agroindustries and consumers is due to miscommunication and or interpretation of research results therefore the generation of information about meat water footprint and practices that can make the product more water efficient will help to reduce these conflicts government and private institutions may use this information to understand and demonstrate the relationship between beef cattle production and water use improving environmental marketability of meat to national and international markets finally our results could support future studies about water use in beef production because carefully quantified consumption data this could allow animal scientists to propose breeding studies that consider animal performance and water efficiency therefore the results have immediate value for decision making about present and future beef meat sustainability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

344,an original nonlinear multi dimensional model for the inertial fluid flow through a fluid porous interface is derived by asymptotic theory for arbitrary flow directions the interfacial region between the pure fluid and the homogeneous porous region is viewed as a thin transition porous layer characterized by smoothly evolving heterogeneities the asymptotic analysis applied to the homogenized navier stokes equations in this thin heterogeneous porous layer leads to nonlinear momentum jump conditions at the equivalent dividing interface these jump conditions involve slip and friction coefficients whose dependence on porosity are analyzed moreover we show that the resulting navier stokes darcy forchheimer macroscale coupled model is globally dissipative in the porosity range 0 ϕ p 0 95 which also contributes to its physical relevance to our knowledge this innovative asymptotic model is the first nonlinear multi dimensional model proposed in the literature for the inertial flow with arbitrary flow directions at a permeable interface besides it clearly opens new perspectives to study turbulent flows at the fluid porous interface keywords fluid porous inertial flow asymptotic analysis nonlinear jump interface conditions slip and friction coefficients navier stokes ddarcy forchheimer model globally dissipative model 1 main objectives and highlights the momentum transport at the interface between a fluid and a permeable region is present in a large variety of industrial applications dendritic solidification of multi component mixtures fuel cell oil recovery separation processes etc but also in environmental situations or for water resources surface or subsurface hydrology interaction atmosphere canopy benthic boundary layers etc or biological systems bone growth biofilms cell proliferation etc we refer to the recent paper bottaro 2019 and the references therein for many examples of application due to the different characteristic length scales involved in these heterogeneous configurations the momentum transport analysis is often performed at the macroscopic scale where the concept of interface is actually related to the nature of the average representation from the pioneering work of beavers and joseph beavers and joseph 1967 two macroscopic modeling approaches have been used the single domain approach considers the interfacial region as a thin transition porous layer see fig 1 where the averaged properties porosity permeability are continuously spatially dependent evolving heterogeneities on the other hand the two domain approach considers a fictive interface see fig 2 where explicit jump boundary conditions must be expressed it is worth mentioning that these jump conditions result from an integration of the momentum transport on the thin transition layer of the single domain approach goyeau et al 2003 valdés parada et al 2013 different studies have been devoted to the derivation of these jump conditions for non inertial one dimensional channel flows parallel to the porous layer beavers and joseph 1967 brillard et al 2013 goyeau et al 2003 jäger and mikelić 2000 2009 ochoa tapia and whitaker 1995a b saffman 1971 valdés parada et al 2013 using an asymptotic modeling as for thin fractures in porous media angot et al 2009 the present authors have recently derived in angot et al 2017 jump conditions for a general two or three dimensional non inertial viscous flow and arbitrary flow directions at a permeable interface however many applications concern flow regimes where inertial effects have to be considered nield and bejan 2017 a few papers address the inertial flows at a fluid porous interface by numerical simulations at the macroscopic scale sahraoui and kaviany 1992 hill and straughan 2009 or at the pore scale breugem and boersma 2005 zhang and prosperetti 2009 liu and prosperetti 2011 rosti et al 2015 zampogna and bottaro 2016 basser et al 2017 lācis and bagheri 2017 but mainly restricted to the 1 d channel case to the best of our knowledge there exists no general interface model for the multi dimensional inertial flow and arbitrary flow directions nield and bejan 2017 hence the macroscopic description of the inertial flow through a permeable interface is still a challenging open problem in fluid dynamics this is the objective of the present theoretical study where the asymptotic analysis angot et al 2017 applied here to the homogenized navier stokes equations in the thin transition porous layer yields an original nonlinear multi dimensional model for the inertial flow over a permeable medium moreover we show that the total work of the inertial forces in the fluid and porous domains has always a positive contribution at the interface to the dissipation of kinetic energy inside the whole system the paper is organized as follows section 2 details the model equations governing the flow in the fluid and permeable regions in section 3 we derive the asymptotic model for the inertial flow only the contribution of all the additional nonlinear and inertial terms is detailed including the cases of both weak or strong inertia the resulting nonlinear interface conditions are discussed in section 4 finally the mechanical energy balance is derived in section 5 which suggests some concluding remarks the present analysis is carried out in detail for the porosity range 0 ϕ p 0 95 but remark 5 gives some hints on how to generalize it for larger porosities ϕ p 0 95 2 fluid porous inertial flow models let us consider a two dimensional 1 1 for the sake of clarity the present asymptotic model is derived hereafter for the 2 d flow although the extension to 3 d is quite straigthforward since all the tangential derivative and possibly curvature terms are neglected up to first order in o d l bounded domain ω r 2 composed of a pure fluid region ω f of constant mass density ρ dynamic viscosity μ and a saturated porous medium ω f p ω p separated by a physical interface γ f p see fig 1 the homogeneous part of the porous region ω p is characterized by its constant porosity ϕ p volume fraction of fluid and permeability tensor k p with k p k p whereas ϕ p ϕ ϕ x z 1 and k k ϕ are respectively the spatially dependent porosity and permeability tensor of the non homogeneous interfacial transition layer ω f p the porosity ϕ inside ω f p is assumed to vary smoothly from ϕ p to 1 for the pure fluid over the thickness d l where l represents the characteristic length scale of the system at least l 100 d goyeau et al 2003 or far more for example kozeny carman s formula carman 1937 for k p ϕ p correlation confirmed in macdonald et al 1991 is classically used for granular media whereas happel langmuir s one happel 1959 or others gathered in jackson and james 1986 are more suitable for fibrous materials the asymptotic analysis is based on the integration of the momentum transport over the thickness d of ω f p giving rise to jump conditions at a fictive interface σ whose location inside ω f p is not known a priori here located at the dimensionless height 1 2 ξ z σ d 1 2 in fig 2 the thin transition layer ω f p is then replaced by the interface 2 2 the reader should be careful that the notations of ω f and ω p are not obviously consistent between fig 1 and fig 2 but this is for the practical sake of simplicity and convenience σ associated with suitable jump interface conditions 2 1 flow models with inertia the flow models without inertia are discussed in detail in angot et al 2017 for the stokes brinkman or stokes darcy problems the present analysis concerns the flow models with inertia here we consider the so called navier stokes darcy forchheimer fluid porous problem in the range of porosity 0 ϕ p 0 95 under these conditions the steady form of the inertial incompressible viscous flow in the fluid porous system ω is governed at the macroscopic scale by the following set of equations 1 v 0 in ω 2 ρ v v μ δ v p ρ f in ω f 3 1 ϕ ρ ϕ v v σ v p μ k 1 v ρ k p v κ ϕ v ρ f in ω fp 4 μ k p 1 v ρ k p v κ ϕ p v p ρ f in ω p where the symbol represents the tensor product in the above system f is a force per mass unit κ is the dupuit forchheimer tensor and σ v p represents the stress tensor for a newtonian fluid v being the velocity and p the pressure defined by 5 σ v p μ v v t p i μ ϕ v v t p i with ϕ 1 in ω f ϕ ϕ p in ω p where i denotes the identity tensor in the above system equation 1 represents the mass conservation in the whole domain ω where v is the superficial average velocity also called the filtration velocity the velocity of the solid skeleton being here null the pressure p refers to the intrinsic average pressure the pressure inside the solid skeleton being non defined hence the variables v p are physically measurable quantities at the macroscopic scale here it is interesting to note that the momentum transport models for the two stratified porous regions ω f p ω p are obtained from the so called navier stokes darcy forchheimer equation 3 which has been derived using a volume averaging method gray and o neill 1976 ochoa tapia and whitaker 1998 whitaker 1996 in the context of the one domain approach we also refer to bousquet melou et al 2002 for a more recent and precise derivation of this equation in the case of evolving heterogeneities all the terms in equation 3 arising from the upscaling procedure have to be kept due to evolving heterogeneities but their contribution obviously depends on the porosity values ϕ p ϕ 1 for instance in the pure fluid region ω f ϕ 1 k ϕ and κ ϕ 0 therefore the two friction terms including the permeability become negligible and equation 3 asymptotically tends towards the navier stokes equation 2 in the homogeneous porous bulk ω p the darcy forchheimer equation 4 is obtained by considering equation 3 when ϕ ϕ p therefore valid in ω p and then both the brinkman viscous term with respect to the darcy drag and the navier stokes nonlinear term with respect to the dupuit forchheimer quadratic term are discarded as explained a little further in section 2 2 these approximations are clearly valid at the macroscopic scale in the porosity range 0 ϕ p 0 95 in other words equation 3 asymptotically tends towards equation 4 at the porous interface between ω f p and ω p where ϕ ϕ p under these conditions we have natural continuity of both the velocity and stress vectors on γ f p see angot 1999 goyeau et al 2003 this also holds at the porous interface between ω f p and ω p i e at the bottom of the transition layer ω f p since the brinkman boundary layer is fully included inside ω f p see angot et al 2016 hernandez rodriguez et al 2020 the quadratic form of dupuit forchheimer s inertial friction is confirmed by many studies in the strong inertia regime e g theoretical works hassanizadeh and gray 1987 whitaker 1996 direct numerical simulations in ordered coulaud et al 1988 or random porous media andrade et al 1999 the correlation of ergun s coefficient κ ϕ ergun 1952 was confirmed in macdonald et al 1979 also in good agreement with the analytical approach proposed in du plessis 1994 although some others are discussed in papathanasiou et al 2001 lasseux et al 2011 muljadi et al 2016 these correlations are recalled in appendix b 2 2 justification of the approximations in order to justify the approximations made in section 2 1 it is useful to plot the ratio between the orders of magnitude of brinkman s viscous term and darcy s drag term let us use for the homogeneous and isotropic porous medium of porosity ϕ and permeability k ϕ the well known kozeny carman s formula carman 1937 confirmed in macdonald et al 1991 for the absolute permeability of random packed beds of spherical particles for granular materials this reads as below d p being the mean diameter of particles and η being the size of representative unit cell 6 with 1 ϕ π 6 d p η 3 k ϕ d p 2 ϕ 3 180 1 ϕ 2 0 00855 η 2 ϕ 3 1 ϕ 4 3 finer correlations for many other permeable media like fibrous materials with arrays of cylinder rods aligned or normal to the flow are gathered and discussed in jackson and james 1986 higdon and ford 1996 for example they reported the formula below of langmuir 1942 and confirmed by happel 1959 d f being now the characteristic diameter of fibers 7 k ϕ d f 2 16 1 ϕ ln 1 ϕ 3 2 2 1 ϕ fig 3 shows the well known variation of the dimensionless permeability with the porosity for both granular and fibrous materials then with μ μ ϕ in eq 3 with 5 it is useful to compare the ratio r b d of the orders of magnitude between brinkman s viscous term μ v v t of order o μ v l 2 and darcy s drag term μ k 1 v of order o μ v k ϕ using kozeny carman s correlation 6 thus we get 8 r b d d p 2 l 2 ϕ 2 180 1 ϕ 2 here v denotes a characteristic scale of velocity and kozeny carman s formula 6 is used for the correlation k ϕ the graph of r b d is plotted in fig 4 for different macroscopic scales l d p in the range of porosity 0 80 ϕ 1 hence at a macroscopic scale of the whole fluid porous system usually such that l o 100 d p at least or far more the brinkman viscous term can be clearly neglected for ϕ 0 95 except for highly permeable media as fibrous ones when we usually have ϕ 0 98 in particular this term must be kept in the interfacial porous layer ω f p of thickness d o d p and where ϕ varies continuously from ϕ p to 1 indeed when ϕ 1 we have r b d and the darcy brinkman equation recovers the stokes one let us now detail how to generalize the momentum transport equation to include the inertial effects at the macroscopic scale the suggestion that the one dimensional form be modified by the addition of a term proportional to ρ v 2 dates back to dupuit 1863 but the modified equation is usually associated to forchheimer 1901 this is confirmed by many experimental results beavers et al 1973 chauveteau and thirriot 1967 ergun 1952 givler and altobelli 1994 irmay 1958 macdonald et al 1979 zeng and grigg 2006 or numerical results coulaud et al 1988 ma and ruth 1993 rojas and koplik 1998 thauvin and mohanty 1998 andrade et al 1999 papathanasiou et al 2001 lasseux et al 2011 muljadi et al 2016 moreover upscaling methods as homogenization giorgi 1997 marušić paloka and mikelić 2000 chen et al 2001 or volume averaging hassanizadeh and gray 1987 ruth and ma 1992 whitaker 1996 soulaine and quintard 2014 prove the quadratic behaviour of the macroscopic inertial effect when the navier stokes equations govern the flow at the microscopic scale forchheimer and others wodié and lévy 1991 koch and ladd 1997 rojas and koplik 1998 skjetne and auriault 1999 have also included a term proportional to v 2 v but this cubic transition regime from the non inertial linear regime seems to appear only for weak inertia and shortly for the 3 d flow in random media fourar et al 2005 panfilov and fourar 2006 lasseux et al 2011 muljadi et al 2016 for an isotropic homogeneous porous medium with a constant porosity ϕ and permeability k k ϕ the navier brinkman dupuit forchheimer equation reads as follows after ward 1964 joseph et al 1982 whitaker 1996 nield 2000 9 ρ ϕ 2 v v μ δ v μ k v κ ϕ k ϕ ρ v v p ρ f where the non dimensional scalar function κ ϕ 0 in dupuit forchheimer s quadratic inertial friction strongly depends on the porosity ϕ v 2 v v being the square of the euclidean norm of vector v for example ward 1964 suggested the mean value κ 0 55 whereas ergun 1952 proposed from his experimental data a κ ϕ correlation given in appendix b later macdonald et al 1979 confirmed a very close correlation for κ ϕ as 10 κ ϕ 1 80 1 ϕ 1 2 ϕ 3 this is also in good agreement with the analytical approach proposed in du plessis 1994 then together with kozeny carman s formula 6 it gives 11 κ ϕ k ϕ 24 15 1 ϕ 3 2 d p ϕ 9 2 other correlations exist from various experimental data or numerical results supplied in appendix b e g irmay 1958 papathanasiou et al 2001 lasseux et al 2011 giving a large disparity or even some discrepancy as shown in fig 5 however it is important to mention that all these correlations are not calibrated for the same media ordered or random and some result from experimental measurements and others from numerical simulations besides they are not all valid in the whole range of porosity 0 ϕ 1 for instance κ ϕ does not tend to 0 when ϕ 1 in irmay 1958 and the results of lasseux et al 2011 are limited to the range 0 3 ϕ 0 75 in such a way when d p 0 and ϕ 1 we have using kozeny carman s relation k ϕ and the inertial resistance factor κ ϕ k ϕ 0 with eq 11 or with other κ ϕ correlations therefore since we have also μ μ the navier stokes equation is fully recovered with eq 9 which justifies the presence of the navier stokes nonlinear term indeed this term in eq 9 actually comes from the volume averaging process of the navier stokes equation at the microscopic scale as developed by whitaker 1996 nevertheless for many real porous media the navier stokes nonlinear term is shown to be negligible with respect to dupuit forchheimer s inertial term and thus it is often omitted when ϕ 0 95 indeed the following approximation holds with 11 except for a large porosity since κ ϕ k ϕ 0 when ϕ 1 ρ ϕ 2 v v o ρ v 2 ϕ 2 l ρ k d v κ ϕ v o ρ v 2 κ ϕ k ϕ using eq 11 the ratio r n s f of these quantities reads 12 r n s f d p l 0 0414 ϕ 9 2 1 ϕ 3 2 the graph of r n s f is plotted in fig 6 for different macroscopic scales l d p in the range of porosity 0 80 ϕ 1 this shows that the navier stokes nonlinear term cannot be neglected when ϕ 1 whatever the scale in particular this term must be kept in the interfacial porous layer ω f p of thickness d o d p and where ϕ varies continuously from ϕ p to 1 but as soon as l 100 d p the approximation holds in ω p with r n s f 1 100 for ϕ p 0 95 and the brinkman viscous term is also negligible as discussed earlier in that case the flow in ω p is governed by darcy forchheimer s equation 4 now if the porous medium is anisotropic dupuit forchheimer s quadratic term takes a tensorial form as derived in whitaker 1996 f ϕ v v where the tensor f ϕ v varies linearly with v so has the dimension of a velocity and is written in 2 d as 13 f ϕ v v κ ϕ v κ τ ϕ κ τ n ϕ κ n τ ϕ κ n ϕ we also refer to lasseux et al 2011 for the numerical solutions of the associated local closure problems showing that this tensor is positive but generally non symmetric for ordered media in the so called strong inertia regime of flow thus the dimensionless tensor κ ϕ is positive and possibly non symmetric as a conclusion the previous discussion justifies the momentum transport equation 3 in the transition porous region ω f p which is derived by volume averaging for an heterogeneous porous medium in several works gray and o neill 1976 ochoa tapia and whitaker 1998 whitaker 1996 and also in bousquet melou et al 2002 for evolving heterogeneities 3 the asymptotic interface model the asymptotic model for the momentum transport is derived by integrating eqs 1 3 and 5 over the thickness d of the interfacial layer ω f p using the constraint d l 1 with d o 20 k p valdés parada et al 2007 and related approximations up to o d l in the recent study hernandez rodriguez et al 2020 the thickness δ b of brinkman s viscous boundary layer is precisely investigated by filtered direct numerical simulations at the pore scale for different configurations of porous media we also refer to angot et al 2016 where the viscous boundary layer is theoretically calculated by wkb asymptotic expansions of which the convergence is proved since the transition layer ω f p due to the microstructure is included inside the brinkman boundary layer we have thus d δ b then the averaged transfer is described at the fictive dividing interface σ through suitable jump interface conditions at the first order in o d l for the sake of simplicity we consider the simplest reasonable choice when the fictive interface σ is centered inside ω f p i e with the dimensionless coordinate ξ z σ d 0 the modifications involved by ξ 0 with 1 2 ξ 1 2 are detailed in angot et al 2017 using non centered approximations see remark 3 leading to a family of jump interface conditions depending on the location of σ inside ω f p in fact the exact position of the interface inside ω f p is not of great importance for the present study since the model is derived hereafter up to the approximation order of o d l therefore compared to more sophiscated up scaling methods the present simplified asymptotic theory considers the position of σ as given a priori as it is for the macroscopic problem to solve in ω and then the resulting approximate model is related to that given position up to o d l it is also worth noting that at every step of the derivation of the model a quantity is neglected only with respect to another term of the same physical meaning that is much larger hence this allows us to assess that the global error remains of the order of o d l throughout the whole model 3 3 with some obvious changes the present theory can be applied to derive the macroscopic jump interface conditions for the flow between two porous media of different permeability or with a non newtonian fluid we very often refer to angot et al 2017 where the asymptotic modeling is extensively developed for the multi dimensional but non inertial viscous flow with arbitrary flow directions let n be a unit normal vector on the interface σ arbitrarily oriented from ω p to ω f and τ be a unit tangential vector on σ see fig 2 for any quantity ψ defined all over ω the restrictions on ω f or ω p are respectively denoted by ψ f ψ ω f and ψ p ψ ω p for a function ψ having a jump on σ let ψ and ψ be the traces of ψ p and ψ f on each side of σ respectively following angot 2010 the jump of ψ on σ oriented by n and the arithmetic mean of traces of ψ are defined as reduced variables at the interface by 14 ψ σ ψ ψ ψ f ψ p σ ψ σ 1 2 ψ ψ 1 2 ψ f ψ p σ besides for any quantity k the arithmetic and harmonic means over the thickness of ω f p respectively are given by 15 k x 1 d d 2 d 2 k x z d z k h x 1 k 1 3 1 jump interface conditions for the non inertial flow before deriving jump conditions for the inertial flow let us briefly recall the linear jump interface conditions for the stress and tangential velocity vectors at the interface σ separating now the pure fluid domain ω f from the porous domain ω p as derived in angot et al 2017 16 v n σ 0 σ v p n σ p σ n μ d ϕ σ v σ σ v p n σ μ d k σ 1 v σ d ρ f where ϕ σ denotes an effective surface porosity on σ and k σ is an effective surface permeability tensor on σ the first equation in 16 indicates that there is no jump of the normal velocity across σ this is obtained by the average of the mass conservation equation v 0 over the thickness of the interfacial layer ω f p the additional tangential derivative term being of order of o v d l and thus neglected in front of v n σ o v we refer to angot et al 2009 for higher order asymptotic modelling of the flow in fractured porous media where the tangential derivatives are not neglected the second equation in 16 corresponds to the average of the viscous stress vector 4 4 the derivation in angot et al 2017 is carried out using the pseudo stress vector μ v n p n on σ instead of the full stress one σ v p n σ with 5 that is more suitable for arbitrary flow directions jones 1973 however the reader will be easily convinced that the contribution of v t amounts to zero and the slip coefficient α σ remains unchanged since all the tangential derivatives can be neglected up to o d l and because we have also j b v n σ 0 from eq 5 and the scalar coefficient 2 d ϕ σ can be related with the scaling d o k p to the quantity α σ k p where α σ denotes the non dimensional slip coefficient originally introduced semi empirically in beavers and joseph 1967 for the 1 d channel flow with darcy s law thus this jump condition appears as a generalization for 2 d 3 d configurations with arbitrary flow directions of the popular beavers and joseph s tangential velocity jump which was early justified by volume averaging in ross 1983 nield 2009 and recently proved via homogenization by brillard et al 2013 a simplified version was also justified with a statistical and volume averaging approach in saffman 1971 and proved via homogenization in jäger and mikelić 2000 according to the present theory these two first conditions in eq 16 are not modified by including the inertial effects remark 1 nonlinear beavers joseph conditions therefore it does not seem physically meaningful to consider nonlinear versions of beavers and joseph s velocity jump condition as made by several authors since the definition of the stress vector in eq 5 remains unchanged and linear whatever inertia or not however the case of non newtonian flows will result in a nonlinear beavers joseph condition the last condition in 16 results from the averaging of the darcy brinkman momentum equation i e eq 3 with no inertial term over the thickness d of the interfacial layer ω f p this corresponds to the balance of forces across the interface σ and this is the single equation which will be modified to take account of inertia terms included in eq 3 the tensorial quantity d k σ 1 can be rescaled and related to β σ k p where β σ denotes the so called darcy friction tensor that is dimensionless this condition can be viewed as a generalization for 2 d 3 d configurations with arbitrary flow directions of the shear stress jump condition originally derived by volume averaging in ochoa tapia and whitaker 1995a b minale 2014 for the 1 d flow with no tangential velocity jump or assuming no pressure jump ochoa tapia and whitaker 1998 moreover as argued in angot et al 2017 the linear asymptotic model described by the set of equations 16 provides a suitable generalization for 2 d 3 d configurations with arbitrary flow directions of the interface conditions recently derived for the 1 d channel flow by volume averaging in valdés parada et al 2013 and including both shear stress and tangential velocity jumps therefore in agreement with the above discussion with the scaling d o 20 k p we introduce the dimensionless scalar or tensorial slip and friction coefficients at the interface 17 α σ k p d ϕ σ with ϕ σ 1 ϕ 1 ϕ h β σ d k p k σ 1 with k σ k ϕ h then the asymptotic interface model 16 with a surface force f σ d ρ f on σ finally reads for the non inertial regime and arbitrary flow directions up to o d l 18 v n σ 0 σ v p n σ p σ n μ k p α σ v σ σ v p n σ μ k p β σ v σ f σ on σ such a form similar to eq 18 was proposed earlier in angot 2010 2011 to mathematically study the multi dimensional fluid porous flow and prove the solvability of the coupled stokes brinkman or stokes darcy problems remark 2 over determination with 18 let us point out that the normal component of the second equation in 18 is not necessary to solve the problem since v n σ 0 is already given by the first equation this can be used to determine the mean pressure p σ at the interface see also angot et al 2017 for the jump of pressure p σ at the interface thus only the tangential component of this second equation is required with the first and third equations of 18 to prove that the whole fluid porous coupled problem is well posed indeed the mathematical analysis of solvability is recently detailed in angot 2018 let us now derive separately the contribution of the additional inertial terms from eq 3 in ω f p i e the navier stokes nonlinear term and dupuit forchheimer s quadratic inertial friction for the strong inertia regime of flow the case of the weak inertia regime with a cubic inertial friction is also considered further 3 2 contribution of the navier stokes nonlinear term let us set for convenience γ ϕ 1 ϕ and observe that ϕ p ϕ 1 in ω f p to respect the coherency of the modeling this function should be cut off to zero in ω p i e by taking γ p γ ϕ p 0 in ω p since the navier stokes nonlinear term is neglected in ω p for ϕ p 0 95 besides we have using the trapezoidal quadrature formula 19 γ σ γ ϕ 1 2 γ f γ p o d 2 1 2 by integrating the navier stokes nonlinear term in eq 3 over the thickness of ω f p the density ρ being a constant and applying the approximation lemma 1 of the generalized average in appendix a we get 20 d 2 d 2 1 ϕ ρ ϕ v v d z ρ γ σ d 2 d 2 γ ϕ v v d z o ρ γ σ 2 v 2 d 2 l 2 it clearly appears that the error term can be neglected up to o d l then it yields in the 2 d tensorial form up to the modeling error in o d l 21 ρ γ σ d 2 d 2 γ ϕ v v d z ρ γ σ τ d γ v τ 2 γ v τ v n σ τ d γ v τ v n γ v n 2 σ however the tangential derivative terms in both components are estimated as 22 ρ γ σ τ d γ v τ 2 o γ σ 2 ρ v 2 d l ρ γ σ τ d γ v τ v n o γ σ 2 ρ v 2 d l and they can be neglected up to o d l with respect to the jump terms which are of the order of o γ σ 2 ρ v 2 since v n σ v n σ 0 angot et al 2017 and thus v f n v p n v n we get with eq 20 the approximation below up to o d l 23 d 2 d 2 1 ϕ ρ ϕ v v d z ρ γ σ v n γ v σ besides by neglecting the navier stokes nonlinear term in ω p we have with γ p 0 and the definitions 14 γ σ 1 2 γ v τ σ v f τ σ γ σ γ f γ p 1 then eq 23 simplifies as 24 d 2 d 2 1 ϕ ρ ϕ v v d z 1 2 ρ v n v f we observe that this term is always null for the 1 d channel or shear flow i e with v n 0 at σ which is physically expected from the poiseuille or couette flow since the navier stokes convection term vanishes however this term is generally non zero for 2 d 3 d configurations with arbitrary flow directions 3 3 contribution of dupuit forchheimer s term let us consider dupuit forchheimer s quadratic term of eq 3 in ω f p first written as ρ k p f ϕ v v with f ϕ v v κ ϕ by applying the approximation lemma 1 of the generalized average in angot et al 2017 appendix b the integral of this term over the thickness of ω f p yields with the scaling d o k p 25 d 2 d 2 ρ k p f ϕ v v d z ρ d k p f ϕ v v σ o ρ v 2 d l and the error term can be neglected with respect to other terms in o ρ v 2 now still using the approximation lemma 1 we get 26 d f ϕ v d 2 d 2 v κ ϕ d z d v σ κ ϕ o κ ϕ v d 2 l let us define the positive tensor κ σ κ ϕ as the effective dupuit forchheimer s friction tensor at σ then by replacing 26 in eq 25 it gives still using the scaling d o 20 k p 27 d 2 d 2 ρ k p f ϕ v v d z ρ d k p v σ κ σ v σ o κ σ ρ v 2 d l and the error term can be still neglected hence the approximation up to o d l of the integral across ω f p of dupuit forchheimer s quadratic term in eq 3 reads 28 d 2 d 2 ρ k p f ϕ v v d z ρ d k p v σ κ σ v σ 3 4 contribution of a power law inertial term more generally let us now consider a power law inertial term of the form f q ϕ v q v with f q ϕ v q v q κ ϕ with any real number q 0 this term should be multiplied by a suitable quantity for dimensional reason to be included in eqs 3 and 4 instead of dupuit forchheimer s term corresponding to q 1 then using the same approximation procedure with lemma 1 we get 29 d 2 d 2 f q ϕ v q v d z v q σ κ σ v σ on σ the cubic inertial term for the weak inertia regime corresponds to the case q 2 4 the nonlinear interface model for inertial flow by incorporating the contributions of the inertial terms from eqs 24 and 28 in the asymptotic interface model 18 for the non inertial flow we summarize below the nonlinear asymptotic model governing the 2 d 3 d inertial flow at the interface by neglecting brinkman s viscous term in ω p within a suitable rescaling it suffices to formally take the limit when the effective viscosity μ p 0 inside ω p in the definition of the stress tensor 5 angot 2011 angot et al 2016 and thus the stress vector on the porous side of σ reduces to the normal pressure force 30 σ v p p n σ p p n indeed the coupled limit problem when μ 0 is rigorously proved by a vanishing viscosity method in angot 2011 or with a bkw asymptotic expansion to calculate the viscous boundary layer in angot et al 2016 from the stokes darcy brinkman problem to the stokes darcy problem we also refer to hernandez rodriguez et al 2020 for numerical investigations of the brinkman boundary layer with pore scale resolved simulations since we have the scaling d o 20 k p we introduce the dimensionless scalar or tensorial slip and friction coefficients at the interface 31 α σ k p d ϕ σ with ϕ σ 1 ϕ 1 ϕ h β σ d k p k σ 1 with k σ k ϕ h λ σ d k p κ σ with κ σ κ ϕ here ϕ σ denotes an effective surface porosity on σ whereas k σ is an effective surface permeability tensor on σ therefore the nonlinear interface model with a surface force f σ d ρ f on σ reads up to o d l 32 v n σ 0 σ v p n σ p σ n μ k p α σ v σ 1 2 ρ v n v f σ v p n σ μ k p β σ v σ ρ v σ λ σ v σ f σ on σ remark 2 obviously holds also as for 18 for the over determination of the set of interface conditions 32 remark 3 the case of σ non centered in ω f p for the sake of completeness let us recall from angot et al 2017 that when the dividing interface σ is chosen non centered inside ω f p i e for ξ 0 see fig 2 then all the mean quantities ψ σ in the interface conditions 18 or 32 must be replaced by their weighted counterpart ψ σ w defined by 33 ψ σ w ψ σ ξ ψ σ with 1 2 ξ 1 2 therefore two special cases can be discussed ξ 1 2 giving ψ σ w ψ σ f where σ is located at the top of the transition layer ω f p and ξ 1 2 giving ψ σ w ψ σ p when σ is at the bottom of ω f p see angot et al 2020 although the slip and friction coefficients should be estimated by experimental data or direct numerical simulations in ordered or random media the present theory also provides correlations with respect to the porosity ϕ p of the porous medium in ω p these functions are calculated hereafter for isotropic tensors β σ β σ i or λ σ λ σ i and depend on the scaling d d p chosen for the thickness of the transition layer ω f p d p o k p being the mean diameter of solid particles or fibres indeed we have chosen d o 10 d p to derive the macroscopic momentum equation 3 in ω f p now approximating the averaged quantities in eqs 31 by the trapezoidal rule which only includes the known values in ω f or ω p we get 34 α σ k p d ϕ 1 k p ϕ p 2 d 1 1 ϕ p β σ d 2 k p ϕ p λ σ d k p κ ϕ d κ ϕ p 2 k p ϕ p κ ϕ p β σ it is easy to verify that these coefficients satisfy the required coherency at the asymptotics when ϕ p 0 or ϕ p 1 in ω p the graphs of α σ and β σ for the scaling d 10 d p or d 10 d f are plotted in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively using either kozeny carman s correlation k p ϕ p for granular media carman 1937 macdonald et al 1991 or happel langmuir s one for fibrous materials happel 1959 jackson and james 1986 the graph of λ σ is plotted in fig 9 using also the correlation of ergun s coefficient κ ϕ p from macdonald et al 1979 remark 4 on the inertial friction coefficient λ σ it is remarkable that λ σ at the interface is related to the stress jump coefficient β σ as λ σ κ ϕ p β σ from 34 therefore the interface model for the inertial flow with ξ 0 i e σ being centered in ω f p only requires the surface coefficients α σ β σ needed for the non inertial flow and the ergun s coefficient κ ϕ p of the porous bulk ω p moreover by choosing the interface σ at the bottom of ω f p i e ξ 1 2 it appears from the forthcoming study angot et al 2020 that the interface conditions 32 degenerate to a generalized version of the stress jump condition of ochoa tapia and whitaker ochoa tapia and whitaker 1995a with velocity continuity v f v p on σ then the single friction coefficient β σ is only required to calibrate the interface model for the inertial flow 5 the mechanical energy balance and dissipation 5 1 energy balance for the fluid porous inertial flow let us now derive the energy balance of the resulting macroscale coupled model 1 2 4 in the domain ω ω f σ ω p i e the navier stokes and darcy forchheimer equations in ω f and ω p respectively supplemented by the interface model 32 on σ this will show that our model actually satisfies the energy theorem in mechanics at the macroscopic scale and that the conservation of kinetic energy holds without loss of generality we assume null boundary conditions v γ f 0 and v p n γ 0 at the external boundary γ of ω thus all the boundary integrals on γ will vanish with these homogeneous boundary conditions for the linear terms we follow the mathematical analysis made in angot 2018 see also angot 2010 2011 for the well posedness study of the fluid porous stokes darcy problem with the asymptotic interface conditions without inertia 16 and we include the contributions of all the nonlinear inertial terms to deal with the nonlinear terms it is more suitable to write the inertial term in the navier stokes equation with constant density ρ in ω f as 35 ρ v v ρ v v 1 2 ρ v 2 which introduces bernoulli s total pressure in the fluid ω f π f p f ρ v f 2 2 by taking l 2 scalar products of the motion equations with v in ω f and ω p respectively we use formally for sufficiently regular solutions standard integrations by parts and the boundary integrals on γ vanish with homogeneous boundary conditions as well as the integrals with divergence free velocity terms we have also the skew symmetry property 36 ω f ρ v f v f v f d x 0 using eqs 35 36 and v f 0 v γ f 0 we get with integration by parts 37 ω f ρ v f v f v f d x ω f 1 2 ρ v f 2 v f d x ω f 1 2 ρ v f 2 v f d x σ 1 2 ρ v f 2 v f n d s ρ 2 σ v f 2 v n d s hence the contribution of the navier stokes inertial term in ω f only involves the kinetic energy on σ from bernoulli s pressure then we follow the previous works angot 2010 2011 2018 for the mathematical analysis of the fluid porous flow without inertia using now the inertial interface conditions 32 instead of 18 we get after standard integrations by parts the following energy balance 38 μ ω f v f 2 d x μ ω p k p 1 v p v p d x ρ k p ω p v p κ ϕ v p v p d x μ k p σ α σ v τ σ 2 d s μ k p σ β σ v σ v σ d s j σ ω ρ f v d x σ f σ v σ d s where the energy quantity j σ gathers all the contributions of the nonlinear navier stokes and forchheimer inertial terms from the third interface condition in 32 on σ and also includes the term 37 therefore we have j σ ρ σ v σ λ σ v σ v σ d s ρ 2 σ v n v f v σ d s ρ 2 σ v f 2 v n d s by combining the last two terms using the definition of v σ from 14 the quantity j σ finally reads 39 j σ ρ σ v σ λ σ v σ v σ d s ρ 4 σ v f 2 v f v p v n d s let us notice that the first term in the right hand side of 39 is always positive whereas the second one is of arbitrary sign or vanishes if v p v f on σ i e when there is no jump of velocity at the interface 5 2 global dissipation of the coupled fluid porous model now we can prove the following result in appendix c theorem 1 sufficient condition for dissipation if the condition λ σ 1 holds then we have j σ 0 and hence the global dissipation of the present model holds this is at least satisfied within the porosity range of validity of the present navier stokes darcy forchheimer macroscale model 1 2 4 32 i e 0 ϕ p 0 95 as shown in fig 10 and fig 11 for a zoom indeed introducing the ratio r v f σ v p σ 1 we recall that saffman s approximation saffman 1971 assuming v p τ v f τ at the interface is generally not valid as soon as the porosity is large enough thus only the condition r 1 clearly holds but we do not have in general r 1 then it appears after calculations detailed in appendix c that a simple sufficient condition to get j σ 0 reads 40 a λ σ r 2 1 2 r 0 for any r 1 then from 40 it follows the final sufficient condition for global dissipation 41 λ σ 1 a r 2 1 2 r r 1 2 0 j σ 0 as shown in figs 10 and 11 the condition λ σ 1 is clearly satisfied for the correlation of ergun s coefficient κ ϕ p given by ergun 1952 macdonald et al 1979 but it also holds for other correlations like papathanasiou et al 2001 lasseux et al 2011 at least within the porosity range ϕ p 0 95 of validity of the present navier stokes darcy forchheimer model thus we have always j σ 0 with ϕ p 0 95 which means that all the nonlinear terms at the interface have always a positive contribution to the dissipation of kinetic energy in the whole system ω since all the other terms in the left hand side of eq 38 are also positive we conclude that the present navier stokes darcy forchheimer model is globally dissipative which assesses its stability and physical relevance 5 5 with the present theory and with no inertia at all in the porous region ω p it does not seem possible to get the global dissipation with no restriction on the size of the data indeed considering only the navier stokes darcy problem as made by some authors would give λ σ 0 this does not enable us to control the kinetic energy at the interface σ with the present interface conditions at ξ 0 nor discarding the first nonlinear term ρ v n v f 2 in 32 to get interface conditions that become then only linear moreover the condition j σ 0 is also a strong argument to mathematically prove the global existence of weak solutions to this nonlinear flow model in 3 d with no restriction on the size of the data remark 5 generalization for porosities ϕ p 0 95 the present interface model 32 its derivation and analysis of global dissipation can be extended with some modifications to larger porosities ϕ p 95 of the permeable medium ω p e g for fibrous porous media in that case considering now the navier brinkman forchheimer equation 9 in ω p the navier stokes navier brinkman forchheimer model must be used for the free fluid and porous medium coupling together with a suitable modification of the interface conditions 32 on σ then the jump of velocity v σ on the interface is small and can be neglected thus we have v p v f on σ and the second term in the right hand side of 39 vanishes therefore we get j σ 0 and the global dissipation of the navier stokes navier brinkman forchheimer model is also ensured that is detailed in a forthcoming paper angot et al 2021 6 conclusion let us emphasize that the physically meaningful nonlinear interface model in the set of equations 32 34 is quite original since to our knowledge there exists in the literature no other multi dimensional nonlinear macroscale model for the inertial flow with arbitrary flow directions over a permeable medium moreover this clearly opens new perspectives to study turbulent flows at the fluid porous interface declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a approximation result the key practical result which is used several times in this study reads as follows the proof is given in angot et al 2017 appendix b lemma 1 approximations of generalized average let the function ψ d 2 d 2 r be continuously differentiable and the function w d 2 d 2 r be lebesgue integrable then we have d 2 d 2 w x ψ x d x w d 2 d 2 ψ x d x o w ψ d 2 d w ψ σ o w ψ d 2 appendix b different κ ϕ correlations for ergun s coefficient here we summarize various widely used κ ϕ correlations for ergun s coefficient of dupuit forchheimer s inertial resistance force most of the correlations are phenomenological and have been deduced from experiments recently a few of them have been obtained using numerical simulations correlation by ergun 1952 based on an implicit model of packed spheres b 1 κ ϕ 1 75 1 ϕ 1 2 ϕ 3 correlation by irmay 1958 three dimensional

38 ϕ 2 04 for 0 3 ϕ 0 75 appendix c proof of theorem 1 the strategy is to get a non negative lower bound of j σ given in 39 for sake of clarity we consider the case of the isotropic tensor λ σ λ σ i with the scalar coefficient λ σ 0 the general case of a symmetric positive definite tensor λ σ will easily follow by considering the classical minoration from rayleigh s quotient λ σ v v λ m i n v 2 for all v r 3 where λ min 0 is the minimum eigenvalue of the matrix λ σ then the result below holds using λ min instead of λ σ further from 39 we have the splitting below c 1 j σ j 1 j 2 with j 1 ρ σ v σ λ σ v σ v σ d s 0 j 2 ρ 4 σ v f 2 v f v p v n d s now the key idea is to introduce the ratio c 2 r v f σ v p σ 1 on σ we recall that saffman s approximation saffman 1971 assuming v p τ v f τ at the interface is generally not valid as soon as the porosity is large enough thus only the condition r 1 clearly holds since v p τ v f τ and also v f n v p n v n on σ but we do not have in general r 1 then from one side using the definition of the arithmetic mean on σ from 14 we have successively j 1 ρ σ v σ λ σ v σ 2 d s ρ 8 σ λ σ v f v p v f v p 2 d s ρ 8 σ λ σ v f v p v f 2 v p 2 2 v f v p d s ρ 8 σ v p 3 λ σ r 1 r 2 1 2 v f v p v p 2 d s since v f v p 0 on σ we get the minoration of j 1 c 3 j 1 ρ 8 σ v p 3 λ σ r 1 r 2 1 d s from another side with the cauchy schwarz inequality we have the majoration of j 2 c 4 j 2 ρ 4 σ v f 2 v f v p v n d s ρ 4 σ v p 3 r 2 r d s ρ 8 σ v p 3 2 r r 1 d s combining c 3 and c 4 we get the minoration of j σ below c 5 j σ j 1 j 2 ρ 8 σ v p 3 r 1 λ σ r 2 1 2 r d s then it appears that a simple sufficient condition to get j σ 0 reads c 6 a λ σ r 2 1 2 r 0 i e λ σ 2 r r 2 1 for any r 1 since we have 0 2 r r 2 1 1 for all r 1 the sufficient condition c 6 is equivalent to the condition below c 7 λ σ 1 this ends the proof 
344,an original nonlinear multi dimensional model for the inertial fluid flow through a fluid porous interface is derived by asymptotic theory for arbitrary flow directions the interfacial region between the pure fluid and the homogeneous porous region is viewed as a thin transition porous layer characterized by smoothly evolving heterogeneities the asymptotic analysis applied to the homogenized navier stokes equations in this thin heterogeneous porous layer leads to nonlinear momentum jump conditions at the equivalent dividing interface these jump conditions involve slip and friction coefficients whose dependence on porosity are analyzed moreover we show that the resulting navier stokes darcy forchheimer macroscale coupled model is globally dissipative in the porosity range 0 ϕ p 0 95 which also contributes to its physical relevance to our knowledge this innovative asymptotic model is the first nonlinear multi dimensional model proposed in the literature for the inertial flow with arbitrary flow directions at a permeable interface besides it clearly opens new perspectives to study turbulent flows at the fluid porous interface keywords fluid porous inertial flow asymptotic analysis nonlinear jump interface conditions slip and friction coefficients navier stokes ddarcy forchheimer model globally dissipative model 1 main objectives and highlights the momentum transport at the interface between a fluid and a permeable region is present in a large variety of industrial applications dendritic solidification of multi component mixtures fuel cell oil recovery separation processes etc but also in environmental situations or for water resources surface or subsurface hydrology interaction atmosphere canopy benthic boundary layers etc or biological systems bone growth biofilms cell proliferation etc we refer to the recent paper bottaro 2019 and the references therein for many examples of application due to the different characteristic length scales involved in these heterogeneous configurations the momentum transport analysis is often performed at the macroscopic scale where the concept of interface is actually related to the nature of the average representation from the pioneering work of beavers and joseph beavers and joseph 1967 two macroscopic modeling approaches have been used the single domain approach considers the interfacial region as a thin transition porous layer see fig 1 where the averaged properties porosity permeability are continuously spatially dependent evolving heterogeneities on the other hand the two domain approach considers a fictive interface see fig 2 where explicit jump boundary conditions must be expressed it is worth mentioning that these jump conditions result from an integration of the momentum transport on the thin transition layer of the single domain approach goyeau et al 2003 valdés parada et al 2013 different studies have been devoted to the derivation of these jump conditions for non inertial one dimensional channel flows parallel to the porous layer beavers and joseph 1967 brillard et al 2013 goyeau et al 2003 jäger and mikelić 2000 2009 ochoa tapia and whitaker 1995a b saffman 1971 valdés parada et al 2013 using an asymptotic modeling as for thin fractures in porous media angot et al 2009 the present authors have recently derived in angot et al 2017 jump conditions for a general two or three dimensional non inertial viscous flow and arbitrary flow directions at a permeable interface however many applications concern flow regimes where inertial effects have to be considered nield and bejan 2017 a few papers address the inertial flows at a fluid porous interface by numerical simulations at the macroscopic scale sahraoui and kaviany 1992 hill and straughan 2009 or at the pore scale breugem and boersma 2005 zhang and prosperetti 2009 liu and prosperetti 2011 rosti et al 2015 zampogna and bottaro 2016 basser et al 2017 lācis and bagheri 2017 but mainly restricted to the 1 d channel case to the best of our knowledge there exists no general interface model for the multi dimensional inertial flow and arbitrary flow directions nield and bejan 2017 hence the macroscopic description of the inertial flow through a permeable interface is still a challenging open problem in fluid dynamics this is the objective of the present theoretical study where the asymptotic analysis angot et al 2017 applied here to the homogenized navier stokes equations in the thin transition porous layer yields an original nonlinear multi dimensional model for the inertial flow over a permeable medium moreover we show that the total work of the inertial forces in the fluid and porous domains has always a positive contribution at the interface to the dissipation of kinetic energy inside the whole system the paper is organized as follows section 2 details the model equations governing the flow in the fluid and permeable regions in section 3 we derive the asymptotic model for the inertial flow only the contribution of all the additional nonlinear and inertial terms is detailed including the cases of both weak or strong inertia the resulting nonlinear interface conditions are discussed in section 4 finally the mechanical energy balance is derived in section 5 which suggests some concluding remarks the present analysis is carried out in detail for the porosity range 0 ϕ p 0 95 but remark 5 gives some hints on how to generalize it for larger porosities ϕ p 0 95 2 fluid porous inertial flow models let us consider a two dimensional 1 1 for the sake of clarity the present asymptotic model is derived hereafter for the 2 d flow although the extension to 3 d is quite straigthforward since all the tangential derivative and possibly curvature terms are neglected up to first order in o d l bounded domain ω r 2 composed of a pure fluid region ω f of constant mass density ρ dynamic viscosity μ and a saturated porous medium ω f p ω p separated by a physical interface γ f p see fig 1 the homogeneous part of the porous region ω p is characterized by its constant porosity ϕ p volume fraction of fluid and permeability tensor k p with k p k p whereas ϕ p ϕ ϕ x z 1 and k k ϕ are respectively the spatially dependent porosity and permeability tensor of the non homogeneous interfacial transition layer ω f p the porosity ϕ inside ω f p is assumed to vary smoothly from ϕ p to 1 for the pure fluid over the thickness d l where l represents the characteristic length scale of the system at least l 100 d goyeau et al 2003 or far more for example kozeny carman s formula carman 1937 for k p ϕ p correlation confirmed in macdonald et al 1991 is classically used for granular media whereas happel langmuir s one happel 1959 or others gathered in jackson and james 1986 are more suitable for fibrous materials the asymptotic analysis is based on the integration of the momentum transport over the thickness d of ω f p giving rise to jump conditions at a fictive interface σ whose location inside ω f p is not known a priori here located at the dimensionless height 1 2 ξ z σ d 1 2 in fig 2 the thin transition layer ω f p is then replaced by the interface 2 2 the reader should be careful that the notations of ω f and ω p are not obviously consistent between fig 1 and fig 2 but this is for the practical sake of simplicity and convenience σ associated with suitable jump interface conditions 2 1 flow models with inertia the flow models without inertia are discussed in detail in angot et al 2017 for the stokes brinkman or stokes darcy problems the present analysis concerns the flow models with inertia here we consider the so called navier stokes darcy forchheimer fluid porous problem in the range of porosity 0 ϕ p 0 95 under these conditions the steady form of the inertial incompressible viscous flow in the fluid porous system ω is governed at the macroscopic scale by the following set of equations 1 v 0 in ω 2 ρ v v μ δ v p ρ f in ω f 3 1 ϕ ρ ϕ v v σ v p μ k 1 v ρ k p v κ ϕ v ρ f in ω fp 4 μ k p 1 v ρ k p v κ ϕ p v p ρ f in ω p where the symbol represents the tensor product in the above system f is a force per mass unit κ is the dupuit forchheimer tensor and σ v p represents the stress tensor for a newtonian fluid v being the velocity and p the pressure defined by 5 σ v p μ v v t p i μ ϕ v v t p i with ϕ 1 in ω f ϕ ϕ p in ω p where i denotes the identity tensor in the above system equation 1 represents the mass conservation in the whole domain ω where v is the superficial average velocity also called the filtration velocity the velocity of the solid skeleton being here null the pressure p refers to the intrinsic average pressure the pressure inside the solid skeleton being non defined hence the variables v p are physically measurable quantities at the macroscopic scale here it is interesting to note that the momentum transport models for the two stratified porous regions ω f p ω p are obtained from the so called navier stokes darcy forchheimer equation 3 which has been derived using a volume averaging method gray and o neill 1976 ochoa tapia and whitaker 1998 whitaker 1996 in the context of the one domain approach we also refer to bousquet melou et al 2002 for a more recent and precise derivation of this equation in the case of evolving heterogeneities all the terms in equation 3 arising from the upscaling procedure have to be kept due to evolving heterogeneities but their contribution obviously depends on the porosity values ϕ p ϕ 1 for instance in the pure fluid region ω f ϕ 1 k ϕ and κ ϕ 0 therefore the two friction terms including the permeability become negligible and equation 3 asymptotically tends towards the navier stokes equation 2 in the homogeneous porous bulk ω p the darcy forchheimer equation 4 is obtained by considering equation 3 when ϕ ϕ p therefore valid in ω p and then both the brinkman viscous term with respect to the darcy drag and the navier stokes nonlinear term with respect to the dupuit forchheimer quadratic term are discarded as explained a little further in section 2 2 these approximations are clearly valid at the macroscopic scale in the porosity range 0 ϕ p 0 95 in other words equation 3 asymptotically tends towards equation 4 at the porous interface between ω f p and ω p where ϕ ϕ p under these conditions we have natural continuity of both the velocity and stress vectors on γ f p see angot 1999 goyeau et al 2003 this also holds at the porous interface between ω f p and ω p i e at the bottom of the transition layer ω f p since the brinkman boundary layer is fully included inside ω f p see angot et al 2016 hernandez rodriguez et al 2020 the quadratic form of dupuit forchheimer s inertial friction is confirmed by many studies in the strong inertia regime e g theoretical works hassanizadeh and gray 1987 whitaker 1996 direct numerical simulations in ordered coulaud et al 1988 or random porous media andrade et al 1999 the correlation of ergun s coefficient κ ϕ ergun 1952 was confirmed in macdonald et al 1979 also in good agreement with the analytical approach proposed in du plessis 1994 although some others are discussed in papathanasiou et al 2001 lasseux et al 2011 muljadi et al 2016 these correlations are recalled in appendix b 2 2 justification of the approximations in order to justify the approximations made in section 2 1 it is useful to plot the ratio between the orders of magnitude of brinkman s viscous term and darcy s drag term let us use for the homogeneous and isotropic porous medium of porosity ϕ and permeability k ϕ the well known kozeny carman s formula carman 1937 confirmed in macdonald et al 1991 for the absolute permeability of random packed beds of spherical particles for granular materials this reads as below d p being the mean diameter of particles and η being the size of representative unit cell 6 with 1 ϕ π 6 d p η 3 k ϕ d p 2 ϕ 3 180 1 ϕ 2 0 00855 η 2 ϕ 3 1 ϕ 4 3 finer correlations for many other permeable media like fibrous materials with arrays of cylinder rods aligned or normal to the flow are gathered and discussed in jackson and james 1986 higdon and ford 1996 for example they reported the formula below of langmuir 1942 and confirmed by happel 1959 d f being now the characteristic diameter of fibers 7 k ϕ d f 2 16 1 ϕ ln 1 ϕ 3 2 2 1 ϕ fig 3 shows the well known variation of the dimensionless permeability with the porosity for both granular and fibrous materials then with μ μ ϕ in eq 3 with 5 it is useful to compare the ratio r b d of the orders of magnitude between brinkman s viscous term μ v v t of order o μ v l 2 and darcy s drag term μ k 1 v of order o μ v k ϕ using kozeny carman s correlation 6 thus we get 8 r b d d p 2 l 2 ϕ 2 180 1 ϕ 2 here v denotes a characteristic scale of velocity and kozeny carman s formula 6 is used for the correlation k ϕ the graph of r b d is plotted in fig 4 for different macroscopic scales l d p in the range of porosity 0 80 ϕ 1 hence at a macroscopic scale of the whole fluid porous system usually such that l o 100 d p at least or far more the brinkman viscous term can be clearly neglected for ϕ 0 95 except for highly permeable media as fibrous ones when we usually have ϕ 0 98 in particular this term must be kept in the interfacial porous layer ω f p of thickness d o d p and where ϕ varies continuously from ϕ p to 1 indeed when ϕ 1 we have r b d and the darcy brinkman equation recovers the stokes one let us now detail how to generalize the momentum transport equation to include the inertial effects at the macroscopic scale the suggestion that the one dimensional form be modified by the addition of a term proportional to ρ v 2 dates back to dupuit 1863 but the modified equation is usually associated to forchheimer 1901 this is confirmed by many experimental results beavers et al 1973 chauveteau and thirriot 1967 ergun 1952 givler and altobelli 1994 irmay 1958 macdonald et al 1979 zeng and grigg 2006 or numerical results coulaud et al 1988 ma and ruth 1993 rojas and koplik 1998 thauvin and mohanty 1998 andrade et al 1999 papathanasiou et al 2001 lasseux et al 2011 muljadi et al 2016 moreover upscaling methods as homogenization giorgi 1997 marušić paloka and mikelić 2000 chen et al 2001 or volume averaging hassanizadeh and gray 1987 ruth and ma 1992 whitaker 1996 soulaine and quintard 2014 prove the quadratic behaviour of the macroscopic inertial effect when the navier stokes equations govern the flow at the microscopic scale forchheimer and others wodié and lévy 1991 koch and ladd 1997 rojas and koplik 1998 skjetne and auriault 1999 have also included a term proportional to v 2 v but this cubic transition regime from the non inertial linear regime seems to appear only for weak inertia and shortly for the 3 d flow in random media fourar et al 2005 panfilov and fourar 2006 lasseux et al 2011 muljadi et al 2016 for an isotropic homogeneous porous medium with a constant porosity ϕ and permeability k k ϕ the navier brinkman dupuit forchheimer equation reads as follows after ward 1964 joseph et al 1982 whitaker 1996 nield 2000 9 ρ ϕ 2 v v μ δ v μ k v κ ϕ k ϕ ρ v v p ρ f where the non dimensional scalar function κ ϕ 0 in dupuit forchheimer s quadratic inertial friction strongly depends on the porosity ϕ v 2 v v being the square of the euclidean norm of vector v for example ward 1964 suggested the mean value κ 0 55 whereas ergun 1952 proposed from his experimental data a κ ϕ correlation given in appendix b later macdonald et al 1979 confirmed a very close correlation for κ ϕ as 10 κ ϕ 1 80 1 ϕ 1 2 ϕ 3 this is also in good agreement with the analytical approach proposed in du plessis 1994 then together with kozeny carman s formula 6 it gives 11 κ ϕ k ϕ 24 15 1 ϕ 3 2 d p ϕ 9 2 other correlations exist from various experimental data or numerical results supplied in appendix b e g irmay 1958 papathanasiou et al 2001 lasseux et al 2011 giving a large disparity or even some discrepancy as shown in fig 5 however it is important to mention that all these correlations are not calibrated for the same media ordered or random and some result from experimental measurements and others from numerical simulations besides they are not all valid in the whole range of porosity 0 ϕ 1 for instance κ ϕ does not tend to 0 when ϕ 1 in irmay 1958 and the results of lasseux et al 2011 are limited to the range 0 3 ϕ 0 75 in such a way when d p 0 and ϕ 1 we have using kozeny carman s relation k ϕ and the inertial resistance factor κ ϕ k ϕ 0 with eq 11 or with other κ ϕ correlations therefore since we have also μ μ the navier stokes equation is fully recovered with eq 9 which justifies the presence of the navier stokes nonlinear term indeed this term in eq 9 actually comes from the volume averaging process of the navier stokes equation at the microscopic scale as developed by whitaker 1996 nevertheless for many real porous media the navier stokes nonlinear term is shown to be negligible with respect to dupuit forchheimer s inertial term and thus it is often omitted when ϕ 0 95 indeed the following approximation holds with 11 except for a large porosity since κ ϕ k ϕ 0 when ϕ 1 ρ ϕ 2 v v o ρ v 2 ϕ 2 l ρ k d v κ ϕ v o ρ v 2 κ ϕ k ϕ using eq 11 the ratio r n s f of these quantities reads 12 r n s f d p l 0 0414 ϕ 9 2 1 ϕ 3 2 the graph of r n s f is plotted in fig 6 for different macroscopic scales l d p in the range of porosity 0 80 ϕ 1 this shows that the navier stokes nonlinear term cannot be neglected when ϕ 1 whatever the scale in particular this term must be kept in the interfacial porous layer ω f p of thickness d o d p and where ϕ varies continuously from ϕ p to 1 but as soon as l 100 d p the approximation holds in ω p with r n s f 1 100 for ϕ p 0 95 and the brinkman viscous term is also negligible as discussed earlier in that case the flow in ω p is governed by darcy forchheimer s equation 4 now if the porous medium is anisotropic dupuit forchheimer s quadratic term takes a tensorial form as derived in whitaker 1996 f ϕ v v where the tensor f ϕ v varies linearly with v so has the dimension of a velocity and is written in 2 d as 13 f ϕ v v κ ϕ v κ τ ϕ κ τ n ϕ κ n τ ϕ κ n ϕ we also refer to lasseux et al 2011 for the numerical solutions of the associated local closure problems showing that this tensor is positive but generally non symmetric for ordered media in the so called strong inertia regime of flow thus the dimensionless tensor κ ϕ is positive and possibly non symmetric as a conclusion the previous discussion justifies the momentum transport equation 3 in the transition porous region ω f p which is derived by volume averaging for an heterogeneous porous medium in several works gray and o neill 1976 ochoa tapia and whitaker 1998 whitaker 1996 and also in bousquet melou et al 2002 for evolving heterogeneities 3 the asymptotic interface model the asymptotic model for the momentum transport is derived by integrating eqs 1 3 and 5 over the thickness d of the interfacial layer ω f p using the constraint d l 1 with d o 20 k p valdés parada et al 2007 and related approximations up to o d l in the recent study hernandez rodriguez et al 2020 the thickness δ b of brinkman s viscous boundary layer is precisely investigated by filtered direct numerical simulations at the pore scale for different configurations of porous media we also refer to angot et al 2016 where the viscous boundary layer is theoretically calculated by wkb asymptotic expansions of which the convergence is proved since the transition layer ω f p due to the microstructure is included inside the brinkman boundary layer we have thus d δ b then the averaged transfer is described at the fictive dividing interface σ through suitable jump interface conditions at the first order in o d l for the sake of simplicity we consider the simplest reasonable choice when the fictive interface σ is centered inside ω f p i e with the dimensionless coordinate ξ z σ d 0 the modifications involved by ξ 0 with 1 2 ξ 1 2 are detailed in angot et al 2017 using non centered approximations see remark 3 leading to a family of jump interface conditions depending on the location of σ inside ω f p in fact the exact position of the interface inside ω f p is not of great importance for the present study since the model is derived hereafter up to the approximation order of o d l therefore compared to more sophiscated up scaling methods the present simplified asymptotic theory considers the position of σ as given a priori as it is for the macroscopic problem to solve in ω and then the resulting approximate model is related to that given position up to o d l it is also worth noting that at every step of the derivation of the model a quantity is neglected only with respect to another term of the same physical meaning that is much larger hence this allows us to assess that the global error remains of the order of o d l throughout the whole model 3 3 with some obvious changes the present theory can be applied to derive the macroscopic jump interface conditions for the flow between two porous media of different permeability or with a non newtonian fluid we very often refer to angot et al 2017 where the asymptotic modeling is extensively developed for the multi dimensional but non inertial viscous flow with arbitrary flow directions let n be a unit normal vector on the interface σ arbitrarily oriented from ω p to ω f and τ be a unit tangential vector on σ see fig 2 for any quantity ψ defined all over ω the restrictions on ω f or ω p are respectively denoted by ψ f ψ ω f and ψ p ψ ω p for a function ψ having a jump on σ let ψ and ψ be the traces of ψ p and ψ f on each side of σ respectively following angot 2010 the jump of ψ on σ oriented by n and the arithmetic mean of traces of ψ are defined as reduced variables at the interface by 14 ψ σ ψ ψ ψ f ψ p σ ψ σ 1 2 ψ ψ 1 2 ψ f ψ p σ besides for any quantity k the arithmetic and harmonic means over the thickness of ω f p respectively are given by 15 k x 1 d d 2 d 2 k x z d z k h x 1 k 1 3 1 jump interface conditions for the non inertial flow before deriving jump conditions for the inertial flow let us briefly recall the linear jump interface conditions for the stress and tangential velocity vectors at the interface σ separating now the pure fluid domain ω f from the porous domain ω p as derived in angot et al 2017 16 v n σ 0 σ v p n σ p σ n μ d ϕ σ v σ σ v p n σ μ d k σ 1 v σ d ρ f where ϕ σ denotes an effective surface porosity on σ and k σ is an effective surface permeability tensor on σ the first equation in 16 indicates that there is no jump of the normal velocity across σ this is obtained by the average of the mass conservation equation v 0 over the thickness of the interfacial layer ω f p the additional tangential derivative term being of order of o v d l and thus neglected in front of v n σ o v we refer to angot et al 2009 for higher order asymptotic modelling of the flow in fractured porous media where the tangential derivatives are not neglected the second equation in 16 corresponds to the average of the viscous stress vector 4 4 the derivation in angot et al 2017 is carried out using the pseudo stress vector μ v n p n on σ instead of the full stress one σ v p n σ with 5 that is more suitable for arbitrary flow directions jones 1973 however the reader will be easily convinced that the contribution of v t amounts to zero and the slip coefficient α σ remains unchanged since all the tangential derivatives can be neglected up to o d l and because we have also j b v n σ 0 from eq 5 and the scalar coefficient 2 d ϕ σ can be related with the scaling d o k p to the quantity α σ k p where α σ denotes the non dimensional slip coefficient originally introduced semi empirically in beavers and joseph 1967 for the 1 d channel flow with darcy s law thus this jump condition appears as a generalization for 2 d 3 d configurations with arbitrary flow directions of the popular beavers and joseph s tangential velocity jump which was early justified by volume averaging in ross 1983 nield 2009 and recently proved via homogenization by brillard et al 2013 a simplified version was also justified with a statistical and volume averaging approach in saffman 1971 and proved via homogenization in jäger and mikelić 2000 according to the present theory these two first conditions in eq 16 are not modified by including the inertial effects remark 1 nonlinear beavers joseph conditions therefore it does not seem physically meaningful to consider nonlinear versions of beavers and joseph s velocity jump condition as made by several authors since the definition of the stress vector in eq 5 remains unchanged and linear whatever inertia or not however the case of non newtonian flows will result in a nonlinear beavers joseph condition the last condition in 16 results from the averaging of the darcy brinkman momentum equation i e eq 3 with no inertial term over the thickness d of the interfacial layer ω f p this corresponds to the balance of forces across the interface σ and this is the single equation which will be modified to take account of inertia terms included in eq 3 the tensorial quantity d k σ 1 can be rescaled and related to β σ k p where β σ denotes the so called darcy friction tensor that is dimensionless this condition can be viewed as a generalization for 2 d 3 d configurations with arbitrary flow directions of the shear stress jump condition originally derived by volume averaging in ochoa tapia and whitaker 1995a b minale 2014 for the 1 d flow with no tangential velocity jump or assuming no pressure jump ochoa tapia and whitaker 1998 moreover as argued in angot et al 2017 the linear asymptotic model described by the set of equations 16 provides a suitable generalization for 2 d 3 d configurations with arbitrary flow directions of the interface conditions recently derived for the 1 d channel flow by volume averaging in valdés parada et al 2013 and including both shear stress and tangential velocity jumps therefore in agreement with the above discussion with the scaling d o 20 k p we introduce the dimensionless scalar or tensorial slip and friction coefficients at the interface 17 α σ k p d ϕ σ with ϕ σ 1 ϕ 1 ϕ h β σ d k p k σ 1 with k σ k ϕ h then the asymptotic interface model 16 with a surface force f σ d ρ f on σ finally reads for the non inertial regime and arbitrary flow directions up to o d l 18 v n σ 0 σ v p n σ p σ n μ k p α σ v σ σ v p n σ μ k p β σ v σ f σ on σ such a form similar to eq 18 was proposed earlier in angot 2010 2011 to mathematically study the multi dimensional fluid porous flow and prove the solvability of the coupled stokes brinkman or stokes darcy problems remark 2 over determination with 18 let us point out that the normal component of the second equation in 18 is not necessary to solve the problem since v n σ 0 is already given by the first equation this can be used to determine the mean pressure p σ at the interface see also angot et al 2017 for the jump of pressure p σ at the interface thus only the tangential component of this second equation is required with the first and third equations of 18 to prove that the whole fluid porous coupled problem is well posed indeed the mathematical analysis of solvability is recently detailed in angot 2018 let us now derive separately the contribution of the additional inertial terms from eq 3 in ω f p i e the navier stokes nonlinear term and dupuit forchheimer s quadratic inertial friction for the strong inertia regime of flow the case of the weak inertia regime with a cubic inertial friction is also considered further 3 2 contribution of the navier stokes nonlinear term let us set for convenience γ ϕ 1 ϕ and observe that ϕ p ϕ 1 in ω f p to respect the coherency of the modeling this function should be cut off to zero in ω p i e by taking γ p γ ϕ p 0 in ω p since the navier stokes nonlinear term is neglected in ω p for ϕ p 0 95 besides we have using the trapezoidal quadrature formula 19 γ σ γ ϕ 1 2 γ f γ p o d 2 1 2 by integrating the navier stokes nonlinear term in eq 3 over the thickness of ω f p the density ρ being a constant and applying the approximation lemma 1 of the generalized average in appendix a we get 20 d 2 d 2 1 ϕ ρ ϕ v v d z ρ γ σ d 2 d 2 γ ϕ v v d z o ρ γ σ 2 v 2 d 2 l 2 it clearly appears that the error term can be neglected up to o d l then it yields in the 2 d tensorial form up to the modeling error in o d l 21 ρ γ σ d 2 d 2 γ ϕ v v d z ρ γ σ τ d γ v τ 2 γ v τ v n σ τ d γ v τ v n γ v n 2 σ however the tangential derivative terms in both components are estimated as 22 ρ γ σ τ d γ v τ 2 o γ σ 2 ρ v 2 d l ρ γ σ τ d γ v τ v n o γ σ 2 ρ v 2 d l and they can be neglected up to o d l with respect to the jump terms which are of the order of o γ σ 2 ρ v 2 since v n σ v n σ 0 angot et al 2017 and thus v f n v p n v n we get with eq 20 the approximation below up to o d l 23 d 2 d 2 1 ϕ ρ ϕ v v d z ρ γ σ v n γ v σ besides by neglecting the navier stokes nonlinear term in ω p we have with γ p 0 and the definitions 14 γ σ 1 2 γ v τ σ v f τ σ γ σ γ f γ p 1 then eq 23 simplifies as 24 d 2 d 2 1 ϕ ρ ϕ v v d z 1 2 ρ v n v f we observe that this term is always null for the 1 d channel or shear flow i e with v n 0 at σ which is physically expected from the poiseuille or couette flow since the navier stokes convection term vanishes however this term is generally non zero for 2 d 3 d configurations with arbitrary flow directions 3 3 contribution of dupuit forchheimer s term let us consider dupuit forchheimer s quadratic term of eq 3 in ω f p first written as ρ k p f ϕ v v with f ϕ v v κ ϕ by applying the approximation lemma 1 of the generalized average in angot et al 2017 appendix b the integral of this term over the thickness of ω f p yields with the scaling d o k p 25 d 2 d 2 ρ k p f ϕ v v d z ρ d k p f ϕ v v σ o ρ v 2 d l and the error term can be neglected with respect to other terms in o ρ v 2 now still using the approximation lemma 1 we get 26 d f ϕ v d 2 d 2 v κ ϕ d z d v σ κ ϕ o κ ϕ v d 2 l let us define the positive tensor κ σ κ ϕ as the effective dupuit forchheimer s friction tensor at σ then by replacing 26 in eq 25 it gives still using the scaling d o 20 k p 27 d 2 d 2 ρ k p f ϕ v v d z ρ d k p v σ κ σ v σ o κ σ ρ v 2 d l and the error term can be still neglected hence the approximation up to o d l of the integral across ω f p of dupuit forchheimer s quadratic term in eq 3 reads 28 d 2 d 2 ρ k p f ϕ v v d z ρ d k p v σ κ σ v σ 3 4 contribution of a power law inertial term more generally let us now consider a power law inertial term of the form f q ϕ v q v with f q ϕ v q v q κ ϕ with any real number q 0 this term should be multiplied by a suitable quantity for dimensional reason to be included in eqs 3 and 4 instead of dupuit forchheimer s term corresponding to q 1 then using the same approximation procedure with lemma 1 we get 29 d 2 d 2 f q ϕ v q v d z v q σ κ σ v σ on σ the cubic inertial term for the weak inertia regime corresponds to the case q 2 4 the nonlinear interface model for inertial flow by incorporating the contributions of the inertial terms from eqs 24 and 28 in the asymptotic interface model 18 for the non inertial flow we summarize below the nonlinear asymptotic model governing the 2 d 3 d inertial flow at the interface by neglecting brinkman s viscous term in ω p within a suitable rescaling it suffices to formally take the limit when the effective viscosity μ p 0 inside ω p in the definition of the stress tensor 5 angot 2011 angot et al 2016 and thus the stress vector on the porous side of σ reduces to the normal pressure force 30 σ v p p n σ p p n indeed the coupled limit problem when μ 0 is rigorously proved by a vanishing viscosity method in angot 2011 or with a bkw asymptotic expansion to calculate the viscous boundary layer in angot et al 2016 from the stokes darcy brinkman problem to the stokes darcy problem we also refer to hernandez rodriguez et al 2020 for numerical investigations of the brinkman boundary layer with pore scale resolved simulations since we have the scaling d o 20 k p we introduce the dimensionless scalar or tensorial slip and friction coefficients at the interface 31 α σ k p d ϕ σ with ϕ σ 1 ϕ 1 ϕ h β σ d k p k σ 1 with k σ k ϕ h λ σ d k p κ σ with κ σ κ ϕ here ϕ σ denotes an effective surface porosity on σ whereas k σ is an effective surface permeability tensor on σ therefore the nonlinear interface model with a surface force f σ d ρ f on σ reads up to o d l 32 v n σ 0 σ v p n σ p σ n μ k p α σ v σ 1 2 ρ v n v f σ v p n σ μ k p β σ v σ ρ v σ λ σ v σ f σ on σ remark 2 obviously holds also as for 18 for the over determination of the set of interface conditions 32 remark 3 the case of σ non centered in ω f p for the sake of completeness let us recall from angot et al 2017 that when the dividing interface σ is chosen non centered inside ω f p i e for ξ 0 see fig 2 then all the mean quantities ψ σ in the interface conditions 18 or 32 must be replaced by their weighted counterpart ψ σ w defined by 33 ψ σ w ψ σ ξ ψ σ with 1 2 ξ 1 2 therefore two special cases can be discussed ξ 1 2 giving ψ σ w ψ σ f where σ is located at the top of the transition layer ω f p and ξ 1 2 giving ψ σ w ψ σ p when σ is at the bottom of ω f p see angot et al 2020 although the slip and friction coefficients should be estimated by experimental data or direct numerical simulations in ordered or random media the present theory also provides correlations with respect to the porosity ϕ p of the porous medium in ω p these functions are calculated hereafter for isotropic tensors β σ β σ i or λ σ λ σ i and depend on the scaling d d p chosen for the thickness of the transition layer ω f p d p o k p being the mean diameter of solid particles or fibres indeed we have chosen d o 10 d p to derive the macroscopic momentum equation 3 in ω f p now approximating the averaged quantities in eqs 31 by the trapezoidal rule which only includes the known values in ω f or ω p we get 34 α σ k p d ϕ 1 k p ϕ p 2 d 1 1 ϕ p β σ d 2 k p ϕ p λ σ d k p κ ϕ d κ ϕ p 2 k p ϕ p κ ϕ p β σ it is easy to verify that these coefficients satisfy the required coherency at the asymptotics when ϕ p 0 or ϕ p 1 in ω p the graphs of α σ and β σ for the scaling d 10 d p or d 10 d f are plotted in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively using either kozeny carman s correlation k p ϕ p for granular media carman 1937 macdonald et al 1991 or happel langmuir s one for fibrous materials happel 1959 jackson and james 1986 the graph of λ σ is plotted in fig 9 using also the correlation of ergun s coefficient κ ϕ p from macdonald et al 1979 remark 4 on the inertial friction coefficient λ σ it is remarkable that λ σ at the interface is related to the stress jump coefficient β σ as λ σ κ ϕ p β σ from 34 therefore the interface model for the inertial flow with ξ 0 i e σ being centered in ω f p only requires the surface coefficients α σ β σ needed for the non inertial flow and the ergun s coefficient κ ϕ p of the porous bulk ω p moreover by choosing the interface σ at the bottom of ω f p i e ξ 1 2 it appears from the forthcoming study angot et al 2020 that the interface conditions 32 degenerate to a generalized version of the stress jump condition of ochoa tapia and whitaker ochoa tapia and whitaker 1995a with velocity continuity v f v p on σ then the single friction coefficient β σ is only required to calibrate the interface model for the inertial flow 5 the mechanical energy balance and dissipation 5 1 energy balance for the fluid porous inertial flow let us now derive the energy balance of the resulting macroscale coupled model 1 2 4 in the domain ω ω f σ ω p i e the navier stokes and darcy forchheimer equations in ω f and ω p respectively supplemented by the interface model 32 on σ this will show that our model actually satisfies the energy theorem in mechanics at the macroscopic scale and that the conservation of kinetic energy holds without loss of generality we assume null boundary conditions v γ f 0 and v p n γ 0 at the external boundary γ of ω thus all the boundary integrals on γ will vanish with these homogeneous boundary conditions for the linear terms we follow the mathematical analysis made in angot 2018 see also angot 2010 2011 for the well posedness study of the fluid porous stokes darcy problem with the asymptotic interface conditions without inertia 16 and we include the contributions of all the nonlinear inertial terms to deal with the nonlinear terms it is more suitable to write the inertial term in the navier stokes equation with constant density ρ in ω f as 35 ρ v v ρ v v 1 2 ρ v 2 which introduces bernoulli s total pressure in the fluid ω f π f p f ρ v f 2 2 by taking l 2 scalar products of the motion equations with v in ω f and ω p respectively we use formally for sufficiently regular solutions standard integrations by parts and the boundary integrals on γ vanish with homogeneous boundary conditions as well as the integrals with divergence free velocity terms we have also the skew symmetry property 36 ω f ρ v f v f v f d x 0 using eqs 35 36 and v f 0 v γ f 0 we get with integration by parts 37 ω f ρ v f v f v f d x ω f 1 2 ρ v f 2 v f d x ω f 1 2 ρ v f 2 v f d x σ 1 2 ρ v f 2 v f n d s ρ 2 σ v f 2 v n d s hence the contribution of the navier stokes inertial term in ω f only involves the kinetic energy on σ from bernoulli s pressure then we follow the previous works angot 2010 2011 2018 for the mathematical analysis of the fluid porous flow without inertia using now the inertial interface conditions 32 instead of 18 we get after standard integrations by parts the following energy balance 38 μ ω f v f 2 d x μ ω p k p 1 v p v p d x ρ k p ω p v p κ ϕ v p v p d x μ k p σ α σ v τ σ 2 d s μ k p σ β σ v σ v σ d s j σ ω ρ f v d x σ f σ v σ d s where the energy quantity j σ gathers all the contributions of the nonlinear navier stokes and forchheimer inertial terms from the third interface condition in 32 on σ and also includes the term 37 therefore we have j σ ρ σ v σ λ σ v σ v σ d s ρ 2 σ v n v f v σ d s ρ 2 σ v f 2 v n d s by combining the last two terms using the definition of v σ from 14 the quantity j σ finally reads 39 j σ ρ σ v σ λ σ v σ v σ d s ρ 4 σ v f 2 v f v p v n d s let us notice that the first term in the right hand side of 39 is always positive whereas the second one is of arbitrary sign or vanishes if v p v f on σ i e when there is no jump of velocity at the interface 5 2 global dissipation of the coupled fluid porous model now we can prove the following result in appendix c theorem 1 sufficient condition for dissipation if the condition λ σ 1 holds then we have j σ 0 and hence the global dissipation of the present model holds this is at least satisfied within the porosity range of validity of the present navier stokes darcy forchheimer macroscale model 1 2 4 32 i e 0 ϕ p 0 95 as shown in fig 10 and fig 11 for a zoom indeed introducing the ratio r v f σ v p σ 1 we recall that saffman s approximation saffman 1971 assuming v p τ v f τ at the interface is generally not valid as soon as the porosity is large enough thus only the condition r 1 clearly holds but we do not have in general r 1 then it appears after calculations detailed in appendix c that a simple sufficient condition to get j σ 0 reads 40 a λ σ r 2 1 2 r 0 for any r 1 then from 40 it follows the final sufficient condition for global dissipation 41 λ σ 1 a r 2 1 2 r r 1 2 0 j σ 0 as shown in figs 10 and 11 the condition λ σ 1 is clearly satisfied for the correlation of ergun s coefficient κ ϕ p given by ergun 1952 macdonald et al 1979 but it also holds for other correlations like papathanasiou et al 2001 lasseux et al 2011 at least within the porosity range ϕ p 0 95 of validity of the present navier stokes darcy forchheimer model thus we have always j σ 0 with ϕ p 0 95 which means that all the nonlinear terms at the interface have always a positive contribution to the dissipation of kinetic energy in the whole system ω since all the other terms in the left hand side of eq 38 are also positive we conclude that the present navier stokes darcy forchheimer model is globally dissipative which assesses its stability and physical relevance 5 5 with the present theory and with no inertia at all in the porous region ω p it does not seem possible to get the global dissipation with no restriction on the size of the data indeed considering only the navier stokes darcy problem as made by some authors would give λ σ 0 this does not enable us to control the kinetic energy at the interface σ with the present interface conditions at ξ 0 nor discarding the first nonlinear term ρ v n v f 2 in 32 to get interface conditions that become then only linear moreover the condition j σ 0 is also a strong argument to mathematically prove the global existence of weak solutions to this nonlinear flow model in 3 d with no restriction on the size of the data remark 5 generalization for porosities ϕ p 0 95 the present interface model 32 its derivation and analysis of global dissipation can be extended with some modifications to larger porosities ϕ p 95 of the permeable medium ω p e g for fibrous porous media in that case considering now the navier brinkman forchheimer equation 9 in ω p the navier stokes navier brinkman forchheimer model must be used for the free fluid and porous medium coupling together with a suitable modification of the interface conditions 32 on σ then the jump of velocity v σ on the interface is small and can be neglected thus we have v p v f on σ and the second term in the right hand side of 39 vanishes therefore we get j σ 0 and the global dissipation of the navier stokes navier brinkman forchheimer model is also ensured that is detailed in a forthcoming paper angot et al 2021 6 conclusion let us emphasize that the physically meaningful nonlinear interface model in the set of equations 32 34 is quite original since to our knowledge there exists in the literature no other multi dimensional nonlinear macroscale model for the inertial flow with arbitrary flow directions over a permeable medium moreover this clearly opens new perspectives to study turbulent flows at the fluid porous interface declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a approximation result the key practical result which is used several times in this study reads as follows the proof is given in angot et al 2017 appendix b lemma 1 approximations of generalized average let the function ψ d 2 d 2 r be continuously differentiable and the function w d 2 d 2 r be lebesgue integrable then we have d 2 d 2 w x ψ x d x w d 2 d 2 ψ x d x o w ψ d 2 d w ψ σ o w ψ d 2 appendix b different κ ϕ correlations for ergun s coefficient here we summarize various widely used κ ϕ correlations for ergun s coefficient of dupuit forchheimer s inertial resistance force most of the correlations are phenomenological and have been deduced from experiments recently a few of them have been obtained using numerical simulations correlation by ergun 1952 based on an implicit model of packed spheres b 1 κ ϕ 1 75 1 ϕ 1 2 ϕ 3 correlation by irmay 1958 three dimensional viscous flow in the tortuous channels of the medium composed by spherical grains b 2 κ ϕ 0 045 ϕ 3 2 correlation by macdonald et al 1979 macdonald et al 1979 theoretical and experimental data with solid spheres b 3 κ ϕ 1 80 1 ϕ 1 2 ϕ 3 correlation by papathanasiou et al 2001 computational evaluations b 4 κ ϕ 0 08 1 ϕ ϕ correlation by lasseux et al 2011 numerical simulations b 5 κ ϕ 0 12 1 ϕ 0 38 ϕ 2 04 for 0 3 ϕ 0 75 appendix c proof of theorem 1 the strategy is to get a non negative lower bound of j σ given in 39 for sake of clarity we consider the case of the isotropic tensor λ σ λ σ i with the scalar coefficient λ σ 0 the general case of a symmetric positive definite tensor λ σ will easily follow by considering the classical minoration from rayleigh s quotient λ σ v v λ m i n v 2 for all v r 3 where λ min 0 is the minimum eigenvalue of the matrix λ σ then the result below holds using λ min instead of λ σ further from 39 we have the splitting below c 1 j σ j 1 j 2 with j 1 ρ σ v σ λ σ v σ v σ d s 0 j 2 ρ 4 σ v f 2 v f v p v n d s now the key idea is to introduce the ratio c 2 r v f σ v p σ 1 on σ we recall that saffman s approximation saffman 1971 assuming v p τ v f τ at the interface is generally not valid as soon as the porosity is large enough thus only the condition r 1 clearly holds since v p τ v f τ and also v f n v p n v n on σ but we do not have in general r 1 then from one side using the definition of the arithmetic mean on σ from 14 we have successively j 1 ρ σ v σ λ σ v σ 2 d s ρ 8 σ λ σ v f v p v f v p 2 d s ρ 8 σ λ σ v f v p v f 2 v p 2 2 v f v p d s ρ 8 σ v p 3 λ σ r 1 r 2 1 2 v f v p v p 2 d s since v f v p 0 on σ we get the minoration of j 1 c 3 j 1 ρ 8 σ v p 3 λ σ r 1 r 2 1 d s from another side with the cauchy schwarz inequality we have the majoration of j 2 c 4 j 2 ρ 4 σ v f 2 v f v p v n d s ρ 4 σ v p 3 r 2 r d s ρ 8 σ v p 3 2 r r 1 d s combining c 3 and c 4 we get the minoration of j σ below c 5 j σ j 1 j 2 ρ 8 σ v p 3 r 1 λ σ r 2 1 2 r d s then it appears that a simple sufficient condition to get j σ 0 reads c 6 a λ σ r 2 1 2 r 0 i e λ σ 2 r r 2 1 for any r 1 since we have 0 2 r r 2 1 1 for all r 1 the sufficient condition c 6 is equivalent to the condition below c 7 λ σ 1 this ends the proof
