1940,compared with traditional methods based on non visual devices the water level measurement method based on computer vision has the advantages of low equipment installation and maintenance cost convenient visualization and so on however the complex condition of the monitoring site such as different weather lighting water quality staff gauge appearance camera imaging etc pose significant challenges to the existing computer vision method which can cope with specific situations but often cannot be universal we propose a robust water level measurement method to overcome this problem firstly we introduce a mapping method which preprocesses the original image s extended region of interest eroi to obtain the transformed image the region of interest roi here refers to the staff gauge region and the extended means taking advantage of the contextual information secondly we construct a high resolution representation deep learning regression model for water line positioning in the transformed image then we trained the model with a robust data augmentation method consisting of two submethods appearance based data augmentation ada and random extension in the direction red finally we did a series of experiments and analyses on the widely distributed test dataset we built with two groups of criteria to evaluate the results which are normalized since the data set contains samples of different scales the result of this study is significantly improved compared with other computer vision methods it shows that this study has robustness in various environments and has vast promotion value and application potential keywords water level measurement computer vision image transformation high resolution representation deep learning regression robust data augmentation 1 introduction the water level is one of the most basic hydrological factors in rivers lakes and reservoirs an all weather real time automatic and accurate water level measurement system is of great significance in improving the level of flood control and drought relief and daily supervision field manual measurement is laborious and cannot realize real time measurement water level surveyors often cannot rush to the site immediately especially if the site is far from towns some areas are unsuitable for on site measurements by water level surveyors such as flood and polluted water environments xu 1999 muste et al 2011 noto et al 2021 therefore centralized remote water level management based on automatic water level measurement and reporting devices is more common than on site measurement existing automatic water level measurement devices generally include float type pressure type ultrasonic type radar type etc according to specific application scenarios however in practical application these methods are easily restricted by external factors such as water quality temperature and sediment concentration resulting in limitations in use installation and daily maintenance zheng et al 2010 chetpattananondh et al 2014 zhang et al 2019a b float type gauges usually require the construction of a logging chamber which is costly pressure type sensors need to be deep in water and the measurement accuracy is easily affected by the content of impurities and sand in water the ambient temperature affects ultrasonic type gauges and the measuring accuracy is limited in an extensive range radar type equipment is relatively expensive to install and maintain with the increase in the number of water level monitoring sites the installation and maintenance costs are essential to consider in practical applications remote monitoring with a camera transmitting the images to the center through the internet is a common visualization method the camera can observe the surrounding environment of the water area and regularly measure the water level manually in particular when the water level device measures the abnormal value the observer can immediately confirm and respond to the situation in the centralized hydrological monitoring and management scenario video monitoring equipment almost becomes necessary for water level monitoring sites they provided a basis for measurement based on computer vision to replace traditional non visual measurement devices computer vision technology has been rapidly developed in recent years and applied in various fields research on hydrology technology based on artificial intelligence has also become a hot spot vetra carvalho et al 2020 tauro et al 2014 perks et al 2016 pearce et al 2020 and research on methods related to water level measurement has also attracted more and more attention a method based on computer vision can be directly integrated into the camera with a computing power chip to analyze real time images or deployed to the cloud server etter et al 2020 luffman and connors 2022 then the analysis results of water level measurement at each site in the jurisdiction area are sent and summarized to the management center in real time compared to additional installation and maintenance of non visual measurement devices methods based on computer vision have the advantages of being highly integrated non contact with no temperature drift and conversion error can significantly reduce costs and improve efficiency noto et al 2021 zhang et al 2019a b however in practical applications computer vision algorithms face complex situations such as images varying from place to place and time to time adapting to various conditions to obtain more reliable measurements is one of the challenges in the field in recent years many scholars have carried out research in this field some use semantic segmentation to obtain water regions moy de vitry et al 2019 yu et al 2020 vandaele et al 2021 still these methods generally only work when the water surface has changed significantly and cannot obtain accurate water level measurement results it is more common is observing water levels using references such as a staff gauge usually the camera axis is not perpendicular to the staff gauge in addition under different environmental conditions the distance between the camera and the staff gauge is different and the measuring range and size of the staff gauge are diverse so according to the perspective principle the staff gauge is imaged by the camera as an irregular quadrilateral the pixel spacing of each position in the image is inconsistent and there is a lot of background interference increasing the difficulty of the algorithm design image transformation and cropping is a common preprocessing method zhang et al 2019a b gilmore et al 2013 nguyen et al 2009 fleury et al 2020 to focus on the region of interest roi and get a normalized transformed image for a camera with a fixed position in the real world the surface of the staff gauge generally approximates a plane which satisfies a definite spatial mapping relationship with the staff gauge in the original camera image the existing methods usually calculate the transfer matrix of the mapping relationship and cut out the roi to obtain a transformed image directly however they lose the original image s contextual information another critical question of the water level measurement method is how to position the water line accurately in the transformed image the water line is the boundary position between the staff gauge and the water area one idea is to use an image processing operator to extract image features such as the canny operator bharti et al 2022 soble operator yang et al 2014 etc and then distinguish the features of the staff gauge and water zhang et al 2019a b zhen et al 2019 sun et al 2014 however the image features vary due to changes in time weather season and other natural factors in addition environmental factors such as shadows generated by building structures rolling waves transparent water water with different colors etc make the extraction results of basic features more complex and unreliable these factors result in gross errors infrared imaging was used to try to alleviate the lighting problem zhang et al 2019a b but it further limits the use conditions and does not solve problems caused by factors other than lighting some high level semantic feature extraction methods are applied to water level measurement to overcome the instability of low level features for example the template matching method is used to obtain the staff gauge area lin et al 2013 bruinink et al 2015 and the deep learning method to detect characters qiao et al 2022 these methods attempt to locate particular sign regions and use postprocessing logic to predict the water line position however these methods may fail when the appearance of the staff gauge or water changes such as perspective reflection occlusion wear etc fleury et al proposed a deep learning regression method fleury et al 2020 which crops out the roi image after preprocessing and uses a deep learning model to get the water line position however not only does the cropped roi region lose surrounding contextual information but their model structure cannot guarantee stable positioning results as described in the paper fleury et al 2020 the effect of its method would be different under some unusual environmental conditions such as various water level values weather and season in summary the existing computer vision methods can achieve good results under specific conditions however they were challenged by different realistic factors this paper proposes a robust water level measurement method to cope with these problems the final experimental results show that this study is more robust for deployment and application under different environmental conditions 2 materials and methods this chapter elaborates on the proposed method in detail fig 1 section 2 1 introduces the extended region of interest eroi with contextual information to obtain a normalized rectangular transformed image section 2 2 presents the water line positioning method which involves a deep learning regression model structure that inputs the transformed image and outputs the location result to further improve the model s generalization ability section 2 3 introduces a set of training data augmentation methods then the water line positioning result is converted to the real world in section 2 4 to get the actual water level measurement results finally we give the evaluation criteria 2 1 extended region of interest image transformation 2 1 1 homography transformation the measuring range of the staff gauge the relative angle and the camera s distance differ significantly at different sites and there is a lot of background interference in the image it is necessary to transform and normalize the images first according to the technical principles related to machine vision the plane approximated by the staff gauge satisfies the mapping of the homography relationship eq 1 between the world coordinate and the camera coordinate system dubrofsky 2009 agarwal et al 2005 1 x i y i w t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 t 6 t 7 t 8 t 9 x i y i 1 t x i y i 1 x i x i w y i y i w x i y i is the point coordinate of the original image from the camera x i y i is the corresponding point coordinate on the transformed image we want to get and w is the scaling factor the homography transformation matrix t matrix defines the mapping relationship between the camera plane and the transformed image coordinate system the following subsection 2 1 2 describes obtaining the t matrix in water level measurement 2 1 2 generate transformed images with contextual information before solving the t matrix let s once again explicitly define the three spatial coordinate systems table 1 lists corresponding coordinate system names and symbols the original coordinate system defines the space of the original image fig 2 a the transformed coordinate system defines the corresponding transformed image space fig 2b and c the real world coordinate system is specified on the real staff gauge plane fig 2a which takes the corner point of the staff gauge as the origin and the horizontal and vertical directions as the coordinate axes the subscript i indicates the different position to solve t matrix x i y i need to be calibrated on the original image fig 2a usually selecting the intersection point of the left and right boundary and the water scale line in the original image because such points can directly read the coordinates u i v i on the corresponding staff gauge in the real world coordinate system without additional operation for example the intersection point between the scale line with a height of 20 cm and the left boundary of the staff gauge corresponds to u i v i 0 c m 20 c m in the real world coordinate system directly so we get the mapping x i y i u i v i further we need to get the mapping u i v i x i y i when the staff gauge in the real world size is w h and the corresponding size in the transformed image is w h the horizontal and vertical pixel spacing of the transformed image can be calculated as s x w w and s y h h when the origin of the real world coordinate system fig 2b corresponds to the origin of the transformed image coordinate system there is x i y i u i s x v i s y however contextual information is essential for the computer vision method for example when a staff gauge is placed on a wall it can be an additional reference and when the staff gauge is set independently on the water the background may reflect the color of the water etc therefore we extend x o pixels left and right in the horizontal direction to obtain the extended region of interest eroi we rewrite the mapping formula as x i y i x o u i s x v i s y and the size of the transformed image is w 2 x o h fig 3 shows the transformed image using eroi or not the t matrix to be solved has 8 degrees of freedom t 1 t 2 t 8 under the constraint t 9 1 for a camera we can select several points in the original image before application and get the mapping relationship x i y i u i v i x i y i i 1 2 n as mentioned above when n 4 and the point mapping relationships are not completely collinear the least squares solution of the t matrix eq 1 can be obtained agarwal et al 2005 dubrofsky 2009 then the transformed positive rectangle image is obtained by interpolating the pixel values in the eroi of the original image fig 2c because once the equipment and staff gauge are installed firmly the relative position is determined and the t matrix will not change in the subsequent processing so each camera only needs to implement this process once to save the t matrix and realize the transformation process of all images in the following time 2 2 high resolution representation model for water line position 2 2 1 model structure the computer vision method based on deep learning has achieved excellent results in object detection classification segmentation and key point identification in images to cope with the complexity of the water level measurement we construct a deep learning regression model to locate the water line in the transformed image where the water line is the boundary between the staff gauge and the water area because the water line position may appear at any height in the transformed image and has high precision requirements the model extracting spatial features and identifying ability is essential the high resolution feature extraction network hrnet sun et al 2019a was first proposed for image human pose recognition compared with other network structures the backbone of the network structure can extract features at various spatial scales its excellent ability for information extraction and spatial representation makes it widely used in various computer vision tasks sun et al 2019b based on this network as a backbone we added a simple structure head part to fuse the features extracted from the backbone at multiple scales and then completed the regression task the input of the model is the transformed image with three channels considering the limitation of computation in practical applications we take the lightweight network hrnetw18 and its smaller version as the network backbone for subsequent research in the head part we use convolution blocks to fuse multiple branch information and then use the full connection fc layer as a regressor to obtain the model output the ground truth of the water line position corresponding to the input transformed image supervised the model output fig 4 to be more specific about the model structure we present the details of each structure table 2 n modules n branchs n blocks and n chanels indicate the number of repeated concatenations of the module the number of branches in the current stage the number of blocks in each branch and the number of convolution kernel channels in each block respectively in the backbone the number of channels in each branch is constant but different in the head the different specifications in the small version are noted in parentheses 2 2 2 training methodology regression is commonly used in data fitting and prediction tasks l 1 loss and l 2 loss are often used to supervise the training process yang et al 2019 however in practical application even when the error is minimal the derivative of l 1 loss is constant and cannot be differentiated close to 0 resulting in low solving efficiency l 2 loss produces a significant loss because of its squared operation when there is a sample outlier and the training is more sensitive and unstable due to gradient explosion smoothl 1 lose eq 2 was proposed in faster rcnn ren et al 2015 for object detection tasks 2 smooth l 1 0 5 e 2 e 1 e 0 5 e 1 o r e 1 e is the error between the ground truth l and the model output l which formula is e l l smoothl 1 lose combines the advantage of both methods to ensure continuous differentiable and training stability so we chose this regularization method to deal with the regression tasks the deep learning model in this study and its comparison all use the same training method regarding training resources we used an nvidia v100 graphics card whose graphics memory is 32g and theoretical performance is 14 13 tflops during the training we used a batch size of 32 and the method of adam as the optimizer iterate over 200 epochs at an initial learning rate of 0 01 the learning rate decreases by 0 1 times per 50 epochs model params are pre trained on the imagenet krizhevsky et al 2017 the training process was stable and convergent under this set of hyperparameters and the subsequent experiments used this set of parameters the model was trained using a set of data augmentation methods described in section 2 3 2 3 robust data augmentation method in general the environment of actual hydrological scenarios is very complex not only does the environment of different water level monitoring sites vary greatly but also it takes a long time for changes in the same site to be reflected including a series of external factors such as natural light and weather we hope the model can output accurate results without bias under any conditions however training with biased data hardly guarantees results in unusual cases thus we propose a robust augmentation method for the water line positioning model s training phase to overcome these problems it consists of two submethods fig 5 appearance based data augmentation ada and random extension in the direction red the detailed process is presented in sections 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 2 3 1 appearance based data augmentation the collected data set can hardly contain all appearance conditions resulting in the model overfitting the appearance conditions specified by the training set a series of data augmentations for appearance are adopted to simulate transformed images under different appearance conditions table 3 training with horizontal flipping and horizontal cropping can improve the model s generalization ability to the appearance change for example the direction of light in the morning and evening is opposite the jittering of brightness hue and saturation can improve the generalization ability of the image style for example atmospheric scattering makes light bluer and sunsets make light yellower and cloudy or rainy days make light darker cameras typically use infrared fill light at night producing gray images in addition the unnatural light leads to changes in the image and the color of the water is different at each site fig 7 and fig 9 2 3 2 random extension in the direction there is a strong correlation between the regression ability and the training set s distribution of ground truth values nibali et al 2018 the unbalanced distribution of ground truth values will lead to biased model output results which prefer to output an average water level because collecting samples at rare heights of positions is complex to overcome the problem we propose a new data augmentation method of random extension in the direction red which is only used in training and transforms the ground truth distribution into a uniform distribution fig 6 the method is plug and play without additional calculation costs for each training image i and ground truth l we first randomly generate a water line position l with uniform distributed probability fig 6a if l l redundant components need to be cut out in the staff gauge part of the image while the water part needs to be expanded the expansion adopts reflecting to ensure that the image obtained after splicing is natural the reflecting takes the image boundary as the axis and fills the extended area symmetrically fig 6c d the new transformed image is recorded as i when l l reverse operations are performed in the area of staff gauge and water based on this data augmentation method the model with almost no bias output can be trained under data set with any ground truth distribution 2 4 convert to the actual water level when the water line is positioned on the transformed image the actual water level in the real world can be calculated by eq 3 3 l actual l base l s y l is the model s output estimates the vertical coordinates of the water line on the transformed image s y is the vertical pixel spacing of the transformed image mentioned in section 2 1 whose unit is pixel m e t r e l base represents the baseline which is the actual water level height corresponding to the 0 scales of the staff gauge 2 5 evaluation criteria we used two group evaluation criteria to verify this study s validity the first one is the indicators of the regression another one is the proportion that meets the applicable standard since the measuring range of the staff gauge at each site is different the measuring indexes in this paper are all based on normalized output for the convenience of analysis 2 5 1 mae rmse and r2 in regression tasks common evaluation indicators include mae r m s e and r 2 eq 4 4 mae 1 n i 1 n l i l i r m s e 1 n i 1 n l i l i 2 r 2 1 i 1 n l i l i 2 i 1 n l i l 2 n is the number of samples in the test set l is the sample ground truth l is the water level output and l is the mean value of all ground truths of the dataset the subscript i represents the different samples 2 5 2 accuracy in the case below the error threshold we set an error threshold t when the error is less than t the measurement is correct otherwise it is wrong the measurement accuracy on the test set is defined as eq 5 5 t t l l t a c c t n t t n t t is the correct sample n t t is the number of correct samples and n is the total number of samples in the test dataset according to the needs of different scenarios we set the threshold t as 1 2 5 and 10 respectively 3 results 3 1 data set to objectively reflect the effect we collected data sets from public sources such as public websites and field observation sites 3 1 1 image data set first we created an image data set for basic training and validation fig 7 to ensure the data set diversity and reduce the distribution bias caused by many images in some specific sites only one image was sampled at each site we confirm that the training and test data sets are heterogeneous containing 760 training images and 995 test images to handle the different ranges of staff gauges in each site we convert all the original images in the datasets into a normalized transformed image using preprocess mentioned in section 2 1 since both the preprocessing in section 2 1 and the postprocessing in section 2 4 are deterministic linear operations therefore the model s output on the transformed image can directly reflect the effect of the whole system for the labeling the boundary between the staff gauge and the water area is first marked for each image then the median value of water level height under different horizontal coordinates is taken as the ground truth value of the water level to reduce the influence of ripples waves and other factors fig 8 in addition to the typical samples this data set has some exceptional cases such as high and shallow water levels dark lighting infrared imaging and blurred imaging quality fig 9 3 1 2 sequential data sets to illustrate the effect of this study in actual hydrological scenarios we collected three sequential data sets table 4 site a and c are from actual observation stations and site b is from an open source data set tsai and cheng 2020 originally used to classify hazardous water conditions we selected a sub sequential whose staff gauge is visible these sequences contain a wealth of environmental variations with color images during the day and infrared images at night for each site fig 10 the labeling operation for the sequential data is roughly consistent with the image data set the difference is that since the device collecting the sequence is fixed only the position of the staff gauge in the first frame is calibrated and the calibrated information is used in the subsequent sequence without repeated calibration 3 2 ablation experiment an ablation experiment typically refers to changing or removing some submethod and seeing how that affects performance to illustrate the effectiveness of each part of this study we performed ablation experiments with the image data set image input size affects application results we trained a group of models with different image sizes and compared the results table 5 if the input size is small such as 320 32 the image details are lost and the result will be poor a larger image size like 960 96 will linearly increase the computation and the model training difficulty because it needs to be solved in a larger space and its results are not significantly better therefore 640 64 was selected as the input size for subsequent experiments resnet he et al 2016 is a classical model structure so we selected resnet18 and resnet34 which with a similar amount of computation as our method to compare with our model structure mentioned in section 2 2 table 6 lists the results of different models and submethods applied in the water line positioning task eroi represents the extended region of interest proposed in section 2 1 ada and red represent appearance based data augmentation and random extension in the direction respectively as mentioned in section 2 3 to illustrate the model efficiency we also listed each model s number of parameters and computation table 7 other training related hyperparameters of each model are consistent as subsection 2 2 2 compared with resnet backbones this study achieves higher accuracy with the approximate amount of computation table 6 and table 7 the result proves that our model is more suitable for water level measurement tasks the backbone can be selected according to real time and precision requirements in practical applications training using eroi can obtain better results than without extension table 6 it means that the introduction of contextual information can better assist in determining the location of the water line by comparing each model s eroi and eroi ada results we can see that appearance based data augmentation improves the generalization ability of appearance each evaluation index is improved compared with no use of ada the accuracy was further improved by using red fig 11 to illustrate the effectiveness of red in countering model output bias affected by the training dataset and we performed further analysis according to the training data set ground truth normalized height distribution fig 9a most training set samples are concentrated near the median value the number of extraordinary water levels such as the high water level 0 0 0 2 subset or shallow water level 0 8 1 0 subset is small we calculate the correlation between the acc 2 and the number of training sets eq 6 6 c o r r a n i 1 s a i a n i n i 1 s a i a 2 n i n 2 a is sequence consists of the acc 2 of the test subset and n is sequence consists of the training subset s sample numbers a and n is their mean value subscript i is index number of the data set and s is num of subset in this case s 5 the correlation coefficient between the accuracy results and the number of training sets before using red is 0 7726 with a strong correlation between them however after using red the correlation coefficient is 0 0713 with little linear correlation we conclude that red can effectively overcome the model bias caused by training data distribution 3 3 comparisons with other methods we compare the other three methods results including two traditional feature extraction and one deep learning method otsu is a feature method based on the image s gray level while mdf integrates edge and gray level features zhen et al 2019 and the method fleury et al 2020 uses a deep learning regression model with a straight chain 19 layer model structure we reproduce the comparison methods and adjust the parameters appropriately without changing the principle so that these methods can achieve better indicators in more complex scenarios the input image size of each method is consistent with that of the original paper the results table 8 show that this study has significantly higher accuracy than others we showed visualizations to compare the differences between other methods and this study fig 12 besides the original images and results we offer the visualizations of traditional operator image processing and use grad cam selvaraju et al 2017 to visualize deep learning features to explain how a semantic feature obtains from a cnn model layer contributes to the final result grad cam uses gradient information that flows into the cnn model s last convolution layer as essential values of each neuron then the grad cam is obtained by weighing the essential values of different feature channels selvaraju et al 2017 we show it with pseudo color with warm and cool colors representing larger and smaller values respectively in the site where each method is applicable fig 12a the texture is clear the environment is simple and there is no obvious noise in the staff gauge and water area when the brightness of the staff gauge is close to that of the water fig 12b the otsu method cannot get an accurate result when there is a slight perspective below the water line some texture features and brightness features can be seen affecting other methods judgment of the water line position when the water level is high the reflection is clear and the characteristics of the staff gauge are few fig 12d other methods that pay more attention to the features of the staff gauge are ineffective when the surface of the staff gauge is heavily rusted and texture features are hard to recognize fig 12e the expanded part can supplement more information to deal with this situation when floating objects block the surface of the water fig 12f all the comparison methods except this study get the wrong results where there is a splash of waves near the staff gauge fig 12g the other three methods fail this study improves adaptability when the staff gauge is rich in color fig 12h the above visualization results show that this study is very well adapted to complex situations that other methods cannot the traditional feature extraction method is effective in specific cases but will produce errors when encountering different staff gauge appearances and environments the deep learning methods can automatically extract semantic features for measurement through training the grad cam results show that the method in fleury et al 2020 focuses on the staff gauge and infers the water line position however this is susceptible to changes in the environment s appearance this study paid attention to the water and water line apart from the staff gauge in addition contextual information helps water line positioning especially when the water line is not obvious in the image in summary our method has better robustness than the existing methods 3 4 measured results of the sequential data sets to verify the result of this study in actual hydrological observation sequence data sets as subsection 3 1 2 are used for testing we list the normalized statistical indicators table 9 this study achieves good results in sites a and b in site c under relatively loose standards such as acc 5 and acc 10 this study can achieve high accuracy but under strict standards such as acc 1 and acc 2 the accuracy is relatively low it has good robustness in most cases but there are some errors in some periods of site c which leads to a low index under the strictest standard fig 13 a gross error which we mark with the green circle it is because there is an occlusion in front of the camera fig 10k in addition the measurement results of site c are not stable especially the period marked with the red circle the camera in this location is not installed stable causing wobble fig 10 there is a height drop in the top position of different frames fig 10a b we will discuss the effects of wobble further in the following chapter 4 other instability factors such as imaging illumination weather water reflection ripples and floats can be overcome by this study to sum up this study can obtain ideal results in most hydrological water level measurement tasks 4 discussion we propose a robust water level measurement method to solve the problem that the existing computer vision methods are unstable our data set is diverse and the training and testing samples are heterogeneous the analysis in chapter 3 shows that the robust method proposed by us has achieved outstanding results compared with the traditional feature extraction operator method this study does not need to redesign and adjust the algorithm compared to other deep learning methods this study can migrate fine tuning the model by collecting a small amount of data rather than spending much effort to cover all environmental changes this study is closer to achieving all weather robust and accurate measurements in most scenarios compared with traditional methods such as float type this study has some advantages such as being more conducive to maintenance cost reduction etc however we must admit that compared with the stable operating devices this study may have errors in some scenes such as waves fig 12g the model result needs further improvement on the one hand improving the model s generalization ability needs continuous research on the other hand further data collection and training to cover more complex environmental conditions are also required one concern is that the deep learning model in this study is based on supervised training and a data set needs to be prepared in advance collecting samples is difficult in some cases such as remote sites without access to the network and ground truths labeling also takes a few human resources it may be a helpful research direction to obtain more diversified training data by sample synthesis or simulation before use the equipment shall be calibrated as described in subsection 2 1 2 although this process only needs to be configured once after the camera is set up in a practical application it isn t easy to complete calibration automatically because the staff gauge style is hardly predictable if the characteristics of the staff gauges are consistent and have the same appearance or scale elements an algorithm module can be added for automatic calibration and application in addition if the manual calibration is not accurate it may lead to more errors in the final measurement results therefore it is necessary to ensure the accuracy of the stage as much as possible the number of calibrated points can be increased to ensure accuracy because the t matrix is solved by least squares agarwal et al 2005 dubrofsky 2009 another limitation of this study is the samples collected had a staff gauge the cases where there was no staff gauge or the water level was beyond the measuring range were not discussed for the time being we believe this study can be used in a broader range of cases for example some hydrological signs buildings and other known elevations are used as references to complete the conversion from the original image to the transformed image in section 2 1 to achieve measurement as mentioned in section 3 3 our model also focuses on the water and the water line therefore we reasoned that this kind of scene could also realize the positioning of the water line after training we will collect more test data to verify the site without a staff gauge in this study the stability of the image is a basic premise when the image is shaken there may be output errors to more clearly explore the impact of camera wobble on the computer vision method we try to calculate its uncertainty according to the central limit theorem loève 2017 the camera jitter offset over a long period is approximately normally distributed therefore eq 7 can be used to estimate variance and uncertainty meyer 2007 based on samples the uncertainty is due to random error and it is a measure of the quality of the result the smaller the uncertainty the higher the quality of the measurement results conversely the lower the quality of the measurement results 7 s x 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 2 u 95 2 s s x is the sample standard deviation u 95 means that about 95 of the cases can be covered within two standard deviations we calibrated the position of each frame of the staff gauge in the sequence data set in subsection 3 1 2 and the normalized uncertainties due to the wobble of three sites are 0 0021 0 0125 and 0 0222 respectively the instability will directly lead to increased measurement errors like site c therefore before using this study it is necessary to ensure the image is as stable as possible to reduce this uncertainty this study can also combine with more camera functions in different environments such as anti shaking or image based registration maybe a supplementary scheme this study may fail when environmental factors cause the inability to see the image or visual field loss thus some extreme cases such as when the lens is prone to dust or rain cover require hardware such as wipers and a camera with auxiliary infrared light is a good choice for night scenes in addition this study can be extended to other measuring machine vision intelligence applications to measure different signs or targets with relatively large application potential 5 conclusions we have put forward a new water level measurement approach in this paper this study has the advantages of remote visualization easy installation and maintenance and low cost firstly we obtain the transformed images based on homography transformation and contextual information is introduced then a deep learning model structure for water line positioning is built to process the transformed image the structure has the backbone of high resolution representation and a head of the regression we identified the advantages of our proposed model structure from the experimental results because the model structure can maintain high resolution and relatively strong multi scale and feature fusion ability next we propose robust data augmentation methods for model training that can greatly improve the model s generalization the appearance based data augmentation can cover more environmental changes and the random extension in the direction can overcome the problem of uneven distribution of water level values finally we did a series of experiments and analyses on the image and sequential datasets we built the experimental results show that this study is more robust and has significant advantages in dealing with more complex applications than other computer vision methods in the actual water level measurement task this study can overcome most of the interference conditions and meet the requirements of hydrology measurement some issues still need to be further explored such as improving the algorithm s accuracy reducing the workload brought by image collection and labeling reducing the impact of camera instability through registration validation in the absence of staff gauges and studying other measurement applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
1940,compared with traditional methods based on non visual devices the water level measurement method based on computer vision has the advantages of low equipment installation and maintenance cost convenient visualization and so on however the complex condition of the monitoring site such as different weather lighting water quality staff gauge appearance camera imaging etc pose significant challenges to the existing computer vision method which can cope with specific situations but often cannot be universal we propose a robust water level measurement method to overcome this problem firstly we introduce a mapping method which preprocesses the original image s extended region of interest eroi to obtain the transformed image the region of interest roi here refers to the staff gauge region and the extended means taking advantage of the contextual information secondly we construct a high resolution representation deep learning regression model for water line positioning in the transformed image then we trained the model with a robust data augmentation method consisting of two submethods appearance based data augmentation ada and random extension in the direction red finally we did a series of experiments and analyses on the widely distributed test dataset we built with two groups of criteria to evaluate the results which are normalized since the data set contains samples of different scales the result of this study is significantly improved compared with other computer vision methods it shows that this study has robustness in various environments and has vast promotion value and application potential keywords water level measurement computer vision image transformation high resolution representation deep learning regression robust data augmentation 1 introduction the water level is one of the most basic hydrological factors in rivers lakes and reservoirs an all weather real time automatic and accurate water level measurement system is of great significance in improving the level of flood control and drought relief and daily supervision field manual measurement is laborious and cannot realize real time measurement water level surveyors often cannot rush to the site immediately especially if the site is far from towns some areas are unsuitable for on site measurements by water level surveyors such as flood and polluted water environments xu 1999 muste et al 2011 noto et al 2021 therefore centralized remote water level management based on automatic water level measurement and reporting devices is more common than on site measurement existing automatic water level measurement devices generally include float type pressure type ultrasonic type radar type etc according to specific application scenarios however in practical application these methods are easily restricted by external factors such as water quality temperature and sediment concentration resulting in limitations in use installation and daily maintenance zheng et al 2010 chetpattananondh et al 2014 zhang et al 2019a b float type gauges usually require the construction of a logging chamber which is costly pressure type sensors need to be deep in water and the measurement accuracy is easily affected by the content of impurities and sand in water the ambient temperature affects ultrasonic type gauges and the measuring accuracy is limited in an extensive range radar type equipment is relatively expensive to install and maintain with the increase in the number of water level monitoring sites the installation and maintenance costs are essential to consider in practical applications remote monitoring with a camera transmitting the images to the center through the internet is a common visualization method the camera can observe the surrounding environment of the water area and regularly measure the water level manually in particular when the water level device measures the abnormal value the observer can immediately confirm and respond to the situation in the centralized hydrological monitoring and management scenario video monitoring equipment almost becomes necessary for water level monitoring sites they provided a basis for measurement based on computer vision to replace traditional non visual measurement devices computer vision technology has been rapidly developed in recent years and applied in various fields research on hydrology technology based on artificial intelligence has also become a hot spot vetra carvalho et al 2020 tauro et al 2014 perks et al 2016 pearce et al 2020 and research on methods related to water level measurement has also attracted more and more attention a method based on computer vision can be directly integrated into the camera with a computing power chip to analyze real time images or deployed to the cloud server etter et al 2020 luffman and connors 2022 then the analysis results of water level measurement at each site in the jurisdiction area are sent and summarized to the management center in real time compared to additional installation and maintenance of non visual measurement devices methods based on computer vision have the advantages of being highly integrated non contact with no temperature drift and conversion error can significantly reduce costs and improve efficiency noto et al 2021 zhang et al 2019a b however in practical applications computer vision algorithms face complex situations such as images varying from place to place and time to time adapting to various conditions to obtain more reliable measurements is one of the challenges in the field in recent years many scholars have carried out research in this field some use semantic segmentation to obtain water regions moy de vitry et al 2019 yu et al 2020 vandaele et al 2021 still these methods generally only work when the water surface has changed significantly and cannot obtain accurate water level measurement results it is more common is observing water levels using references such as a staff gauge usually the camera axis is not perpendicular to the staff gauge in addition under different environmental conditions the distance between the camera and the staff gauge is different and the measuring range and size of the staff gauge are diverse so according to the perspective principle the staff gauge is imaged by the camera as an irregular quadrilateral the pixel spacing of each position in the image is inconsistent and there is a lot of background interference increasing the difficulty of the algorithm design image transformation and cropping is a common preprocessing method zhang et al 2019a b gilmore et al 2013 nguyen et al 2009 fleury et al 2020 to focus on the region of interest roi and get a normalized transformed image for a camera with a fixed position in the real world the surface of the staff gauge generally approximates a plane which satisfies a definite spatial mapping relationship with the staff gauge in the original camera image the existing methods usually calculate the transfer matrix of the mapping relationship and cut out the roi to obtain a transformed image directly however they lose the original image s contextual information another critical question of the water level measurement method is how to position the water line accurately in the transformed image the water line is the boundary position between the staff gauge and the water area one idea is to use an image processing operator to extract image features such as the canny operator bharti et al 2022 soble operator yang et al 2014 etc and then distinguish the features of the staff gauge and water zhang et al 2019a b zhen et al 2019 sun et al 2014 however the image features vary due to changes in time weather season and other natural factors in addition environmental factors such as shadows generated by building structures rolling waves transparent water water with different colors etc make the extraction results of basic features more complex and unreliable these factors result in gross errors infrared imaging was used to try to alleviate the lighting problem zhang et al 2019a b but it further limits the use conditions and does not solve problems caused by factors other than lighting some high level semantic feature extraction methods are applied to water level measurement to overcome the instability of low level features for example the template matching method is used to obtain the staff gauge area lin et al 2013 bruinink et al 2015 and the deep learning method to detect characters qiao et al 2022 these methods attempt to locate particular sign regions and use postprocessing logic to predict the water line position however these methods may fail when the appearance of the staff gauge or water changes such as perspective reflection occlusion wear etc fleury et al proposed a deep learning regression method fleury et al 2020 which crops out the roi image after preprocessing and uses a deep learning model to get the water line position however not only does the cropped roi region lose surrounding contextual information but their model structure cannot guarantee stable positioning results as described in the paper fleury et al 2020 the effect of its method would be different under some unusual environmental conditions such as various water level values weather and season in summary the existing computer vision methods can achieve good results under specific conditions however they were challenged by different realistic factors this paper proposes a robust water level measurement method to cope with these problems the final experimental results show that this study is more robust for deployment and application under different environmental conditions 2 materials and methods this chapter elaborates on the proposed method in detail fig 1 section 2 1 introduces the extended region of interest eroi with contextual information to obtain a normalized rectangular transformed image section 2 2 presents the water line positioning method which involves a deep learning regression model structure that inputs the transformed image and outputs the location result to further improve the model s generalization ability section 2 3 introduces a set of training data augmentation methods then the water line positioning result is converted to the real world in section 2 4 to get the actual water level measurement results finally we give the evaluation criteria 2 1 extended region of interest image transformation 2 1 1 homography transformation the measuring range of the staff gauge the relative angle and the camera s distance differ significantly at different sites and there is a lot of background interference in the image it is necessary to transform and normalize the images first according to the technical principles related to machine vision the plane approximated by the staff gauge satisfies the mapping of the homography relationship eq 1 between the world coordinate and the camera coordinate system dubrofsky 2009 agarwal et al 2005 1 x i y i w t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 t 6 t 7 t 8 t 9 x i y i 1 t x i y i 1 x i x i w y i y i w x i y i is the point coordinate of the original image from the camera x i y i is the corresponding point coordinate on the transformed image we want to get and w is the scaling factor the homography transformation matrix t matrix defines the mapping relationship between the camera plane and the transformed image coordinate system the following subsection 2 1 2 describes obtaining the t matrix in water level measurement 2 1 2 generate transformed images with contextual information before solving the t matrix let s once again explicitly define the three spatial coordinate systems table 1 lists corresponding coordinate system names and symbols the original coordinate system defines the space of the original image fig 2 a the transformed coordinate system defines the corresponding transformed image space fig 2b and c the real world coordinate system is specified on the real staff gauge plane fig 2a which takes the corner point of the staff gauge as the origin and the horizontal and vertical directions as the coordinate axes the subscript i indicates the different position to solve t matrix x i y i need to be calibrated on the original image fig 2a usually selecting the intersection point of the left and right boundary and the water scale line in the original image because such points can directly read the coordinates u i v i on the corresponding staff gauge in the real world coordinate system without additional operation for example the intersection point between the scale line with a height of 20 cm and the left boundary of the staff gauge corresponds to u i v i 0 c m 20 c m in the real world coordinate system directly so we get the mapping x i y i u i v i further we need to get the mapping u i v i x i y i when the staff gauge in the real world size is w h and the corresponding size in the transformed image is w h the horizontal and vertical pixel spacing of the transformed image can be calculated as s x w w and s y h h when the origin of the real world coordinate system fig 2b corresponds to the origin of the transformed image coordinate system there is x i y i u i s x v i s y however contextual information is essential for the computer vision method for example when a staff gauge is placed on a wall it can be an additional reference and when the staff gauge is set independently on the water the background may reflect the color of the water etc therefore we extend x o pixels left and right in the horizontal direction to obtain the extended region of interest eroi we rewrite the mapping formula as x i y i x o u i s x v i s y and the size of the transformed image is w 2 x o h fig 3 shows the transformed image using eroi or not the t matrix to be solved has 8 degrees of freedom t 1 t 2 t 8 under the constraint t 9 1 for a camera we can select several points in the original image before application and get the mapping relationship x i y i u i v i x i y i i 1 2 n as mentioned above when n 4 and the point mapping relationships are not completely collinear the least squares solution of the t matrix eq 1 can be obtained agarwal et al 2005 dubrofsky 2009 then the transformed positive rectangle image is obtained by interpolating the pixel values in the eroi of the original image fig 2c because once the equipment and staff gauge are installed firmly the relative position is determined and the t matrix will not change in the subsequent processing so each camera only needs to implement this process once to save the t matrix and realize the transformation process of all images in the following time 2 2 high resolution representation model for water line position 2 2 1 model structure the computer vision method based on deep learning has achieved excellent results in object detection classification segmentation and key point identification in images to cope with the complexity of the water level measurement we construct a deep learning regression model to locate the water line in the transformed image where the water line is the boundary between the staff gauge and the water area because the water line position may appear at any height in the transformed image and has high precision requirements the model extracting spatial features and identifying ability is essential the high resolution feature extraction network hrnet sun et al 2019a was first proposed for image human pose recognition compared with other network structures the backbone of the network structure can extract features at various spatial scales its excellent ability for information extraction and spatial representation makes it widely used in various computer vision tasks sun et al 2019b based on this network as a backbone we added a simple structure head part to fuse the features extracted from the backbone at multiple scales and then completed the regression task the input of the model is the transformed image with three channels considering the limitation of computation in practical applications we take the lightweight network hrnetw18 and its smaller version as the network backbone for subsequent research in the head part we use convolution blocks to fuse multiple branch information and then use the full connection fc layer as a regressor to obtain the model output the ground truth of the water line position corresponding to the input transformed image supervised the model output fig 4 to be more specific about the model structure we present the details of each structure table 2 n modules n branchs n blocks and n chanels indicate the number of repeated concatenations of the module the number of branches in the current stage the number of blocks in each branch and the number of convolution kernel channels in each block respectively in the backbone the number of channels in each branch is constant but different in the head the different specifications in the small version are noted in parentheses 2 2 2 training methodology regression is commonly used in data fitting and prediction tasks l 1 loss and l 2 loss are often used to supervise the training process yang et al 2019 however in practical application even when the error is minimal the derivative of l 1 loss is constant and cannot be differentiated close to 0 resulting in low solving efficiency l 2 loss produces a significant loss because of its squared operation when there is a sample outlier and the training is more sensitive and unstable due to gradient explosion smoothl 1 lose eq 2 was proposed in faster rcnn ren et al 2015 for object detection tasks 2 smooth l 1 0 5 e 2 e 1 e 0 5 e 1 o r e 1 e is the error between the ground truth l and the model output l which formula is e l l smoothl 1 lose combines the advantage of both methods to ensure continuous differentiable and training stability so we chose this regularization method to deal with the regression tasks the deep learning model in this study and its comparison all use the same training method regarding training resources we used an nvidia v100 graphics card whose graphics memory is 32g and theoretical performance is 14 13 tflops during the training we used a batch size of 32 and the method of adam as the optimizer iterate over 200 epochs at an initial learning rate of 0 01 the learning rate decreases by 0 1 times per 50 epochs model params are pre trained on the imagenet krizhevsky et al 2017 the training process was stable and convergent under this set of hyperparameters and the subsequent experiments used this set of parameters the model was trained using a set of data augmentation methods described in section 2 3 2 3 robust data augmentation method in general the environment of actual hydrological scenarios is very complex not only does the environment of different water level monitoring sites vary greatly but also it takes a long time for changes in the same site to be reflected including a series of external factors such as natural light and weather we hope the model can output accurate results without bias under any conditions however training with biased data hardly guarantees results in unusual cases thus we propose a robust augmentation method for the water line positioning model s training phase to overcome these problems it consists of two submethods fig 5 appearance based data augmentation ada and random extension in the direction red the detailed process is presented in sections 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 2 3 1 appearance based data augmentation the collected data set can hardly contain all appearance conditions resulting in the model overfitting the appearance conditions specified by the training set a series of data augmentations for appearance are adopted to simulate transformed images under different appearance conditions table 3 training with horizontal flipping and horizontal cropping can improve the model s generalization ability to the appearance change for example the direction of light in the morning and evening is opposite the jittering of brightness hue and saturation can improve the generalization ability of the image style for example atmospheric scattering makes light bluer and sunsets make light yellower and cloudy or rainy days make light darker cameras typically use infrared fill light at night producing gray images in addition the unnatural light leads to changes in the image and the color of the water is different at each site fig 7 and fig 9 2 3 2 random extension in the direction there is a strong correlation between the regression ability and the training set s distribution of ground truth values nibali et al 2018 the unbalanced distribution of ground truth values will lead to biased model output results which prefer to output an average water level because collecting samples at rare heights of positions is complex to overcome the problem we propose a new data augmentation method of random extension in the direction red which is only used in training and transforms the ground truth distribution into a uniform distribution fig 6 the method is plug and play without additional calculation costs for each training image i and ground truth l we first randomly generate a water line position l with uniform distributed probability fig 6a if l l redundant components need to be cut out in the staff gauge part of the image while the water part needs to be expanded the expansion adopts reflecting to ensure that the image obtained after splicing is natural the reflecting takes the image boundary as the axis and fills the extended area symmetrically fig 6c d the new transformed image is recorded as i when l l reverse operations are performed in the area of staff gauge and water based on this data augmentation method the model with almost no bias output can be trained under data set with any ground truth distribution 2 4 convert to the actual water level when the water line is positioned on the transformed image the actual water level in the real world can be calculated by eq 3 3 l actual l base l s y l is the model s output estimates the vertical coordinates of the water line on the transformed image s y is the vertical pixel spacing of the transformed image mentioned in section 2 1 whose unit is pixel m e t r e l base represents the baseline which is the actual water level height corresponding to the 0 scales of the staff gauge 2 5 evaluation criteria we used two group evaluation criteria to verify this study s validity the first one is the indicators of the regression another one is the proportion that meets the applicable standard since the measuring range of the staff gauge at each site is different the measuring indexes in this paper are all based on normalized output for the convenience of analysis 2 5 1 mae rmse and r2 in regression tasks common evaluation indicators include mae r m s e and r 2 eq 4 4 mae 1 n i 1 n l i l i r m s e 1 n i 1 n l i l i 2 r 2 1 i 1 n l i l i 2 i 1 n l i l 2 n is the number of samples in the test set l is the sample ground truth l is the water level output and l is the mean value of all ground truths of the dataset the subscript i represents the different samples 2 5 2 accuracy in the case below the error threshold we set an error threshold t when the error is less than t the measurement is correct otherwise it is wrong the measurement accuracy on the test set is defined as eq 5 5 t t l l t a c c t n t t n t t is the correct sample n t t is the number of correct samples and n is the total number of samples in the test dataset according to the needs of different scenarios we set the threshold t as 1 2 5 and 10 respectively 3 results 3 1 data set to objectively reflect the effect we collected data sets from public sources such as public websites and field observation sites 3 1 1 image data set first we created an image data set for basic training and validation fig 7 to ensure the data set diversity and reduce the distribution bias caused by many images in some specific sites only one image was sampled at each site we confirm that the training and test data sets are heterogeneous containing 760 training images and 995 test images to handle the different ranges of staff gauges in each site we convert all the original images in the datasets into a normalized transformed image using preprocess mentioned in section 2 1 since both the preprocessing in section 2 1 and the postprocessing in section 2 4 are deterministic linear operations therefore the model s output on the transformed image can directly reflect the effect of the whole system for the labeling the boundary between the staff gauge and the water area is first marked for each image then the median value of water level height under different horizontal coordinates is taken as the ground truth value of the water level to reduce the influence of ripples waves and other factors fig 8 in addition to the typical samples this data set has some exceptional cases such as high and shallow water levels dark lighting infrared imaging and blurred imaging quality fig 9 3 1 2 sequential data sets to illustrate the effect of this study in actual hydrological scenarios we collected three sequential data sets table 4 site a and c are from actual observation stations and site b is from an open source data set tsai and cheng 2020 originally used to classify hazardous water conditions we selected a sub sequential whose staff gauge is visible these sequences contain a wealth of environmental variations with color images during the day and infrared images at night for each site fig 10 the labeling operation for the sequential data is roughly consistent with the image data set the difference is that since the device collecting the sequence is fixed only the position of the staff gauge in the first frame is calibrated and the calibrated information is used in the subsequent sequence without repeated calibration 3 2 ablation experiment an ablation experiment typically refers to changing or removing some submethod and seeing how that affects performance to illustrate the effectiveness of each part of this study we performed ablation experiments with the image data set image input size affects application results we trained a group of models with different image sizes and compared the results table 5 if the input size is small such as 320 32 the image details are lost and the result will be poor a larger image size like 960 96 will linearly increase the computation and the model training difficulty because it needs to be solved in a larger space and its results are not significantly better therefore 640 64 was selected as the input size for subsequent experiments resnet he et al 2016 is a classical model structure so we selected resnet18 and resnet34 which with a similar amount of computation as our method to compare with our model structure mentioned in section 2 2 table 6 lists the results of different models and submethods applied in the water line positioning task eroi represents the extended region of interest proposed in section 2 1 ada and red represent appearance based data augmentation and random extension in the direction respectively as mentioned in section 2 3 to illustrate the model efficiency we also listed each model s number of parameters and computation table 7 other training related hyperparameters of each model are consistent as subsection 2 2 2 compared with resnet backbones this study achieves higher accuracy with the approximate amount of computation table 6 and table 7 the result proves that our model is more suitable for water level measurement tasks the backbone can be selected according to real time and precision requirements in practical applications training using eroi can obtain better results than without extension table 6 it means that the introduction of contextual information can better assist in determining the location of the water line by comparing each model s eroi and eroi ada results we can see that appearance based data augmentation improves the generalization ability of appearance each evaluation index is improved compared with no use of ada the accuracy was further improved by using red fig 11 to illustrate the effectiveness of red in countering model output bias affected by the training dataset and we performed further analysis according to the training data set ground truth normalized height distribution fig 9a most training set samples are concentrated near the median value the number of extraordinary water levels such as the high water level 0 0 0 2 subset or shallow water level 0 8 1 0 subset is small we calculate the correlation between the acc 2 and the number of training sets eq 6 6 c o r r a n i 1 s a i a n i n i 1 s a i a 2 n i n 2 a is sequence consists of the acc 2 of the test subset and n is sequence consists of the training subset s sample numbers a and n is their mean value subscript i is index number of the data set and s is num of subset in this case s 5 the correlation coefficient between the accuracy results and the number of training sets before using red is 0 7726 with a strong correlation between them however after using red the correlation coefficient is 0 0713 with little linear correlation we conclude that red can effectively overcome the model bias caused by training data distribution 3 3 comparisons with other methods we compare the other three methods results including two traditional feature extraction and one deep learning method otsu is a feature method based on the image s gray level while mdf integrates edge and gray level features zhen et al 2019 and the method fleury et al 2020 uses a deep learning regression model with a straight chain 19 layer model structure we reproduce the comparison methods and adjust the parameters appropriately without changing the principle so that these methods can achieve better indicators in more complex scenarios the input image size of each method is consistent with that of the original paper the results table 8 show that this study has significantly higher accuracy than others we showed visualizations to compare the differences between other methods and this study fig 12 besides the original images and results we offer the visualizations of traditional operator image processing and use grad cam selvaraju et al 2017 to visualize deep learning features to explain how a semantic feature obtains from a cnn model layer contributes to the final result grad cam uses gradient information that flows into the cnn model s last convolution layer as essential values of each neuron then the grad cam is obtained by weighing the essential values of different feature channels selvaraju et al 2017 we show it with pseudo color with warm and cool colors representing larger and smaller values respectively in the site where each method is applicable fig 12a the texture is clear the environment is simple and there is no obvious noise in the staff gauge and water area when the brightness of the staff gauge is close to that of the water fig 12b the otsu method cannot get an accurate result when there is a slight perspective below the water line some texture features and brightness features can be seen affecting other methods judgment of the water line position when the water level is high the reflection is clear and the characteristics of the staff gauge are few fig 12d other methods that pay more attention to the features of the staff gauge are ineffective when the surface of the staff gauge is heavily rusted and texture features are hard to recognize fig 12e the expanded part can supplement more information to deal with this situation when floating objects block the surface of the water fig 12f all the comparison methods except this study get the wrong results where there is a splash of waves near the staff gauge fig 12g the other three methods fail this study improves adaptability when the staff gauge is rich in color fig 12h the above visualization results show that this study is very well adapted to complex situations that other methods cannot the traditional feature extraction method is effective in specific cases but will produce errors when encountering different staff gauge appearances and environments the deep learning methods can automatically extract semantic features for measurement through training the grad cam results show that the method in fleury et al 2020 focuses on the staff gauge and infers the water line position however this is susceptible to changes in the environment s appearance this study paid attention to the water and water line apart from the staff gauge in addition contextual information helps water line positioning especially when the water line is not obvious in the image in summary our method has better robustness than the existing methods 3 4 measured results of the sequential data sets to verify the result of this study in actual hydrological observation sequence data sets as subsection 3 1 2 are used for testing we list the normalized statistical indicators table 9 this study achieves good results in sites a and b in site c under relatively loose standards such as acc 5 and acc 10 this study can achieve high accuracy but under strict standards such as acc 1 and acc 2 the accuracy is relatively low it has good robustness in most cases but there are some errors in some periods of site c which leads to a low index under the strictest standard fig 13 a gross error which we mark with the green circle it is because there is an occlusion in front of the camera fig 10k in addition the measurement results of site c are not stable especially the period marked with the red circle the camera in this location is not installed stable causing wobble fig 10 there is a height drop in the top position of different frames fig 10a b we will discuss the effects of wobble further in the following chapter 4 other instability factors such as imaging illumination weather water reflection ripples and floats can be overcome by this study to sum up this study can obtain ideal results in most hydrological water level measurement tasks 4 discussion we propose a robust water level measurement method to solve the problem that the existing computer vision methods are unstable our data set is diverse and the training and testing samples are heterogeneous the analysis in chapter 3 shows that the robust method proposed by us has achieved outstanding results compared with the traditional feature extraction operator method this study does not need to redesign and adjust the algorithm compared to other deep learning methods this study can migrate fine tuning the model by collecting a small amount of data rather than spending much effort to cover all environmental changes this study is closer to achieving all weather robust and accurate measurements in most scenarios compared with traditional methods such as float type this study has some advantages such as being more conducive to maintenance cost reduction etc however we must admit that compared with the stable operating devices this study may have errors in some scenes such as waves fig 12g the model result needs further improvement on the one hand improving the model s generalization ability needs continuous research on the other hand further data collection and training to cover more complex environmental conditions are also required one concern is that the deep learning model in this study is based on supervised training and a data set needs to be prepared in advance collecting samples is difficult in some cases such as remote sites without access to the network and ground truths labeling also takes a few human resources it may be a helpful research direction to obtain more diversified training data by sample synthesis or simulation before use the equipment shall be calibrated as described in subsection 2 1 2 although this process only needs to be configured once after the camera is set up in a practical application it isn t easy to complete calibration automatically because the staff gauge style is hardly predictable if the characteristics of the staff gauges are consistent and have the same appearance or scale elements an algorithm module can be added for automatic calibration and application in addition if the manual calibration is not accurate it may lead to more errors in the final measurement results therefore it is necessary to ensure the accuracy of the stage as much as possible the number of calibrated points can be increased to ensure accuracy because the t matrix is solved by least squares agarwal et al 2005 dubrofsky 2009 another limitation of this study is the samples collected had a staff gauge the cases where there was no staff gauge or the water level was beyond the measuring range were not discussed for the time being we believe this study can be used in a broader range of cases for example some hydrological signs buildings and other known elevations are used as references to complete the conversion from the original image to the transformed image in section 2 1 to achieve measurement as mentioned in section 3 3 our model also focuses on the water and the water line therefore we reasoned that this kind of scene could also realize the positioning of the water line after training we will collect more test data to verify the site without a staff gauge in this study the stability of the image is a basic premise when the image is shaken there may be output errors to more clearly explore the impact of camera wobble on the computer vision method we try to calculate its uncertainty according to the central limit theorem loève 2017 the camera jitter offset over a long period is approximately normally distributed therefore eq 7 can be used to estimate variance and uncertainty meyer 2007 based on samples the uncertainty is due to random error and it is a measure of the quality of the result the smaller the uncertainty the higher the quality of the measurement results conversely the lower the quality of the measurement results 7 s x 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 2 u 95 2 s s x is the sample standard deviation u 95 means that about 95 of the cases can be covered within two standard deviations we calibrated the position of each frame of the staff gauge in the sequence data set in subsection 3 1 2 and the normalized uncertainties due to the wobble of three sites are 0 0021 0 0125 and 0 0222 respectively the instability will directly lead to increased measurement errors like site c therefore before using this study it is necessary to ensure the image is as stable as possible to reduce this uncertainty this study can also combine with more camera functions in different environments such as anti shaking or image based registration maybe a supplementary scheme this study may fail when environmental factors cause the inability to see the image or visual field loss thus some extreme cases such as when the lens is prone to dust or rain cover require hardware such as wipers and a camera with auxiliary infrared light is a good choice for night scenes in addition this study can be extended to other measuring machine vision intelligence applications to measure different signs or targets with relatively large application potential 5 conclusions we have put forward a new water level measurement approach in this paper this study has the advantages of remote visualization easy installation and maintenance and low cost firstly we obtain the transformed images based on homography transformation and contextual information is introduced then a deep learning model structure for water line positioning is built to process the transformed image the structure has the backbone of high resolution representation and a head of the regression we identified the advantages of our proposed model structure from the experimental results because the model structure can maintain high resolution and relatively strong multi scale and feature fusion ability next we propose robust data augmentation methods for model training that can greatly improve the model s generalization the appearance based data augmentation can cover more environmental changes and the random extension in the direction can overcome the problem of uneven distribution of water level values finally we did a series of experiments and analyses on the image and sequential datasets we built the experimental results show that this study is more robust and has significant advantages in dealing with more complex applications than other computer vision methods in the actual water level measurement task this study can overcome most of the interference conditions and meet the requirements of hydrology measurement some issues still need to be further explored such as improving the algorithm s accuracy reducing the workload brought by image collection and labeling reducing the impact of camera instability through registration validation in the absence of staff gauges and studying other measurement applications

integrated moving average farima model was fit to the deseasonalized streamflow time series to model its statistical structure farima allows the separation of streamflow into low slowly varying and high frequency fast varying components in this study the changes in the contribution of various components to the total streamflow variance were analyzed further the variables affecting these changes were identified using random forest and linear regression results show that in the snow dominated watersheds the contribution of low frequency components to total streamflow variance decreased over the study period and the contribution of high frequency components increased the changes in the snow dominated watersheds were primarily driven by changes in precipitation statistics and changes in snowpack but also by changes in seasonal temperature statistics among the rain driven watersheds the contribution of high frequency components generally increased in arid regions but decreased in humid regions in both humid and arid rain driven watersheds increasing winter temperature appears to be responsible for the change in streamflow statistical structure these results have consequences for the predictability of streamflow in the presence of climate change further the analysis carried out in this study allowed us to understand the plausible changes in watershed hydrologic processes that affect streamflow without using process based or conceptual models keywords streamflow climate change farima spectral analysis snow dominated watersheds rain driven watersheds data availability the data used in study are freely available online and the appropriate references have been provided in the main text 1 introduction 1 1 background the global hydrologic water balance will be impacted directly by climate change milly et al 2005 milly and dunne 2016 mote et al 2018 manabe and broccoli 2020 which will alter streamflows the extent and nature of hydrologic change depend upon several factors including watershed geomorphological characteristics lee and delleur 1972 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 1997 vegetation characteristics soil properties eagleson 1978 the dominant mode of streamflow production wu et al 2021 snowmelt or rain quick flow baseflow etc and changes in vegetation characteristics e g milly 1997 thus a rich variety of responses can be expected from different watersheds due to the change in climate gordon et al 2022 the hydrologic responses of watersheds to climate change need to be understood to devise an effective adaption strategy because of strong feedbacks between various components of a hydrologic system laio et al 2001 porporato et al 2001 rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 rodriguez iturbe et al 2001 climate change can potentially lead to profound changes in the watershed hydrologic regime the hydrologic regime here refers to the interaction between different components of the hydrologic process which produce hydrologic fluxes such as streamflow and evapotranspiration et further the effects of climate change are expected to be observed at different timescales streamflow is the integrated response of a watershed s hydrology which is affected by watershed characteristics that determine the hydrologic regime of the watershed thus studying changes in streamflow characteristics provides clues to understanding the changes in watershed hydrologic regime hydrologists have employed various mathematical models simulation approaches to understand the streamflow response of a watershed at different timescales these models can be broadly classified as process based or conceptual deterministic models beven 2011 stochastic models klemeš 1978 montanari et al 1997 and statistical machine learning models govindaraju 2000 the model that is used depends to some extent upon the spatial scale watershed scale regional scale global scale etc and timescale daily monthly yearly etc at which simulations predictions are required along with the purpose of simulations predictions policy making scientific hypothesis testing for most of the models used some parameters of the model need to be calibrated against observations the values of calibrated parameters depend upon climate statistics mean annual precipitation depth precipitation frequency seasonal mean temperatures etc and watershed properties temporal non stationarity introduced by climate change milly et al 2008 means that the calibrated parameters depend upon the observation period in fact climate change may directly affect the physical characteristics of a watershed via a change in vegetation characteristics milly 1997 this introduces additional uncertainty in model projections predictions in the presence of climate change for example stephens et al 2020 showed that changes in rainfall statistics along with changes in atmospheric co2 can change soil moisture statistics it may take a few years for a calibrated hydrologic model to adjust to the new equilibrium conditions examples of climate change impacting watershed hydrologic characteristics include changes in snowpack in the western usa e g knowles et al 2006 mote et al 2005 mote 2006 belmecheri et al 2016 berg and hall 2017 and change in baseflow and stormflow e g ficklin et al 2016 in summary the problem is that climate non stationarities may make a hydrologic model calibrated and validated against historical observations unreliable for prediction simulation in changed conditions some strategies have been proposed to address this problem klemeš 1986 proposed differential split sample testing to test the robustness of a model under change but such strategies may not be useful in case of large changes especially if the change in a watershed is toward a drier hydrologic regime stephens et al 2020 singh et al 2011 proposed a space time symmetry approach under an uncertainty framework to estimate streamflows in a watershed in the presence of regime change the idea of space time symmetry has been demonstrated to be useful at decadal timescales using the budyko framework e g sivapalan et al 2011 the relative success of machine learning ml methods in estimating streamflows at gauged and ungauged locations at a daily timescale kratzert et al 2018 suggests that there is a considerable amount of hydrologic information shared between different watersheds but note that data from different watersheds may also introduce disinformation beven 2020 however there is limited evidence of the successful application of space time symmetry at a daily timescale see singh et al 2011 especially under a changing climate therefore there is a need to further test this idea such a testing procedure would require identifying watersheds that have undergone hydrologic regime change this was the main motivation for this work 1 2 streamflow statistical structure and objectives of the study in this study changes in the streamflow statistical structure sss were studied recently it has been shown that sss is also indicative of streamflow dynamics to some extent betterle et al 2019 which further justifies studying the changes in sss to understand the effect of climate change on the hydrologic regime further studying the changes in sss can help identify the changes in flow paths and strengthening weakening of different flow paths in a watershed using just the available streamflow data streamflow time series typically exhibit long term persistence hurst 1951 meaning that autocorrelations in streamflow decrease very slowly with time lag studying the statistical structure of a stationary time series is equivalent to studying its spectral properties previous work has shown that the power spectral density psd of streamflow time series scales linearly on a log log graph tessier et al 1996 that is h ω ω α h where h ω denotes psd at angular frequency ω t 1 and α h denotes the slope of the scaling relationship also a typical streamflow time series exhibits two scaling regimes two different values of α h with scale break occurring between 1 and 20 days hirpa et al 2010 kim et al 2016 and yang and bowling 2014 analyzed the changes in streamflow psd to study the effects of urbanization on the hydrologic regime in the south korean watersheds and the great lakes region respectively specifically kim et al 2016 studied the changes in the slopes of two scaling regimes and the change in scale break point bras and rodriguez iturbe 1993 and chow 1978 also illustrated the usefulness of spectral analysis in streamflow time series analysis gudmundsson et al 2011 studied the contribution of low frequency components specifically greater than 1 year timescale to total streamflow variance in several european watersheds but did not examine the temporal changes similarly zaerpour et al 2021 defined the streamflow regime based on annual flow characteristics but neglected high frequency fluctuations further several studies have reported that streamflow dynamics is deterministic chaotic e g sivakumar et al 2001 sivakumar and singh 2012 rather than linear stochastic but these studies have been criticized because of the small lengths of streamflow time series used to determine chaos e g schertzer et al 2002 koutsoyiannis 2006 a systematic analysis of the changes in sss over time across the contiguous usa has not been reported to the best of the authors knowledge the objectives of this study are as follows 1 to conduct a spectral analysis of streamflow time series in watersheds across the usa 2 to identify temporal changes in those spectral signatures 3 to identify the spatial patterns of changes in sss and 4 to investigate the relationship between sss change climatic statistics such as annual mean temperature and rainfall and watershed attributes other researchers have studied the changes in hydrologic regime due to climate change but their focus has been on a few of the hydrologic processes or fluxes such as baseflow soil moisture annual streamflow etc e g ficklin et al 2016 studying the change in spectral properties of daily streamflow time series can provide holistic insight into changes in hydrologic regime because 1 streamflow is an integrated response of several hydrologic processes 2 to some extent studying the changes in spectral properties allow us to understand the changes in various hydrologic flow paths for example changes in the low frequency components of a streamflow time series can inform us about the changes in baseflow and snowpack changes in the high frequency components can inform us about the changes in soil moisture surface flow and interflow processes note that soil moisture affects the low frequency component also the changes in sss can occur due to changes in climatic statistics and or changes in watershed characteristics which interact with each other non linearly and may even cancel each other s effect boisramé et al 2017 therefore it is likely that watersheds that are close to each other in space may exhibit different changes in sss even though the effect of climate on the watersheds is similar in this scenario analysis across a large number of watersheds provides a more holistic understanding thus this work aims to contribute to our understanding of the impact of climate change on the hydrologic regime and hydrologic flow paths by studying the changes in sss across a large number of watersheds in the usa another feature of this work is that the analyses are based only on observed streamflow data no process based models have been used in the analysis process based models require a large dataset for parameter calibration typically the data include rainfall time series which contain uncertainty due to measurement errors and spatial variability which is difficult to capture bárdossy and anwar 2022 preprint also there is structural uncertainty associated with process based models beven and smith 2015 this is not to say that the process based models are not useful for change detection but that the analysis presented in this study can complement an analysis carried out using the process based models in what follows section 2 describes the methodology used in this study section 3 describes the study area and data along with changes in a few climatic statistics across the usa section 4 describes the sss across the usa during the first 10 years of study and describes how different hydrologic processes may contribute to sss formation section 5 discusses the changes in sss sections 6 and 7 discuss the relationships of changes in sss with the changes in climatic statistics and watershed attributes section 8 summarizes and concludes the paper 2 modeling description 2 1 farima model the fractionally differenced auto regressive integrated moving average farima montanari et al 1997 model was used to represent the statistical properties of streamflow time series farima is a time series model which is known to capture streamflow structure very well montanari et al 1997 montanari et al 2000 in this study the farima models were fitted to streamflow time series to estimate the noise free psd of the time series see priestley 1982 for a discussion of the issues of noise in psd estimation the general form of the farima model is 1 φ p b 1 b d x t ψ q b t where x t denotes streamflow at time step t b denotes the backward shift operator such that b x t x t 1 d denotes a parameter of the model that takes a value between 0 and 0 5 for streamflow time series and t denotes uncorrelated white noise φ p b and ψ q b denote p t h order autoregressive ar and q t h order moving average ma polynomials respectively 2 φ p b i 0 p ϕ i b i ϕ 0 1 3 ψ q b i 0 q ψ i b i ψ 0 1 where ϕ i and ψ i are ar and ma parameters when d 0 the farima model degenerates to an arma model when d takes a positive integer value it degenerates to the classic arima model promoted by box and jenkins 1970 for a typical streamflow time series d takes a fractional value between 0 and 0 5 due to long term persistence in the time series a detailed discussion of the interpretation of the farima model parameters is given in supplementary information si text s1 and several other texts e g granger and joyeux 1980 beran 1994 parameters of the farima models were estimated using a similar method as that of montanari et al 1997 details of the parameter estimation method are provided in si text s2 to validate the farima models the autocorrelations of the obtained residual time series were analyzed the results are shown in si text s3 figures s3 s11 for most of the models the autocorrelations at any lag were statistically indistinguishable from zero for a few models however the autocorrelations were greater than 0 15 at a few lags indicating that the farima model could not capture the statistical structure of streamflow time series in the corresponding watersheds therefore these watersheds were removed from the subsequent analysis the conditions imposed in this study are typically appropriate for model validation see montanari et al 1997 the residuals however did not follow the gaussian distribution for most of the models but as pointed out by montanari et al 1997 and the references therein deviation from gaussianity does not affect the parameter estimation of farima models after fitting the farima model to a time series a noise free estimate of the psd of the time series could be obtained using eq s4 of si in this study the changes in normalized psd npsd were considered npsd is obtained by dividing the psd by the total variance of the process where total variance is nothing but the total area under the psd 2 2 measurement of change in power spectral density to analyze the changes in sss a moving window approach was taken with a window length of 10 years and with moving step of 3 years table 1 thus the study period 1980 2013 water years was broken up into 9 overlapping windows of 10 years each the farima models were fit to deseasonalized time series for different moving windows thus as many sets of farima parameters were obtained as the number of moving windows each set of parameters resulted in an npsd to detect the changes in sss the trends in area under npsd for different ranges of frequencies were computed fig 1 the frequency range was split into five different regions units in cycles per day c p d 1 less than 1 365 c p d greater than 1 year timescales 2 1 365 to 1 120 c p d 4 month to 1 year timescales 3 1 120 to 1 30 c p d 1 month to 4 month timescales 4 1 30 to 1 15 c p d 2 week to 1 month timescales and 5 greater than 1 15 c p d less than 2 week timescale for the ease of discussion two more frequency regions were used 1 365 to 1 30 c p d 1 month to 1 year timescales and greater than 1 30 c p d less than 1 month timescales denoting npsd by f ω the area under npsd in a given frequency region ω 1 ω 2 is 4 f ω 1 ω 2 ω 1 ω 2 f ω d ω which is equal to the contribution to the total variance of the components with frequency between ω 1 and ω 2 since the area under npsd is equal to 1 an increase in the contribution of high frequency components implies a decrease in the contribution of low frequency components in what follows area under npsd in the frequency region greater than 1 year timescale will be denoted by f 0 similarly area under npsd in the frequency region 4 month to 1 year timescales 1 month to 4 month timescales 2 week to 1 month timescales less than 2 week timescales 1 month to 1 year timescales and less than 1 month timescales will be denoted by f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 and f 6 respectively these notations are listed in table 2 for convenience let f i j ω i ω i 1 be the area under f ω for i t h frequency region and j t h time window the trend in f i j ω i ω i 1 across time periods were estimated with a linear fit f i j ω i ω i 1 γ j c where γ is the trend and c is the intercept the sign of γ indicates whether the contribution of a frequency region to total streamflow variance is increasing positive γ or decreasing negative γ over time the magnitude of γ indicates the extent of change a larger smaller magnitude of γ implies a larger smaller change a trend was considered statistically significant if the p value of the slope γ was less than or equal to 0 05 we refer to this test as the first significance test in addition the statistical significance of each trend was computed by another method using the posterior probability distribution of the farima parameters see si text s2 for details of the posterior distribution estimation eqs s10 and s11 the posterior probability distribution of npsd was obtained this in turn was used to compute the probability distribution of the fraction of area under each frequency region of npsd see fig 1 for frequency regions for all the time windows thus for each frequency region we had probability distribution of f i j ω i ω i 1 for the first and last time windows let these probability distributions be denoted by p 1 f and p 2 f with respective mean values m 1 and m 2 for the trend to be significant we imposed the condition that m 1 and m 2 should belong to different statistical populations toward this end a probability p s was computed 5 p s p 1 f m 2 p 2 f m 1 2 m 1 m 2 p 1 f m 2 p 2 f m 1 2 m 1 m 2 for the trend to be significant p s should be less than 0 05 we refer to this test as the second significance test in summary a trend was deemed statistically significant only if it came out to be significant using both first and second statistical significance tests this means that the change in sss should be consistent in time and the sss in the first and last time windows should be significantly different the first and second significance tests collectively ensure that the changes in sss are robust if the change in sss in a watershed is significant according to first significant test it is still possible that the first and last time windows have similar regimes such a change is unlikely to be robust given the 30 years of data used in this study see below for more on the dataset the second significance test helps us identify and discard such cases changes in sss were gradual in some watersheds and sudden in other watersheds therefore the mann kendall test could not be reliably applied to many of these watersheds for the sake of completeness however we still applied the mann kendall trend test we found that of all the watersheds for which changes in sss were statistically significant according to first and second significance tests 70 of the watersheds had statistically significant changes according to the mann kendall test also for the majority of the remaining 30 watersheds for which the mann kendall test concluded that changes were statistically insignificant the changes were abrupt some plots illustrating the changes in sss are shown in si text s4 figures s12 s14 these plots also illustrate the robustness of the changes in sss reported in this study 2 3 different geographical regions of the usa and rain and snow dominated watersheds for the sake of discussion reference to different geographical regions of the usa will be made the spatial extent of these regions is shown in fig a1 appendix a the rain dominated watersheds are the ones located in the pacific region except the sierra nevada the gulf coast the central and the southern great plains the central and the southern mississippi valley and one watershed in the atlantic coast snow dominated watersheds are the ones located in the sierra nevada the rocky mountains the high plains the northern great plains and the great lakes region a few watersheds in the pacific northwest are also snow dominated the watersheds located in the northern mississippi valley could not be classified as either snow or rain dominated 2 4 methodology for relating changes in statistical structure of streamflows with climatic statistics and watershed attributes to understand the changes in ssss statistical methods were used first the variables related to the change in f i i 0 1 6 were identified second possible mechanisms via which each variable might have affected the f i values were hypothesized watersheds were divided into two groups snow dominated and rain dominated watersheds the analysis was carried out separately for these two groups note that many of the snow dominated watersheds also experience rain but the sss is significantly controlled by snow in these watersheds further the only difference between the analyses of snow and rain dominated watersheds is that for snow dominated rain dominated watersheds some predictor variables exclusive to snow dominated rain dominated watersheds were derived other predictor variables were identical for all the watersheds the locations of snow and rain dominated watersheds used are shown in figures s18 and s19 respectively the variables explored include static catchment attributes including soil properties geological properties topography and average climate changes in climatic statistics were also explored as possible causes of change in f i values these include variables related to the changes in precipitation and change in temperature for example change in total annual precipitation depth change in ond oct nov dec total precipitation depth and change in mean annual temperature changes in climatic variables were computed using the same moving windows as for the case of change in sss table 1 additionally variables capturing snowmelt dynamics in snow dominated watersheds and rainfall runoff dynamics in rain dominated watersheds were also used the details of these variables are given in si texts s7 and s8 a list of all the variables used in this study is included in table s1 text s9 in si variables important for explaining the change in f i were identified using the random forest algorithm breiman 2001 and simple linear regression the random forest has the advantage that it can identify non linear relationships between two variables however we found that both the random forest and linear regression yielded the same variables as important a variable was considered important using simple linear regression if the regression coefficient was significantly different from 0 at a 5 significance level two linear fits were made for each combination of δ f i and predictor variable 1 using all the watersheds and 2 using only the watershed for which δ f i was statistically significant according to both first and second significance test all the variables for which the slope of either of the two linear fits was significant at the 5 significance level were considered important we found that even though linear regression and random forest could identify the important predictor variables there was a large scatter in the relationship between δ f i with other predictor variables essentially the linear fit may have a statistically significant slope but not all the watersheds may satisfy the relationship suggested by the line a similar argument applies to the random forest algorithm therefore probability densities of important variables conditioned upon the event that δ f i was positive or negative were plotted to understand the effect of a variable on δ f i this procedure is similar to computing mutual information between δ f i and a variable but more transparent as shown below the aim of this analysis was to identify what characteristics of a watershed are related to positive or negative changes in f i for example we observed that arid and humid watersheds exhibited different kinds of changes in sss 3 study area and data to achieve the objectives of this study catchments attributes and meteorology for large sample studies camels dataset addor et al 2017a b was used the camels dataset was chosen because it contains hydro meteorological data for a large number of watersheds a total of 671 across the contiguous usa also the camels watersheds are unregulated and free of anthropogenic land use changes such as deforestation the time period of the data is water years 1980 2013 in this study we included watersheds that had at least 30 years of complete data there were a total of 614 such watersheds exploratory analysis shows that significant warming has occurred in the camels watersheds across the usa fig 2 shows the trends in various climatic variables over the study period detailed results of this figure are discussed in si text s5 briefly fig 2 shows that both the temperature and precipitation statistics changed across the usa since temperature and precipitation both have strong control over sss some of the camels watersheds are likely to have undergone a sss change an increase in atmospheric co2 can also result in changes in vegetation characteristics such as water use efficiency donohue et al 2013 which in turn may affect the sss significant increases in temperatures along with the fact that global average co2 has increased over the period 1980 to 2014 from 339 ppm in 1980 to 397 ppm in 2014 dlugokencky and tans 2022 gml noaa gov ccgg trends accessed on 17 mar 2022 indicates that a significant change in climate has occurred during the study period beyond the natural climate variability thirty years of data available in the camels dataset are not enough to robustly capture the impacts of climate change therefore data available at global runoff data center grdc were also used in this study this dataset contains 110 years 1910 2020 water years of complete without any missing values streamflow data from 43 stations across the usa the aim of using the grdc dataset was to test if the changes in sss are still observed when longer periods of data are used and to understand the impact of data length on the results the main focus of this study is to understand the changes in sss on the camels dataset as it has been used in many large sample studies thus the scope of this paper is limited to the short term changes in sss in the camels dataset which are likely to occur because of both natural and anthropogenic changes in climate the results obtained with the grdc data are presented in si text s6 figures s15 and s16 and will be discussed sparingly in what follows 4 spatial distribution of streamflow statistical structure sss in the usa fig 3 a b c d shows the contributions of different frequency regions to streamflow variance in the camels watersheds during the first time window 1980 1989 water years the aim of this section is to understand the spatial variability of sss across the usa which would put the changes in sss in proper context for the convenience of discussion reference to different geographical regions of the usa will be made see fig a1 in appendix a the contribution of greater than 1 year timescale components to total streamflow variance f 0 was less than 10 in most of the rain dominated watersheds of the eastern usa and the pacific northwest fig 3c large contributions from this frequency region were found in some snow dominated watersheds in the rocky mountains region the high plains the sierra mountains in california and the pacific coast the contribution of the 1 month to 1 year timescale component f 5 fig 3b was very small in the central and southern great plains and the mississippi valley compared to that in other regions the highest values of f 5 greater than 50 were found in the snow dominated watersheds of the rocky mountains and the high plains the f 5 values ranged from 25 to 50 in the pacific northwest and the atlantic coast the contribution of baseflow to total streamflow appears to be an important factor in determining the values of f 5 since the values of f 5 follow the broadscale pattern of the baseflow index bfi see fig 4 in addor et al 2017a the bfi values were below 0 5 in the great plains and the mississippi valley greater than 0 6 in the rocky mountains and the high plains and between 0 40 and 0 60 in the pacific northwest and the atlantic coastal region moreover the scatter plot not shown of the bfi and f 5 shows that as the bfi increases from 0 to 0 4 f 5 value also increases interflow might also contribute to the 1 month to 1 year frequency region the contributions of less than 1 month timescales component to total streamflow variance f 6 were small 25 in the cold snow dominated watersheds of the western usa fig 3a in the pacific northwest and the pacific coast f 6 values were between 25 and 75 but mostly greater than 50 in most of the eastern usa watersheds the contribution of this frequency component was greater than 50 in the great plains and the mississippi valley the contribution of this component was greater than 75 in many watersheds these are dry watersheds where most of the rainwater evaporates back into the atmosphere and only a few storms reach the river network therefore the contribution of low high frequency components is very low high in these watersheds it is noteworthy that in the snow dominated watersheds with the fraction of snow 0 40 fraction of precipitation falling as snow the value of f 6 increased with an increase in mean rainfall not shown in the rain driven watersheds a linear relationship between the slope of the flow duration curve fdc addor et al 2017a and f 6 was found slope 0 054 p value 0 0045 r 2 0 033 smaller slopes of fdc imply smaller variability in streamflow thus the negative correlation between the fdc slope and the contribution of the high frequency component indicates that watersheds with less variation in streamflow values exhibit more contributions from the high frequency components for example in ephemeral streams streamflow variation is low as it stays dry during most of the water year therefore the low high frequency component is very small large the contribution of the 2 week to 1 month timescale component to total streamflow variance f 3 was very small for most of the watersheds fig 3d but there exists a cluster of watersheds in the pacific northwest where f 3 values were greater than 20 in fact in most of the pacific northwestern watersheds f 3 values were greater than 15 the f 3 values were greater than 15 in several eastern snow dominated watersheds also it was observed that f 3 was positively correlated with mean precipitation r 2 0 206 p value 0 and negatively correlated with potential evapotranspiration pet r 2 0 115 p value 0 this indicates that f 3 values are high in humid watersheds with high total precipitation and low et further f 3 was negatively correlated with both low rainfall frequency r 2 0 157 p value 0 and high rainfall frequency r 2 0 093 p value 0 here high rainfall frequency in a watershed was computed as the fraction of days when rainfall was 5 times greater than the mean rainfall similarly low rainfall frequency in a watershed was computed as the fraction of days when rainfall was below 1 mm it indicates that in watersheds where rainfall event characteristics are such that it allows enough water to stay in the soils for a long time compared to the timescale of quick flow and percolation the f 3 values are high these results indicate that slow interflow may be responsible for creating the 2 week to 1 month timescales component wu et al 2021 showed that lateral preferential flow is an important streamflow generation mechanism in pacific northwestern watersheds fig 3e shows the spatial variation of the parameter d in camels watersheds the parameter d is related to the hurst exponent h by the relation h d 0 5 there was a large spatial variation in the values of d but some general patterns were observed the very high values of d 0 30 were typically observed in the western snow dominated watersheds where the contribution of low frequency components was significant in most of the eastern rain driven watersheds the d values were less than 0 30 there was a strong linear relationship between bfi and d value slope 0 22 p value 0 r 2 0 23 also the linear relationship was stronger when bfi increased from 0 to 0 25 at very low values of bfi the d values were close to 0 this indicates that the baseflow is the essential factor for the existence of long term persistence in streamflow time series many of the watersheds in the pacific northwest the great lakes and the atlantic coast region had d values less than 0 10 despite having moderately high values of bfi 0 40 the reason for such small values of d in these regions is unclear mudelsee 2007 argued that long term persistence in streamflow time series may also be a result of the aggregation of several short memory processes granger 1980 in a watershed and showed that the value of d increases with increasing drainage area as one moves downstream in a river network therefore it is also reasonable to expect that river networks with large drainage areas may show higher d value in their corresponding streamflow time series such a relation between drainage area and d however was not observed in this study note that this does not contradict the hypothesis of mudelsee 2007 it can be concluded that long timescale fluctuations and long term persistence even in a deseasonalized streamflow time series are determined by the processes such as baseflow and the fraction of snow high frequency components are determined by quick flow interflow and et note that other researchers have reported higher contributions of the low frequency components to streamflow e g gudmundsson et al 2011 compared to those reported in this study this is due to the seasonal component of the hydrologic cycle the seasonal component accounts for the annual cycle and contributes significantly to low frequency fluctuations in this study the seasonal component had been removed from the streamflow time series therefore f 0 values came out to be smaller 5 changes in streamflow statistical structure sss as measured by changes in npsd fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of trends in f ω i ω i 1 for short timescale contributions less than 1 month f 6 2 week to 1 month f 3 and less than 2 week f 4 overall the spatial distribution of trends is patchy but a weak spatial structure is still visible such that watersheds with positive negative changes tend to be clustered together in small groups this is especially true for the watersheds located in the pacific northwest the gulf coast the atlantic coast and the great lakes region see fig a1 in appendix a for a reference to these geographical regions it indicates that the process es that has caused these changes is spatially correlated change in climatic statistics seems to be one of the causes but climate change alone cannot explain these changes since the correlation length of these trends is significantly smaller than the correlation length of trends in climatic variables such as temperature and rainfall fig 2 further it implies that the effect of climate change on the sss is strongly modulated by watershed characteristics such as soil properties and geomorphological characteristics this will be explored in subsequent sections in the grdc dataset where analysis was carried out with 110 years of data the changes in sss were less patchy figures s15 and s16 this means that the long term changes in sss are dominantly controlled by changes in climate and that watershed characteristics play a very small role this may be simply because of the larger magnitude of change in climatic statistics over a longer time period most of the snow dominated watersheds in the eastern usa located in the northern atlantic coastal region and the state of michigan exhibited positive trends in f 6 and f 4 in the western snow dominated watersheds both negative and positive trends in f 6 and f 4 were observed watersheds with negative trends were mostly located in the high plains the trends in f 3 were positive in most of the rocky mountain watersheds and negative in the eastern snow dominated watersheds but the magnitudes of the trend were very small compared to the magnitudes of trend in f 4 overall it can be concluded that the contribution of high frequency components to total variance has increased over the study period in the majority of the snow dominated watersheds with the exception of the high plains several different mechanisms are plausible that could affect this change 1 an increase in runoff producing rainfall events because of snow to rain transition e g knowles et al 2006 2 a change in temperature snow relationship horner et al 2020 3 a change in snow storage including spatial distribution belmecheri et al 2016 berg and hall 2017 and 4 a change in temperature regime mote et al 2005 mote 2006 it is likely that the combination of these mechanisms rather than one individual mechanism is responsible for the changes the same trends in f 3 and f 6 were seen in the grdc dataset in the snow dominated watersheds see si figure s15 there were two watersheds in the eastern snow dominated region in the grdc dataset where the trends in f 4 were negative as opposed to the positive trends in f 4 in the majority of the camels dataset in the same region in the rain driven watersheds other than spatial clustering of positive trends with positive trends and that of negative trends with negative trends a few other patterns are visible most of the humid watersheds located in the pacific northwest region and the gulf coast region showed a negative trend in f 6 but the trend in f 4 was positive in many of the watersheds in the pacific northwest while the trend in f 4 was negative in the gulf coast overall it appears that these humid watersheds are becoming drier which is possible due to the changes in rainfall statistics in these watersheds another possibility is that the change in evapotranspiration statistics in these watersheds is caused by the change in temperature which in turn might have changed the soil moisture dynamics a decrease in mean soil moisture in humid watersheds may result in a decrease in the contribution of high frequency components to streamflow this will be discussed in subsequent sections in the great plains both increasing and decreasing trends in f 4 and f 6 were observed the trends in f 3 showed two clear patterns 1 most of the statistically significant trends were negative in the watersheds located in the pacific and the atlantic coastal regions and 2 most of the statistically significant trends in the rocky mountains the great plains the mississippi valley and the gulf coast were positive but several negative trends were also visible in this region the trends in f 3 were of small magnitude compared to those in f 4 and f 5 this is because the values of f 3 were very small in most of the watersheds to begin with nevertheless the f 3 values have decreased in almost all the pacific region watersheds since the f 3 values were very small in all the watersheds across the usa the changes in f 3 were expected to be highly variable in space therefore the presence of only negative changes in the f 3 values in the pacific region watersheds indicates a significant systematic and common causal mechanism fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of the trends in the contribution of long timescale fluctuations greater than 1 year f 0 4 month to 1 year f 1 and 1 month to 4 month f 2 timescales similar to short timescale trends a weak spatial clustering of positive trends with positive trends and negative trends with negative trends were observed the magnitude of the trends in f 0 was larger in the watersheds located in the western usa in most of the western snow dominated watersheds the value of f 0 decreased and the magnitudes of decrease were relatively large but the trends were statistically significant only in three watersheds which might be due to the small magnitude of f 0 value there is some spatial variability in the f 0 in the eastern usa snow dominated watersheds this is explained by the fact that in the eastern snow dominated watersheds the contribution of components at greater than 1 year timescales is smaller the values of f 1 and f 2 decreased in most of the eastern snow dominated watersheds the value of f 1 increased in all the snow dominated watersheds in the high plains while it decreased in many of the rocky mountain watersheds in the grdc dataset the value of f 0 increased in the western snow dominated dominated watersheds see si figure s16 this suggests that the decrease in f 0 observed in the camels dataset in this region is the result of the recent changes in climatic statistics i e the decline in the snowpack snow to rain transition etc rather than a long term trend most of the rain dominated watersheds in the pacific northwest exhibited positive trends in f 0 and f 1 and negative trends in f 2 similarly most of the watersheds in the pacific coast exhibited negative trends in f 0 though trend was statistically significant only for one watershed the trends in f 0 f 1 and f 2 were positive in most of the gulf coast watersheds most of the rain dominated watersheds in the great plains exhibited a decrease in f 0 f 1 and f 2 but there were several watersheds in this region where f 0 f 1 and f 2 increased in summary sss has changed in many of the watersheds across the usa over the study period there is some spatial structure in the sss change watersheds close to each other show similar types of changes the spatial structure of changes in snow dominated watersheds is stronger than that in rain dominated watersheds also the western and the eastern snow dominated watersheds showed some differences in trends in long timescale components the next two sections focus on the causes of regime change in snow and rain dominated watersheds respectively for brevity the discussion of causes of change in sss is limited to the f 6 values 6 causes of sss change in the snow dominated watersheds in this section we explore the causes of sss changes in the snow dominated watersheds most of these watersheds are in the sierra nevada in the state of california the rocky mountains the high plains the northern great plains and the atlantic region a few watersheds are also located in the pacific coast see figure s18 in si there are other watersheds where snowmelt contributes to streamflow but rainfall is the primary driver in those watersheds in addition to the watershed characteristics changes in temperature snowmelt relationship may also contribute to the changes in the sss in the snow dominated watersheds in this study snow signatures proposed by horner et al 2020 were used to identify the changes in temperature snow relationship the details of these signatures are provided in si text s7 briefly three signatures namely rising limb slope of average snowmelt and average temperature relationship δ s n o w rising limb intercept of average snowmelt and average temperature β s n o w and time to peak were used as snow signatures next we look at how the change in snowmelt dynamics along with other watershed properties may have affected the sss fig 6 shows the important predictor variables that determine the change in f 6 blue and orange solid curves are the probability densities of variables conditioned upon the positive and negative trends for all the watersheds respectively green and red dash curves are the probability densities of variables conditioned upon the positive and negative trend for all the watersheds where the trend was statistically significant several important variables were related to the change in the precipitation statistics the trend in mean storm depth the trend in jas july august september average rainfall depth the trends in average high rainfall duration and depth and the trend in total storm depth an increase in all these statistics is associated with an increase in f 6 for example in watersheds where mean storm depth increased positive changes in f 6 were more likely this is expected because an increase in all of these four variables would directly increase high frequency fluctuations in streamflow the mean storm depth increased in most of the eastern snow dominated watersheds fig 2 it tells us that the increase in f 6 in the eastern snow dominated watersheds might be related to an increase in precipitation mean watershed temperature is another important variable watersheds with warmer temperatures were more likely to exhibit an increase in f 6 it might be related to the fact that in the western usa swe is decreasing at a higher rate in warmer watersheds than that in colder watersheds mote 2006 the disappearance of snow would reduce the contribution of the low frequency components of streamflow and by implication increase the contribution of the high frequency components another temperature related important variable is the trend in amj apr may jun maximum daily temperature the plausible mechanism behind the effect of amj temperature was unclear soil properties that were important in determining the trends in f 6 were sand fraction silt fraction soil conductivity soil depth and depth to bedrock watersheds with sandy and high conductivity soils were more likely to exhibit a decrease in f 6 watersheds with clayey and low conductivity soils were more likely to exhibit an increase in f 6 one of the differences between the watershed with clayey and sandy soils was that in the former the average high rainfall depth increased more significantly in the watersheds with clayey soils the ond oct nov dec temperatures increased moderately whereas in the watersheds with sandy soils the ond temperatures increased significantly also note that in most of the snow dominated watersheds the high rainfall occurs mainly in the winter season these observations lead to the following hypothesis in watersheds with clayey soils an increase in high rainfall depth together with only a moderate increase in winter maximum daily temperature is responsible for an increase in f 6 a moderate increase in winter maximum daily temperature ensures that soil moisture does not decrease significantly in watersheds with sandy soils a decrease or only a moderate increase in high rainfall depth with a large increase in winter maximum daily temperature may be responsible for a significant decrease in soil moisture this decrease in soil moisture can explain the decrease in f 6 finally the trend in δ s n o w and the trend in time to peak were important variables for determining the change in f 6 higher the increase in δ s n o w higher the increase in f 6 higher the decrease in time to peak higher the increase in f 6 both the increase in δ s n o w and the decrease in time to peak suggest an increase in snowmelt rate this in turn implies that water is reaching the river network faster which decreases the contribution of the low frequency component and increases the f 6 values in summary in the snow dominated watersheds changes in rainfall depth and duration the increase in winter ond and the decrease in spring amj temperatures and the change in snowmelt dynamics is responsible for the change in f 6 7 causes of sss changes in the rain dominated watersheds fig 7 shows the conditional probability densities of important variables for the classification of positive and negative trends at the less than 1 month timescale f 6 in rain dominated watersheds some of the important variables are the trend in ond oct nov dec mean maximum daily temperature the trend in median minimum daily temperature and the aridity index the value of f 6 increased in many of the arid watersheds while it decreased in most of the humid watersheds further f 6 increased in the watersheds in which the ond maximum daily temperature increased significantly we hypothesize that the increase in evaporation was more than the increase in rainfall in the arid watersheds which resulted in a decrease in the low frequency components of streamflow in these watersheds it was observed that the arid rain driven watersheds had a higher increase in ond maximum daily temperature fig 2 a higher increase in the number of dry days and a higher increase in jas maximum and minimum daily temperature also changes in average rainfall depth in arid watersheds during the ond and jas months were small not shown fig 7 also shows that an increase in median minimum daily temperature is associated with an increase in f 6 this supports the hypothesis that the decrease in the contribution of the low frequency components in arid watersheds is due to an increase in evaporation a decrease in the low frequency components resulted by implication in an increase in the high frequency components many of the humid watersheds where f 6 decreased are located in the pacific northwest and the gulf coast region where rainfall is more frequent in the winter months it was observed that the ond rainfall depth decreased in most of the humid watersheds and the ond temperature increased moderately in these watersheds these two factors could result in fewer runoff producing rain events and thus explain the decrease in f 6 in these watersheds other observations that support this hypothesis are a decrease in the median storm depth and a decrease in high rainfall duration in most of the watersheds ficklin et al 2016 also reported a decrease in quick runoff in several watersheds located in the pacific northwest and the gulf coast the values of f 3 decreased in almost all the pacific northwest watersheds over the study period fig 4 as discussed above the value of f 3 is partially determined by et an increase in et results in a decrease in f 3 therefore the decrease in f 3 and f 6 in these watersheds suggests an important role of temperature in changing the sss some of the rainfall related variables such as the trend in low rainfall frequency the trends in low rainfall duration and frequency the trend in the number of rain days the low rainfall frequency and the mean rainfall were also important these variables are also related to the aridity and humidity of the watersheds watersheds with low mean rainfall and a larger number of dry days are typically arid the f 6 value also increased in most of the watersheds where the number of rain days decreased the number of dry days increased and the low rainfall duration increased this is expected because these trends indicate an increase in the aridity of these watersheds arid watersheds are known to exhibit high values of f 6 fig 3 fig 7 also shows that in most of the watersheds where f 6 has increased the number of rain days has also decreased some of the soil properties such as sand fraction and the porosity including the fraction of forest were also important variables most of the watersheds with sandy and smaller porosity soils and a large fraction of forest cover exhibited a decrease in f 6 these three variables are correlated since sandy soils are known to be low porosity and ideal to support forests eagleson 1982 it was observed that most of the camels watersheds with sandy soils are located in humid regions with high mean annual rainfall thus the decrease in f 6 in watersheds with sandy soils can be explained as in humid watersheds as discussed above another difference between watersheds with sandy and fine soils was that in the former the phase difference between monthly rainfall and evaporation s d see berghuijs and woods 2016 for details decreased which might have resulted in more rainwater evaporating back to the atmosphere drying of soils and muted response of the watersheds to rainstorms many of the watersheds in the pacific northwest have sandy soils one notable point in the above discussion is that the ond maximum temperature increased in most of the watersheds in humid watersheds the increase was moderate and in arid watersheds the increase was large but this increase had opposite effects on the sss in the humid and arid watersheds in humid watersheds the increase in the ond temperature resulted in an increase in et a decrease in soil moisture and a muted response of the watershed to rainfall which resulted in a decrease in the high frequency components in arid watersheds the increase in the ond temperature resulted in an increase in et and a decrease in the low frequency components which in turn resulted in an increase in the high frequency components thus change in ond temperature directly affects the high frequency components in humid watersheds and only indirectly affects them in arid watersheds one question remains here why the high frequency component is not directly affected by the change in the ond temperature in arid watersheds the reason is that in the majority of the rain driven arid watersheds in the usa rainfall pre dominantly occurs in spring summer months except in california where rain occurs in winter months addor et al 2017a fig 3 thus an increase in et in winter months directly affects only the low frequency component not the high frequency component the high frequency component is formed by the summer rainfall which appears to be unchanged during the study period finally it is possible that change in the rainfall runoff response of a rain driven watershed is responsible for the changes in sss in this study we used a conceptual event based model to simulate the rainfall runoff response of the rain driven camels watersheds the changes in the parameter of the model could indicate a change in the rainfall runoff response of the watershed and could be related to the change in sss however no relation between the changes in the parameters of the rainfall runoff model and sss was observed therefore it is not discussed further see text s8 in si for the details on this analysis 8 summary and conclusions this study analyzed the changes in deseasonalized streamflow statistical structure sss in the camels dataset over the period 1980 2013 water year where sss was defined as the contribution of different frequency components to total streamflow variance the contributions of the different frequency components were computed by spectral analysis specific frequency components considered in this study are listed in table 2 the relationship between the changes in sss and the changes in climatic statistics precipitation and temperature and watershed characteristics were studied further changes in sss from 43 stations across the usa contained in the grdc dataset with the period 1910 2020 water years were also studied the aim of the grdc analysis was to test the robustness of changes in the camels dataset the discussion below is focused on the camels dataset the main conclusions of this study are summarized in table 3 the contribution of greater than 1 year timescales fluctuations f 0 to total streamflow variance was typically very small in the rain driven watersheds but it is substantial in the western snow dominated watersheds where the fraction of snow is greater than 0 4 the contribution of 1 month to 1 year timescale fluctuations f 5 strongly depends upon the contribution of baseflow to total streamflow formation also long term persistence value of d in deseasonalized streamflow time series depends upon the contribution of baseflow low values of baseflow index bfi are associated with weaker long term persistence the contribution of 2 week to 1 month timescale fluctuations f 3 to total streamflow variance appears to be determined by interflow the contribution of high frequency components is mainly determined by the quick flow thus spectral analysis of deseasonalized streamflow time series can be very useful in detecting hydrologic regime changes in a watershed through analysis of streamflow time series in snow dominated watersheds across the usa a clear east west divide was found in terms of change in the sss contributions of slow components such as 4 month to 1 year f 1 and 1 month to 4 month f 2 timescale decreased increased in most of the eastern western watersheds value of f 0 decreased in most of the western watersheds the high frequency components increased in most of the snow dominated watersheds increases in the high frequency components and decreases in the low frequency components in the snow dominated watersheds were related to increases in rainfall in these watersheds but also to increases in ond oct nov dec temperatures it could be concluded that trends in rainfall have significant control over the sss change in the snow dominated watersheds changes in snowmelt temperature relationships also played a role in changing the sss in the snow dominated watersheds in most rain driven watersheds and in the eastern snow dominated watersheds the contribution of less than one month timescale components f 6 was greater than 50 this was particularly the case in the watersheds in the great plains and the mississippi valley where the contribution of low frequency components is very small due to high evapotranspiration et in most of the arid watersheds the values of f 4 contribution of less than 2 week timescale components and f 6 increased these increases may be related to increases in et in these watersheds in winter months which decreased the contribution from low frequency components and in turn increased the contribution from the high frequency components the high frequency fluctuations f 6 decreased in the gulf coast watersheds and the pacific northwestern watersheds the reason for this was also the increase in winter et and decrease in winter rainfall depth in these watersheds in these watersheds the dominant rainfall season is winter therefore an increase in et possibly resulted in a decrease in antecedent soil moisture and overall muted response of these watersheds to rainfall the trends in the contribution of fluctuations at different timescales were also related to soil properties such as soil texture porosity and the fraction of forest further analyses revealed that soil properties were an indicator of change in climatic statistics in the snow dominated watersheds with fine soils high rainfall depth increased and winter maximum daily temperature increased only moderately this is hypothesized to have resulted in an increase in f 6 in these watersheds in the snow dominated watershed with sandy soils a decrease or only a moderate increase in high rainfall depth with a large increase in winter maximum daily temperature is hypothesized to result in a significant decrease in soil moisture and a decrease in f 6 in the rain dominated watersheds with sandy soils f 6 decreased most of the watersheds with sandy soils are in humid regions with high mean annual rainfall another difference between watersheds with sandy and fine soils was that in the former the phase difference between monthly rainfall and evaporation decreased which might have resulted in more rainwater evaporating back into the atmosphere drying of soils and muted response of watersheds to the rainstorms in the snow dominated watersheds change in the temperature snowmelt relationship is responsible at least to some extent for sss change the change in the temperature snowmelt relationship is likely due to changes in spatiotemporal snow statistics and temperature statistics rather than any physical changes in the watersheds although changes in vegetation density might also be responsible for the changes in the rain dominated watersheds the change in the rainfall runoff relationship appears to be negligible we note that the conclusions reported in this study apply only to deseasonalized streamflow time series changes in seasonal components are not studied in this paper nevertheless the results presented in this study with the camels dataset convincingly show that changes in sss have occurred across the usa although the pattern of changes is patchy there is a local spatial structure these changes have consequences for the accurate simulation of streamflow time series in the presence of climate change decreasing the influence of low frequency components can result in a decrease in the accuracy of simulations this is evident in arid watersheds of the great plains where the contribution of low frequency components has always been small and all the models conceptual process based and ml models of streamflow have been reported to perform poorly in these watersheds e g konapala et al 2020 in this study only the effect of climatic statistics changes on sss change has been explored but sss can also change due to natural changes in the land use such as forest disturbance e g goeking and tarboton 2021 the effects of such changes on sss should be the topic of future study moreover we believe that it would be worthwhile to simulate the hydrologic response of the camels watersheds using a detailed process based model to understand the changes in various hydrologic quantities in these watersheds finally the analysis carried out in this study identifies only the variables that play a role in determining the changes in sss the specific mechanisms creating the changes could not be identified using this analysis nevertheless a few hypotheses regarding changes in the hydrologic mechanisms that might have led to the sss change have been proposed data between water years 1980 2013 were used to achieve the objectives though 30 35 years of data are not enough to identify all the changes in sss such data can still reveal the useful pattern of hydrologic change e g ficklin et al 2016 besides it is well known that systematic changes in global temperatures and rainfall patterns have occurred over the study period manabe and broccoli 2020 nevertheless the changes in sss reported in this study can be argued to have occurred due to changes in climatic statistics changes in climatic statistics might be due to natural climate

1941,changes in statistical structure spectral properties of streamflow across the usa due to climate change were studied for water years 1980 2013 the fractionally differenced autoregressive integrated moving average farima model was fit to the deseasonalized streamflow time series to model its statistical structure farima allows the separation of streamflow into low slowly varying and high frequency fast varying components in this study the changes in the contribution of various components to the total streamflow variance were analyzed further the variables affecting these changes were identified using random forest and linear regression results show that in the snow dominated watersheds the contribution of low frequency components to total streamflow variance decreased over the study period and the contribution of high frequency components increased the changes in the snow dominated watersheds were primarily driven by changes in precipitation statistics and changes in snowpack but also by changes in seasonal temperature statistics among the rain driven watersheds the contribution of high frequency components generally increased in arid regions but decreased in humid regions in both humid and arid rain driven watersheds increasing winter temperature appears to be responsible for the change in streamflow statistical structure these results have consequences for the predictability of streamflow in the presence of climate change further the analysis carried out in this study allowed us to understand the plausible changes in watershed hydrologic processes that affect streamflow without using process based or conceptual models keywords streamflow climate change farima spectral analysis snow dominated watersheds rain driven watersheds data availability the data used in study are freely available online and the appropriate references have been provided in the main text 1 introduction 1 1 background the global hydrologic water balance will be impacted directly by climate change milly et al 2005 milly and dunne 2016 mote et al 2018 manabe and broccoli 2020 which will alter streamflows the extent and nature of hydrologic change depend upon several factors including watershed geomorphological characteristics lee and delleur 1972 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 1997 vegetation characteristics soil properties eagleson 1978 the dominant mode of streamflow production wu et al 2021 snowmelt or rain quick flow baseflow etc and changes in vegetation characteristics e g milly 1997 thus a rich variety of responses can be expected from different watersheds due to the change in climate gordon et al 2022 the hydrologic responses of watersheds to climate change need to be understood to devise an effective adaption strategy because of strong feedbacks between various components of a hydrologic system laio et al 2001 porporato et al 2001 rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 rodriguez iturbe et al 2001 climate change can potentially lead to profound changes in the watershed hydrologic regime the hydrologic regime here refers to the interaction between different components of the hydrologic process which produce hydrologic fluxes such as streamflow and evapotranspiration et further the effects of climate change are expected to be observed at different timescales streamflow is the integrated response of a watershed s hydrology which is affected by watershed characteristics that determine the hydrologic regime of the watershed thus studying changes in streamflow characteristics provides clues to understanding the changes in watershed hydrologic regime hydrologists have employed various mathematical models simulation approaches to understand the streamflow response of a watershed at different timescales these models can be broadly classified as process based or conceptual deterministic models beven 2011 stochastic models klemeš 1978 montanari et al 1997 and statistical machine learning models govindaraju 2000 the model that is used depends to some extent upon the spatial scale watershed scale regional scale global scale etc and timescale daily monthly yearly etc at which simulations predictions are required along with the purpose of simulations predictions policy making scientific hypothesis testing for most of the models used some parameters of the model need to be calibrated against observations the values of calibrated parameters depend upon climate statistics mean annual precipitation depth precipitation frequency seasonal mean temperatures etc and watershed properties temporal non stationarity introduced by climate change milly et al 2008 means that the calibrated parameters depend upon the observation period in fact climate change may directly affect the physical characteristics of a watershed via a change in vegetation characteristics milly 1997 this introduces additional uncertainty in model projections predictions in the presence of climate change for example stephens et al 2020 showed that changes in rainfall statistics along with changes in atmospheric co2 can change soil moisture statistics it may take a few years for a calibrated hydrologic model to adjust to the new equilibrium conditions examples of climate change impacting watershed hydrologic characteristics include changes in snowpack in the western usa e g knowles et al 2006 mote et al 2005 mote 2006 belmecheri et al 2016 berg and hall 2017 and change in baseflow and stormflow e g ficklin et al 2016 in summary the problem is that climate non stationarities may make a hydrologic model calibrated and validated against historical observations unreliable for prediction simulation in changed conditions some strategies have been proposed to address this problem klemeš 1986 proposed differential split sample testing to test the robustness of a model under change but such strategies may not be useful in case of large changes especially if the change in a watershed is toward a drier hydrologic regime stephens et al 2020 singh et al 2011 proposed a space time symmetry approach under an uncertainty framework to estimate streamflows in a watershed in the presence of regime change the idea of space time symmetry has been demonstrated to be useful at decadal timescales using the budyko framework e g sivapalan et al 2011 the relative success of machine learning ml methods in estimating streamflows at gauged and ungauged locations at a daily timescale kratzert et al 2018 suggests that there is a considerable amount of hydrologic information shared between different watersheds but note that data from different watersheds may also introduce disinformation beven 2020 however there is limited evidence of the successful application of space time symmetry at a daily timescale see singh et al 2011 especially under a changing climate therefore there is a need to further test this idea such a testing procedure would require identifying watersheds that have undergone hydrologic regime change this was the main motivation for this work 1 2 streamflow statistical structure and objectives of the study in this study changes in the streamflow statistical structure sss were studied recently it has been shown that sss is also indicative of streamflow dynamics to some extent betterle et al 2019 which further justifies studying the changes in sss to understand the effect of climate change on the hydrologic regime further studying the changes in sss can help identify the changes in flow paths and strengthening weakening of different flow paths in a watershed using just the available streamflow data streamflow time series typically exhibit long term persistence hurst 1951 meaning that autocorrelations in streamflow decrease very slowly with time lag studying the statistical structure of a stationary time series is equivalent to studying its spectral properties previous work has shown that the power spectral density psd of streamflow time series scales linearly on a log log graph tessier et al 1996 that is h ω ω α h where h ω denotes psd at angular frequency ω t 1 and α h denotes the slope of the scaling relationship also a typical streamflow time series exhibits two scaling regimes two different values of α h with scale break occurring between 1 and 20 days hirpa et al 2010 kim et al 2016 and yang and bowling 2014 analyzed the changes in streamflow psd to study the effects of urbanization on the hydrologic regime in the south korean watersheds and the great lakes region respectively specifically kim et al 2016 studied the changes in the slopes of two scaling regimes and the change in scale break point bras and rodriguez iturbe 1993 and chow 1978 also illustrated the usefulness of spectral analysis in streamflow time series analysis gudmundsson et al 2011 studied the contribution of low frequency components specifically greater than 1 year timescale to total streamflow variance in several european watersheds but did not examine the temporal changes similarly zaerpour et al 2021 defined the streamflow regime based on annual flow characteristics but neglected high frequency fluctuations further several studies have reported that streamflow dynamics is deterministic chaotic e g sivakumar et al 2001 sivakumar and singh 2012 rather than linear stochastic but these studies have been criticized because of the small lengths of streamflow time series used to determine chaos e g schertzer et al 2002 koutsoyiannis 2006 a systematic analysis of the changes in sss over time across the contiguous usa has not been reported to the best of the authors knowledge the objectives of this study are as follows 1 to conduct a spectral analysis of streamflow time series in watersheds across the usa 2 to identify temporal changes in those spectral signatures 3 to identify the spatial patterns of changes in sss and 4 to investigate the relationship between sss change climatic statistics such as annual mean temperature and rainfall and watershed attributes other researchers have studied the changes in hydrologic regime due to climate change but their focus has been on a few of the hydrologic processes or fluxes such as baseflow soil moisture annual streamflow etc e g ficklin et al 2016 studying the change in spectral properties of daily streamflow time series can provide holistic insight into changes in hydrologic regime because 1 streamflow is an integrated response of several hydrologic processes 2 to some extent studying the changes in spectral properties allow us to understand the changes in various hydrologic flow paths for example changes in the low frequency components of a streamflow time series can inform us about the changes in baseflow and snowpack changes in the high frequency components can inform us about the changes in soil moisture surface flow and interflow processes note that soil moisture affects the low frequency component also the changes in sss can occur due to changes in climatic statistics and or changes in watershed characteristics which interact with each other non linearly and may even cancel each other s effect boisramé et al 2017 therefore it is likely that watersheds that are close to each other in space may exhibit different changes in sss even though the effect of climate on the watersheds is similar in this scenario analysis across a large number of watersheds provides a more holistic understanding thus this work aims to contribute to our understanding of the impact of climate change on the hydrologic regime and hydrologic flow paths by studying the changes in sss across a large number of watersheds in the usa another feature of this work is that the analyses are based only on observed streamflow data no process based models have been used in the analysis process based models require a large dataset for parameter calibration typically the data include rainfall time series which contain uncertainty due to measurement errors and spatial variability which is difficult to capture bárdossy and anwar 2022 preprint also there is structural uncertainty associated with process based models beven and smith 2015 this is not to say that the process based models are not useful for change detection but that the analysis presented in this study can complement an analysis carried out using the process based models in what follows section 2 describes the methodology used in this study section 3 describes the study area and data along with changes in a few climatic statistics across the usa section 4 describes the sss across the usa during the first 10 years of study and describes how different hydrologic processes may contribute to sss formation section 5 discusses the changes in sss sections 6 and 7 discuss the relationships of changes in sss with the changes in climatic statistics and watershed attributes section 8 summarizes and concludes the paper 2 modeling description 2 1 farima model the fractionally differenced auto regressive integrated moving average farima montanari et al 1997 model was used to represent the statistical properties of streamflow time series farima is a time series model which is known to capture streamflow structure very well montanari et al 1997 montanari et al 2000 in this study the farima models were fitted to streamflow time series to estimate the noise free psd of the time series see priestley 1982 for a discussion of the issues of noise in psd estimation the general form of the farima model is 1 φ p b 1 b d x t ψ q b t where x t denotes streamflow at time step t b denotes the backward shift operator such that b x t x t 1 d denotes a parameter of the model that takes a value between 0 and 0 5 for streamflow time series and t denotes uncorrelated white noise φ p b and ψ q b denote p t h order autoregressive ar and q t h order moving average ma polynomials respectively 2 φ p b i 0 p ϕ i b i ϕ 0 1 3 ψ q b i 0 q ψ i b i ψ 0 1 where ϕ i and ψ i are ar and ma parameters when d 0 the farima model degenerates to an arma model when d takes a positive integer value it degenerates to the classic arima model promoted by box and jenkins 1970 for a typical streamflow time series d takes a fractional value between 0 and 0 5 due to long term persistence in the time series a detailed discussion of the interpretation of the farima model parameters is given in supplementary information si text s1 and several other texts e g granger and joyeux 1980 beran 1994 parameters of the farima models were estimated using a similar method as that of montanari et al 1997 details of the parameter estimation method are provided in si text s2 to validate the farima models the autocorrelations of the obtained residual time series were analyzed the results are shown in si text s3 figures s3 s11 for most of the models the autocorrelations at any lag were statistically indistinguishable from zero for a few models however the autocorrelations were greater than 0 15 at a few lags indicating that the farima model could not capture the statistical structure of streamflow time series in the corresponding watersheds therefore these watersheds were removed from the subsequent analysis the conditions imposed in this study are typically appropriate for model validation see montanari et al 1997 the residuals however did not follow the gaussian distribution for most of the models but as pointed out by montanari et al 1997 and the references therein deviation from gaussianity does not affect the parameter estimation of farima models after fitting the farima model to a time series a noise free estimate of the psd of the time series could be obtained using eq s4 of si in this study the changes in normalized psd npsd were considered npsd is obtained by dividing the psd by the total variance of the process where total variance is nothing but the total area under the psd 2 2 measurement of change in power spectral density to analyze the changes in sss a moving window approach was taken with a window length of 10 years and with moving step of 3 years table 1 thus the study period 1980 2013 water years was broken up into 9 overlapping windows of 10 years each the farima models were fit to deseasonalized time series for different moving windows thus as many sets of farima parameters were obtained as the number of moving windows each set of parameters resulted in an npsd to detect the changes in sss the trends in area under npsd for different ranges of frequencies were computed fig 1 the frequency range was split into five different regions units in cycles per day c p d 1 less than 1 365 c p d greater than 1 year timescales 2 1 365 to 1 120 c p d 4 month to 1 year timescales 3 1 120 to 1 30 c p d 1 month to 4 month timescales 4 1 30 to 1 15 c p d 2 week to 1 month timescales and 5 greater than 1 15 c p d less than 2 week timescale for the ease of discussion two more frequency regions were used 1 365 to 1 30 c p d 1 month to 1 year timescales and greater than 1 30 c p d less than 1 month timescales denoting npsd by f ω the area under npsd in a given frequency region ω 1 ω 2 is 4 f ω 1 ω 2 ω 1 ω 2 f ω d ω which is equal to the contribution to the total variance of the components with frequency between ω 1 and ω 2 since the area under npsd is equal to 1 an increase in the contribution of high frequency components implies a decrease in the contribution of low frequency components in what follows area under npsd in the frequency region greater than 1 year timescale will be denoted by f 0 similarly area under npsd in the frequency region 4 month to 1 year timescales 1 month to 4 month timescales 2 week to 1 month timescales less than 2 week timescales 1 month to 1 year timescales and less than 1 month timescales will be denoted by f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 and f 6 respectively these notations are listed in table 2 for convenience let f i j ω i ω i 1 be the area under f ω for i t h frequency region and j t h time window the trend in f i j ω i ω i 1 across time periods were estimated with a linear fit f i j ω i ω i 1 γ j c where γ is the trend and c is the intercept the sign of γ indicates whether the contribution of a frequency region to total streamflow variance is increasing positive γ or decreasing negative γ over time the magnitude of γ indicates the extent of change a larger smaller magnitude of γ implies a larger smaller change a trend was considered statistically significant if the p value of the slope γ was less than or equal to 0 05 we refer to this test as the first significance test in addition the statistical significance of each trend was computed by another method using the posterior probability distribution of the farima parameters see si text s2 for details of the posterior distribution estimation eqs s10 and s11 the posterior probability distribution of npsd was obtained this in turn was used to compute the probability distribution of the fraction of area under each frequency region of npsd see fig 1 for frequency regions for all the time windows thus for each frequency region we had probability distribution of f i j ω i ω i 1 for the first and last time windows let these probability distributions be denoted by p 1 f and p 2 f with respective mean values m 1 and m 2 for the trend to be significant we imposed the condition that m 1 and m 2 should belong to different statistical populations toward this end a probability p s was computed 5 p s p 1 f m 2 p 2 f m 1 2 m 1 m 2 p 1 f m 2 p 2 f m 1 2 m 1 m 2 for the trend to be significant p s should be less than 0 05 we refer to this test as the second significance test in summary a trend was deemed statistically significant only if it came out to be significant using both first and second statistical significance tests this means that the change in sss should be consistent in time and the sss in the first and last time windows should be significantly different the first and second significance tests collectively ensure that the changes in sss are robust if the change in sss in a watershed is significant according to first significant test it is still possible that the first and last time windows have similar regimes such a change is unlikely to be robust given the 30 years of data used in this study see below for more on the dataset the second significance test helps us identify and discard such cases changes in sss were gradual in some watersheds and sudden in other watersheds therefore the mann kendall test could not be reliably applied to many of these watersheds for the sake of completeness however we still applied the mann kendall trend test we found that of all the watersheds for which changes in sss were statistically significant according to first and second significance tests 70 of the watersheds had statistically significant changes according to the mann kendall test also for the majority of the remaining 30 watersheds for which the mann kendall test concluded that changes were statistically insignificant the changes were abrupt some plots illustrating the changes in sss are shown in si text s4 figures s12 s14 these plots also illustrate the robustness of the changes in sss reported in this study 2 3 different geographical regions of the usa and rain and snow dominated watersheds for the sake of discussion reference to different geographical regions of the usa will be made the spatial extent of these regions is shown in fig a1 appendix a the rain dominated watersheds are the ones located in the pacific region except the sierra nevada the gulf coast the central and the southern great plains the central and the southern mississippi valley and one watershed in the atlantic coast snow dominated watersheds are the ones located in the sierra nevada the rocky mountains the high plains the northern great plains and the great lakes region a few watersheds in the pacific northwest are also snow dominated the watersheds located in the northern mississippi valley could not be classified as either snow or rain dominated 2 4 methodology for relating changes in statistical structure of streamflows with climatic statistics and watershed attributes to understand the changes in ssss statistical methods were used first the variables related to the change in f i i 0 1 6 were identified second possible mechanisms via which each variable might have affected the f i values were hypothesized watersheds were divided into two groups snow dominated and rain dominated watersheds the analysis was carried out separately for these two groups note that many of the snow dominated watersheds also experience rain but the sss is significantly controlled by snow in these watersheds further the only difference between the analyses of snow and rain dominated watersheds is that for snow dominated rain dominated watersheds some predictor variables exclusive to snow dominated rain dominated watersheds were derived other predictor variables were identical for all the watersheds the locations of snow and rain dominated watersheds used are shown in figures s18 and s19 respectively the variables explored include static catchment attributes including soil properties geological properties topography and average climate changes in climatic statistics were also explored as possible causes of change in f i values these include variables related to the changes in precipitation and change in temperature for example change in total annual precipitation depth change in ond oct nov dec total precipitation depth and change in mean annual temperature changes in climatic variables were computed using the same moving windows as for the case of change in sss table 1 additionally variables capturing snowmelt dynamics in snow dominated watersheds and rainfall runoff dynamics in rain dominated watersheds were also used the details of these variables are given in si texts s7 and s8 a list of all the variables used in this study is included in table s1 text s9 in si variables important for explaining the change in f i were identified using the random forest algorithm breiman 2001 and simple linear regression the random forest has the advantage that it can identify non linear relationships between two variables however we found that both the random forest and linear regression yielded the same variables as important a variable was considered important using simple linear regression if the regression coefficient was significantly different from 0 at a 5 significance level two linear fits were made for each combination of δ f i and predictor variable 1 using all the watersheds and 2 using only the watershed for which δ f i was statistically significant according to both first and second significance test all the variables for which the slope of either of the two linear fits was significant at the 5 significance level were considered important we found that even though linear regression and random forest could identify the important predictor variables there was a large scatter in the relationship between δ f i with other predictor variables essentially the linear fit may have a statistically significant slope but not all the watersheds may satisfy the relationship suggested by the line a similar argument applies to the random forest algorithm therefore probability densities of important variables conditioned upon the event that δ f i was positive or negative were plotted to understand the effect of a variable on δ f i this procedure is similar to computing mutual information between δ f i and a variable but more transparent as shown below the aim of this analysis was to identify what characteristics of a watershed are related to positive or negative changes in f i for example we observed that arid and humid watersheds exhibited different kinds of changes in sss 3 study area and data to achieve the objectives of this study catchments attributes and meteorology for large sample studies camels dataset addor et al 2017a b was used the camels dataset was chosen because it contains hydro meteorological data for a large number of watersheds a total of 671 across the contiguous usa also the camels watersheds are unregulated and free of anthropogenic land use changes such as deforestation the time period of the data is water years 1980 2013 in this study we included watersheds that had at least 30 years of complete data there were a total of 614 such watersheds exploratory analysis shows that significant warming has occurred in the camels watersheds across the usa fig 2 shows the trends in various climatic variables over the study period detailed results of this figure are discussed in si text s5 briefly fig 2 shows that both the temperature and precipitation statistics changed across the usa since temperature and precipitation both have strong control over sss some of the camels watersheds are likely to have undergone a sss change an increase in atmospheric co2 can also result in changes in vegetation characteristics such as water use efficiency donohue et al 2013 which in turn may affect the sss significant increases in temperatures along with the fact that global average co2 has increased over the period 1980 to 2014 from 339 ppm in 1980 to 397 ppm in 2014 dlugokencky and tans 2022 gml noaa gov ccgg trends accessed on 17 mar 2022 indicates that a significant change in climate has occurred during the study period beyond the natural climate variability thirty years of data available in the camels dataset are not enough to robustly capture the impacts of climate change therefore data available at global runoff data center grdc were also used in this study this dataset contains 110 years 1910 2020 water years of complete without any missing values streamflow data from 43 stations across the usa the aim of using the grdc dataset was to test if the changes in sss are still observed when longer periods of data are used and to understand the impact of data length on the results the main focus of this study is to understand the changes in sss on the camels dataset as it has been used in many large sample studies thus the scope of this paper is limited to the short term changes in sss in the camels dataset which are likely to occur because of both natural and anthropogenic changes in climate the results obtained with the grdc data are presented in si text s6 figures s15 and s16 and will be discussed sparingly in what follows 4 spatial distribution of streamflow statistical structure sss in the usa fig 3 a b c d shows the contributions of different frequency regions to streamflow variance in the camels watersheds during the first time window 1980 1989 water years the aim of this section is to understand the spatial variability of sss across the usa which would put the changes in sss in proper context for the convenience of discussion reference to different geographical regions of the usa will be made see fig a1 in appendix a the contribution of greater than 1 year timescale components to total streamflow variance f 0 was less than 10 in most of the rain dominated watersheds of the eastern usa and the pacific northwest fig 3c large contributions from this frequency region were found in some snow dominated watersheds in the rocky mountains region the high plains the sierra mountains in california and the pacific coast the contribution of the 1 month to 1 year timescale component f 5 fig 3b was very small in the central and southern great plains and the mississippi valley compared to that in other regions the highest values of f 5 greater than 50 were found in the snow dominated watersheds of the rocky mountains and the high plains the f 5 values ranged from 25 to 50 in the pacific northwest and the atlantic coast the contribution of baseflow to total streamflow appears to be an important factor in determining the values of f 5 since the values of f 5 follow the broadscale pattern of the baseflow index bfi see fig 4 in addor et al 2017a the bfi values were below 0 5 in the great plains and the mississippi valley greater than 0 6 in the rocky mountains and the high plains and between 0 40 and 0 60 in the pacific northwest and the atlantic coastal region moreover the scatter plot not shown of the bfi and f 5 shows that as the bfi increases from 0 to 0 4 f 5 value also increases interflow might also contribute to the 1 month to 1 year frequency region the contributions of less than 1 month timescales component to total streamflow variance f 6 were small 25 in the cold snow dominated watersheds of the western usa fig 3a in the pacific northwest and the pacific coast f 6 values were between 25 and 75 but mostly greater than 50 in most of the eastern usa watersheds the contribution of this frequency component was greater than 50 in the great plains and the mississippi valley the contribution of this component was greater than 75 in many watersheds these are dry watersheds where most of the rainwater evaporates back into the atmosphere and only a few storms reach the river network therefore the contribution of low high frequency components is very low high in these watersheds it is noteworthy that in the snow dominated watersheds with the fraction of snow 0 40 fraction of precipitation falling as snow the value of f 6 increased with an increase in mean rainfall not shown in the rain driven watersheds a linear relationship between the slope of the flow duration curve fdc addor et al 2017a and f 6 was found slope 0 054 p value 0 0045 r 2 0 033 smaller slopes of fdc imply smaller variability in streamflow thus the negative correlation between the fdc slope and the contribution of the high frequency component indicates that watersheds with less variation in streamflow values exhibit more contributions from the high frequency components for example in ephemeral streams streamflow variation is low as it stays dry during most of the water year therefore the low high frequency component is very small large the contribution of the 2 week to 1 month timescale component to total streamflow variance f 3 was very small for most of the watersheds fig 3d but there exists a cluster of watersheds in the pacific northwest where f 3 values were greater than 20 in fact in most of the pacific northwestern watersheds f 3 values were greater than 15 the f 3 values were greater than 15 in several eastern snow dominated watersheds also it was observed that f 3 was positively correlated with mean precipitation r 2 0 206 p value 0 and negatively correlated with potential evapotranspiration pet r 2 0 115 p value 0 this indicates that f 3 values are high in humid watersheds with high total precipitation and low et further f 3 was negatively correlated with both low rainfall frequency r 2 0 157 p value 0 and high rainfall frequency r 2 0 093 p value 0 here high rainfall frequency in a watershed was computed as the fraction of days when rainfall was 5 times greater than the mean rainfall similarly low rainfall frequency in a watershed was computed as the fraction of days when rainfall was below 1 mm it indicates that in watersheds where rainfall event characteristics are such that it allows enough water to stay in the soils for a long time compared to the timescale of quick flow and percolation the f 3 values are high these results indicate that slow interflow may be responsible for creating the 2 week to 1 month timescales component wu et al 2021 showed that lateral preferential flow is an important streamflow generation mechanism in pacific northwestern watersheds fig 3e shows the spatial variation of the parameter d in camels watersheds the parameter d is related to the hurst exponent h by the relation h d 0 5 there was a large spatial variation in the values of d but some general patterns were observed the very high values of d 0 30 were typically observed in the western snow dominated watersheds where the contribution of low frequency components was significant in most of the eastern rain driven watersheds the d values were less than 0 30 there was a strong linear relationship between bfi and d value slope 0 22 p value 0 r 2 0 23 also the linear relationship was stronger when bfi increased from 0 to 0 25 at very low values of bfi the d values were close to 0 this indicates that the baseflow is the essential factor for the existence of long term persistence in streamflow time series many of the watersheds in the pacific northwest the great lakes and the atlantic coast region had d values less than 0 10 despite having moderately high values of bfi 0 40 the reason for such small values of d in these regions is unclear mudelsee 2007 argued that long term persistence in streamflow time series may also be a result of the aggregation of several short memory processes granger 1980 in a watershed and showed that the value of d increases with increasing drainage area as one moves downstream in a river network therefore it is also reasonable to expect that river networks with large drainage areas may show higher d value in their corresponding streamflow time series such a relation between drainage area and d however was not observed in this study note that this does not contradict the hypothesis of mudelsee 2007 it can be concluded that long timescale fluctuations and long term persistence even in a deseasonalized streamflow time series are determined by the processes such as baseflow and the fraction of snow high frequency components are determined by quick flow interflow and et note that other researchers have reported higher contributions of the low frequency components to streamflow e g gudmundsson et al 2011 compared to those reported in this study this is due to the seasonal component of the hydrologic cycle the seasonal component accounts for the annual cycle and contributes significantly to low frequency fluctuations in this study the seasonal component had been removed from the streamflow time series therefore f 0 values came out to be smaller 5 changes in streamflow statistical structure sss as measured by changes in npsd fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of trends in f ω i ω i 1 for short timescale contributions less than 1 month f 6 2 week to 1 month f 3 and less than 2 week f 4 overall the spatial distribution of trends is patchy but a weak spatial structure is still visible such that watersheds with positive negative changes tend to be clustered together in small groups this is especially true for the watersheds located in the pacific northwest the gulf coast the atlantic coast and the great lakes region see fig a1 in appendix a for a reference to these geographical regions it indicates that the process es that has caused these changes is spatially correlated change in climatic statistics seems to be one of the causes but climate change alone cannot explain these changes since the correlation length of these trends is significantly smaller than the correlation length of trends in climatic variables such as temperature and rainfall fig 2 further it implies that the effect of climate change on the sss is strongly modulated by watershed characteristics such as soil properties and geomorphological characteristics this will be explored in subsequent sections in the grdc dataset where analysis was carried out with 110 years of data the changes in sss were less patchy figures s15 and s16 this means that the long term changes in sss are dominantly controlled by changes in climate and that watershed characteristics play a very small role this may be simply because of the larger magnitude of change in climatic statistics over a longer time period most of the snow dominated watersheds in the eastern usa located in the northern atlantic coastal region and the state of michigan exhibited positive trends in f 6 and f 4 in the western snow dominated watersheds both negative and positive trends in f 6 and f 4 were observed watersheds with negative trends were mostly located in the high plains the trends in f 3 were positive in most of the rocky mountain watersheds and negative in the eastern snow dominated watersheds but the magnitudes of the trend were very small compared to the magnitudes of trend in f 4 overall it can be concluded that the contribution of high frequency components to total variance has increased over the study period in the majority of the snow dominated watersheds with the exception of the high plains several different mechanisms are plausible that could affect this change 1 an increase in runoff producing rainfall events because of snow to rain transition e g knowles et al 2006 2 a change in temperature snow relationship horner et al 2020 3 a change in snow storage including spatial distribution belmecheri et al 2016 berg and hall 2017 and 4 a change in temperature regime mote et al 2005 mote 2006 it is likely that the combination of these mechanisms rather than one individual mechanism is responsible for the changes the same trends in f 3 and f 6 were seen in the grdc dataset in the snow dominated watersheds see si figure s15 there were two watersheds in the eastern snow dominated region in the grdc dataset where the trends in f 4 were negative as opposed to the positive trends in f 4 in the majority of the camels dataset in the same region in the rain driven watersheds other than spatial clustering of positive trends with positive trends and that of negative trends with negative trends a few other patterns are visible most of the humid watersheds located in the pacific northwest region and the gulf coast region showed a negative trend in f 6 but the trend in f 4 was positive in many of the watersheds in the pacific northwest while the trend in f 4 was negative in the gulf coast overall it appears that these humid watersheds are becoming drier which is possible due to the changes in rainfall statistics in these watersheds another possibility is that the change in evapotranspiration statistics in these watersheds is caused by the change in temperature which in turn might have changed the soil moisture dynamics a decrease in mean soil moisture in humid watersheds may result in a decrease in the contribution of high frequency components to streamflow this will be discussed in subsequent sections in the great plains both increasing and decreasing trends in f 4 and f 6 were observed the trends in f 3 showed two clear patterns 1 most of the statistically significant trends were negative in the watersheds located in the pacific and the atlantic coastal regions and 2 most of the statistically significant trends in the rocky mountains the great plains the mississippi valley and the gulf coast were positive but several negative trends were also visible in this region the trends in f 3 were of small magnitude compared to those in f 4 and f 5 this is because the values of f 3 were very small in most of the watersheds to begin with nevertheless the f 3 values have decreased in almost all the pacific region watersheds since the f 3 values were very small in all the watersheds across the usa the changes in f 3 were expected to be highly variable in space therefore the presence of only negative changes in the f 3 values in the pacific region watersheds indicates a significant systematic and common causal mechanism fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of the trends in the contribution of long timescale fluctuations greater than 1 year f 0 4 month to 1 year f 1 and 1 month to 4 month f 2 timescales similar to short timescale trends a weak spatial clustering of positive trends with positive trends and negative trends with negative trends were observed the magnitude of the trends in f 0 was larger in the watersheds located in the western usa in most of the western snow dominated watersheds the value of f 0 decreased and the magnitudes of decrease were relatively large but the trends were statistically significant only in three watersheds which might be due to the small magnitude of f 0 value there is some spatial variability in the f 0 in the eastern usa snow dominated watersheds this is explained by the fact that in the eastern snow dominated watersheds the contribution of components at greater than 1 year timescales is smaller the values of f 1 and f 2 decreased in most of the eastern snow dominated watersheds the value of f 1 increased in all the snow dominated watersheds in the high plains while it decreased in many of the rocky mountain watersheds in the grdc dataset the value of f 0 increased in the western snow dominated dominated watersheds see si figure s16 this suggests that the decrease in f 0 observed in the camels dataset in this region is the result of the recent changes in climatic statistics i e the decline in the snowpack snow to rain transition etc rather than a long term trend most of the rain dominated watersheds in the pacific northwest exhibited positive trends in f 0 and f 1 and negative trends in f 2 similarly most of the watersheds in the pacific coast exhibited negative trends in f 0 though trend was statistically significant only for one watershed the trends in f 0 f 1 and f 2 were positive in most of the gulf coast watersheds most of the rain dominated watersheds in the great plains exhibited a decrease in f 0 f 1 and f 2 but there were several watersheds in this region where f 0 f 1 and f 2 increased in summary sss has changed in many of the watersheds across the usa over the study period there is some spatial structure in the sss change watersheds close to each other show similar types of changes the spatial structure of changes in snow dominated watersheds is stronger than that in rain dominated watersheds also the western and the eastern snow dominated watersheds showed some differences in trends in long timescale components the next two sections focus on the causes of regime change in snow and rain dominated watersheds respectively for brevity the discussion of causes of change in sss is limited to the f 6 values 6 causes of sss change in the snow dominated watersheds in this section we explore the causes of sss changes in the snow dominated watersheds most of these watersheds are in the sierra nevada in the state of california the rocky mountains the high plains the northern great plains and the atlantic region a few watersheds are also located in the pacific coast see figure s18 in si there are other watersheds where snowmelt contributes to streamflow but rainfall is the primary driver in those watersheds in addition to the watershed characteristics changes in temperature snowmelt relationship may also contribute to the changes in the sss in the snow dominated watersheds in this study snow signatures proposed by horner et al 2020 were used to identify the changes in temperature snow relationship the details of these signatures are provided in si text s7 briefly three signatures namely rising limb slope of average snowmelt and average temperature relationship δ s n o w rising limb intercept of average snowmelt and average temperature β s n o w and time to peak were used as snow signatures next we look at how the change in snowmelt dynamics along with other watershed properties may have affected the sss fig 6 shows the important predictor variables that determine the change in f 6 blue and orange solid curves are the probability densities of variables conditioned upon the positive and negative trends for all the watersheds respectively green and red dash curves are the probability densities of variables conditioned upon the positive and negative trend for all the watersheds where the trend was statistically significant several important variables were related to the change in the precipitation statistics the trend in mean storm depth the trend in jas july august september average rainfall depth the trends in average high rainfall duration and depth and the trend in total storm depth an increase in all these statistics is associated with an increase in f 6 for example in watersheds where mean storm depth increased positive changes in f 6 were more likely this is expected because an increase in all of these four variables would directly increase high frequency fluctuations in streamflow the mean storm depth increased in most of the eastern snow dominated watersheds fig 2 it tells us that the increase in f 6 in the eastern snow dominated watersheds might be related to an increase in precipitation mean watershed temperature is another important variable watersheds with warmer temperatures were more likely to exhibit an increase in f 6 it might be related to the fact that in the western usa swe is decreasing at a higher rate in warmer watersheds than that in colder watersheds mote 2006 the disappearance of snow would reduce the contribution of the low frequency components of streamflow and by implication increase the contribution of the high frequency components another temperature related important variable is the trend in amj apr may jun maximum daily temperature the plausible mechanism behind the effect of amj temperature was unclear soil properties that were important in determining the trends in f 6 were sand fraction silt fraction soil conductivity soil depth and depth to bedrock watersheds with sandy and high conductivity soils were more likely to exhibit a decrease in f 6 watersheds with clayey and low conductivity soils were more likely to exhibit an increase in f 6 one of the differences between the watershed with clayey and sandy soils was that in the former the average high rainfall depth increased more significantly in the watersheds with clayey soils the ond oct nov dec temperatures increased moderately whereas in the watersheds with sandy soils the ond temperatures increased significantly also note that in most of the snow dominated watersheds the high rainfall occurs mainly in the winter season these observations lead to the following hypothesis in watersheds with clayey soils an increase in high rainfall depth together with only a moderate increase in winter maximum daily temperature is responsible for an increase in f 6 a moderate increase in winter maximum daily temperature ensures that soil moisture does not decrease significantly in watersheds with sandy soils a decrease or only a moderate increase in high rainfall depth with a large increase in winter maximum daily temperature may be responsible for a significant decrease in soil moisture this decrease in soil moisture can explain the decrease in f 6 finally the trend in δ s n o w and the trend in time to peak were important variables for determining the change in f 6 higher the increase in δ s n o w higher the increase in f 6 higher the decrease in time to peak higher the increase in f 6 both the increase in δ s n o w and the decrease in time to peak suggest an increase in snowmelt rate this in turn implies that water is reaching the river network faster which decreases the contribution of the low frequency component and increases the f 6 values in summary in the snow dominated watersheds changes in rainfall depth and duration the increase in winter ond and the decrease in spring amj temperatures and the change in snowmelt dynamics is responsible for the change in f 6 7 causes of sss changes in the rain dominated watersheds fig 7 shows the conditional probability densities of important variables for the classification of positive and negative trends at the less than 1 month timescale f 6 in rain dominated watersheds some of the important variables are the trend in ond oct nov dec mean maximum daily temperature the trend in median minimum daily temperature and the aridity index the value of f 6 increased in many of the arid watersheds while it decreased in most of the humid watersheds further f 6 increased in the watersheds in which the ond maximum daily temperature increased significantly we hypothesize that the increase in evaporation was more than the increase in rainfall in the arid watersheds which resulted in a decrease in the low frequency components of streamflow in these watersheds it was observed that the arid rain driven watersheds had a higher increase in ond maximum daily temperature fig 2 a higher increase in the number of dry days and a higher increase in jas maximum and minimum daily temperature also changes in average rainfall depth in arid watersheds during the ond and jas months were small not shown fig 7 also shows that an increase in median minimum daily temperature is associated with an increase in f 6 this supports the hypothesis that the decrease in the contribution of the low frequency components in arid watersheds is due to an increase in evaporation a decrease in the low frequency components resulted by implication in an increase in the high frequency components many of the humid watersheds where f 6 decreased are located in the pacific northwest and the gulf coast region where rainfall is more frequent in the winter months it was observed that the ond rainfall depth decreased in most of the humid watersheds and the ond temperature increased moderately in these watersheds these two factors could result in fewer runoff producing rain events and thus explain the decrease in f 6 in these watersheds other observations that support this hypothesis are a decrease in the median storm depth and a decrease in high rainfall duration in most of the watersheds ficklin et al 2016 also reported a decrease in quick runoff in several watersheds located in the pacific northwest and the gulf coast the values of f 3 decreased in almost all the pacific northwest watersheds over the study period fig 4 as discussed above the value of f 3 is partially determined by et an increase in et results in a decrease in f 3 therefore the decrease in f 3 and f 6 in these watersheds suggests an important role of temperature in changing the sss some of the rainfall related variables such as the trend in low rainfall frequency the trends in low rainfall duration and frequency the trend in the number of rain days the low rainfall frequency and the mean rainfall were also important these variables are also related to the aridity and humidity of the watersheds watersheds with low mean rainfall and a larger number of dry days are typically arid the f 6 value also increased in most of the watersheds where the number of rain days decreased the number of dry days increased and the low rainfall duration increased this is expected because these trends indicate an increase in the aridity of these watersheds arid watersheds are known to exhibit high values of f 6 fig 3 fig 7 also shows that in most of the watersheds where f 6 has increased the number of rain days has also decreased some of the soil properties such as sand fraction and the porosity including the fraction of forest were also important variables most of the watersheds with sandy and smaller porosity soils and a large fraction of forest cover exhibited a decrease in f 6 these three variables are correlated since sandy soils are known to be low porosity and ideal to support forests eagleson 1982 it was observed that most of the camels watersheds with sandy soils are located in humid regions with high mean annual rainfall thus the decrease in f 6 in watersheds with sandy soils can be explained as in humid watersheds as discussed above another difference between watersheds with sandy and fine soils was that in the former the phase difference between monthly rainfall and evaporation s d see berghuijs and woods 2016 for details decreased which might have resulted in more rainwater evaporating back to the atmosphere drying of soils and muted response of the watersheds to rainstorms many of the watersheds in the pacific northwest have sandy soils one notable point in the above discussion is that the ond maximum temperature increased in most of the watersheds in humid watersheds the increase was moderate and in arid watersheds the increase was large but this increase had opposite effects on the sss in the humid and arid watersheds in humid watersheds the increase in the ond temperature resulted in an increase in et a decrease in soil moisture and a muted response of the watershed to rainfall which resulted in a decrease in the high frequency components in arid watersheds the increase in the ond temperature resulted in an increase in et and a decrease in the low frequency components which in turn resulted in an increase in the high frequency components thus change in ond temperature directly affects the high frequency components in humid watersheds and only indirectly affects them in arid watersheds one question remains here why the high frequency component is not directly affected by the change in the ond temperature in arid watersheds the reason is that in the majority of the rain driven arid watersheds in the usa rainfall pre dominantly occurs in spring summer months except in california where rain occurs in winter months addor et al 2017a fig 3 thus an increase in et in winter months directly affects only the low frequency component not the high frequency component the high frequency component is formed by the summer rainfall which appears to be unchanged during the study period finally it is possible that change in the rainfall runoff response of a rain driven watershed is responsible for the changes in sss in this study we used a conceptual event based model to simulate the rainfall runoff response of the rain driven camels watersheds the changes in the parameter of the model could indicate a change in the rainfall runoff response of the watershed and could be related to the change in sss however no relation between the changes in the parameters of the rainfall runoff model and sss was observed therefore it is not discussed further see text s8 in si for the details on this analysis 8 summary and conclusions this study analyzed the changes in deseasonalized streamflow statistical structure sss in the camels dataset over the period 1980 2013 water year where sss was defined as the contribution of different frequency components to total streamflow variance the contributions of the different frequency components were computed by spectral analysis specific frequency components considered in this study are listed in table 2 the relationship between the changes in sss and the changes in climatic statistics precipitation and temperature and watershed characteristics were studied further changes in sss from 43 stations across the usa contained in the grdc dataset with the period 1910 2020 water years were also studied the aim of the grdc analysis was to test the robustness of changes in the camels dataset the discussion below is focused on the camels dataset the main conclusions of this study are summarized in table 3 the contribution of greater than 1 year timescales fluctuations f 0 to total streamflow variance was typically very small in the rain driven watersheds but it is substantial in the western snow dominated watersheds where the fraction of snow is greater than 0 4 the contribution of 1 month to 1 year timescale fluctuations f 5 strongly depends upon the contribution of baseflow to total streamflow formation also long term persistence value of d in deseasonalized streamflow time series depends upon the contribution of baseflow low values of baseflow index bfi are associated with weaker long term persistence the contribution of 2 week to 1 month timescale fluctuations f 3 to total streamflow variance appears to be determined by interflow the contribution of high frequency components is mainly determined by the quick flow thus spectral analysis of deseasonalized streamflow time series can be very useful in detecting hydrologic regime changes in a watershed through analysis of streamflow time series in snow dominated watersheds across the usa a clear east west divide was found in terms of change in the sss contributions of slow components such as 4 month to 1 year f 1 and 1 month to 4 month f 2 timescale decreased increased in most of the eastern western watersheds value of f 0 decreased in most of the western watersheds the high frequency components increased in most of the snow dominated watersheds increases in the high frequency components and decreases in the low frequency components in the snow dominated watersheds were related to increases in rainfall in these watersheds but also to increases in ond oct nov dec temperatures it could be concluded that trends in rainfall have significant control over the sss change in the snow dominated watersheds changes in snowmelt temperature relationships also played a role in changing the sss in the snow dominated watersheds in most rain driven watersheds and in the eastern snow dominated watersheds the contribution of less than one month timescale components f 6 was greater than 50 this was particularly the case in the watersheds in the great plains and the mississippi valley where the contribution of low frequency components is very small due to high evapotranspiration et in most of the arid watersheds the values of f 4 contribution of less than 2 week timescale components and f 6 increased these increases may be related to increases in et in these watersheds in winter months which decreased the contribution from low frequency components and in turn increased the contribution from the high frequency components the high frequency fluctuations f 6 decreased in the gulf coast watersheds and the pacific northwestern watersheds the reason for this was also the increase in winter et and decrease in winter rainfall depth in these watersheds in these watersheds the dominant rainfall season is winter therefore an increase in et possibly resulted in a decrease in antecedent soil moisture and overall muted response of these watersheds to rainfall the trends in the contribution of fluctuations at different timescales were also related to soil properties such as soil texture porosity and the fraction of forest further analyses revealed that soil properties were an indicator of change in climatic statistics in the snow dominated watersheds with fine soils high rainfall depth increased and winter maximum daily temperature increased only moderately this is hypothesized to have resulted in an increase in f 6 in these watersheds in the snow dominated watershed with sandy soils a decrease or only a moderate increase in high rainfall depth with a large increase in winter maximum daily temperature is hypothesized to result in a significant decrease in soil moisture and a decrease in f 6 in the rain dominated watersheds with sandy soils f 6 decreased most of the watersheds with sandy soils are in humid regions with high mean annual rainfall another difference between watersheds with sandy and fine soils was that in the former the phase difference between monthly rainfall and evaporation decreased which might have resulted in more rainwater evaporating back into the atmosphere drying of soils and muted response of watersheds to the rainstorms in the snow dominated watersheds change in the temperature snowmelt relationship is responsible at least to some extent for sss change the change in the temperature snowmelt relationship is likely due to changes in spatiotemporal snow statistics and temperature statistics rather than any physical changes in the watersheds although changes in vegetation density might also be responsible for the changes in the rain dominated watersheds the change in the rainfall runoff relationship appears to be negligible we note that the conclusions reported in this study apply only to deseasonalized streamflow time series changes in seasonal components are not studied in this paper nevertheless the results presented in this study with the camels dataset convincingly show that changes in sss have occurred across the usa although the pattern of changes is patchy there is a local spatial structure these changes have consequences for the accurate simulation of streamflow time series in the presence of climate change decreasing the influence of low frequency components can result in a decrease in the accuracy of simulations this is evident in arid watersheds of the great plains where the contribution of low frequency components has always been small and all the models conceptual process based and ml models of streamflow have been reported to perform poorly in these watersheds e g konapala et al 2020 in this study only the effect of climatic statistics changes on sss change has been explored but sss can also change due to natural changes in the land use such as forest disturbance e g goeking and tarboton 2021 the effects of such changes on sss should be the topic of future study moreover we believe that it would be worthwhile to simulate the hydrologic response of the camels watersheds using a detailed process based model to understand the changes in various hydrologic quantities in these watersheds finally the analysis carried out in this study identifies only the variables that play a role in determining the changes in sss the specific mechanisms creating the changes could not be identified using this analysis nevertheless a few hypotheses regarding changes in the hydrologic mechanisms that might have led to the sss change have been proposed data between water years 1980 2013 were used to achieve the objectives though 30 35 years of data are not enough to identify all the changes in sss such data can still reveal the useful pattern of hydrologic change e g ficklin et al 2016 besides it is well known that systematic changes in global temperatures and rainfall patterns have occurred over the study period manabe and broccoli 2020 nevertheless the changes in sss reported in this study can be argued to have occurred due to changes in climatic statistics changes in climatic statistics might be due to natural climate

1942,heavy metal contamination in soils can pose severe challenges to the safety of geotechnical engineering projects loess which is widely distributed in northwest china is a preferred engineering construction material for anti fouling barriers therefore research on the influence of heavy metal ions on its seepage performance is urgently required to obtain new insights into the seepage behavior of heavy metal contaminated loess and its underlying geochemical mechanism laboratory investigations were performed on the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat leaching and microstructural characteristics of loess contaminated with cu2 and zn2 the results indicate that the hydrolysis of zn2 creates an acidic environment which promotes the dissolution of carbonate minerals in loess enhances the leaching capacity and leads to the quantitative transformation of small pores 2 8 μm to mesopores 8 32 μm meanwhile the alternating adsorption of zn2 and its diffuse double layer effect compresses the diffusion layer increasing the abundance of free water channels thus the ksat of zn contaminated loess increases by 81 2 during the seepage period as for cu contaminated loess its seepage behavior is the opposite of that of zn contaminated loess with a ksat decrease of nearly 50 the primary factor controlling this phenomenon is the formation and enrichment of cu2o in the lower part of the soil which inhibits the enlargement of pores and reduces the effective connectivity of pores the findings of this work provide insight into the seepage behavior of saturated loess under erosion by heavy metals and the underlying geochemical mechanism thereof keywords seepage behavior heavy metal geochemical process microstructure loess data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction rapid industrialization and urbanization have resulted in increasingly potential pollution and adversely affected human lives engineering projects and the environment adimalla 2020 chu et al 2017 soils at industrial sites often exhibit heavy metal contamination which has become a worldwide environmental issue furthermore during the process of soil erosion by heavy metals complex physical and chemical interactions occur between the heavy metal ions and soil particles leading to the deterioration of the engineering properties of the soil which adversely affects the safety and longevity of geotechnical engineering projects chen 2017 chu et al 2017 2018 yin et al 2007 zha et al 2013 zha et al 2014 zha et al 2018 zha et al 2021 therefore to mitigate these hazards it is of great significance to study the mechanism underlying the deterioration of the engineering properties of heavy metal contaminated soil in recent years the deterioration of the engineering properties of soils contaminated by heavy metals has garnered considerable academic interest in the fields of environmental geotechnical engineering wu et al 2020 summarized the changes in the material compositions and physicochemical properties of heavy metal contaminated soils gajo and maines 2007 found that the addition of heavy metal ions to soil decreased the atterberg limits and similar findings were obtained by yong et al 2009 furthermore several previous studies have explored the influence of heavy metal ions on the permeability shear strength and compressivestrength of soil chu et al 2017 dutta and mishra 2016 souli et al 2008 wahid et al 2011 zha et al 2021 notably contaminants primarily enter soil via seepage after which they migrate and undergo transformation xu et al 2021c d during the process of seepage the chemical properties of pore water are altered due to heavy metal contamination resulting in complex soil water interactions that ultimately cause a deterioration in the engineering performance of the soil cetin et al 2012 islam et al 2016 sunil et al 2006 zeng et al 2017 thus the seepage behavior of heavy metal contaminated soil and its underlying mechanism are particularly important for environmental geotechnical engineering permeability which is a measure of the difficulty of water flow through porous media has been treated as one of the most important hydraulic properties of soil and is used in several fields of study chapuis 2012 liu et al 2016 qiao et al 2018 xu et al 2021b in particular geological disasters such as slope instability land subsidence and foundation failure are closely associated with the flow of water in soil wang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 water infiltration in heavy metal contaminated soil is a dynamic and complex process the physicochemical interactions between heavy metals and soil particles alter the original structure and seepage path within the soil thereby affecting the permeability and subsequently other engineering properties of the soil resmi et al 2011 investigated the effect of pb on the engineering properties of cohesive soil and found that the free expansion rate of pb contaminated cohesive soil decreased and its permeability increased souli et al 2008 reported that zn2 contamination altered the permeability of soil by causing particle rearrangement and skeleton deformation zhang et al 2019 found that the permeability of cu contaminated soil first decreased and then increased as the cu2 concentration increased whereas jullien et al 2002 found that permeability first increased and then remained stable as the cu2 concentration increased the foregoing discussion reveals that considerable research has been performed on the influence of heavy metal contaminants on the permeability of clayey soil and its underlying mechanism can be summarized in terms of the following three aspects 1 geochemical actions of minerals primarily including dissolution precipitation and cation exchange bakhshipour et al 2016 islam et al 2016 2 occurrence migration and transformation of chemical cements xu et al 2021d 3 diffuse double layer effect of clay minerals and changes in the occurrence forms of water including tightly bound water loosely bound water and free water on the surface of clay particles yukselen aksoy and kaya 2011 darrow et al 2020 xu et al 2021c all of these soil water interactions influence the structure of the soil and exert an effect on its permeability jullien et al 2002 ouhadi et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 loess which is characterized by its loose texture large porosity and high water sensitivity is distributed in regions throughout the world such as china northern europe and africa duan et al 2021 li et al 2022a sabbarese et al 2021 xue et al 2021 in china loess originated in the northern desert area and was mainly deposited in the northwest forming the chinese loess plateau clp hu et al 2021a peng et al 2018 smalley et al 2014 wang et al 2022 xu et al 2023 as a result of the belt and road initiative and livable yellow river concepts the chinese loess plateau has become a core area of the silk road economic belt as well as a key construction area for the safe yellow river initiative peng et al 2020 wei et al 2020a xu et al 2021a the number of potential pollutants generated is increasing and soil pollution is worsening owing to accelerating urbanization industrialization and agricultural modernization xu et al 2021c for these reasons variations in the geotechnical environment of the region are becoming increasingly prominent as are geological disasters in the area although loess is characterized by a loose texture and is easily disturbed by water and seepage hu et al 2021b xu et al 2018 it is among the main engineering construction materials in arid and semi arid areas and its engineering performance cannot be underestimated research on the deterioration of anti seepage performance and comprehensive treatment of heavy metal contaminated soil in loess regions has gradually attracted attention for instance liu 2016 studied the changes in the physical and chemical properties microstructure and mechanical performance of loess polluted by chromium zinc and copper ions however he could not adequately explain the mechanism underlying the influence of changes in particle surface potential and mineral compositions on the mechanical performance of loess yang 2016 experimentally investigated change trends in the shear strength and permeability of cu and cr contaminated loess and determined their relationships with soil resistivity however there was a lack of clarification on the mechanism of microstructure evolution thus research on the mechanism underlying the influence of heavy metal pollution on loess permeability is not adequate in particular the seepage behavior during the erosion of loess by heavy metal ions and its underlying geochemical mechanisms have rarely been studied several previous studies have described how to prepare contaminated soil chen 2017 meegoda and rajapakse 1993 nayak et al 2007 zha et al 2018 at present the methods of indoor preparation of contaminated soil can be categorized into the following three types 1 manual mixing compaction method the key step in this method is to prepare the sample by spraying a calculated mass of contaminated solution evenly on the dry soil followed by mixing and compaction khamehchiyan et al 2007 nayak et al 2007 zha et al 2018 2 compaction soaking method the core procedure in this method is to leave the compacted sample to soak in the contaminated solution for an experimental cycle chen 2017 3 consolidation leaching method the main step in this method is the mixing of the contaminated liquid with soil and the consolidation of the soil into a specimen after which leaching is performed meegoda and rajapakse 1993 zha et al 2021 in nature heavy metals often enter the soil as ions via flowing water which is a dynamic process however the above three methods do not reveal the dynamic pollution of heavy metals in soil and its potential effects therefore it is recommended to study the seepage behavior and geochemical mechanism of loess by using uncontaminated loess with heavy metal solution seepage jingyang county in shaanxi province has widespread deposits of loess it is a typical study area of the chinese loess plateau and geological disasters occur frequently in this region duan et al 2022 leng et al 2018 peng et al 2017 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2020a wei et al 2020b yan et al 2020 zhu et al 2022 not only are copper and zinc heavy metals that have attracted considerable academic attention but they are also typical heavy metals seen in the loess covered areas the heavy metals usually enter the soil in the form of ions through irrigation infiltration rainfall infiltration and groundwater seepage islam et al 2016 zha et al 2021 thus the reagents zncl2 and cucl2 were chosen because of their high solubility in this study the malan loess in jingyang county which is widely used for engineering projects was investigated with copper and zinc ions as the pollution sources laboratory investigations were performed on the saturated hydraulic conductivity leaching and microstructural characteristics of heavy metal contaminated loess detailed analyses were carried out on the chemical composition of the leachate and response of the soil composition the geochemical processes occurring during seepage were clarified based on these investigations the geochemical mechanism underlying the seepage behavior of cu and zn contaminated loess was explained and effective suggestions for practical engineering applications were provided 2 materials and methods 2 1 test material the clp located in the middle reaches of the yellow river is the largest loess area in the world with a total area of approximately 6 4 105 km2 hou et al 2021a li et al 2022b a 70 km2 loess platform which is located in jingyang county shaanxi province at the southern edge of the clp has experienced more than 50 landslides since 1976 due to extensive agricultural irrigation peng et al 2018 thus jingyang loess platform was chosen as the sampling site the present study focuses on the malan loess which is widely distributed in the jingyang area and has been strongly influenced by human activities disturbed malan loess samples were collected at a depth of approximately 3 m below the surface and were transported to the laboratory for testing the soil samples were loose with a light grayish yellow color after the loess was pretreated following the procedure described by xu et al 2022a and hou et al 2020a grain size analysis was performed using a laser grain size analyzer malvern mastersizer 2000 the loess is consisted of approximately 6 22 sand 81 36 silt and 12 47 clay based on the classification system of us department of agriculture usda 1951 the physical and mechanical properties of the loess are presented in table 1 the liquid limit and plastic limit were measured using a liquid plastic combine tester and the plasticity index was calculated from the difference between the two the maximum dry density and optimum water content were ascertained via standard compaction tests in addition the pycnometer method was used to measure the specific gravity the loess used in this study could be classified as low plasticity clay cl according to the astm 2011 the major chemical components of the loess were identified via x ray fluorescence xrf panalytical axios4 0kwx and are listed in table 2 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 compacted loess specimens since undisturbed loess is susceptible to uncontrollable factors such as root holes and worm holes it is difficult to maintain consistency in the specimen structure during the collection process which can adversely affect the reliability of the research results therefore compacted loess samples with the optimal water content were prepared using the moist tamping method the specific preparation procedure was as follows 1 fresh loess from jingyang county was air dried after which it was ground using a rubber hammer and passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove impurities and ensure that the particle size was within the same range li et al 2022a yan et al 2021 2 the sieved loess was dried in a blast drying oven 101 2a at 105 c for 8 h to remove residual moisture immediately afterwards the loess was cooled to the room temperature of 20 25 c 3 according to table 1 the optimum water content of loess was 17 07 therefore loess samples with a gravimetric moisture content of 17 were prepared based on equation 1 1 m ω m d ω t where mω is the amount of deionized water required kg md is the amount of dry loess kg and ωt is the target moisture content 4 to ensure uniformity in the wet loess it was passed through a 2 mm sieve again xu et al 2021a 5 the sieved wet loess was sealed in a double plastic bag at room temperature for 24 h to homogenize the water li et al 2022a 6 to avoid inconsistencies in the initial soil structure caused by differences in moisture content the average of the moisture content values measured in three parallel groups was used as the final measured moisture content ωf and the error δ in the target moisture content ωt was strictly controlled within 0 2 the calculation formulas are as follows 2 ω m m w m d m d 100 3 ω f ω m 3 4 δ ω f ω t where mw refers to the mass of wet loess g md refers to the mass of loess dried at 105 c g and ωm is the measured moisture content 7 compacted loess specimens with dry densities greater than 1 45 g cm3 are preferred for the study of indoor seepage characteristics due to their relatively stable microstructure xu et al 2021b simultaneously a sufficient quantity of exudate is needed to test its water chemical properties xu et al 2021a thus the homogeneous mixed loess obtained in step 6 was gradually compacted into cylindrical specimens diameter 61 8 mm height 40 mm with dry densities of 1 45 1 50 1 55 g cm3 for subsequent laboratory tests 2 2 2 heavy metal contaminated solutions the clp is a typical agricultural region in china although copper and zinc are trace elements necessary for the growth and development of plants the extensive application of organic fertilizers that has accompanied the rapid development of modern agriculture has promoted cu and zn contamination in the soil of the region jia et al 2016 thus copper and zinc are the typical heavy metal pollutants in the loess covered areas which need to be studied to explore the geochemical mechanism underlying the evolution of the soil microstructure and its seepage behavior under the erosion of the copper and zinc the reagents zncl2 and cucl2 were chosen because of their high solubility according to previous studies xu et al 2020 2021c an inorganic salt solution with a concentration of 2 5 mmol l was sufficient to reflect the influence of ion species on the loess structure and its seepage behavior therefore 2 5 mmol l zncl2 and cucl2 solutions were prepared by dissolving the solid reagent in deionized water dw moreover dw was considered as the reference solution 2 2 3 seepage test the procedure described in detail by xu et al 2021b c was followed during the loess seepage test and the corresponding test device is shown in fig 1 the following two points need to be explained 1 to eliminate the influence of temperature on the geochemical effects and seepage behavior the entire seepage process of the loess samples was carried out in a shh c3000 constant temperature controller which maintained at 20 chu et al 2018 zhang et al 2021b 2 the constant head method a widely accepted method to determine the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of soil jafari et al 2017 soracco et al 2010 was adopted in this work to evaluate the saturated permeability of the compacted loess under heavy metal pollution the seepage period was designed to be 7 days 3 the permeability behavior of remolded loess conforms to darcy s law when the hydraulic gradient is less than 3 wang et al 2020c for this reason as well as to avoid damage to soil microstructure caused by high water pressure a hydraulic gradient of 3 was adopted in this study 2 2 4 hydrochemical analysis to reveal the geochemical action during the process of heavy metal erosion of loess it is necessary to analyze the hydrochemical components of the leachate the sampling interval for recording the volume of leachate was approximately 12 h thus a total of 14 water samples was obtained from each soil sample the ph and total dissolved solids tds of water samples were measured immediately using a multifunctional water quality tester az86505 after recording data about the exudate following this suspended particulate matter in the leachate was removed using 0 45 μm filters jia et al 2021 the water samples obtained were stored in two 10 ml centrifuge tubes for ion analysis one centrifuge tube containing a water sample was acidified to ph less than 2 using nitric acid and the concentrations of the main cations in the leachate including na k ca2 mg2 cu2 and zn2 were determined using icap 6300 spectrometer the sample contained in the other centrifuge tube was used to measure cl and so4 2 concentrations by via ion chromatography ics 600 the concentrations of hco3 and co3 2 were measured using the titrimetric method 2 2 5 zeta potential measurement charged soil particles that are suspended in an aqueous solution can attract ions with opposite charges the ions close to the soil particles experience a strong adsorptive force and the resulting connection is relatively firm this layer of ions is called the stern layer ions further away from the soil particles i e outside the stern layer experience a weaker adsorptive force and the resulting connection is looser this layer of ions is called the diffuse layer he 2018 heavy metals can alternately adsorb with ions on mineral surfaces through hydration change the thickness of the diffuse double layer ddl and thereby affect the soil structure and its hydraulic properties bate and burns 2014 yoon et al 2022 the zeta potential ζ p can be used to characterize the ddl thickness yukselen aksoy and kaya 2011 prior to testing the loess was passed through a 50 μm sieve pretreated loess 100 mg was transferred to 100 ml glass beakers containing different chemical solutions 100 ml and was stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 30 min xu et al 2022a in this study a malvern zeta potential analyzer was used to determine the ζp values of loess particles in different heavy metal solutions the dts1070 microelectrophoresis cell was washed with dw before and after each measurement to prevent cross contamination 2 2 6 microstructure characterization scanning electron microscopy sem is popular among researchers to qualitatively and quantitatively investigate the soil microstructure hou et al 2021b vos et al 2014 in order to reveal the seepage behavior in loess polluted by heavy metals and the underlying mechanism thereof scanning electron microscopy sem fei quanta 200 was applied to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the loess microstructure before and after seepage for details on the procedure followed during the characterization of the soil microstructure the reader can refer to hou et al 2021b and xu et al 2021b 2 2 6 1 qualitative description the microstructural characteristics of loess vary significantly under different magnifications in sem images hou et al 2020b xu 2021 as shown in fig 2 therefore the typical magnifications of 200x and 2000x were used to study the evolution of the loess microstructure under the erosion of zn2 and cu2 2 2 6 2 quantitative analysis as reported by li and li 2017 800x sem images have a suitable field of view and quantitatively accurate results can be obtained from these images thus this magnification was chosen in this study to investigate the microstructure of the zn and cu contaminated loess image pro plus 6 0 ipp 6 0 software was used to process the sem images including pre processing segmentation and parameter acquisition the area ratios of various pores were calculated according to the loess pore classification standard proposed by lei 1987 3 results 3 1 seepage behavior a comprehensive understanding of the hydraulic conductivity of soil is the premise of exploring permeability based on darcy s law the variation in the ksat of compacted loess with time and its statistical characteristics were obtained fig 3 under the seepage of the zncl2 solution the ksat of compacted loess increased with time and its increasing trend was relatively weak under the seepage of dw under the seepage of the cucl2 solution the ksat of compacted loess decreased significantly with time in addition for the same dry density the difference between the initial ksat values of the loess samples was small and this difference tended to become significant as seepage progressed furthermore the addition of heavy metals caused the variation coefficient cv of ksat to increase indicating that heavy metals had a non negligible effect on the seepage behavior of loess the variation trends of loess samples with these three dry densities were essentially the same furthermore a sufficient quantity of exudate was needed to test the chemical properties of the water thus loess with a dry density of 1 45 g cm3 was used for the investigations described hereafter 3 2 hydrogeochemical characteristics of leachate 3 2 1 descriptive statistics descriptive statistics of the chemical components of water can yield preliminary insight into its hydrochemical characteristics liu et al 2021 statistics related to the main components of the leachate are provided in table 3 the ph values of all samples were between 7 93 and 8 45 indicating that the leachate was weakly alkaline the tds concentrations in the leachates of zncl2 and cucl2 were much higher than that of dw this was mainly due to the contribution of cl and it indicated that the influence of cl on the geochemical action in the seepage process was low the main chemical components in the leachate were ca2 mg2 k na so4 2 cl and hco3 and these components exhibited a wide range of variation fig 4 in addition co3 2 was only detected under the seepage of zncl2 and cucl2 solutions cu2 0 01 0 13 mg l was detected in the leachate of the cucl2 solution on the first day of seepage and small amounts of zn2 0 47 5 01 mg l were detected in the zncl2 exudate these observations indicate that complex soil water interactions occurred during the seepage process especially with the addition of heavy metals 3 2 2 hydrochemical type the piper trilinear diagram is extensively used in hydrochemical analysis and classification liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a based on fig 5 the leachate samples of the three solutions show a consistent trend namely the dominant cation type gradually changes from the na type to the ca mg type under dw seepage the major anion type transforms from the so4 type to the hco3 type however the cl type is predominant in the zncl2 and cucl2 solutions which is caused by the large amount of cl in the osmotic solution therefore the evolution of the hydrochemical type of the dw exudate is as follows so4 cl ca mg hco3 na and hco3 ca mg in the zncl2 and cucl2 solutions the cl so4 na type is gradually transformed into the cl so4 ca mg type these changes in the hydrochemical type of the leachate also confirm the complex soil water interactions during the seepage process 3 2 3 evaluation of leaching effect the leaching effect can be evaluated using the cumulative mass mj in the leachate which is defined as 5 m j v j c j where vj is the volume of leachate recorded each time l cj is the mass concentration of the component mg l mj is the cumulative mass mg and j indicates the order of records changes in mj of the chemical components with time are presented in fig 6 although the permeability increased with time under dw seepage the leaching mass of various ions decreased indicating that the geochemical process gradually weakened the addition of cucl2 decreased the permeability of loess whereas it promoted the leaching of ca2 mg2 k and hco3 the addition of zncl2 increased the leaching mass of various ions in particular the leaching mass of ca2 mg2 k and hco3 were obvious during the latter stage of seepage these phenomena show that there are differences in the chemical interactions that zn2 and cu2 induce between water and soil 3 3 chemical composition of soil to comprehensively elucidate the response law of the chemical composition of loess to the influx of zn2 or cu2 a chemical composition test was performed on the particles of the sample after seepage and the results are shown in table 4 combined with table 2 the contents of mgo cao and k2o of loess samples decreased in varying degrees based on the solutions that had been percolated through them the decrease was especially evident in the sample through which the zncl2 solution was percolated which is also evidence of the strong geochemical action during the seepage process of the zncl2 solution the zno content in the sample increased significantly by 0 345 after seepage of the zncl2 solution whereas the increase value of 0 018 in the cuo content in the soil after cucl2 seepage was not significant confirming that there were differences in the geochemical mechanisms of loess polluted by different heavy metals 3 4 microstructure characteristics the particle patterns contact relations pore forms and cementation degree collectively determine the soil microstructure which in turn influences its macroscopic physical and mechanical properties hou et al 2021b xiao et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 fig 7 provides an overview of the microstructure of compacted loess subjected to seepage of cucl2 and zncl2 solutions the loess sample without seepage contains uniformly dispersed particles and presents a relatively dense microstructure with poorly developed pore spaces after dw seepage the soil particles are gathered in clusters and form aggregates that are larger than the particles this phenomenon is more prominent in the loess samples subjected to seepage of the zncl2 solution and pore spaces are well developed this provides evidence that the permeability of soil contaminated with zncl2 increases significantly with time although aggregates are observed in the loess samples after cucl2 seepage they have rough surfaces hence the samples exhibit microstructural characteristics that differ from those of the samples percolated with dw and zncl2 solution fig 8 shows 2000x sem images clearly depicting the microstructural characteristics of heavy metal contaminated loess prior to seepage the coarse particles in the compacted loess have the clearest outline and are covered by a small amount of fine particles fig 8a the particles form an interlocking structure with the contact mode of the particles being mainly mosaic contact followed by overhead contact after dw seepage some coarse particles are covered by flocs of fine particles forming large scale aggregates which is conducive to the development of pore spaces fig 8b this is mainly because the van der waals force increases and electrostatic repulsion decreases during the seepage process zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 the phenomenon of large aggregate formation is more significant in zn contaminated loess samples fig 8c the aggregates are larger and the flocculation and enlargement of pore spaces are more significant which may increase the leaching capacity and decrease the impermeability fig 8d shows the aggregation of clay particles and the wide distribution of rough aggregates in loess contaminated with cu2 however the enlargement of pore spaces is not significant and the effective connectivity of the pores reduces due to the large quantities of small clastic particles or clastic cement these findings confirm that the influx of cu2 and zn2 can induce the reorganization of soil microstructure and adversely affect the engineering performance of the loess hence the potential mechanisms underlying the action of cu2 and zn2 are different ouhadi et al 2011 souli et al 2008 yong et al 2009 zha et al 2021 fig 9 presents the area ratios of various pores of loess samples before and after seepage from the perspective of pore distribution the green area in the sem images of the cu contaminated loess i e the mesopore area is smaller than the other three areas fig 9a quantitatively the mesopore area ratio in the cu contaminated loess is 2 07 5 60 and 4 09 less than that of the original sample the sample after dw seepage and the samples after zncl2 infiltration respectively fig 9b compared with the original loess sample the area ratios of micropores in the loess sample after dw zncl2 and cucl2 seepage exhibit the smallest change decreasing by 0 28 1 32 and 0 95 respectively although the small pore area ratio is reduced by 4 50 in the sample after dw seepage the enhancement in permeability is mainly due to the transformation from small pores to mesopores which has a positive effect on the ksat xu et al 2021b similarly the difference between the small pore area ratio in the zn contaminated loess and that in the cu contaminated loess is only 0 13 this indicates that the difference in the permeability behaviors of the zn contaminated loess and cu contaminated loess is mainly controlled by the mesopores in addition the soil skeleton particle area ratio reduces most in the zn contaminated loess in other words the total pore area ratio increases most in the zn contaminated loess which corroborates the significant geochemical interaction between water and soil during the seepage process 4 discussion 4 1 geochemical process as heavy metal ions gradually enter the soil under the action of flowing water a series of complex geochemical reactions including hydrolysis cation exchange and dissolution precipitation inevitably occurs islam et al 2016 zha et al 2014 loess is rich in carbonates xu et al 2021d calcium carbonate accounts for more than 90 of composition of the loess in northwest china and carbonates are the main bonding materials in the loess structure jiang et al 2012 meng and li 2019 ng et al 2017 the hydrolysis of zn2 and cu2 in the pore water solution can create an acidic environment eqs 6 and 7 during the process of seepage calcite and dolomite in loess dissolve in an acidic environment and produce ca2 mg2 and hco3 eqs 8 and 9 as shown in fig 6 the contents of these chemical components in the exudate are higher than those under dw seepage simultaneously the oh generated by hydrolysis can react with hco3 to further promote the dissolution of carbonate minerals this is also the reason for the presence of co3 2 in the exudate during the latter stages of seepage fig 4 and for the release of a large amount of ca2 and mg2 shown in fig 6 hydrolysis of zncl2 cucl2 6 zn 2 2 h 2 o zn oh 2 2h 7 cu 2 2 h 2 o cu oh 2 2h dissolution of ca co3 mgca co3 2 8 caco 3 h ca 2 hco 3 9 mgca co 3 2 2 h ca 2 mg 2 2 hco 3 oxides in loess such as al2o3 and fe2o3 play a significant role in the cementation of the soil structure xu et al 2021d they mainly exhibit two modes of occurrence 1 films wrapped around coarse particles 2 cements between soil particles zhou 2018 the weak acidic environment generated by the hydrolysis of copper and zinc ions promotes the dissolution of al2o3 and fe2o3 which is conducive to the development of pores however the seepage behavior of loess under erosion due to these two heavy metal ions is not consistent previous studies have shown that zn2 precipitates zinc salt crystals in clayey soil producing a wedging effect between soil particles and destroying the original cementation structure zhou 2018 li et al 2020 also found that zinc easily accumulates in inorganic components of soil in this study under continuous seepage of the zncl2 solution the zn2 content in the exudate was very low table 3 and the zno content in the zn contaminated loess was 6 7 times that before seepage tables 2 and 4 these verify the theory that zinc salt crystals were attached between particles these chemical processes between water and soil are conducive to the enhancement of soil permeability cu contaminated soil demonstrates contrasting seepage behavior organic matter is an important factor restricting the migration and transformation of metal elements in soil liu et al 2014 wei et al 2006 copper readily combines with organic functional groups and accumulates in soil aggregates de andrade et al 2020 li et al 2020 the functional groups of organic carbon in soil mainly include carboxyl cooh alcohol hydroxyl oh and aldehyde cho cu oh 2 the hydrolysate of copper chloride readily reacts with cho to precipitate brick red cu2o eq 10 after the seepage test a layer of brick red sediment was observed at the bottom of the soil sample in the tst 55 permeameter which served as evidence of the aforementioned chemical process meanwhile cu2 was almost completely absent from the exudate table 3 and the content of cuo in the loess after seepage was only twice that under non seepage this is precisely the chemical action demonstrated in eq 10 it hinders the migration of cu2 with the seepage direction and causes major precipitation of cu2o at the bottom of the loess sample therefore the pores at the bottom of the sample are blocked which reduces the permeability formation of cu2o 10 cho 2cu oh 2 cooh cu 2 o 2h 2 o cation exchange and adsorption induced by heavy metals can increase leached ion concentrations reduce soil strength and alter the soil microstructure ouhadi et al 2011 zha et al 2021 it is universally knownthat the foundation of this action is soil containing clay minerals loess contains abundant clay minerals such as montmorillonite illite and kaolinite wang et al 2020b won et al 2017 thus cation exchange and adsorption must be considered in the seepage process of zn contaminated and cu contaminated loess eq 11 the intrusion of zn2 and cu2 disrupts the original charge balance of clay minerals and the na k ca2 and mg2 adsorbed on the clay minerals undergo cation exchange which is one of the reasons for the increase in the concentration of leached ions fig 6 the formation of cu2o not only blocks the pores but also reduces the opportunity for exchange between cu2 and other metal ions therefore the availability of cu2 for exchange and adsorption is lower than that of zn2 and the changes in the main chemical components in loess caused by seepage are also less prominent zn2 and cu2 have different effects on soil structure resulting in inconsistent seepage behavior cation exchange and adsorption 11 na k mg ca clay cu 2 zn 2 cu zn clay na k mg 2 ca 2 4 2 ddl effect heavy metal ions in the exchangeable phase can also reduce the ddl thickness promote the flocculation of clay particles and enhance the pore spaces hu et al 2022 wu and hu 2014 zeng et al 2017 in addition the ddl effect needs to be considered when soils have clay content exceeding 10 gajo and maines 2007 in this study the loess contains 12 47 clay indicating that the ddl effect on loess eroded by heavy metals through seepage cannot be ignored this effect reduces the ddl thickness and enhances the shrinkage of clay clusters this phenomenon has also been observed in other types of soil polluted by heavy metals indicating that the findings obtained in this study have been widely recognized dutta and mishra 2016 ouhadi et al 2006 zha et al 2021 the thickness of the ddl can be assessed by the zeta potential ζp ali et al 2019 as presented in table 5 the ζp values of loess in cucl2 and zncl2 solutions are positive indicating that cu2 and zn2 enter the stern layer via electrostatic attraction and change the sign of the ζp uddin 2017 xu et al 2021c moreover heavy metal ions absorbed by particles can form the inner layer complexes which strongly compress the diffusion layer and expand the free layer according to the theory of ddl the space for free gravity water in the two aforementioned kinds of polluted loess increases and the permeability of soil is enhanced however the saturated hydraulic conductivity of cu contaminated loess decreases with time which may be predominantly caused by the hydrolysis reduction and precipitation of copper ions 4 3 response mechanism of seepage behavior based on the aforementioned geochemical interactions and the morphological characteristics of loess microstructure a schematic diagram of the evolution of the loess microstructure under different seepage conditions is presented in fig 10 to reduce the influence of the differences between loess samples on the experimental results the normalized saturated hydraulic conductivity ηk was used to measure the degree of change in the seepage behavior under the erosion of heavy metal ions it is defined as follows xu 2021 12 η k k sat k i 100 where ksat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity measured in the test cm s and ki is the initial saturated hydraulic conductivity cm s the variation curves of ηk with time are shown in fig 12 under the optimum moisture content the particles are coated with a water film on the surface which promotes the agglomeration of the particles and the formation of a relatively stable structure fig 10a xu et al 2022b during dw seepage dissolution enhances pore connectivity moreover cation exchange between ca2 and na causes the formation of particle aggregates which also creates space for the flow of water xu et al 2021a however the ddl thickness on the surface of clay particles is increased as shown in fig 10b therefore although the saturated hydraulic conductivity of compacted loess shows an increasing trend the increase is only 7 7 fig 11 a in addition a stage of rapid increase stage is observed during the last four days of the seepage cycle which could be related to the role of carbonate dissolution in the loess other research results have also demonstrated that carbonate dissolution plays a key role in the formation of abundant water passages in loess meng and li 2019 xu et al 2021a d when zncl2 solution is used as the osmotic fluid the hydrolysis of zn2 releases a large number of free hydrogen ions the complex chemical reactions of the hydrogen ions with the calcium and magnesium compounds originating from the loess reduce the degree of soil cementation hu et al 2021b meanwhile the alternating adsorption of zn2 and its ddl effect not only strongly promotes the agglomeration of particles but also compresses the diffusion layer increasing the abundance of free water channels fig 10c thus the saturated permeability of loess shows a significant increasing trend and the corresponding ηk value reaches 181 2 representing an increase of 81 2 fig 11b although cu2 plays a role similar to that of zn2 when loess is exposed to a cucl2 solution fig 10d the hydrolysis and precipitation of cu2 hinders the development of pores weakens the leaching effect and enhances the roughness and cementation of particles thus due to a large number of small clastic particles or clastic cement the effective pore connectivity as well as the content of mesopores is greatly reduced in loess after cucl2 seepage fig 9d as shown in fig 11c the ηk decreases by nearly 50 indicating that the saturated permeability of loess decreases significantly in summary the seepage behavior of loess and the underlying geochemical mechanism thereof vary significantly under erosion by different heavy metals 5 conclusions the saturated permeability and leaching characteristics as well as the microstructural characteristics of cu contaminated and zn contaminated loess were experimentally investigated to provide new insights into the geochemical mechanism underlying the seepage behavior the main conclusions are summarized as follows the hydrolysis of zn2 creates an acidic environment which promotes the dissolution of carbonate minerals in loess the alternating adsorption of zn2 and its ddl effect not only strongly promote the agglomeration of particles but also compress the diffusion layer increasing the abundance of free water channels in addition the pore space in zn contaminated loess increases the most which serves as evidence of the significant geochemical action during seepage thus the ksat of zn contaminated loess increases with seepage time hydrolysis and the ddl effect are also active under cu2 contamination however cu2o formed by the precipitation of cu2 is enriched at the bottom of the soil reducing the effective pore connectivity in cu contaminated loess the aggregation of clay particles is less prominent and the distribution of rough aggregates is wider the enlargement of pore spaces is not as significant as that in zn contaminated loess due to a large number of small clastic particles or clastic cement therefore the seepage behavior of the cu contaminated loess is the opposite of that of zn contaminated loess the above findings are of theoretical importance to provide insight into the geochemical processes in saturated loess under erosion by heavy metals and the response of seepage behavior they are of practical significance for the safety of geotechnical engineering projects in loess areas in

1942,heavy metal contamination in soils can pose severe challenges to the safety of geotechnical engineering projects loess which is widely distributed in northwest china is a preferred engineering construction material for anti fouling barriers therefore research on the influence of heavy metal ions on its seepage performance is urgently required to obtain new insights into the seepage behavior of heavy metal contaminated loess and its underlying geochemical mechanism laboratory investigations were performed on the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat leaching and microstructural characteristics of loess contaminated with cu2 and zn2 the results indicate that the hydrolysis of zn2 creates an acidic environment which promotes the dissolution of carbonate minerals in loess enhances the leaching capacity and leads to the quantitative transformation of small pores 2 8 μm to mesopores 8 32 μm meanwhile the alternating adsorption of zn2 and its diffuse double layer effect compresses the diffusion layer increasing the abundance of free water channels thus the ksat of zn contaminated loess increases by 81 2 during the seepage period as for cu contaminated loess its seepage behavior is the opposite of that of zn contaminated loess with a ksat decrease of nearly 50 the primary factor controlling this phenomenon is the formation and enrichment of cu2o in the lower part of the soil which inhibits the enlargement of pores and reduces the effective connectivity of pores the findings of this work provide insight into the seepage behavior of saturated loess under erosion by heavy metals and the underlying geochemical mechanism thereof keywords seepage behavior heavy metal geochemical process microstructure loess data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction rapid industrialization and urbanization have resulted in increasingly potential pollution and adversely affected human lives engineering projects and the environment adimalla 2020 chu et al 2017 soils at industrial sites often exhibit heavy metal contamination which has become a worldwide environmental issue furthermore during the process of soil erosion by heavy metals complex physical and chemical interactions occur between the heavy metal ions and soil particles leading to the deterioration of the engineering properties of the soil which adversely affects the safety and longevity of geotechnical engineering projects chen 2017 chu et al 2017 2018 yin et al 2007 zha et al 2013 zha et al 2014 zha et al 2018 zha et al 2021 therefore to mitigate these hazards it is of great significance to study the mechanism underlying the deterioration of the engineering properties of heavy metal contaminated soil in recent years the deterioration of the engineering properties of soils contaminated by heavy metals has garnered considerable academic interest in the fields of environmental geotechnical engineering wu et al 2020 summarized the changes in the material compositions and physicochemical properties of heavy metal contaminated soils gajo and maines 2007 found that the addition of heavy metal ions to soil decreased the atterberg limits and similar findings were obtained by yong et al 2009 furthermore several previous studies have explored the influence of heavy metal ions on the permeability shear strength and compressivestrength of soil chu et al 2017 dutta and mishra 2016 souli et al 2008 wahid et al 2011 zha et al 2021 notably contaminants primarily enter soil via seepage after which they migrate and undergo transformation xu et al 2021c d during the process of seepage the chemical properties of pore water are altered due to heavy metal contamination resulting in complex soil water interactions that ultimately cause a deterioration in the engineering performance of the soil cetin et al 2012 islam et al 2016 sunil et al 2006 zeng et al 2017 thus the seepage behavior of heavy metal contaminated soil and its underlying mechanism are particularly important for environmental geotechnical engineering permeability which is a measure of the difficulty of water flow through porous media has been treated as one of the most important hydraulic properties of soil and is used in several fields of study chapuis 2012 liu et al 2016 qiao et al 2018 xu et al 2021b in particular geological disasters such as slope instability land subsidence and foundation failure are closely associated with the flow of water in soil wang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 water infiltration in heavy metal contaminated soil is a dynamic and complex process the physicochemical interactions between heavy metals and soil particles alter the original structure and seepage path within the soil thereby affecting the permeability and subsequently other engineering properties of the soil resmi et al 2011 investigated the effect of pb on the engineering properties of cohesive soil and found that the free expansion rate of pb contaminated cohesive soil decreased and its permeability increased souli et al 2008 reported that zn2 contamination altered the permeability of soil by causing particle rearrangement and skeleton deformation zhang et al 2019 found that the permeability of cu contaminated soil first decreased and then increased as the cu2 concentration increased whereas jullien et al 2002 found that permeability first increased and then remained stable as the cu2 concentration increased the foregoing discussion reveals that considerable research has been performed on the influence of heavy metal contaminants on the permeability of clayey soil and its underlying mechanism can be summarized in terms of the following three aspects 1 geochemical actions of minerals primarily including dissolution precipitation and cation exchange bakhshipour et al 2016 islam et al 2016 2 occurrence migration and transformation of chemical cements xu et al 2021d 3 diffuse double layer effect of clay minerals and changes in the occurrence forms of water including tightly bound water loosely bound water and free water on the surface of clay particles yukselen aksoy and kaya 2011 darrow et al 2020 xu et al 2021c all of these soil water interactions influence the structure of the soil and exert an effect on its permeability jullien et al 2002 ouhadi et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 loess which is characterized by its loose texture large porosity and high water sensitivity is distributed in regions throughout the world such as china northern europe and africa duan et al 2021 li et al 2022a sabbarese et al 2021 xue et al 2021 in china loess originated in the northern desert area and was mainly deposited in the northwest forming the chinese loess plateau clp hu et al 2021a peng et al 2018 smalley et al 2014 wang et al 2022 xu et al 2023 as a result of the belt and road initiative and livable yellow river concepts the chinese loess plateau has become a core area of the silk road economic belt as well as a key construction area for the safe yellow river initiative peng et al 2020 wei et al 2020a xu et al 2021a the number of potential pollutants generated is increasing and soil pollution is worsening owing to accelerating urbanization industrialization and agricultural modernization xu et al 2021c for these reasons variations in the geotechnical environment of the region are becoming increasingly prominent as are geological disasters in the area although loess is characterized by a loose texture and is easily disturbed by water and seepage hu et al 2021b xu et al 2018 it is among the main engineering construction materials in arid and semi arid areas and its engineering performance cannot be underestimated research on the deterioration of anti seepage performance and comprehensive treatment of heavy metal contaminated soil in loess regions has gradually attracted attention for instance liu 2016 studied the changes in the physical and chemical properties microstructure and mechanical performance of loess polluted by chromium zinc and copper ions however he could not adequately explain the mechanism underlying the influence of changes in particle surface potential and mineral compositions on the mechanical performance of loess yang 2016 experimentally investigated change trends in the shear strength and permeability of cu and cr contaminated loess and determined their relationships with soil resistivity however there was a lack of clarification on the mechanism of microstructure evolution thus research on the mechanism underlying the influence of heavy metal pollution on loess permeability is not adequate in particular the seepage behavior during the erosion of loess by heavy metal ions and its underlying geochemical mechanisms have rarely been studied several previous studies have described how to prepare contaminated soil chen 2017 meegoda and rajapakse 1993 nayak et al 2007 zha et al 2018 at present the methods of indoor preparation of contaminated soil can be categorized into the following three types 1 manual mixing compaction method the key step in this method is to prepare the sample by spraying a calculated mass of contaminated solution evenly on the dry soil followed by mixing and compaction khamehchiyan et al 2007 nayak et al 2007 zha et al 2018 2 compaction soaking method the core procedure in this method is to leave the compacted sample to soak in the contaminated solution for an experimental cycle chen 2017 3 consolidation leaching method the main step in this method is the mixing of the contaminated liquid with soil and the consolidation of the soil into a specimen after which leaching is performed meegoda and rajapakse 1993 zha et al 2021 in nature heavy metals often enter the soil as ions via flowing water which is a dynamic process however the above three methods do not reveal the dynamic pollution of heavy metals in soil and its potential effects therefore it is recommended to study the seepage behavior and geochemical mechanism of loess by using uncontaminated loess with heavy metal solution seepage jingyang county in shaanxi province has widespread deposits of loess it is a typical study area of the chinese loess plateau and geological disasters occur frequently in this region duan et al 2022 leng et al 2018 peng et al 2017 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2020a wei et al 2020b yan et al 2020 zhu et al 2022 not only are copper and zinc heavy metals that have attracted considerable academic attention but they are also typical heavy metals seen in the loess covered areas the heavy metals usually enter the soil in the form of ions through irrigation infiltration rainfall infiltration and groundwater seepage islam et al 2016 zha et al 2021 thus the reagents zncl2 and cucl2 were chosen because of their high solubility in this study the malan loess in jingyang county which is widely used for engineering projects was investigated with copper and zinc ions as the pollution sources laboratory investigations were performed on the saturated hydraulic conductivity leaching and microstructural characteristics of heavy metal contaminated loess detailed analyses were carried out on the chemical composition of the leachate and response of the soil composition the geochemical processes occurring during seepage were clarified based on these investigations the geochemical mechanism underlying the seepage behavior of cu and zn contaminated loess was explained and effective suggestions for practical engineering applications were provided 2 materials and methods 2 1 test material the clp located in the middle reaches of the yellow river is the largest loess area in the world with a total area of approximately 6 4 105 km2 hou et al 2021a li et al 2022b a 70 km2 loess platform which is located in jingyang county shaanxi province at the southern edge of the clp has experienced more than 50 landslides since 1976 due to extensive agricultural irrigation peng et al 2018 thus jingyang loess platform was chosen as the sampling site the present study focuses on the malan loess which is widely distributed in the jingyang area and has been strongly influenced by human activities disturbed malan loess samples were collected at a depth of approximately 3 m below the surface and were transported to the laboratory for testing the soil samples were loose with a light grayish yellow color after the loess was pretreated following the procedure described by xu et al 2022a and hou et al 2020a grain size analysis was performed using a laser grain size analyzer malvern mastersizer 2000 the loess is consisted of approximately 6 22 sand 81 36 silt and 12 47 clay based on the classification system of us department of agriculture usda 1951 the physical and mechanical properties of the loess are presented in table 1 the liquid limit and plastic limit were measured using a liquid plastic combine tester and the plasticity index was calculated from the difference between the two the maximum dry density and optimum water content were ascertained via standard compaction tests in addition the pycnometer method was used to measure the specific gravity the loess used in this study could be classified as low plasticity clay cl according to the astm 2011 the major chemical components of the loess were identified via x ray fluorescence xrf panalytical axios4 0kwx and are listed in table 2 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 compacted loess specimens since undisturbed loess is susceptible to uncontrollable factors such as root holes and worm holes it is difficult to maintain consistency in the specimen structure during the collection process which can adversely affect the reliability of the research results therefore compacted loess samples with the optimal water content were prepared using the moist tamping method the specific preparation procedure was as follows 1 fresh loess from jingyang county was air dried after which it was ground using a rubber hammer and passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove impurities and ensure that the particle size was within the same range li et al 2022a yan et al 2021 2 the sieved loess was dried in a blast drying oven 101 2a at 105 c for 8 h to remove residual moisture immediately afterwards the loess was cooled to the room temperature of 20 25 c 3 according to table 1 the optimum water content of loess was 17 07 therefore loess samples with a gravimetric moisture content of 17 were prepared based on equation 1 1 m ω m d ω t where mω is the amount of deionized water required kg md is the amount of dry loess kg and ωt is the target moisture content 4 to ensure uniformity in the wet loess it was passed through a 2 mm sieve again xu et al 2021a 5 the sieved wet loess was sealed in a double plastic bag at room temperature for 24 h to homogenize the water li et al 2022a 6 to avoid inconsistencies in the initial soil structure caused by differences in moisture content the average of the moisture content values measured in three parallel groups was used as the final measured moisture content ωf and the error δ in the target moisture content ωt was strictly controlled within 0 2 the calculation formulas are as follows 2 ω m m w m d m d 100 3 ω f ω m 3 4 δ ω f ω t where mw refers to the mass of wet loess g md refers to the mass of loess dried at 105 c g and ωm is the measured moisture content 7 compacted loess specimens with dry densities greater than 1 45 g cm3 are preferred for the study of indoor seepage characteristics due to their relatively stable microstructure xu et al 2021b simultaneously a sufficient quantity of exudate is needed to test its water chemical properties xu et al 2021a thus the homogeneous mixed loess obtained in step 6 was gradually compacted into cylindrical specimens diameter 61 8 mm height 40 mm with dry densities of 1 45 1 50 1 55 g cm3 for subsequent laboratory tests 2 2 2 heavy metal contaminated solutions the clp is a typical agricultural region in china although copper and zinc are trace elements necessary for the growth and development of plants the extensive application of organic fertilizers that has accompanied the rapid development of modern agriculture has promoted cu and zn contamination in the soil of the region jia et al 2016 thus copper and zinc are the typical heavy metal pollutants in the loess covered areas which need to be studied to explore the geochemical mechanism underlying the evolution of the soil microstructure and its seepage behavior under the erosion of the copper and zinc the reagents zncl2 and cucl2 were chosen because of their high solubility according to previous studies xu et al 2020 2021c an inorganic salt solution with a concentration of 2 5 mmol l was sufficient to reflect the influence of ion species on the loess structure and its seepage behavior therefore 2 5 mmol l zncl2 and cucl2 solutions were prepared by dissolving the solid reagent in deionized water dw moreover dw was considered as the reference solution 2 2 3 seepage test the procedure described in detail by xu et al 2021b c was followed during the loess seepage test and the corresponding test device is shown in fig 1 the following two points need to be explained 1 to eliminate the influence of temperature on the geochemical effects and seepage behavior the entire seepage process of the loess samples was carried out in a shh c3000 constant temperature controller which maintained at 20 chu et al 2018 zhang et al 2021b 2 the constant head method a widely accepted method to determine the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of soil jafari et al 2017 soracco et al 2010 was adopted in this work to evaluate the saturated permeability of the compacted loess under heavy metal pollution the seepage period was designed to be 7 days 3 the permeability behavior of remolded loess conforms to darcy s law when the hydraulic gradient is less than 3 wang et al 2020c for this reason as well as to avoid damage to soil microstructure caused by high water pressure a hydraulic gradient of 3 was adopted in this study 2 2 4 hydrochemical analysis to reveal the geochemical action during the process of heavy metal erosion of loess it is necessary to analyze the hydrochemical components of the leachate the sampling interval for recording the volume of leachate was approximately 12 h thus a total of 14 water samples was obtained from each soil sample the ph and total dissolved solids tds of water samples were measured immediately using a multifunctional water quality tester az86505 after recording data about the exudate following this suspended particulate matter in the leachate was removed using 0 45 μm filters jia et al 2021 the water samples obtained were stored in two 10 ml centrifuge tubes for ion analysis one centrifuge tube containing a water sample was acidified to ph less than 2 using nitric acid and the concentrations of the main cations in the leachate including na k ca2 mg2 cu2 and zn2 were determined using icap 6300 spectrometer the sample contained in the other centrifuge tube was used to measure cl and so4 2 concentrations by via ion chromatography ics 600 the concentrations of hco3 and co3 2 were measured using the titrimetric method 2 2 5 zeta potential measurement charged soil particles that are suspended in an aqueous solution can attract ions with opposite charges the ions close to the soil particles experience a strong adsorptive force and the resulting connection is relatively firm this layer of ions is called the stern layer ions further away from the soil particles i e outside the stern layer experience a weaker adsorptive force and the resulting connection is looser this layer of ions is called the diffuse layer he 2018 heavy metals can alternately adsorb with ions on mineral surfaces through hydration change the thickness of the diffuse double layer ddl and thereby affect the soil structure and its hydraulic properties bate and burns 2014 yoon et al 2022 the zeta potential ζ p can be used to characterize the ddl thickness yukselen aksoy and kaya 2011 prior to testing the loess was passed through a 50 μm sieve pretreated loess 100 mg was transferred to 100 ml glass beakers containing different chemical solutions 100 ml and was stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 30 min xu et al 2022a in this study a malvern zeta potential analyzer was used to determine the ζp values of loess particles in different heavy metal solutions the dts1070 microelectrophoresis cell was washed with dw before and after each measurement to prevent cross contamination 2 2 6 microstructure characterization scanning electron microscopy sem is popular among researchers to qualitatively and quantitatively investigate the soil microstructure hou et al 2021b vos et al 2014 in order to reveal the seepage behavior in loess polluted by heavy metals and the underlying mechanism thereof scanning electron microscopy sem fei quanta 200 was applied to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the loess microstructure before and after seepage for details on the procedure followed during the characterization of the soil microstructure the reader can refer to hou et al 2021b and xu et al 2021b 2 2 6 1 qualitative description the microstructural characteristics of loess vary significantly under different magnifications in sem images hou et al 2020b xu 2021 as shown in fig 2 therefore the typical magnifications of 200x and 2000x were used to study the evolution of the loess microstructure under the erosion of zn2 and cu2 2 2 6 2 quantitative analysis as reported by li and li 2017 800x sem images have a suitable field of view and quantitatively accurate results can be obtained from these images thus this magnification was chosen in this study to investigate the microstructure of the zn and cu contaminated loess image pro plus 6 0 ipp 6 0 software was used to process the sem images including pre processing segmentation and parameter acquisition the area ratios of various pores were calculated according to the loess pore classification standard proposed by lei 1987 3 results 3 1 seepage behavior a comprehensive understanding of the hydraulic conductivity of soil is the premise of exploring permeability based on darcy s law the variation in the ksat of compacted loess with time and its statistical characteristics were obtained fig 3 under the seepage of the zncl2 solution the ksat of compacted loess increased with time and its increasing trend was relatively weak under the seepage of dw under the seepage of the cucl2 solution the ksat of compacted loess decreased significantly with time in addition for the same dry density the difference between the initial ksat values of the loess samples was small and this difference tended to become significant as seepage progressed furthermore the addition of heavy metals caused the variation coefficient cv of ksat to increase indicating that heavy metals had a non negligible effect on the seepage behavior of loess the variation trends of loess samples with these three dry densities were essentially the same furthermore a sufficient quantity of exudate was needed to test the chemical properties of the water thus loess with a dry density of 1 45 g cm3 was used for the investigations described hereafter 3 2 hydrogeochemical characteristics of leachate 3 2 1 descriptive statistics descriptive statistics of the chemical components of water can yield preliminary insight into its hydrochemical characteristics liu et al 2021 statistics related to the main components of the leachate are provided in table 3 the ph values of all samples were between 7 93 and 8 45 indicating that the leachate was weakly alkaline the tds concentrations in the leachates of zncl2 and cucl2 were much higher than that of dw this was mainly due to the contribution of cl and it indicated that the influence of cl on the geochemical action in the seepage process was low the main chemical components in the leachate were ca2 mg2 k na so4 2 cl and hco3 and these components exhibited a wide range of variation fig 4 in addition co3 2 was only detected under the seepage of zncl2 and cucl2 solutions cu2 0 01 0 13 mg l was detected in the leachate of the cucl2 solution on the first day of seepage and small amounts of zn2 0 47 5 01 mg l were detected in the zncl2 exudate these observations indicate that complex soil water interactions occurred during the seepage process especially with the addition of heavy metals 3 2 2 hydrochemical type the piper trilinear diagram is extensively used in hydrochemical analysis and classification liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a based on fig 5 the leachate samples of the three solutions show a consistent trend namely the dominant cation type gradually changes from the na type to the ca mg type under dw seepage the major anion type transforms from the so4 type to the hco3 type however the cl type is predominant in the zncl2 and cucl2 solutions which is caused by the large amount of cl in the osmotic solution therefore the evolution of the hydrochemical type of the dw exudate is as follows so4 cl ca mg hco3 na and hco3 ca mg in the zncl2 and cucl2 solutions the cl so4 na type is gradually transformed into the cl so4 ca mg type these changes in the hydrochemical type of the leachate also confirm the complex soil water interactions during the seepage process 3 2 3 evaluation of leaching effect the leaching effect can be evaluated using the cumulative mass mj in the leachate which is defined as 5 m j v j c j where vj is the volume of leachate recorded each time l cj is the mass concentration of the component mg l mj is the cumulative mass mg and j indicates the order of records changes in mj of the chemical components with time are presented in fig 6 although the permeability increased with time under dw seepage the leaching mass of various ions decreased indicating that the geochemical process gradually weakened the addition of cucl2 decreased the permeability of loess whereas it promoted the leaching of ca2 mg2 k and hco3 the addition of zncl2 increased the leaching mass of various ions in particular the leaching mass of ca2 mg2 k and hco3 were obvious during the latter stage of seepage these phenomena show that there are differences in the chemical interactions that zn2 and cu2 induce between water and soil 3 3 chemical composition of soil to comprehensively elucidate the response law of the chemical composition of loess to the influx of zn2 or cu2 a chemical composition test was performed on the particles of the sample after seepage and the results are shown in table 4 combined with table 2 the contents of mgo cao and k2o of loess samples decreased in varying degrees based on the solutions that had been percolated through them the decrease was especially evident in the sample through which the zncl2 solution was percolated which is also evidence of the strong geochemical action during the seepage process of the zncl2 solution the zno content in the sample increased significantly by 0 345 after seepage of the zncl2 solution whereas the increase value of 0 018 in the cuo content in the soil after cucl2 seepage was not significant confirming that there were differences in the geochemical mechanisms of loess polluted by different heavy metals 3 4 microstructure characteristics the particle patterns contact relations pore forms and cementation degree collectively determine the soil microstructure which in turn influences its macroscopic physical and mechanical properties hou et al 2021b xiao et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 fig 7 provides an overview of the microstructure of compacted loess subjected to seepage of cucl2 and zncl2 solutions the loess sample without seepage contains uniformly dispersed particles and presents a relatively dense microstructure with poorly developed pore spaces after dw seepage the soil particles are gathered in clusters and form aggregates that are larger than the particles this phenomenon is more prominent in the loess samples subjected to seepage of the zncl2 solution and pore spaces are well developed this provides evidence that the permeability of soil contaminated with zncl2 increases significantly with time although aggregates are observed in the loess samples after cucl2 seepage they have rough surfaces hence the samples exhibit microstructural characteristics that differ from those of the samples percolated with dw and zncl2 solution fig 8 shows 2000x sem images clearly depicting the microstructural characteristics of heavy metal contaminated loess prior to seepage the coarse particles in the compacted loess have the clearest outline and are covered by a small amount of fine particles fig 8a the particles form an interlocking structure with the contact mode of the particles being mainly mosaic contact followed by overhead contact after dw seepage some coarse particles are covered by flocs of fine particles forming large scale aggregates which is conducive to the development of pore spaces fig 8b this is mainly because the van der waals force increases and electrostatic repulsion decreases during the seepage process zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 the phenomenon of large aggregate formation is more significant in zn contaminated loess samples fig 8c the aggregates are larger and the flocculation and enlargement of pore spaces are more significant which may increase the leaching capacity and decrease the impermeability fig 8d shows the aggregation of clay particles and the wide distribution of rough aggregates in loess contaminated with cu2 however the enlargement of pore spaces is not significant and the effective connectivity of the pores reduces due to the large quantities of small clastic particles or clastic cement these findings confirm that the influx of cu2 and zn2 can induce the reorganization of soil microstructure and adversely affect the engineering performance of the loess hence the potential mechanisms underlying the action of cu2 and zn2 are different ouhadi et al 2011 souli et al 2008 yong et al 2009 zha et al 2021 fig 9 presents the area ratios of various pores of loess samples before and after seepage from the perspective of pore distribution the green area in the sem images of the cu contaminated loess i e the mesopore area is smaller than the other three areas fig 9a quantitatively the mesopore area ratio in the cu contaminated loess is 2 07 5 60 and 4 09 less than that of the original sample the sample after dw seepage and the samples after zncl2 infiltration respectively fig 9b compared with the original loess sample the area ratios of micropores in the loess sample after dw zncl2 and cucl2 seepage exhibit the smallest change decreasing by 0 28 1 32 and 0 95 respectively although the small pore area ratio is reduced by 4 50 in the sample after dw seepage the enhancement in permeability is mainly due to the transformation from small pores to mesopores which has a positive effect on the ksat xu et al 2021b similarly the difference between the small pore area ratio in the zn contaminated loess and that in the cu contaminated loess is only 0 13 this indicates that the difference in the permeability behaviors of the zn contaminated loess and cu contaminated loess is mainly controlled by the mesopores in addition the soil skeleton particle area ratio reduces most in the zn contaminated loess in other words the total pore area ratio increases most in the zn contaminated loess which corroborates the significant geochemical interaction between water and soil during the seepage process 4 discussion 4 1 geochemical process as heavy metal ions gradually enter the soil under the action of flowing water a series of complex geochemical reactions including hydrolysis cation exchange and dissolution precipitation inevitably occurs islam et al 2016 zha et al 2014 loess is rich in carbonates xu et al 2021d calcium carbonate accounts for more than 90 of composition of the loess in northwest china and carbonates are the main bonding materials in the loess structure jiang et al 2012 meng and li 2019 ng et al 2017 the hydrolysis of zn2 and cu2 in the pore water solution can create an acidic environment eqs 6 and 7 during the process of seepage calcite and dolomite in loess dissolve in an acidic environment and produce ca2 mg2 and hco3 eqs 8 and 9 as shown in fig 6 the contents of these chemical components in the exudate are higher than those under dw seepage simultaneously the oh generated by hydrolysis can react with hco3 to further promote the dissolution of carbonate minerals this is also the reason for the presence of co3 2 in the exudate during the latter stages of seepage fig 4 and for the release of a large amount of ca2 and mg2 shown in fig 6 hydrolysis of zncl2 cucl2 6 zn 2 2 h 2 o zn oh 2 2h 7 cu 2 2 h 2 o cu oh 2 2h dissolution of ca co3 mgca co3 2 8 caco 3 h ca 2 hco 3 9 mgca co 3 2 2 h ca 2 mg 2 2 hco 3 oxides in loess such as al2o3 and fe2o3 play a significant role in the cementation of the soil structure xu et al 2021d they mainly exhibit two modes of occurrence 1 films wrapped around coarse particles 2 cements between soil particles zhou 2018 the weak acidic environment generated by the hydrolysis of copper and zinc ions promotes the dissolution of al2o3 and fe2o3 which is conducive to the development of pores however the seepage behavior of loess under erosion due to these two heavy metal ions is not consistent previous studies have shown that zn2 precipitates zinc salt crystals in clayey soil producing a wedging effect between soil particles and destroying the original cementation structure zhou 2018 li et al 2020 also found that zinc easily accumulates in inorganic components of soil in this study under continuous seepage of the zncl2 solution the zn2 content in the exudate was very low table 3 and the zno content in the zn contaminated loess was 6 7 times that before seepage tables 2 and 4 these verify the theory that zinc salt crystals were attached between particles these chemical processes between water and soil are conducive to the enhancement of soil permeability cu contaminated soil demonstrates contrasting seepage behavior organic matter is an important factor restricting the migration and transformation of metal elements in soil liu et al 2014 wei et al 2006 copper readily combines with organic functional groups and accumulates in soil aggregates de andrade et al 2020 li et al 2020 the functional groups of organic carbon in soil mainly include carboxyl cooh alcohol hydroxyl oh and aldehyde cho cu oh 2 the hydrolysate of copper chloride readily reacts with cho to precipitate brick red cu2o eq 10 after the seepage test a layer of brick red sediment was observed at the bottom of the soil sample in the tst 55 permeameter which served as evidence of the aforementioned chemical process meanwhile cu2 was almost completely absent from the exudate table 3 and the content of cuo in the loess after seepage was only twice that under non seepage this is precisely the chemical action demonstrated in eq 10 it hinders the migration of cu2 with the seepage direction and causes major precipitation of cu2o at the bottom of the loess sample therefore the pores at the bottom of the sample are blocked which reduces the permeability formation of cu2o 10 cho 2cu oh 2 cooh cu 2 o 2h 2 o cation exchange and adsorption induced by heavy metals can increase leached ion concentrations reduce soil strength and alter the soil microstructure ouhadi et al 2011 zha et al 2021 it is universally knownthat the foundation of this action is soil containing clay minerals loess contains abundant clay minerals such as montmorillonite illite and kaolinite wang et al 2020b won et al 2017 thus cation exchange and adsorption must be considered in the seepage process of zn contaminated and cu contaminated loess eq 11 the intrusion of zn2 and cu2 disrupts the original charge balance of clay minerals and the na k ca2 and mg2 adsorbed on the clay minerals undergo cation exchange which is one of the reasons for the increase in the concentration of leached ions fig 6 the formation of cu2o not only blocks the pores but also reduces the opportunity for exchange between cu2 and other metal ions therefore the availability of cu2 for exchange and adsorption is lower than that of zn2 and the changes in the main chemical components in loess caused by seepage are also less prominent zn2 and cu2 have different effects on soil structure resulting in inconsistent seepage behavior cation exchange and adsorption 11 na k mg ca clay cu 2 zn 2 cu zn clay na k mg 2 ca 2 4 2 ddl effect heavy metal ions in the exchangeable phase can also reduce the ddl thickness promote the flocculation of clay particles and enhance the pore spaces hu et al 2022 wu and hu 2014 zeng et al 2017 in addition the ddl effect needs to be considered when soils have clay content exceeding 10 gajo and maines 2007 in this study the loess contains 12 47 clay indicating that the ddl effect on loess eroded by heavy metals through seepage cannot be ignored this effect reduces the ddl thickness and enhances the shrinkage of clay clusters this phenomenon has also been observed in other types of soil polluted by heavy metals indicating that the findings obtained in this study have been widely recognized dutta and mishra 2016 ouhadi et al 2006 zha et al 2021 the thickness of the ddl can be assessed by the zeta potential ζp ali et al 2019 as presented in table 5 the ζp values of loess in cucl2 and zncl2 solutions are positive indicating that cu2 and zn2 enter the stern layer via electrostatic attraction and change the sign of the ζp uddin 2017 xu et al 2021c moreover heavy metal ions absorbed by particles can form the inner layer complexes which strongly compress the diffusion layer and expand the free layer according to the theory of ddl the space for free gravity water in the two aforementioned kinds of polluted loess increases and the permeability of soil is enhanced however the saturated hydraulic conductivity of cu contaminated loess decreases with time which may be predominantly caused by the hydrolysis reduction and precipitation of copper ions 4 3 response mechanism of seepage behavior based on the aforementioned geochemical interactions and the morphological characteristics of loess microstructure a schematic diagram of the evolution of the loess microstructure under different seepage conditions is presented in fig 10 to reduce the influence of the differences between loess samples on the experimental results the normalized saturated hydraulic conductivity ηk was used to measure the degree of change in the seepage behavior under the erosion of heavy metal ions it is defined as follows xu 2021 12 η k k sat k i 100 where ksat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity measured in the test cm s and ki is the initial saturated hydraulic conductivity cm s the variation curves of ηk with time are shown in fig 12 under the optimum moisture content the particles are coated with a water film on the surface which promotes the agglomeration of the particles and the formation of a relatively stable structure fig 10a xu et al 2022b during dw seepage dissolution enhances pore connectivity moreover cation exchange between ca2 and na causes the formation of particle aggregates which also creates space for the flow of water xu et al 2021a however the ddl thickness on the surface of clay particles is increased as shown in fig 10b therefore although the saturated hydraulic conductivity of compacted loess shows an increasing trend the increase is only 7 7 fig 11 a in addition a stage of rapid increase stage is observed during the last four days of the seepage cycle which could be related to the role of carbonate dissolution in the loess other research results have also demonstrated that carbonate dissolution plays a key role in the formation of abundant water passages in loess meng and li 2019 xu et al 2021a d when zncl2 solution is used as the osmotic fluid the hydrolysis of zn2 releases a large number of free hydrogen ions the complex chemical reactions of the hydrogen ions with the calcium and magnesium compounds originating from the loess reduce the degree of soil cementation hu et al 2021b meanwhile the alternating adsorption of zn2 and its ddl effect not only strongly promotes the agglomeration of particles but also compresses the diffusion layer increasing the abundance of free water channels fig 10c thus the saturated permeability of loess shows a significant increasing trend and the corresponding ηk value reaches 181 2 representing an increase of 81 2 fig 11b although cu2 plays a role similar to that of zn2 when loess is exposed to a cucl2 solution fig 10d the hydrolysis and precipitation of cu2 hinders the development of pores weakens the leaching effect and enhances the roughness and cementation of particles thus due to a large number of small clastic particles or clastic cement the effective pore connectivity as well as the content of mesopores is greatly reduced in loess after cucl2 seepage fig 9d as shown in fig 11c the ηk decreases by nearly 50 indicating that the saturated permeability of loess decreases significantly in summary the seepage behavior of loess and the underlying geochemical mechanism thereof vary significantly under erosion by different heavy metals 5 conclusions the saturated permeability and leaching characteristics as well as the microstructural characteristics of cu contaminated and zn contaminated loess were experimentally investigated to provide new insights into the geochemical mechanism underlying the seepage behavior the main conclusions are summarized as follows the hydrolysis of zn2 creates an acidic environment which promotes the dissolution of carbonate minerals in loess the alternating adsorption of zn2 and its ddl effect not only strongly promote the agglomeration of particles but also compress the diffusion layer increasing the abundance of free water channels in addition the pore space in zn contaminated loess increases the most which serves as evidence of the significant geochemical action during seepage thus the ksat of zn contaminated loess increases with seepage time hydrolysis and the ddl effect are also active under cu2 contamination however cu2o formed by the precipitation of cu2 is enriched at the bottom of the soil reducing the effective pore connectivity in cu contaminated loess the aggregation of clay particles is less prominent and the distribution of rough aggregates is wider the enlargement of pore spaces is not as significant as that in zn contaminated loess due to a large number of small clastic particles or clastic cement therefore the seepage behavior of the cu contaminated loess is the opposite of that of zn contaminated loess the above findings are of theoretical importance to provide insight into the geochemical processes in saturated loess under erosion by heavy metals and the response of seepage behavior they are of practical significance for the safety of geotechnical engineering projects in loess areas in future studies the seepage mechanism of heavy metal contaminated loess under unsaturated conditions should be explored credit authorship contribution statement panpan xu conceptualization roles

1943,temporal disaggregation of rainfall has been of particular focus because of the non availability of higher resolution rainfall data for a long duration period fine temporal resolution rainfall is used in a multitude of hydrological applications researchers have proposed various disaggregation models to disaggregate coarse temporal resolution rainfall in this paper firstly the microcanonical multiplicative random cascade mmrc model is applied for disaggregation from daily rainfall to a one hour scale the model is applied in four different rainfall stations for disaggregation having varying rainfall patterns and characteristics it is observed that the mmrc model can generate statistically reliable rainfall time series however the extreme rainfall characteristics are not well conserved by the model for all the stations this paper describes a new model based on a random multiplicative cascade process where classification and parameter generation is done by k means clustering such that it can better conserve extreme rainfall conditions and generate a reliable rainfall time series mmrc k k means clustering is a vector quantization method that divides the observations into a particular number of clusters based on the nearest mean called cluster centroid the novel approach is tested with the same four indian cities the use of k means clustering has made the classification and parameter generation of the model robust such that it can work with data sets of varying characteristics it is found that mmrc k provides improved conservation of extreme rainfall characteristics compared to the mmrc model for all four stations the mmrc k model reproduces the idf curves of delhi and mumbai stations quite well however a little discrepancy was observed at higher resolution and larger return periods in kolkata and chennai stations extreme rainfall at finer resolution is used in various hydrological analyses and design problems like urban drainage design stormwater management etc the overall superior conservation of the extreme rainfall characteristics in the model generated rainfall time series by the mmrc k model compared to the mmrc model supports the potential applicability of the model for temporal disaggregation keywords random cascade model k means clustering disaggregation simulation of extreme rainfall data availability rainfall data can not be shared without the permission from indian meteorological department but the model code can be shared on request to the authors 1 introduction access to precipitation data at finer resolutions across various time scales is required for studies related to hydrological applications such as rainfall runoff modeling flood forecasting urban drainage modeling etc especially extreme rainfall however rainfall time series at finer resolution for a long duration is not readily available hence the need for disaggregation of rainfall from low resolution rainfall time series to finer time steps using statistical models extensive literature is available on the methods for disaggregation of rainfall stern coe 1984 have developed a model for daily rainfall in which wet and dry days occur in a markov chain with seasonally dependent transition probabilities the rainfall disaggregation model based on the stochastic point process has been studied by waymire and gupta 1981 cowpertwait et al 1996 koutsoyiannis et al 2003 onof and wang 2020 rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 studied the cluster based poisson process for stochastic rainfall modeling wójcik and buishand 2003 westra et al 2012 breinl et al 2015 breinl and di baldassarre 2019 put forward another model based on the method of fragments olsson 1998 has modeled the scaling behavior of rainfall using a cascade process called microcanonical multiplicative random cascade mmrc model various authors have supported the presence of scaling property of rainfall e g hubert et al 1993 olsson 1998 olsson et al 1992 onof et al 1996 the scaling property refers to symmetry across scales the microcanonical property of the model ensures conservation of volume at all levels in the disaggregation process guntner et al 2001 licznar et al 2011 2015 müller and haberlandt 2018 müller thomy 2020 olsson and bemdtsson 1998 assessment of extreme precipitation events is vital for hydrologic risk analysis and design evaluation of rainfall extremes as embodied in intensity duration frequency idf relationship has been a prime focus in both theoretical and applied hydrology idf curves capture extreme rainfall characteristics rainfall frequency relations are extensively used in design of stormwater management systems drainage systems etc in the current study the mmrc model is applied for disaggregation of rainfall from 1 day to 1 hour scale a scale range of high practical significance in four stations of major cities in india namely delhi mumbai kolkata and chennai a mixed branching scheme of 2 and 3 branches lisniak et al 2013 muller thomy 2020 has been used in the model as it is not possible to obtain 1 hour resolution rainfall by subsequent two branching of 24 hour rainfall the results are compared based on statistical variables olsson 1998 and the idf curves the model can generate an acceptable rainfall time series however significant discrepancies were observed in the intensity values of the idf curves overestimation of extreme rainfall in the mmrc model generated rainfall series is previously established by guntner et al 2001 pui et al 2012 for different rainfall conditions hence to improve the preservation of extreme rainfall we present a new model based on a random multiplicative cascade process where k means clustering mcqueen 1967 is introduced for the classification of the rainfall boxes and parameter generation of the model mmrc k k means clustering is a vector quantization method that divides the observations into a particular number of clusters based on their closeness to specific center points called cluster centroids the optimum number of clusters has been selected by using the elbow method thorndike 1953 marutho et al 2018 the optimum number of clusters depends on the data set s characteristics which makes the model flexible to use with data sets of varying properties the model has been applied to all four stations for disaggregation from a daily to 1 hour scale the generated rainfall time series was tested by comparing statistical variables and idf curves extracted from the time series with that of the observed data the mmrc k model generated rainfall time series can effectively capture the extreme rainfall characteristics for all four stations however the calculated statistical variables are underestimated compared to mmrc 2 study area and data delhi mumbai kolkata and chennai the four major cities in india have been selected as study locations the cities receive monsoon rainfall majorly the various attributes of the rainfall received by the stations are listed in table 1 it can be observed that although each of the stations belongs to a monsoon climatic region they have individuality in the characteristics of the precipitation they receive the hourly data for all four stations have been collected from indian meteorological department imd the data has been pre processed before using it in the models the missing data has been filled in using linear extrapolation for mumbai kolkata and chennai data from 01 01 1969 to 30 12 2020 52 years was available whereas for delhi data was available from 01 01 1969 to 12 12 2014 46 years the non overlapping moving window method is used to convert the hourly resolution data to daily resolution 3 methodology 3 1 microcanonical multiplicative random cascade mmrc model the mmrc model disaggregates coarser resolution data to a finer resolution the advantage of using an mmrc model is the microcanonical property of the model which ensures the conservation of rainfall volume at every level of the cascade therefore aggregation of the disaggregated time series would result exactly in the original observed time series the model works in two steps first it aggregates the observed data to find the parameters and then disaggregates low resolution rainfall using the parameters generated in the first step to a higher resolution the use of observed daily time series as input for parameter generation is a strong advantage of the cascade model müller et al 2018 the mmrc model is described in detail in the following sections 3 1 1 model fig 1 shows the schematic representation of the multiplicative cascade model used in the present study each level represents a time series at a particular resolution for our current study level 0 represents 24 hour resolution and level 4 represents 1 hour resolution the transition to the next level from the previous will double or triple the resolution as per the branching scheme b 2 or 3 respectively and this transition process is called modulation the model comprises discrete time intervals called rainfall boxes or rainfall cells in this paper the rainfall volume is the rainfall depth multiplied by the unit area of each rainfall box or cell the model repetitively branches each box of a rainfall time series at cascade level k with a given timescale tk into b child cells of equal and subsequently smaller timescales t k 1 t k b at level k 1 and assigning each child cell a rainfall amount obtained by multiplying the rainfall volume rk of the parent cell by a weighting factor w the redistribution of the cells is performed for wet cells only i e cells with non zero values but the branching is done for all the cells the number of cells created can in principle assume any integer value b 2 with b 2 being the simplest case lisniak et al 2013 the model scheme diagram resembles a tree b is called the branching number it starts with the daily values level 0 and the process repeats till it reaches the tk value of 1 h level 4 disaggregation of 1 hour rainfall from 24 hour rainfall cannot be achieved with only subsequent doubling i e b 2 hence a mixed branching of b 2 and b 3 is adopted in this study lisniak et al 2013 in this study b 3 at 3 hour to 1 hour is used the choice of b 3 at this level has no physical reason and is used to achieve 1 hour scale rainfall from daily scale rainfall by using b 2 at the other levels muller thomy 2020 the weights can take any value in the closed interval 0 1 however the microcanonical feature of the mmrc model ensures the conservation of rainfall volume hence the sum of the weights ws for redistribution of a cell value must be equal to 1 3 1 2 procedure of parameter generation in the case of b 2 only one weight is required to be determined w 1 the other weight w 2 1 w 1 owing to the microcanonical property of the model the process of assigning values for w is called a cascade generator the weights can be distributed in three possible ways firstly w 1 1 and w 2 0 which is referred to as 1 0 division second is the opposite i e w 1 0 and w 2 1 and is referred to as 0 1 division the third possibility is w 1 x and w 2 1 x and is referred as x 1 x distribution where 0 x 1 when referring to x 1 x division the weights are distributed as a uniform distribution in modulation between two cascade levels p 1 0 p 0 1 and p x x are defined as the probability of having a 1 0 0 1 or x 1 x distribution respectively here x is an empirically distributed random number guntner et al 2001 thus the random cascade generator for b 2 can be represented as equation 1 1 w 1 w 2 1 and 0 with probability p 1 0 0 and 1 with probability p 0 1 x and 1 x with probability p x 1 x in the case of b 3 the random cascade generator must be extended by incorporating a third weight w3 along with w1 and w2 such that w 1 w 2 w 3 1 explaining the microcanonical property of the model here the random cascade generator can assume seven states lisniak et al 2013 with their corresponding probabilities similar to the case with b 2 the random cascade generator for b 3 can be represented as equation 2 2 w 1 w 2 w 3 1 0 0 with probability p 1 0 0 0 1 0 with probability p 0 1 0 0 0 1 with probability p 0 0 1 x 1 x 0 with probability p x 1 x 0 x 0 1 x with probability p x 0 1 x 0 x 1 x with probability p 0 x 1 x x y 1 x y with probability p x y 1 x y here x and y are empirically distributed random numbers lisniak et al 2013 in the case of the last condition of equation 2 x can take values in the range of 0 1 but y is conditioned on x such that the range of values that y can assume is 0 1 x lisniak et al 2013 the mmrc model can be divided into two parts 1 aggregation where parameters are generated and 2 disaggregation where the rainfall is broken down into finer resolutions using parameters generated in the 1st part 3 1 3 aggregation in this part the model is calibrated i e the parameters are generated from the observed data the procedure can be summarized as follows at each cascade level the wet boxes i e boxes with non zero values were divided into position class and volume class position classes were divided into four types 1 starting box where the preceding box was dry but the succeeding is wet 2 enclosed box where the preceding and succeeding boxes are wet 3 ending box where the preceding box is wet but the succeeding box is dry 4 isolated box where both preceding and succeeding boxes are dry the volume class is divided into two types 1 above the mean and 2 below the mean volume of the position class olsson 1998 the use of volume class ensures the parameters dependence on the volume of rainfall therefore there will be a total of eight classes the model is aggregated from the time series by reconstructing the generator in the aggregation from level j to level i j 1 for each wet box at level i the class and the weights are determined by dividing each volume at level i by the corresponding volume at level j for a particular class at level i if we assume the number of wet boxes is obtained as n i and the number of wet boxes associated with a division x 1 x for the case of b 2 is obtained as n i x 1 x then the probability of a certain class for the particular division is determined as p x 1 x n i x 1 x n i the same procedure is applied for b 3 where the divisions increase to seven types each having three parts as mentioned in equation 2 therefore at each level of the cascade for b 2 there will be a set of 24 probabilities three sets for each of eight classes and for b 3 there will be a set of 56 probabilities 7 sets for each of eight classes 3 1 4 disaggregation the disaggregation of rainfall amounts between the child cells can therefore be summarized as follows for each cell a determine the position and volume class to select the set of probability values b a uniformly distributed random number r in the interval 0 1 is generated to determine the state of the cascade generator for the branching of that particular cell as per the probabilities as discussed in section 3 1 3 of the class it falls into c the cascade weights are generated according to the rules defined below for b 2 1 if r p 1 0 a 1 0 division is made i e w 1 1 w 2 0 2 if p 1 0 r p 1 0 p 0 1 then a 0 1 division is made 3 if r p 1 0 p 0 1 a x x division is made in the third scenario the weights are generated as an empirically distributed random number güntner et al 2001 between 0 and 1 for b 3 1 if r p 1 0 0 1 0 0 division is done i e w 1 1 w 2 0 w 3 0 2 if p 1 0 0 r p 1 0 0 p 0 1 0 then 0 1 0 division is made 3 if p 1 0 0 p 0 1 0 r p 1 0 0 p 0 1 0 p 0 0 1 then 0 0 1 division is made 4 if p 1 0 0 p 0 1 0 p 0 0 1 r p 1 0 0 p 0 1 0 p 0 0 1 p x 1 x 0 then x 1 x 0 division is made i e w 1 x w 2 1 x w 3 0 5 if p 1 0 0 p 0 1 0 p 0 0 1 p x 1 x 0 r p 1 0 0 p 0 1 0 p 0 0 1 p x 1 x 0 p x 0 1 x then x 0 1 x division is made 6 if p 1 0 0 p 0 1 0 p 0 0 1 p x 1 x 0 p x 0 1 x p x 0 1 x r 1 0 0 p 0 1 0 p 0 0 1 p x 1 x 0 p x 0 1 x p x 0 1 x p 0 x 1 x then 0 x 1 x division is made 7 if r 1 0 0 p 0 1 0 p 0 0 1 p x 1 x 0 p x 0 1 x p x 0 1 x p 0 x 1 x then x y 1 x y division is made i e w 1 x w 2 y w 3 1 x y here x and y are determined as empirically distributed random numbers güntner et al 2001 lisniak et al 2013 here x can take any value in the range of 0 1 but y is conditioned on x such that y can assume any number between 0 1 x d finally after the weights are generated each cell is redistributed as per the set of weights associated with an individual cell if rainfall volume in a cell is considered as r and the distributing weight is w for a particular cell then 3 r j w r i j i 1 3 2 microcanonical multiplicative random cascade with k means clustering mmrc k model the present study focuses on conserving the extreme rainfall of the disaggregated rainfall time series hence a new method for classification and parameter generation in a random cascade process is introduced as k means clustering k means clustering is a classification process where an optimum number of clusters are used in clustering the data rather than any arbitrary number of clusters this paper finds the optimum number of clusters using the elbow method marutho et al 2018 the optimum number of clusters depends on the characteristics of the data considered hence the application of k means clustering in the mmrc k model makes it flexible for applications with data of varying properties in contrast the mmrc model follows a rigid classification process that depends on the position and volume of the rainfall of each box the mmrc k model is expected to generate a rainfall time series with improved preservation of the extreme rainfall along with conservation of the nature and characteristics of the rainfall 3 2 1 k means clustering the k means clustering is one of the most widely used clustering methods and has been implemented in many fields of science and technology k means clustering aims to minimize the sum of the distances between the points within a cluster and their respective cluster centroid the optimal number of clusters is determined initially cluster centroids k are selected randomly from the data all data points near each centroid are grouped into the same cluster and then the centroids of each cluster are calculated the iteration process of grouping into clusters and calculating the centroids is repeated until the centroid of the previous iteration step is the same as in the current iteration step or the data points remain in the same cluster as the previous iteration step or the maximum number of iterations is completed in this study 3 dimensional clustering is used to classify the boxes where the three dimensions are current rainfall lag 1 rainfall and lead 1 rainfall hence each point in the three dimensional space will have a coordinate representing the current box s rainfall the preceding box s rainfall and the succeeding box s rainfall hence like in the mmrc model where the classes depend on the position of the box in the rainfall sequence and its volume there is a dependence of clusters in the mmrc k model as well on the position of the box in the rainfall sequence and its volume the 3 dimensional clustering for the observed 1 hour rainfall time series for delhi station is illustrated in fig 2 the optimal number of clusters is determined using the elbow method thorndike 1953 the sum of the distances of the data points from their corresponding centroids is calculated for a different number of clusters sumd and is plotted against the number of clusters k the point after which there is no steep decrease in the sum of distances i e where an elbow is formed is taken as the optimum number of clusters the optimum numbers of clusters are calculated at each level of the model for the four stations it is found that the optimum number of clusters are equal for all levels for all four stations fig 3 hence in the model scale invariance is assumed for the optimum number of clusters from daily to hourly resolution in the present study the optimum number of clusters k is found for 1 hour resolution using the elbow method fig 3 e 3 j 3 o and 3 t and found to be 4 for all the four stations hence k 4 is incorporated in the classification of the rainfall boxes in the model for the four stations 3 2 2 model the mmrc k model is based on a random cascade process similar to the mmrc model the method of classification of the boxes and hence parameter generation in mmrc k differ from that of mmrc in the case of mmrc k k means clustering is used for classification at each level in this paper the rainfall boxes are divided using 3d k means clustering instead of manually classifying the boxes based on the rainfall position and volume as mentioned in section 3 2 1 the optimum number of clusters was found to be 4 and hence the rainfall is divided into four classes using k means clustering unlike the eight classes in the mmrc model hence there will be four sets of probability for each class i e a total of 12 probabilities for two branching for three branching there will be a total of 28 probabilities 7 probabilities for four classes hence compared to the mmrc model the mmrc k model requires less number of parameters mmrc k model incorporates a mixed type of branching similar to the mmrc model for disaggregation from daily to 1 hour resolution in the mmrc k model for two branchings b 2 the random cascade generator is the same as equation 1 whereas in the case of three branchings b 3 the random cascade generator is represented as equation 4 4 w 1 w 2 w 3 1 0 0 with probability p 1 0 0 0 1 0 with probability p 0 1 0 0 0 1 with probability p 0 0 1 x 1 x 0 with probability p x 1 x 0 x 0 1 x with probability p x 0 1 x 0 x 1 x with probability p 0 x 1 x 1 3 1 3 1 3 with probability p 1 3 1 3 1 3 as in the case of the mmrc model the mmrc k model also operates in two steps aggregation and disaggregation for both aggregation and disaggregation the boxes are classified using k means clustering after the classification of the boxes parameter and weight generation in the aggregation and disaggregation process follows the same method as discussed in sections 3 1 3 and 3 1 4 respectively except instead of p x y 1 x y p 1 3 1 3 1 3 is calculated and used equation 4 therefore for b 3 the 7th condition for weight generation will be as follows if r p 1 0 0 p 0 1 0 p 0 0 1 p x 1 x 0 p x 0 1 x p x 0 1 x p 0 x 1 x then 0 33 0 33 0 33 division is made i e w 1 1 3 w 2 1 3 w 3 1 3 using a factor of 1 3 rather than using the x y 1 x y in equation 4 for redistribution of rainfall boxes divides the rainfall volume uniformly mmrc model tends to overestimate extreme rainfall guntner 2001 pui 2012 which can be observed from the results mentioned in the next section distributing the rainfall uniformly rather than getting distributed such that one box is distributed with high and the rest of the two boxes with low rainfall ensures that the overestimation of extreme rainfall amount is reduced hence it improves the ability of the model to conserve extreme rainfall characteristics distributing the rainfall boxes symmetrically will result in a lower average individual rainfall volume in the model generated ra infall time series however other aspects of the model generated rainfall time series like percentage zero values event volume event duration and dry period length will not get affected as a result of the uniform distribution of the rainfall box after weights are generated each lower resolution rainfall box is redistributed as per the set of weights associated with each cell equation 3 3 3 establishment of intensity duration frequency curve the characteristics of extreme rainfall events are well captured in the idf curve an idf curve gives the expected rainfall intensity of a given storm duration having desired frequency of occurrence idf curve is a graph with duration plotted as abscissa intensity as ordinate and a series of curves one for each return period the frequency is expressed in terms of the return period the idf analysis is done by collecting rainfall data of different durations annual maxima were extracted for all the different rainfall durations the durations considered were 1 h 3 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h the maximum intensity for a particular duration for a specific time period is determined using the standard equation of gumbel s extreme value type i distribution ev i which is fitted using the method of moments the general equation of frequency analysis singh 1998 maity 2018 is 5 x t x k s where x t design intensity for a particular duration and a particular return period x mean of the annual maximum for a particular duration s standard deviation of the annual maximum for a particular duration k frequency factor the frequency factor k is derived from the standard equation of the ev i distribution function chow 1953 chow et al 1988 6 k 6 π 0 5772 l n l n t t 1 this equation was derived by chow 1953 to write the frequency factor k in terms of the return period t the different return periods considered in this paper are 2 years 5 years 10 years 20 years and 50 years 4 results and discussion for an improved representation of the extreme rainfall in the disaggregated rainfall time series the mmrc k model is introduced the rainfall time series generated by the mmrc model and mmrc k model are compared with observed rainfall and tested for conservation of extreme rainfall along with the acceptability of the generated time series firstly to compare the statistical reliability of the model output time series five statistical variables were considered which can depict the nature and characteristics of the rainfall namely 1 percentage zero values 2 individual rainfall volume or average intensity 3 event rainfall volume 4 event duration and 5 length of dry period olsson 1998 here individual rainfall volume is the rainfall volume or depth of each non zero rainfall box and event means the event of continuous rainfall in the discrete rainfall boxes the mean and standard deviation for each variable is calculated and both models results are compared with observed rainfall the results for all four stations are mentioned in table 2 considering the random nature of the model the results obtained are an average of 500 iterations table 2 shows that both models underestimate the mean of event duration and dry period however for mmrc k underestimation is higher than mmrc it implies that the mmrc k model generates a higher number of shorter duration rainfall events than the mmrc model the shorter rainfall event results in the underestimation of the average event volume table 2 the number of dry periods every year for chennai station is plotted in fig 4 it is observed that in the case of mmrc k model generated rainfall the number of dry spells is overestimated considerably compared to mmrc model generated rainfall the number of yearly dry periods higher and average dry periods lower than mmrc implies that a higher number of short dry periods is generated in the mmrc k model the percentage zero values of the rainfall series for all the stations table 2 are overestimated in the mmrc model and underestimated in the mmrc k model compared to the percentage zero values of the observed rainfall this observation implies that the mmrc k model produces more wet boxes while mmrc produces less than the observed rainfall time series the average individual rainfall volume is overestimated in the mmrc model generated rainfall time series whereas underestimated in the mmrc k model generated time series for all the stations the lower values of the mean of individual rainfall volume are more pronounced in the case of mmrc k compared to the mmrc model table 2 the underestimation of the mean of individual volume in the mmrc k compared to the mmrc model may be because of the uniform distribution of rainfall volume applied in the division of three wet boxes equation 4 in the mmrc k model compared to the random distribution of rainfall equation 2 in the mmrc model the statistical variables calculated in table 2 show that the mmrc model generated rainfall series is in closer agreement with the observed series than the mmrc k the second part tests the preservation of extreme rainfall characteristics by both models idf curves developed from the model generated rainfall using gumbel s extreme value type i distribution and are compared with the idf curves generated from the observed rainfall the intensity values for different duration and frequencies are generated and averaged over 500 iterations idf curves for return periods of 2 years 5 years 10 years 20 years and 50 years and duration of 1 h 3 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h are obtained from rainfall time series generated from the mmrc model for all the four stations they are compared with the idf curves obtained from the observed rainfall time series for the same frequency and duration of rainfall fig 5 a 5 d 5 g and 5 j shows the idf curve calculated from the original rainfall time series and fig 5 b 5 e 5 h and 5 k shows idf curves calculated from the mmrc model generated rainfall time series for the four stations comparing the intensity values of the idf curves calculated from the mmrc model generated time series and from the original time series a high discrepancy is observed between them it can be inferred that the mmrc model highly overestimates the intensity values of the idf curves the percentage deviation of the intensity values calculated from the mmrc model generated time series from the original is plotted in fig 6 a 6 c 6 e and 6 g percentage deviation is calculated using equation 7 overestimation of extreme rainfall by the mmrc model was established by guntner et al 2001 pui et al 2012 in different rainfall conditions 7 percentage deviation observed model generated observed 100 idf curves are plotted for all four stations at exact durations and return periods for the mmrc k model generated rainfall time series fig 5 c 5 f 5 i and 5 l and compared with idf curves generated from observed rainfall series fig 5 a 5 d 5 g and 5 j it can be observed that the mmrc k model performs well in preserving idf curves for all four stations however for kolkata and chennai stations deviations in the intensities are observed for higher frequency and finer resolution rainfall it can be seen that the idf curves plotted from mmrc k model generated time series are closer to the idf curves from the observed rainfall time series as compared to the idf curves from the mmrc model generated time series the percentage deviation of the intensity values equation 7 calculated of the mmrc k model generated time series from the original is plotted in fig 6 d 6 d 6 f and 6 h comparing the percentage deviations in the intensity values for both mmrc and mmrc k models suggests better conservation of extreme rainfall by the mmrc k model to further manifest the improvement in the preservation of extreme rainfall by the mmrc k model a scatter plot between observed rainfall values and the model generated rainfall values is plotted corresponding to different quantile values the 1 hour resolution rainfall time series is considered for the plot for the four stations and plotted for the output rainfall time series of both mmrc and mmrc k fig 7 a 7 d shows that the mmrc k model performs better in conserving the extreme rainfall in the generated rainfall time series than the mmrc model for all the stations 5 conclusion mmrc and mmrc k rainfall disaggregation models are based on the principles of the multiplicative random cascade process although the mmrc model can generate an acceptable rainfall time series it fails to conserve the extreme rainfall a new mmrc k model based on the random cascade process is introduced where k means clustering is applied in the classification process of the boxes the introduction of k means clustering has added to the robustness of the model both mmrc and mmrc k model is applied for disaggregation of daily rainfall to obtain a 1 hour scale rainfall time series the models have been applied to 4 stations within india with varying rainfall characteristics table 1 to assess the acceptability of the model for disaggregation five statistical variables olsson 1998 calculated from 1 hour resolution model generated and observed rainfall time series table 2 are compared the comparison shows that the statistical variables calculated from the mmrc model generated rainfall time series is closer to the variables calculated fom the observed rainfall than the variables calculated from the mmrc k model generated timeseries however discrepancies were observed in the statistical variables for both model generated rainfall time series the rainfall time series generated by both models were used to develop the idf curves to establish the ability of the models for conservation of extreme rainfall characteristics the idf curves generated from both models were compared with the idf curves obtained from the observed rainfall time series from the idf curves and the plot of percentage deviation of the intensities of the idf curves calculated from the time series generated from both models it can be inferred that the mmrc k model can provide superior preservation of the idf curves compared to the mmrc model fig 7 a 7 d further holds up the better preservation of extreme rainfall by the mmrc k model while focusing on better conservation of extreme rainfall in the mmrc k model there is some underestimation in the rainfall characteristics in the model generated time series however the improved performance of the mmrc k model for the conservation of extreme rainfall characteristics supports the model s relevancy for the disaggregation of rainfall the model generated rainfall time series will find its application in hydrological analysis and design where extreme rainfall characteristics at fine resolution are crucial in this paper the model is studied in the indian monsoon rainfall only hence the relevance of the mmrc k model shall be studied in other rainfall conditions to check for the agility of the model for disaggregation of rainfall with varying rainfall characteristics further other clustering processes can be explored for the classification process to generate disaggregated rainfall series with better preservation of rainfall characteristics credit authorship contribution statement p deka methodology

1943,temporal disaggregation of rainfall has been of particular focus because of the non availability of higher resolution rainfall data for a long duration period fine temporal resolution rainfall is used in a multitude of hydrological applications researchers have proposed various disaggregation models to disaggregate coarse temporal resolution rainfall in this paper firstly the microcanonical multiplicative random cascade mmrc model is applied for disaggregation from daily rainfall to a one hour scale the model is applied in four different rainfall stations for disaggregation having varying rainfall patterns and characteristics it is observed that the mmrc model can generate statistically reliable rainfall time series however the extreme rainfall characteristics are not well conserved by the model for all the stations this paper describes a new model based on a random multiplicative cascade process where classification and parameter generation is done by k means clustering such that it can better conserve extreme rainfall conditions and generate a reliable rainfall time series mmrc k k means clustering is a vector quantization method that divides the observations into a particular number of clusters based on the nearest mean called cluster centroid the novel approach is tested with the same four indian cities the use of k means clustering has made the classification and parameter generation of the model robust such that it can work with data sets of varying characteristics it is found that mmrc k provides improved conservation of extreme rainfall characteristics compared to the mmrc model for all four stations the mmrc k model reproduces the idf curves of delhi and mumbai stations quite well however a little discrepancy was observed at higher resolution and larger return periods in kolkata and chennai stations extreme rainfall at finer resolution is used in various hydrological analyses and design problems like urban drainage design stormwater management etc the overall superior conservation of the extreme rainfall characteristics in the model generated rainfall time series by the mmrc k model compared to the mmrc model supports the potential applicability of the model for temporal disaggregation keywords random cascade model k means clustering disaggregation simulation of extreme rainfall data availability rainfall data can not be shared without the permission from indian meteorological department but the model code can be shared on request to the authors 1 introduction access to precipitation data at finer resolutions across various time scales is required for studies related to hydrological applications such as rainfall runoff modeling flood forecasting urban drainage modeling etc especially extreme rainfall however rainfall time series at finer resolution for a long duration is not readily available hence the need for disaggregation of rainfall from low resolution rainfall time series to finer time steps using statistical models extensive literature is available on the methods for disaggregation of rainfall stern coe 1984 have developed a model for daily rainfall in which wet and dry days occur in a markov chain with seasonally dependent transition probabilities the rainfall disaggregation model based on the stochastic point process has been studied by waymire and gupta 1981 cowpertwait et al 1996 koutsoyiannis et al 2003 onof and wang 2020 rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 studied the cluster based poisson process for stochastic rainfall modeling wójcik and buishand 2003 westra et al 2012 breinl et al 2015 breinl and di baldassarre 2019 put forward another model based on the method of fragments olsson 1998 has modeled the scaling behavior of rainfall using a cascade process called microcanonical multiplicative random cascade mmrc model various authors have supported the presence of scaling property of rainfall e g hubert et al 1993 olsson 1998 olsson et al 1992 onof et al 1996 the scaling property refers to symmetry across scales the microcanonical property of the model ensures conservation of volume at all levels in the disaggregation process guntner et al 2001 licznar et al 2011 2015 müller and haberlandt 2018 müller thomy 2020 olsson and bemdtsson 1998 assessment of extreme precipitation events is vital for hydrologic risk analysis and design evaluation of rainfall extremes as embodied in intensity duration frequency idf relationship has been a prime focus in both theoretical and applied hydrology idf curves capture extreme rainfall characteristics rainfall frequency relations are extensively used in design of stormwater management systems drainage systems etc in the current study the mmrc model is applied for disaggregation of rainfall from 1 day to 1 hour scale a scale range of high practical significance in four stations of major cities in india namely delhi mumbai kolkata and chennai a mixed branching scheme of 2 and 3 branches lisniak et al 2013 muller thomy 2020 has been used in the model as it is not possible to obtain 1 hour resolution rainfall by subsequent two branching of 24 hour rainfall the results are compared based on statistical variables olsson 1998 and the idf curves the model can generate an acceptable rainfall time series however significant discrepancies were observed in the intensity values of the idf curves overestimation of extreme rainfall in the mmrc model generated rainfall series is previously established by guntner et al 2001 pui et al 2012 for different rainfall conditions hence to improve the preservation of extreme rainfall we present a new model based on a random multiplicative cascade process where k means clustering mcqueen 1967 is introduced for the classification of the rainfall boxes and parameter generation of the model mmrc k k means clustering is a vector quantization method that divides the observations into a particular number of clusters based on their closeness to specific center points called cluster centroids the optimum number of clusters has been selected by using the elbow method thorndike 1953 marutho et al 2018 the optimum number of clusters depends on the data set s characteristics which makes the model flexible to use with data sets of varying properties the model has been applied to all four stations for disaggregation from a daily to 1 hour scale the generated rainfall time series was tested by comparing statistical variables and idf curves extracted from the time series with that of the observed data the mmrc k model generated rainfall time series can effectively capture the extreme rainfall characteristics for all four stations however the calculated statistical variables are underestimated compared to mmrc 2 study area and data delhi mumbai kolkata and chennai the four major cities in india have been selected as study locations the cities receive monsoon rainfall majorly the various attributes of the rainfall received by the stations are listed in table 1 it can be observed that although each of the stations belongs to a monsoon climatic region they have individuality in the characteristics of the precipitation they receive the hourly data for all four stations have been collected from indian meteorological department imd the data has been pre processed before using it in the models the missing data has been filled in using linear extrapolation for mumbai kolkata and chennai data from 01 01 1969 to 30 12 2020 52 years was available whereas for delhi data was available from 01 01 1969 to 12 12 2014 46 years the non overlapping moving window method is used to convert the hourly resolution data to daily resolution 3 methodology 3 1 microcanonical multiplicative random cascade mmrc model the mmrc model disaggregates coarser resolution data to a finer resolution the advantage of using an mmrc model is the microcanonical property of the model which ensures the conservation of rainfall volume at every level of the cascade therefore aggregation of the disaggregated time series would result exactly in the original observed time series the model works in two steps first it aggregates the observed data to find the parameters and then disaggregates low resolution rainfall using the parameters generated in the first step to a higher resolution the use of observed daily time series as input for parameter generation is a strong advantage of the cascade model müller et al 2018 the mmrc model is described in detail in the following sections 3 1 1 model fig 1 shows the schematic representation of the multiplicative cascade model used in the present study each level represents a time series at a particular resolution for our current study level 0 represents 24 hour resolution and level 4 represents 1 hour resolution the transition to the next level from the previous will double or triple the resolution as per the branching scheme b 2 or 3 respectively and this transition process is called modulation the model comprises discrete time intervals called rainfall boxes or rainfall cells in this paper the rainfall volume is the rainfall depth multiplied by the unit area of each rainfall box or cell the model repetitively branches each box of a rainfall time series at cascade level k with a given timescale tk into b child cells of equal and subsequently smaller timescales t k 1 t k b at level k 1 and assigning each child cell a rainfall amount obtained by multiplying the rainfall volume rk of the parent cell by a weighting factor w the redistribution of the cells is performed for wet cells only i e cells with non zero values but the branching is done for all the cells the number of cells created can in principle assume any integer value b 2 with b 2 being the simplest case lisniak et al 2013 the model scheme diagram resembles a tree b is called the branching number it starts with the daily values level 0 and the process repeats till it reaches the tk value of 1 h level 4 disaggregation of 1 hour rainfall from 24 hour rainfall cannot be achieved with only subsequent doubling i e b 2 hence a mixed branching of b 2 and b 3 is adopted in this study lisniak et al 2013 in this study b 3 at 3 hour to 1 hour is used the choice of b 3 at this level has no physical reason and is used to achieve 1 hour scale rainfall from daily scale rainfall by using b 2 at the other levels muller thomy 2020 the weights can take any value in the closed interval 0 1 however the microcanonical feature of the mmrc model ensures the conservation of rainfall volume hence the sum of the weights ws for redistribution of a cell value must be equal to 1 3 1 2 procedure of parameter generation in the case of b 2 only one weight is required to be determined w 1 the other weight w 2 1 w 1 owing to the microcanonical property of the model the process of assigning values for w is called a cascade generator the weights can be distributed in three possible ways firstly w 1 1 and w 2 0 which is referred to as 1 0 division second is the opposite i e w 1 0 and w 2 1 and is referred to as 0 1 division the third possibility is w 1 x and w 2 1 x and is referred as x 1 x distribution where 0 x 1 when referring to x 1 x division the weights are distributed as a uniform distribution in modulation between two cascade levels p 1 0 p 0 1 and p x x are defined as the probability of having a 1 0 0 1 or x 1 x distribution respectively here x is an empirically distributed random number guntner et al 2001 thus the random cascade generator for b 2 can be represented as equation 1 1 w 1 w 2 1 and 0 with probability p 1 0 0 and 1 with probability p 0 1 x and 1 x with probability p x 1 x in the case of b 3 the random cascade generator must be extended by incorporating a third weight w3 along with w1 and w2 such that w 1 w 2 w 3 1 explaining the microcanonical property of the model here the random cascade generator can assume seven states lisniak et al 2013 with their corresponding probabilities similar to the case with b 2 the random cascade generator for b 3 can be represented as equation 2 2 w 1 w 2 w 3 1 0 0 with probability p 1 0 0 0 1 0 with probability p 0 1 0 0 0 1 with probability p 0 0 1 x 1 x 0 with probability p x 1 x 0 x 0 1 x with probability p x 0 1 x 0 x 1 x with probability p 0 x 1 x x y 1 x y with probability p x y 1 x y here x and y are empirically distributed random numbers lisniak et al 2013 in the case of the last condition of equation 2 x can take values in the range of 0 1 but y is conditioned on x such that the range of values that y can assume is 0 1 x lisniak et al 2013 the mmrc model can be divided into two parts 1 aggregation where parameters are generated and 2 disaggregation where the rainfall is broken down into finer resolutions using parameters generated in the 1st part 3 1 3 aggregation in this part the model is calibrated i e the parameters are generated from the observed data the procedure can be summarized as follows at each cascade level the wet boxes i e boxes with non zero values were divided into position class and volume class position classes were divided into four types 1 starting box where the preceding box was dry but the succeeding is wet 2 enclosed box where the preceding and succeeding boxes are wet 3 ending box where the preceding box is wet but the succeeding box is dry 4 isolated box where both preceding and succeeding boxes are dry the volume class is divided into two types 1 above the mean and 2 below the mean volume of the position class olsson 1998 the use of volume class ensures the parameters dependence on the volume of rainfall therefore there will be a total of eight classes the model is aggregated from the time series by reconstructing the generator in the aggregation from level j to level i j 1 for each wet box at level i the class and the weights are determined by dividing each volume at level i by the corresponding volume at level j for a particular class at level i if we assume the number of wet boxes is obtained as n i and the number of wet boxes associated with a division x 1 x for the case of b 2 is obtained as n i x 1 x then the probability of a certain class for the particular division is determined as p x 1 x n i x 1 x n i the same procedure is applied for b 3 where the divisions increase to seven types each having three parts as mentioned in equation 2 therefore at each level of the cascade for b 2 there will be a set of 24 probabilities three sets for each of eight classes and for b 3 there will be a set of 56 probabilities 7 sets for each of eight classes 3 1 4 disaggregation the disaggregation of rainfall amounts between the child cells can therefore be summarized as follows for each cell a determine the position and volume class to select the set of probability values b a uniformly distributed random number r in the interval 0 1 is generated to determine the state of the cascade generator for the branching of that particular cell as per the probabilities as discussed in section 3 1 3 of the class it falls into c the cascade weights are generated according to the rules defined below for b 2 1 if r p 1 0 a 1 0 division is made i e w 1 1 w 2 0 2 if p 1 0 r p 1 0 p 0 1 then a 0 1 division is made 3 if r p 1 0 p 0 1 a x x division is made in the third scenario the weights are generated as an empirically distributed random number güntner et al 2001 between 0 and 1 for b 3 1 if r p 1 0 0 1 0 0 division is done i e w 1 1 w 2 0 w 3 0 2 if p 1 0 0 r p 1 0 0 p 0 1 0 then 0 1 0 division is made 3 if p 1 0 0 p 0 1 0 r p 1 0 0 p 0 1 0 p 0 0 1 then 0 0 1 division is made 4 if p 1 0 0 p 0 1 0 p 0 0 1 r p 1 0 0 p 0 1 0 p 0 0 1 p x 1 x 0 then x 1 x 0 division is made i e w 1 x w 2 1 x w 3 0 5 if p 1 0 0 p 0 1 0 p 0 0 1 p x 1 x 0 r p 1 0 0 p 0 1 0 p 0 0 1 p x 1 x 0 p x 0 1 x then x 0 1 x division is made 6 if p 1 0 0 p 0 1 0 p 0 0 1 p x 1 x 0 p x 0 1 x p x 0 1 x r 1 0 0 p 0 1 0 p 0 0 1 p x 1 x 0 p x 0 1 x p x 0 1 x p 0 x 1 x then 0 x 1 x division is made 7 if r 1 0 0 p 0 1 0 p 0 0 1 p x 1 x 0 p x 0 1 x p x 0 1 x p 0 x 1 x then x y 1 x y division is made i e w 1 x w 2 y w 3 1 x y here x and y are determined as empirically distributed random numbers güntner et al 2001 lisniak et al 2013 here x can take any value in the range of 0 1 but y is conditioned on x such that y can assume any number between 0 1 x d finally after the weights are generated each cell is redistributed as per the set of weights associated with an individual cell if rainfall volume in a cell is considered as r and the distributing weight is w for a particular cell then 3 r j w r i j i 1 3 2 microcanonical multiplicative random cascade with k means clustering mmrc k model the present study focuses on conserving the extreme rainfall of the disaggregated rainfall time series hence a new method for classification and parameter generation in a random cascade process is introduced as k means clustering k means clustering is a classification process where an optimum number of clusters are used in clustering the data rather than any arbitrary number of clusters this paper finds the optimum number of clusters using the elbow method marutho et al 2018 the optimum number of clusters depends on the characteristics of the data considered hence the application of k means clustering in the mmrc k model makes it flexible for applications with data of varying properties in contrast the mmrc model follows a rigid classification process that depends on the position and volume of the rainfall of each box the mmrc k model is expected to generate a rainfall time series with improved preservation of the extreme rainfall along with conservation of the nature and characteristics of the rainfall 3 2 1 k means clustering the k means clustering is one of the most widely used clustering methods and has been implemented in many fields of science and technology k means clustering aims to minimize the sum of the distances between the points within a cluster and their respective cluster centroid the optimal number of clusters is determined initially cluster centroids k are selected randomly from the data all data points near each centroid are grouped into the same cluster and then the centroids of each cluster are calculated the iteration process of grouping into clusters and calculating the centroids is repeated until the centroid of the previous iteration step is the same as in the current iteration step or the data points remain in the same cluster as the previous iteration step or the maximum number of iterations is completed in this study 3 dimensional clustering is used to classify the boxes where the three dimensions are current rainfall lag 1 rainfall and lead 1 rainfall hence each point in the three dimensional space will have a coordinate representing the current box s rainfall the preceding box s rainfall and the succeeding box s rainfall hence like in the mmrc model where the classes depend on the position of the box in the rainfall sequence and its volume there is a dependence of clusters in the mmrc k model as well on the position of the box in the rainfall sequence and its volume the 3 dimensional clustering for the observed 1 hour rainfall time series for delhi station is illustrated in fig 2 the optimal number of clusters is determined using the elbow method thorndike 1953 the sum of the distances of the data points from their corresponding centroids is calculated for a different number of clusters sumd and is plotted against the number of clusters k the point after which there is no steep decrease in the sum of distances i e where an elbow is formed is taken as the optimum number of clusters the optimum numbers of clusters are calculated at each level of the model for the four stations it is found that the optimum number of clusters are equal for all levels for all four stations fig 3 hence in the model scale invariance is assumed for the optimum number of clusters from daily to hourly resolution in the present study the optimum number of clusters k is found for 1 hour resolution using the elbow method fig 3 e 3 j 3 o and 3 t and found to be 4 for all the four stations hence k 4 is incorporated in the classification of the rainfall boxes in the model for the four stations 3 2 2 model the mmrc k model is based on a random cascade process similar to the mmrc model the method of classification of the boxes and hence parameter generation in mmrc k differ from that of mmrc in the case of mmrc k k means clustering is used for classification at each level in this paper the rainfall boxes are divided using 3d k means clustering instead of manually classifying the boxes based on the rainfall position and volume as mentioned in section 3 2 1 the optimum number of clusters was found to be 4 and hence the rainfall is divided into four classes using k means clustering unlike the eight classes in the mmrc model hence there will be four sets of probability for each class i e a total of 12 probabilities for two branching for three branching there will be a total of 28 probabilities 7 probabilities for four classes hence compared to the mmrc model the mmrc k model requires less number of parameters mmrc k model incorporates a mixed type of branching similar to the mmrc model for disaggregation from daily to 1 hour resolution in the mmrc k model for two branchings b 2 the random cascade generator is the same as equation 1 whereas in the case of three branchings b 3 the random cascade generator is represented as equation 4 4 w 1 w 2 w 3 1 0 0 with probability p 1 0 0 0 1 0 with probability p 0 1 0 0 0 1 with probability p 0 0 1 x 1 x 0 with probability p x 1 x 0 x 0 1 x with probability p x 0 1 x 0 x 1 x with probability p 0 x 1 x 1 3 1 3 1 3 with probability p 1 3 1 3 1 3 as in the case of the mmrc model the mmrc k model also operates in two steps aggregation and disaggregation for both aggregation and disaggregation the boxes are classified using k means clustering after the classification of the boxes parameter and weight generation in the aggregation and disaggregation process follows the same method as discussed in sections 3 1 3 and 3 1 4 respectively except instead of p x y 1 x y p 1 3 1 3 1 3 is calculated and used equation 4 therefore for b 3 the 7th condition for weight generation will be as follows if r p 1 0 0 p 0 1 0 p 0 0 1 p x 1 x 0 p x 0 1 x p x 0 1 x p 0 x 1 x then 0 33 0 33 0 33 division is made i e w 1 1 3 w 2 1 3 w 3 1 3 using a factor of 1 3 rather than using the x y 1 x y in equation 4 for redistribution of rainfall boxes divides the rainfall volume uniformly mmrc model tends to overestimate extreme rainfall guntner 2001 pui 2012 which can be observed from the results mentioned in the next section distributing the rainfall uniformly rather than getting distributed such that one box is distributed with high and the rest of the two boxes with low rainfall ensures that the overestimation of extreme rainfall amount is reduced hence it improves the ability of the model to conserve extreme rainfall characteristics distributing the rainfall boxes symmetrically will result in a lower average individual rainfall volume in the model generated ra infall time series however other aspects of the model generated rainfall time series like percentage zero values event volume event duration and dry period length will not get affected as a result of the uniform distribution of the rainfall box after weights are generated each lower resolution rainfall box is redistributed as per the set of weights associated with each cell equation 3 3 3 establishment of intensity duration frequency curve the characteristics of extreme rainfall events are well captured in the idf curve an idf curve gives the expected rainfall intensity of a given storm duration having desired frequency of occurrence idf curve is a graph with duration plotted as abscissa intensity as ordinate and a series of curves one for each return period the frequency is expressed in terms of the return period the idf analysis is done by collecting rainfall data of different durations annual maxima were extracted for all the different rainfall durations the durations considered were 1 h 3 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h the maximum intensity for a particular duration for a specific time period is determined using the standard equation of gumbel s extreme value type i distribution ev i which is fitted using the method of moments the general equation of frequency analysis singh 1998 maity 2018 is 5 x t x k s where x t design intensity for a particular duration and a particular return period x mean of the annual maximum for a particular duration s standard deviation of the annual maximum for a particular duration k frequency factor the frequency factor k is derived from the standard equation of the ev i distribution function chow 1953 chow et al 1988 6 k 6 π 0 5772 l n l n t t 1 this equation was derived by chow 1953 to write the frequency factor k in terms of the return period t the different return periods considered in this paper are 2 years 5 years 10 years 20 years and 50 years 4 results and discussion for an improved representation of the extreme rainfall in the disaggregated rainfall time series the mmrc k model is introduced the rainfall time series generated by the mmrc model and mmrc k model are compared with observed rainfall and tested for conservation of extreme rainfall along with the acceptability of the generated time series firstly to compare the statistical reliability of the model output time series five statistical variables were considered which can depict the nature and characteristics of the rainfall namely 1 percentage zero values 2 individual rainfall volume or average intensity 3 event rainfall volume 4 event duration and 5 length of dry period olsson 1998 here individual rainfall volume is the rainfall volume or depth of each non zero rainfall box and event means the event of continuous rainfall in the discrete rainfall boxes the mean and standard deviation for each variable is calculated and both models results are compared with observed rainfall the results for all four stations are mentioned in table 2 considering the random nature of the model the results obtained are an average of 500 iterations table 2 shows that both models underestimate the mean of event duration and dry period however for mmrc k underestimation is higher than mmrc it implies that the mmrc k model generates a higher number of shorter duration rainfall events than the mmrc model the shorter rainfall event results in the underestimation of the average event volume table 2 the number of dry periods every year for chennai station is plotted in fig 4 it is observed that in the case of mmrc k model generated rainfall the number of dry spells is overestimated considerably compared to mmrc model generated rainfall the number of yearly dry periods higher and average dry periods lower than mmrc implies that a higher number of short dry periods is generated in the mmrc k model the percentage zero values of the rainfall series for all the stations table 2 are overestimated in the mmrc model and underestimated in the mmrc k model compared to the percentage zero values of the observed rainfall this observation implies that the mmrc k model produces more wet boxes while mmrc produces less than the observed rainfall time series the average individual rainfall volume is overestimated in the mmrc model generated rainfall time series whereas underestimated in the mmrc k model generated time series for all the stations the lower values of the mean of individual rainfall volume are more pronounced in the case of mmrc k compared to the mmrc model table 2 the underestimation of the mean of individual volume in the mmrc k compared to the mmrc model may be because of the uniform distribution of rainfall volume applied in the division of three wet boxes equation 4 in the mmrc k model compared to the random distribution of rainfall equation 2 in the mmrc model the statistical variables calculated in table 2 show that the mmrc model generated rainfall series is in closer agreement with the observed series than the mmrc k the second part tests the preservation of extreme rainfall characteristics by both models idf curves developed from the model generated rainfall using gumbel s extreme value type i distribution and are compared with the idf curves generated from the observed rainfall the intensity values for different duration and frequencies are generated and averaged over 500 iterations idf curves for return periods of 2 years 5 years 10 years 20 years and 50 years and duration of 1 h 3 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h are obtained from rainfall time series generated from the mmrc model for all the four stations they are compared with the idf curves obtained from the observed rainfall time series for the same frequency and duration of rainfall fig 5 a 5 d 5 g and 5 j shows the idf curve calculated from the original rainfall time series and fig 5 b 5 e 5 h and 5 k shows idf curves calculated from the mmrc model generated rainfall time series for the four stations comparing the intensity values of the idf curves calculated from the mmrc model generated time series and from the original time series a high discrepancy is observed between them it can be inferred that the mmrc model highly overestimates the intensity values of the idf curves the percentage deviation of the intensity values calculated from the mmrc model generated time series from the original is plotted in fig 6 a 6 c 6 e and 6 g percentage deviation is calculated using equation 7 overestimation of extreme rainfall by the mmrc model was established by guntner et al 2001 pui et al 2012 in different rainfall conditions 7 percentage deviation observed model generated observed 100 idf curves are plotted for all four stations at exact durations and return periods for the mmrc k model generated rainfall time series fig 5 c 5 f 5 i and 5 l and compared with idf curves generated from observed rainfall series fig 5 a 5 d 5 g and 5 j it can be observed that the mmrc k model performs well in preserving idf curves for all four stations however for kolkata and chennai stations deviations in the intensities are observed for higher frequency and finer resolution rainfall it can be seen that the idf curves plotted from mmrc k model generated time series are closer to the idf curves from the observed rainfall time series as compared to the idf curves from the mmrc model generated time series the percentage deviation of the intensity values equation 7 calculated of the mmrc k model generated time series from the original is plotted in fig 6 d 6 d 6 f and 6 h comparing the percentage deviations in the intensity values for both mmrc and mmrc k models suggests better conservation of extreme rainfall by the mmrc k model to further manifest the improvement in the preservation of extreme rainfall by the mmrc k model a scatter plot between observed rainfall values and the model generated rainfall values is plotted corresponding to different quantile values the 1 hour resolution rainfall time series is considered for the plot for the four stations and plotted for the output rainfall time series of both mmrc and mmrc k fig 7 a 7 d shows that the mmrc k model performs better in conserving the extreme rainfall in the generated rainfall time series than the mmrc model for all the stations 5 conclusion mmrc and mmrc k rainfall disaggregation models are based on the principles of the multiplicative random cascade process although the mmrc model can generate an acceptable rainfall time series it fails to conserve the extreme rainfall a new mmrc k model based on the random cascade process is introduced where k means clustering is applied in the classification process of the boxes the introduction of k means clustering has added to the robustness of the model both mmrc and mmrc k model is applied for disaggregation of daily rainfall to obtain a 1 hour scale rainfall time series the models have been applied to 4 stations within india with varying rainfall characteristics table 1 to assess the acceptability of the model for disaggregation five statistical variables olsson 1998 calculated from 1 hour resolution model generated and observed rainfall time series table 2 are compared the comparison shows that the statistical variables calculated from the mmrc model generated rainfall time series is closer to the variables calculated fom the observed rainfall than the variables calculated from the mmrc k model generated timeseries however discrepancies were observed in the statistical variables for both model generated rainfall time series the rainfall time series generated by both models were used to develop the idf curves to establish the ability of the models for conservation of extreme rainfall characteristics the idf curves generated from both models were compared with the idf curves obtained from the observed rainfall time series from the idf curves and the plot of percentage deviation of the intensities of the idf curves calculated from the time series generated from both models it can be inferred that the mmrc k model can provide superior preservation of the idf curves compared to the mmrc model fig 7 a 7 d further holds up the better preservation of extreme rainfall by the mmrc k model while focusing on better conservation of extreme rainfall in the mmrc k model there is some underestimation in the rainfall characteristics in the model generated time series however the improved performance of the mmrc k model for the conservation of extreme rainfall characteristics supports the model s relevancy for the disaggregation of rainfall the model generated rainfall time series will find its application in hydrological analysis and design where extreme rainfall characteristics at fine resolution are crucial in this paper the model is studied in the indian monsoon rainfall only hence the relevance of the mmrc k model shall be studied in other rainfall conditions to check for the agility of the model for disaggregation of rainfall with varying rainfall characteristics further other clustering processes can be explored for the classification process to generate disaggregated rainfall series with better preservation of rainfall characteristics credit authorship contribution statement p deka methodology

1944,identification of hydrothermal systems affected by magmatic fluid input is relevant for geothermal energy development thus an approach for identifying such systems based on chlorine isotope composition and auxiliary hydrochemical indices was proposed the approach enabled us to distinguish rehai a magmatic hydrothermal area in the tengchong volcanic region of china from several other typical non magmatic hydrothermal areas in tengchong menglian shiqiang and jietou the hot springs in the non rehai areas featured high δ37cl values reflecting an exclusive contribution of chlorine from hostrock leaching by contrast some hot springs with much lower δ37cl values occurred in rehai all of which were nearly fully equilibrated waters with respect to reservoir hostrocks rich in chloride and bromide these springs should have the closest relationship with the fluids released from the underlying magma chamber notably the potential reservoir processes that geothermal waters may undergo after receiving an input of magmatic fluids can further alter their chlorine isotope compositions to various degrees therefore a deep understanding of these processes would help improve the use of the proposed approach based primarily on chlorine isotopes regarding rehai all the neutral to alkaline hot springs with δ37cl values ranging from 0 44 to 0 31 evolved from a parent geothermal fluid that received an input of magmatic fluids via adiabatic cooling conductive cooling mixing with low temperature shallow groundwaters or a combination of some of these processes by contrast the acidic rehai hot springs with the highest δ37cl values up to 1 12 were essentially locally perched groundwaters heated by geothermal steam separated from underlying geothermal fluids upon their adiabatic cooling thus they were much less to do with the parent geothermal fluid than the neutral to alkaline springs were hence only the neutral to alkaline rehai hot springs not strongly affected by the mixing of shallow groundwaters and adiabatic cooling can reflect the chlorine isotope characteristics of intrusive magmatic fluids overall chlorine isotope composition in combination with hydrochemistry has proven to be a robust tool for identifying a magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal system keywords cl isotope composition hydrochemistry hot spring parent geothermal fluid magmatic fluid reservoir process data availability all the research data related to this paper are included in the tables and the supplementary data 1 introduction high temperature hydrothermal systems are superior to other types of geothermal systems in exploitation and utilization worldwide high temperature hydrothermal systems are densely distributed in hotspots such as yellowstone national park and hawaii usa and tectonic plate boundaries namely the circum pacific mediterranean himalayan atlantic mid ocean ridge and red sea aden bay east african rift geothermal belts many hydrothermal systems in such geological settings should be closely related to shallow magmas that is they are not only heated by underlying magmas but are also directly affected by the release of magmatic fluids from these magmas nevertheless hydrothermal systems unrelated to shallow magma chambers exist in hotspots and active plate margins and in some cases there are no distinct differences between these systems and magmatic fluid affected systems in surface geothermal features e g hot spring temperatures notably a hydrothermal system in the vicinity of a shallow magma chamber that does not receive an input of magmatic fluid may also have much lower reservoir temperatures and therefore lower exploitation values than strictly defined magmatic hydrothermal systems that is those affected directly by magmatic fluid input guo et al 2017 guo 2022 thus these situations present a critical challenge in discriminating between magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal systems and other types i e hydrothermal systems unaffected by shallow magmas and those affected by shallow magmas in terms of thermal conduction but not magmatic fluid input in unexplored geothermal regions where only surface geothermal information is available such discrimination is vital for developing targeted strategies for geothermal exploration and exploitation secondary geophysical signals have been frequently used to indicate the possible existence of shallow magma chambers brown et al 1996 makovsky et al 1996 husen et al 2004 smith et al 2009 chu et al 2010 ye et al 2018 but they cannot indicate whether hydrothermal systems are affected by the input of magmatic fluids by contrast magma derived chemical components are theoretically more appropriate than geophysical signals for directly determining the occurrence of a magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal system however most magmatic gases including hf so2 h2s and co2 are severely affected by precipitation as secondary minerals e g fluorite anhydrite alunite pyrite and calcite in the deep underground owing to their high reactivity giggenbach 1988 moreover that residual magmatic f s and c remain is further masked by supergene geochemical processes such as the input of these elements from non magmatic sources or complex near surface redox processes as to s and c hence none of these constituents are suitable indicators of magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal systems additionally chemically inert gases related to magmas e g mantle he may originate from substantial depths and ascend to the surface through deep fractures therefore their detection in geothermal waters or vapors does not necessarily indicate the occurrence of a shallow magma chamber heating overlying hydrothermal systems either let alone input of magmatic fluids among the magmatic volatiles hcl is possibly the only one effective in bringing direct deep information indicative of existing magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal systems to the near surface although its proportion in typical magmatic gases is generally much lower than that of co2 and total gaseous s so2 and h2s giggenbach and le guern 1976 rose et al 1986 giggenbach 1987 giggenbach 1988 the primary reason for this phenomenon is that hcl is extremely hydrophilic especially at temperatures lower than those of magma ruaya and seward 1987 thus the released magmatic hcl could be substantially absorbed into deeply circulating geothermal waters and easily sampled in hot spring vents or geothermal wells upon geothermal water circulation the absorbed magmatic cl tends to remain in solution as chloride it does not readily precipitate with secondary minerals because chloride is a typical conservative constituent in aqueous environments at normal and high temperatures ellis 1970 arnorsson and andresdottir 1995 however abundant cl in geothermal water also does not certainly indicate the occurrence of a magmatic geothermal system because it is also likely from non magmatic sources for example the mixing of seawater or dissolution of halite hence cl dissolved in geothermal waters can serve as a tool for distinguishing hydrothermal systems receiving magmatic fluid inputs from those unaffected by magmatic fluids only when combined with its stable isotope composition the importance of cl isotope composition in evaluating the potential roles of magmatic fluid input lies in its potential to differentiate between magmatic cl and supergene cl i e cl originating from geochemical processes in supergenic zones e g rock weathering dissolution and seawater mixing either of which could be a predominant source of cl in geothermal waters although various types of magmas feature somewhat different cl isotope compositions they generally have depleted δ37cl values cl in arc magmas largely recycled from subducting slabs depleted in 37cl logically tends to have low δ37cl values li et al 2015 barnes et al 2008 basaltic magmas inheriting the δ37cl signatures of their mantle sources halldorsson et al 2016 which were commonly considered depleted bonifacie et al 2008 layne et al 2009 have low δ37cl values as well crustal silicic magmas have been even shown to have more depleted δ37cl values than basaltic magmas ranta et al 2021 because cl isotope fractionation is negligible under magmatic conditions schauble et al 2003 released magmatic fluids capable of strongly altering the hydrochemical and isotopic compositions of overlying geothermal waters should also be depleted in δ37cl by contrast non magmatic cl is expected to have different isotopic characteristics for example seawaters are marked by a generally homogeneous δ37cl value of 0 kaufmann et al 1984 godon et al 2004 and surface waters or shallow groundwaters of meteoric origins containing cl from the dissolution of relevant minerals such as halite are likely to have δ37cl values close to 0 or slightly higher than that eggenkamp et al 1995 li et al 2015 in summary magmatic cl is likely characterized by isotopic compositions different from those of the supergene cl for example cl originating from the leaching of cl bearing minerals or mixing of seawater thus cl isotope composition is potentially powerful in identifying magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal systems notably few such studies have been conducted therefore the primary aim of this study was to test the feasibility of using the cl isotope composition along with auxiliary hydrochemical indices to distinguish magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal systems from those of other types by considering the tengchong volcanic geothermal region in southwestern china as a typical study area tengchong is suitable for such a study because hydrothermal areas with and without shallow magma chambers have been found there see the next section for details in view that even in a magma heated hydrothermal area not all hot springs are affected by magmatic fluids we also showed how to distinguish magmatic fluid affected hot springs from those not affected in rehai a typical magmatic hydrothermal area in tengchong specifically three groups of rehai hot springs with being affected by magmatic fluid input to distinctively different degrees were identified as shown in fig s1 see the details for the classification of rehai hot springs in section 5 this study provides a reference for identification of unexplored magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal systems across china and worldwide 2 descriptions of the study areas most magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal systems in china are situated in the yunnan sichuan tibet yst geothermal province part of the mediterranean himalayan geothermal belt and the taiwan geothermal province part of the circum pacific geothermal belt fig 1 similar to the situation in the remaining active plate margins there are many unexplored hydrothermal systems with unknown heat sources either magmatic or non magmatic in these two geothermal provinces tengchong a typical volcanic geothermal region in the yst comprises tens of hydrothermal areas the tengchong volcanic region is in the tengchong terrane which is recognized as the southeastern continuation of the lhasa gangdise terrane where subduction related mantle magmatism is likely to occur pham et al 1986 zhou et al 1995 brown et al 1996 unsworth et al 2005 therefore magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal systems are highly likely to have formed in tengchong more importantly tengchong is unique to mainland china because only in this region have both quaternary volcanic activities been documented tong and zhang 1989 li et al 2000 and shallow magma chambers been presumed to exist based on geophysical evidence ye et al 2018 zhao et al 2021 by contrast all the other late cenozoic volcanoes across mainland china are distributed in northeastern china northern china southeastern china and northern tibet where magmatic hydrothermal activity has not been reported fig 1 tong et al 1990 the total area of the outcropping volcanic rocks in tengchong including basalt andesite andesite and dacite fig 1 exceeds 1000 km2 tong and zhang 1989 daying ma an and heikong hills are the youngest volcanoes in tengchong with k ar ages of 81 104 ka 23 83 ka jiang 1998 and 7 14 ka nakai et al 1993 respectively of the tengchong hydrothermal areas rehai menglian shiqiang and jietou were selected for this study rehai is characterized by the most intense hydrothermal activities the most diversified surface geothermal manifestations e g hydrothermal explosions fumaroles geysers steaming ground and hot springs and the occurrence of hot springs 44 96 c with the most varied hydrochemical types guo et al 2014a it consists of four subareas liuhuangtang zaotanghe langpu and huangguaqing fig 1 rehai is not situated in the central outcropping area of the tengchong volcanic rocks and the surface rocks in the rehai area are primarily miocene gravelstone and sandstone with andesite and basalt distributed in a scattered manner rehai is an ideal site to test whether the hot springs have chlorine isotope compositions indicative of magmatic fluid input because the existence of a basaltic magma chamber beneath rehai as shallow as 7 km has been inferred based on geological and geophysical observations bai et al 1994 liao et al 1997 liao and zhao 1999 bai et al 2001 the magma chamber was speculated to have formed during one of the stages of tengchong magmatism it could have originated from a partially melted upper mantle derived magmatic intrusion but then inevitably mixed with crustal materials during its ascent to shallow levels tong and zhang 1989 as a structurally complicated hydrothermal system rehai consists of multiple reservoir levels and the geothermal waters in various reservoirs are characterized by different recharge and flow regimes liao and zhao 1999 shangguan 2000 guo et al 2014a the acidic geothermal waters reside in the shallowest aquifers with miocene granitic gravelstone and sandstone as host rocks and are recharged by local precipitation they are essentially short circulated groundwater heated by steam separated from the underlying circumneutral geothermal fluids liao and zhao 1999 guo et al 2014a by contrast circumneutral geothermal fluids in deeper reservoirs are recharged primarily by precipitation in the gaoligong mountain area lying east of rehai fig 1 tong and zhang 1989 in the conceptual flow mode a large amount of precipitation infiltrates the gaoligong mountain areas and then flows laterally deep underground below rehai where it is heated by the underlying magma chamber and receives the input of magmatic fluids released from the magma tong and zhang 1989 thereafter the deepest geothermal fluid in rehai flows upward to feed the overlying reservoirs as observed in typical magmatic hydrothermal systems elsewhere for example yellowstone national park usa fournier 1979 and yangyi china guo et al 2009 relevant geological and geophysical investigations liao et al 1997 liao and zhao 1999 have suggested that the cap rocks of the circumneutral geothermal fluids in rehai were strongly altered miocene gravelstone and sandstone and the reservoir host rocks comprised granite and granitic gneiss fig 1 different from rehai the other three hydrothermal areas menglian shiqiang and jietou exhibited low temperature hydrothermal activities hot springs with temperatures varying from approximately 40 to 60 c are the sole surface geothermal manifestations although no boreholes have been drilled into the reservoirs in menglian shiqiang and jietou and there is an absence of detailed information on the stratigraphic distribution the reservoir hostrocks are presumed to be felsic rocks felsic rocks intercalated by carbonate rocks and carbonate rocks intercalated by felsic rocks according to the hydrochemical compositions of the geothermal waters to date there is no geological geophysical or geochemical evidence of the existence of shallow magmas below these three areas their heat sources are local crustal and mantle heat flows in a generally normal geothermal background specifically radiogenic heat from the upper crust crustal heat flow and conductive heat from the mantle mantle heat flow are responsible for the formation of these hydrothermal systems hence they can be regarded as typical non magmatic hydrothermal systems to show how their geothermal waters differ from those of magmatic fluid affected geothermal waters in terms of chlorine isotope compositions 3 methods 3 1 sample collection and analysis eighteen hot spring samples and one cold spring sample were collected from the tengchong volcanic geothermal region of the sampled hot springs 15 were in the rehai hydrothermal area eight at the liuhuangtang site five at the zaotanghe site and two at the langpu site and the other three were in the menglian shiqiang and jietou hydrothermal areas the cold spring sample was collected from the rehai area the locations of all sampling sites are presented in fig 1 moreover three rock samples two granite samples and one granitic gneiss sample corresponding to the reservoir host rocks of the rehai hydrothermal system were collected from the surrounding areas of rehai where these rocks outcrop before the fieldwork the water sampling bottles made of high density polyethylene were soaked in 5 hcl in the laboratory and then rinsed with ultrapure water thrice the samples were also rinsed with filtered spring water at the sampling sites the ph spring temperature t and electrical conductivity were measured beforehand using handheld meters all the samples except those for analysis of alkalinity were filtered on site with 0 22 μm pore size cellulose acetate membranes total alkalinity was determined on the sampling day via the gran titration method the hco3 and co3 2 concentrations of all spring water samples were calculated from the measured values of alkalinity and ph using phreeqc incorporating the wateq4f database parkhurst and appelo 1999 for analysis of metal and metalloid elements 14 m reagent grade hno3 was added to one sample split collected at each spring to realize a ph less than 1 whereas no chemicals were added to the sample splits for the analysis of major anions in the laboratory the concentrations of cl br so4 2 and f were determined by ion chromatography ic those of k na ca mg and si were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes and those of li rb cs b al and fe were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms the chlorine isotope compositions of the spring samples were measured using a thermo fisher triton thermal ionization mass spectrometer tims see the instrumental parameters in table s1 at the qinghai institute of salt lake of the chinese academy of sciences applying the procedures described by xiao and zhang 1992 xiao et al 1995 1998 and han et al 2019 the aqueous samples to be analyzed were passed through ba type and ag type resins to remove so4 2 and no3 respectively to eliminate their severe interference in chlorine isotope determination an h type resin to remove all the cations with the cl ions being converted to hcl and a cs type resin to form cs2cl the formed cs2cl was coated on a mass spectrometer metal tantalum tape 1 5 cm 0 098 cm 0 0025 cm which was vacuum degassed at 3a current for 1 h and treated with 2 5 μl graphite suspension in advance the ratio of 37cs2cl to 35cs2cl in the samples was determined using a multicollector tims instrument equipped with a central cup and eight independently movable faraday cups specifically the samples were loaded into the tims with its ion source vacuumed from 2 10 7 to 3 10 7 bar and the static double receiver method was used to obtain the 37cs2cl to 35cs2cl ratios the δ37cl values of the samples were calculated using the following equation δ 37 cl 37 cl 35 cl sample 37 cl 35 cl standard 1 1000 where the 37cl 35cl ratio of the iaea isl 354 nacl standard is 0 319090 0 000086 the rock samples used for the chloride and bromine analyses were crushed into a fine powder using a ball mill powdered rock samples 200 mesh were subjected to pyrohydrolysis for chloride and bromine extraction as described in wang et al 2018 in brief the powdered samples were mixed with quartz sand placed in a porcelain boat and heated for 25 min in a silica tube at 1200 c during which a constant oxygen flow and h2o vapor steam were maintained to extract the chloride and bromine the released chloride and bromine were collected using a mixed na2co3 nahco3 solution diluted with deionized water and analyzed using ic and icp ms respectively the sampling information in situ parameters chloride and bromide concentrations and chlorine isotope compositions of all spring samples are presented in table 1 and their hydrochemical compositions except chloride and bromide concentrations are listed in table s2 the sampling information and the chlorine and bromine contents of the rock samples are presented in table 2 3 2 t test a t test was used to determine whether the difference between the two groups of values was statistically significant or simply due to random chance assessing the difference between the values for two groups requires referencing the ratio of the difference between their means relative to the spread or variability of their values i e by obtaining the t value using the t value and degrees of freedom the sum of the sample numbers of both groups minus two the probability of these two groups being the same i e p level can be calculated a p level less than 0 05 indicates only a 5 chance that two sets of values are from the same group in this case they are significantly different 3 3 geothermometer measurements geothermometers have been widely used to estimate geothermal system temperatures based on the concentrations of relevant chemical constituents in a surface geothermal water sample the corresponding reservoir temperature can be calculated from the temperature dependent subsurface water rock equilibria in this study a quartz geothermometer fournier and potter 1982 was employed to estimate the reservoir temperatures which were then used for various purposes such as plotting an enthalpy relative to chloride diagram the quartz geothermometer proposed by fournier and potter 1982 is expressed as follows t 42 198 0 28831 m 3 6686 m 2 10000 3 1665 m 3 10000000 77 034 lg m where t is the estimated reservoir temperature and m represents the si concentration of the corresponding geothermal water sample mg sio2 l 3 4 isotope mass balance model in this study an isotope mass balance model presuming a successive infiltrating water flow in chemical and isotopic equilibrium with contacting reservoir rocks pennisi et al 2000 yamaoka et al 2015 was used to calculate the theoretical chloride concentrations and δ37cl values of the rehai geothermal waters assuming that the leaching of reservoir rocks instead of the input of magmatic fluids controls the chlorine geochemistry therefore the result is a function of the initial chlorine concentrations and isotope compositions of the infiltrating meteoric water and reservoir rock reacting with the water the ratio of the final chlorine concentration in the rock to that in the geothermal water i e the chlorine distribution coefficient the mass ratio of geothermal water to reservoir rock and the chlorine isotope fractionation factor at the reservoir temperature specifically the chloride concentrations and δ37cl values of the rehai geothermal waters in the case that they would be determined by leaching of reservoir rocks alone can be calculated using the following model cl water f cl rock i rcl water i d cl r δ 37 cl water f cl rock i 1000 δ 37 cl rock i rcl water i 1000 δ 37 cl water i cl rock i rcl water i d cl r α d cl r where cl water f and δ 37 cl water f are the cl concentration and the δ37cl value of the geothermal water at water rock interaction equilibrium respectively cl water i and cl rock i are the initial cl concentrations of the infiltrated water and the reservoir rock respectively δ 37 cl water i and δ 37 cl rock i are the initial δ37cl values of the infiltrated water and the reservoir rock respectively r is the mass ratio of the reacted geothermal water to the reacted reservoir rock d cl is the distribution coefficient of cl between the reacted reservoir rock and the reacted geothermal water defined as d cl cl rock f cl water f and α is the isotopic fractionation factor of chlorine between the reservoir rock and the geothermal water defined as α 37 35 cl rock f 37 35 cl water f 37 35 cl rock f and 37 35 cl water f are the 37cl 35cl ratios of the reservoir rock and the geothermal water at water rock interaction equilibrium respectively in the model the average chlorine content 344 7 ppm of three collected rehai rock samples two granite samples and one granitic gneiss sample was considered the initial chlorine content of the rehai reservoir rocks due to a lack of measured δ37cl values of the rock samples a δ37cl value range of acidic magmatic rocks 0 1 to 0 9 from the relevant literature cullen et al 2021 was used to represent the chlorine isotope compositions of the reservoir rocks regarding the infiltrating meteoric water an initial chloride concentration range from 1 to 5 mg l and a δ37cl value of 0 were assumed the chlorine distribution coefficient i e the final concentration ratio of cl in the rock to that in the geothermal water and the chlorine isotope fractionation factor i e the ratio of the 37cl 35cl value of the rock to that of the geothermal water between the rehai geothermal waters and the reservoir silicate rocks have been poorly constrained thus they were presumed to be 0 05 and 1 0005 respectively as in the literature cullen et al 2015 simulating the reactions of geothermal waters with silicate rocks at temperatures comparable to those of the rehai reservoirs the mass ratios of geothermal water to reservoir rock tried in the model were set to be 100 50 20 10 5 2 1 0 5 and 0 2 respectively see the numbers beside the curves in fig 4 3 5 enthalpy relative to chloride diagram for evaluating parent geothermal fluid pgf and reservoir processes reservoir processes including adiabatic cooling conductive cooling and mixing with low temperature shallow groundwater are likely to occur in a high temperature hydrothermal system e g rehai where a pgf residing in the deepest reservoir is expected to exist adiabatic cooling indicates that the temperature of a geothermal fluid either pgf or geothermal fluid in an upper reservoir decreases via its subsurface boiling during which no or little heat is transferred to the contacted rock by contrast in a conductive cooling process the geothermal fluid cools owing to the transfer of its heat to subsurface rocks and boiling does not occur these processes can change the temperatures hydrochemical characteristics and isotopic compositions of the upflowing pgf and geothermal fluids in the upper reservoirs to varying degrees forming diverse types of hot springs fed by reservoir fluids in this study an enthalpy relative to chloride diagram proposed by fournier 1979 was used to estimate the enthalpy value and chloride concentration of the pgf in rehai and identify the critical reservoir processes that the pgf and overlying reservoir fluids have undergone which are responsible for the formation of the rehai hot springs the steam tables recommended by keenan et al 1969 were used to convert the temperatures of the hot springs and reservoir fluids to their enthalpy values in the steam tables the enthalpy values of vapor and liquid and the heat of vaporization over a temperature range from 0 to 374 c were presented values were shown at every one degree celsius from which we could easily obtain the enthalpy values of the investigated hot springs and their corresponding reservoir fluids clarifying the reservoir processes improves the understanding of how the chlorine isotopic compositions of the rehai hot springs indicate the input of magmatic fluids into the rehai hydrothermal system 4 results 4 1 general hydrochemistry and the chloride and bromide concentrations of spring samples the hot springs in the four hydrothermal areas of the tengchong volcanic geothermal region exhibit distinctly hydrochemistry tables 1 and s2 the samples collected from menglian shiqiang and jietou are neutral to alkaline with moderate spring vent temperatures 42 to 61 c vent temperature means the temperature of the spring water at the center of a spring vent they have hco3 as the predominant anion and their major cations are na mg2 or ca2 by contrast the rehai hot springs are characterized by a diversified hydrochemistry with a wide range of ph values 1 3 to 9 2 and sampling temperatures 53 to 96 c they can be cl rich so4 2 rich or hco3 rich na is the primary cation in the neutral to alkaline rehai hot springs whereas h na and ca2 dominate in the acidic rehai hot springs of all the hot spring samples the neutral to alkaline samples collected from the liuhuangtang site of rehai have the highest cl and br concentrations 395 to 719 mg l and 1 71 to 2 33 mg l respectively followed by those from the zaotanghe and langpu sites of rehai 218 to 368 mg l and 0 63 to 0 97 mg l respectively the acid rehai hot springs and the hot springs in menglian shiqiang and jietou generally have much lower cl and br concentrations 9 2 to 42 8 mg l and undetected to 0 17 mg l respectively however the acidic rehai hot springs are marked by the highest molar br cl ratios exceeding 0 004 and the br cl ratios of the hot spring samples from liuhuangtang zaotanghe and langpu were comparable 0 001 to 0 002 in contrast with the neutral to alkaline rehai hot springs the sampled cold spring in rehai as expected has much lower concentrations of common dissolved constituents including cl and br it is neutral in ph and rich in na hco3 and cl 4 2 chlorine isotope compositions of spring samples as shown in table 1 the acid experiencing spring at liuhuangtang has the highest δ37cl value 1 12 followed by the hot springs in menglian shiqiang and jietou and the cold spring in rehai 0 74 to 0 85 and the acid old boiling pool at liuhuangtang 0 44 all of which are low in chloride of the chloride rich hot springs the zaotanghe and langpu springs with relatively low chloride concentrations generally feature high δ37cl values 0 02 to 0 31 and correspondingly the liuhuangtang springs with higher chloride concentrations have lower δ37cl values 0 44 to 0 06 to test for statistical differences in δ37cl among types of hot springs we conducted a t test by dividing the investigated hot springs into four groups neutral to alkaline hot springs at liuhuangtang group i neutral to alkaline hot springs at zaotanghe and langpu group ii acid hot springs at liuhuangtang group iii and neutral to alkaline hot springs at non rehai areas i e menglian shiqiang and jietou group iv see section 5 2 for the reasons for this classification the results show a significant difference in δ37cl between any two types of hot springs in rehai table 3 however although group i rehai and group ii rehai significantly differ in δ37cl from group iv non rehai there is no significant difference in δ37cl between group iii rehai and group iv non rehai table 3 a detailed analysis of the statistical results is discussed in section 5 4 3 chlorine and bromine contents of rock samples two granite samples collected from the study area have similar halogen compositions chlorine and bromine concentrations 369 7 and 0 59 ppm sample r2 and 372 3 and 0 51 ppm sample r3 respectively the granitic gneiss sample sample r1 has slightly lower chlorine and bromine concentrations 292 1 and 0 41 ppm respectively generally the rock samples had similar molar br cl ratios 0 00062 0 00071 and 0 00061 for r1 r2 and r3 respectively which were much lower than those of the rehai hot spring samples 0 0011 0 0075 tables 1 and 2 5 discussion 5 1 input of magmatic fluids indicated by the chlorine isotope compositions and the cl and br concentrations of rehai hot springs as shown in table 1 the neutral to alkaline chloride rich hot springs at the liuhuangtang site of rehai samples no 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 generally have low δ37cl values and are in sharp contrast with the hot springs sampled in the non rehai areas in tengchong menglian shiqiang and jietou with much higher δ37cl values showing their distinct geochemical geneses moreover negative correlations can be discerned between the δ37cl value and either spring vent temperature or corresponding reservoir temperature calculated using the quartz geothermometer for all the springs sampled in this study fig 2 likewise there is a negative correlation between the δ37cl value and cl concentration of the sampled springs fig 3 a reasonable explanation for these observations is the incorporation of magmatic chlorine which has low δ37cl values bonifacie et al 2008 layne et al 2009 li et al 2015 halldorsson et al 2016 ranta et al 2021 into the chloride rich rehai hot springs to assess if input of magmatic chlorine contributed to the chloride in the rehai hot springs this study employed the isotope mass balance model introduced in methods to calculate the theoretical chloride concentrations and δ37cl values of the rehai geothermal waters by considering only reservoir rock leaching the calculated results are illustrated in fig 4 showing that leaching of reservoir rocks alone could yield δ37cl values in geothermal water ranging from 0 01 to 0 87 under various presumed conditions this range covers the δ37cl values of most rehai hot springs in the zaotanghe site and the langpu site samples no 9 10 13 14 15 and 16 0 10 to 0 31 but not most of those in the liuhuangtang site with lower δ37cl values samples no 1 2 3 4 and 5 from 0 44 to 0 03 thus the input of magmatic chlorine is indispensable to rationalizing the formation of the five liuhuangtang hot springs with δ37cl values from 0 44 to 0 03 notably the δ37cl values of the rehai hot springs especially the neutral to alkaline springs also distinctively differ from those of typical non magmatic hot springs liu et al 1997 chen et al 2016 cold groundwaters li et al 2016 and surface waters liu et al 1997 chen et al 2021 with low medium total dissolved solid tds values due to reacting primarily with silicate rocks or silicate bearing sediments reported elsewhere in china instead the neutral to alkaline rehai hot springs are similar in chlorine isotope composition to other geothermal waters worldwide proven to be heated by magma chambers such as yellowstone national park usa zhang et al 2004 cullen et al 2021 taupo new zealand bernal et al 2014 la soufrière guadeloupe and montagne pelée martinique li et al 2015 fig 5 therefore the isotopic composition of dissolved chloride is a promising tracer for identifying magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal systems to evaluate the reliability of the chlorine isotope tracer for discerning magmatic chlorine we compared the total amount of available chlorine in the rehai reservoir rocks with the chlorine discharge flux of the rehai system the total area of rehai and the cumulative thickness of the rehai reservoirs are estimated to be 8 5 km2 tong and zhang 1989 and 1 km respectively hence the volume of the reservoir rocks in the rehai hydrothermal system is 8 5 km3 assuming that the average bulk density of the reservoir hostrocks is 2 6 g cm3 the total mass of the reservoir hostrocks can be up to 2 2 1013 kg the average chlorine content in the rehai reservoir hostrocks is 344 7 ppm therefore the total amount of chlorine in the rocks is 7 6 109 kg however only a small portion of this total chlorine could be leached from the rehai system because the chlorine in the majority of rocks that do not react with the geothermal waters is unleachable by contrast the chlorine discharge flux per year in rehai is approximately 1 4 106 kg according to the total spring discharge in the rehai hydrothermal area 119 l s and the average chloride concentration of the rehai hot springs 365 mg l referring to the u series dating results of the oldest hydrothermally altered minerals ever found zhu 1992 the minimum age of the rehai hydrothermal activity i e the rehai system was 175 000 years therefore the total flux of chlorine discharge in rehai since the formation of the rehai system would be 2 4 1011 kg provided that hot springs were discharged at their current natural rates and chloride concentrations thus the estimated total flux of chlorine in rehai is at least one order of magnitude higher than the leachable chlorine in the rehai reservoir rocks demonstrating that the chlorine in the rehai geothermal waters could be partially or even primarily from magmatic fluid input rather than exclusively from host rock leaching just as the chlorine isotope data have already indicated similar to chloride in magmatic fluid affected geothermal waters which may be derived mostly from magmatic chlorine existing as hcl a large portion of bromide in such geothermal waters could be from the input of underlying magmatic fluids as well where bromine occurs in the form of hbr aiuppa et al 2005 martin et al 2006 indeed the neutral to alkaline hot springs at liuhuangtang with low δ37cl values also feature high chloride and bromide concentrations by contrast the non rehai hot springs and the rehai cold spring with much higher δ37cl values have far lower chloride concentrations and no detectable bromide fig 6 table 1 suggesting that for the tengchong waters bromide from hostrock leaching at normal and elevated temperatures is negligible and that high concentrations of bromide likely originate from magmatic bromine this finding was also validated by the distinctively different molar br cl ratios between the rehai hot springs and reservoir rocks fig 6 although the concentration of bromine in magmatic fluids is typically several orders of magnitude lower than that of chlorine rodriguez et al 2016 a positive correlation between chloride and bromide in geothermal waters from magma heated hydrothermal systems can be reasonably expected the bromide concentrations of the rehai hot springs are positively correlated with their chloride concentrations fig 6 and the neutral to alkaline rehai hot springs located either at liuhuangtang or at zaotanghe and langpu have a narrow range of molar br cl ratios between 0 001 and 0 002 falling right into that of subduction related magmas 0 0007 to 0 004 balcone boissard et al 2010 as typical conservative constituents the ratios of bromide to chloride in the rehai geothermal waters are similar to those of the underlying magmatic fluids therefore the bromide concentration and molar br cl ratio indicate that the rehai geothermal waters known to have no hydraulic connection with seawater tend to receive bromide from magmatic fluids in summary by combining the chlorine isotope compositions and cl and br concentrations we can effectively identify a magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal system using rehai as an example notably further inspection of the bromide chloride relations shows that the two acidic hot springs at liuhuangtang experiencing and old boiling pool have abnormally high molar br cl ratios 0 0075 and 0 0043 respectively fig 6 the reasons for this phenomenon are discussed in detail in section 5 3 5 2 reservoir processes undergone by rehai geothermal waters potentially further altered their chlorine isotope compositions after input of magmatic fluids although the neutral to alkaline hot springs at liuhuangtang have low δ37cl values two liuhuangtang acid hot springs are characterized by much higher δ37cl values the acid experiencing spring at liuhuangtang sample no 7 has a δ37cl value of 1 12 even higher than those of the non rehai hot springs 0 74 to 0 82 and the cold spring in rehai 0 85 the neutral to alkaline hot springs at langpu and zaotanghe also have relatively higher δ37cl values than those at liuhuangtang these data seem to be contradictory to the previous conclusion that the rehai hydrothermal system is being affected by the input of magmatic fluids with quite low δ37cl values in improving the interpretation of the chlorine isotope compositions of various rehai hot springs a deep understanding of their geochemical genesis and the complicated reservoir processes they underwent is necessary in a high temperature hydrothermal system e g rehai a pgf with a uniform hydrochemical composition and in full equilibrium with its host rocks is expected to form giggenbach and stewart 1982 giggenbach 1988 which can further evolve into various hot springs by ascending to the surface via different subsurface channels fournier 1979 as shown in the ph cl so4 diagram fig 7 and the triangular na k mg1 2 diagram fig 8 the rehai hot springs can be divided into three groups group i comprises neutral to alkaline springs very rich in chloride plotted right on or close to the full equilibrium line in the na k mg1 2 diagram group ii comprises springs with relatively lower chloride concentrations located in the partially equilibrated or mixed area of the na k mg1 2 diagram and group iii comprises acidic springs very high in sulfate but depleted in chloride in the immature water area of the na k mg1 2 diagram correspondingly the group i samples represent the geothermal waters evolving directly from the pgf without being substantially mixed by shallow cold groundwater the group ii samples similarly evolve from the pgf but have also been largely affected by the mixing of shallow groundwater very low in chloride and the group iii samples are far less related to the pgf than those of groups i and ii except that their acidity and sulfate derive from the stepwise oxidation of h2s in geothermal gases separated from ascending geothermal fluids upon boiling essentially these acidic hot springs are locally perched shallow groundwater heated by high temperature geothermal gases and their dissolved constituents originate from the leaching of aquifer materials by shortly circulating groundwater and trace amounts of deeply derived substances carried by geothermal gases therefore they have very low chloride concentrations and do not reach equilibrium with most primary aquifer minerals the nature of the neutral to alkaline rehai hot springs and their relationship with the pgf can be further elaborated with the aid of an enthalpy relative to chloride plot fig 9 in fig 9 all the neutral to alkaline rehai hot springs and shallow reservoir fluids directly feeding these springs are plotted according to their enthalpy values and chloride concentrations notably the enthalpy values of the shallow reservoir fluids were calculated using a quartz geothermometer and their chloride concentrations were determined based on those of the hot springs and the cooling ways through which they evolved into the springs the location of the pgf in the enthalpy versus chloride plot was then defined by those of the shallow reservoir fluids and diverse cooling ways of the pgf specifically three cooling ways were considered when plotting fig 9 adiabatic cooling conductive cooling and mixing with the overlying water with relatively low temperatures geothermal fluids experiencing adiabatic cooling were plotted on a group of lines connecting the resulting waters and a point representing the separated steam with zero chloride and an enthalpy value of 2779 4 j g the conductive cooling lines connecting the initial fluids and resulting waters were vertical to the horizontal axis because their chloride concentrations were the same easier to understand the mixing lines were plotted by connecting the cold groundwater endmember represented by the cold spring sample no 11 collected in rehai and the pgf or deep geothermal fluids with hydrogeochemical compositions close to that of the pgf finally the chloride concentration and enthalpy value of the pgf were determined to be 415 mg l and 1407 j g corresponding to a temperature of 315 c respectively on the intersection of two lines bounding all the plotted sample points one line denotes the deep subsurface mixing between the pgf and the infiltrating waters and the other line is an adiabatic cooling line delineating the formation of the big boiling pool sample no 6 with the highest chloride concentration 719 1 mg l and sampling temperature 96 c equal to the local boiling point in rehai all neutral to alkaline hot springs sampled in the subareas of rehai grouped well in the enthalpy versus chloride plot regarding the four hot springs at liuhuangtang namely the big boiling pool sample no 6 glasses left spring sample no 2 drum beating spring sample no 3 and proconceptive left spring sample no 4 the highest chloride 573 to 719 mg l and sampling temperatures 93 to 96 c were formed predominantly by adiabatic cooling of the pgf or the fluids evolving from the pgf via slight deep mixing with infiltrating waters however two other springs at liuhuangtang proconceptive right sample no 5 and spring listening sample no 1 were formed primarily via conductive cooling of the pgf or slightly evolved pgf which resulted in their chloride concentrations 417 mg l and 395 mg l respectively very close to the pgf the obviously lower vent temperatures of these two springs 79 and 75 c respectively also implied that they were more likely to be controlled by conductive cooling than by adiabatic cooling by contrast the hot springs at the zaotanghe and langpu sites samples no 9 10 12 13 14 15 and 16 with much lower chloride concentrations 218 to 368 mg l than those at the liuhuangtang site clustered together because the shallow reservoir fluids feeding these springs were formed via the strong mixing of the pgf with shallow cold groundwater of these springs the frog mouth spring sample no 16 and pavilion left spring sample no 12 were products of the conductive cooling of shallow reservoir fluids whereas the others were adiabatic cooling products correspondingly the chloride concentrations of the former 218 and 239 mg l respectively were the lowest among all the neutral to alkaline rehai hot springs 5 3 effects of various processes after magmatic fluid input on the chlorine isotope compositions of rehai geothermal waters the complex reservoir processes that the rehai geothermal waters undergo revealed by the scattered but regular distribution of the rehai hot springs in the enthalpy versus chloride plot can well explain the statistical discrepancies in their chlorine isotope compositions confirmed by the t test analysis the rehai system consists of multiple levels of reservoirs with the deepest being that in which the pgf exists the pgf in full equilibrium with the host rocks could be directly formed from the isochemical dissolution of deep subsurface rocks by magmatic fluids as has been reported elsewhere e g nevado del ruiz in colombia giggenbach et al 1990 miravalles in costa rica giggenbach and soto 1992 marini et al 2003 waiotapu in new zealand giggenbach et al 1994 and yellowstone national park in the united states guo et al 2014b here isochemical dissolution means that the minerals in the deep subsurface rocks were completely dissolved in highly aggressive acidic magmatic fluids with their mineralogical structures collapsing thus the elements in the minerals could enter the liquid phase isochemically giggenbach 1988 therefore the pgf below rehai should have a chlorine isotope composition similar to that of the underlying magmatic fluids as a result the hot springs formed from the conductive cooling of the pgf namely proconceptive right sample no 5 and spring listening sample no 1 which changed little in their chemical compositions during the cooling have the lowest δ37cl values 0 44 and 0 32 respectively during the adiabatic cooling geothermal vapors rich in light chlorine isotope were separated and the δ37cl values of the remaining waters were expected to increase similarly mixing with low temperature waters with much higher δ37cl values increased those of the geothermal fluids as well although the increase would be limited because of the low chloride concentrations of low temperature waters thus the no 2 3 and 4 hot springs at liuhuangtang formed principally from adiabatic cooling had δ37cl values somewhat higher than those of the no 5 and 1 springs but were still low 0 14 0 17 and 0 03 respectively and the no 9 10 12 13 14 15 and 16 hot springs undergoing both mixing and adiabatic cooling had evidently higher δ37cl values 0 02 to 0 31 an exception is the big boiling pool no 6 hot spring the direct adiabatic cooling product of the pgf theoretically it should have a slightly lower δ37cl value than those of the no 2 3 and 4 hot springs but the reverse was true therefore other geochemical processes may have affected its chlorine isotope composition the area of the big boiling pool fig s2 is approximately more than 10 m2 much larger than those of the vents of the other rehai springs therefore strong surface evaporation might be responsible for its relatively high δ37cl value 0 06 strong evaporation is also suggested by its much higher tds value than that of other neutral to alkaline hot springs notably evaporation especially under acid conditions was proved capable of strongly increasing the δ37cl values of evaporated waters based on a systematic experimental study sharp et al 2010 proposed that sharp increases in δ37cl value occurred in remaining hydrochloric acid solutions as a result of strong evaporation owing to light chlorine being preferentially lost to the vapor phase at a 1000 ln a hcl g cl value of 3 92 loss of hydrogen chloride relatively enriched in 35cl via evaporation and consequent occurrence of acidic hot springs or hot lakes rich in heavier 37cl isotope have been frequently observed elsewhere as well rouwet and ohba 2015 capaccioni et al 2016 rodriguez et al 2016 the two acidic hot springs investigated in this study experiencing sample no 7 and old boiling pool sample no 8 were characterized by relatively large spring vents too fig s2 moreover they have very small discharges and are therefore susceptible to evaporation effects indeed the most acid spring experiencing ph 1 3 had the highest δ37cl value 1 12 and there was a clearly negative correlation between the δ37cl values and the ph values of the three rehai springs apparently affected by evaporation experiencing old boiling pool and big boiling pool fig s3 notably the occurrence of evaporation and its effects were also confirmed by the abnormally high molar br cl ratios of the two acidic hot springs fig 6 at a strongly acidic ph dissolved chloride and bromide ions tend to form aqueous hcl and hbr respectively followed by their loss as gaseous hcl and hbr upon evaporation the association constant lgk 1 961 for the reaction h3o cl hcl aq h2o is much higher than that lgk 0 116 for h3o br hbr aq h2o pokrovskii 1999 implying that at the same acidity the chloride ion is more readily associated with the hydrated hydrogen ion and lost from a liquid phase therefore compared with chloride more bromide remained in the two acid springs upon evaporation increasing their molar br cl ratios 6 conclusions magmatic and non magmatic hydrothermal systems occur in the tengchong volcanic geothermal region which serves as an ideal site for testing the feasibility of using chlorine isotope composition and auxiliary hydrochemical indices to detect magmatic fluid input notably the δ37cl values of the hot springs in the non magmatic tengchong hydrothermal areas typically menglian shiqiang and jietou ranged from 0 74 to 0 82 representing the isotopic imprint of the chlorine leached from reservoir hostrocks by contrast those of the hot springs in rehai potentially heated by shallow magma were affected by host rock leaching the input of magmatic fluids and various reservoir processes an overall understanding of the geochemical genesis of hot springs and the reservoir processes they have undergone is critical for employing their chlorine isotope compositions as tracers to indicate the contribution of magmatic chlorine in rehai three types of hot springs prevailed neutral to alkaline hot springs very rich in chloride and bromide group i neutral to alkaline hot springs with lower chloride and bromide concentrations but comparable br cl ratios group ii and acidic hot springs with the lowest chloride and bromide concentrations and abnormally high br cl ratios group iii a pgf formed directly under the impact of magmatic fluid input identified by the enthalpy versus chloride relationship of the rehai hot springs resided in the deepest reservoir the geothermal fluids in the upper reservoirs at different depths which feed the neutral to alkaline rehai hot springs evolved from the pgf via various cooling processes the acidic rehai hot springs however had little relationship to the pgf because they were geothermal steam heated shortly circulating groundwater of the three types of rehai hot springs only the springs in group i with low δ37cl values can indicate the occurrence of magmatic fluid input straightforwardly they inherited the chlorine isotopic characteristics of magmatic fluids to the highest degree because they were closely related to the pgf and little affected by the mixing of low temperature shallow groundwaters with high δ37cl values by contrast the springs in group ii were strongly mixed with shallow groundwaters and consequently their δ37cl values were elevated to some degree and the springs in group iii featured the highest δ37cl values owing to being unrelated to the pgf and of course the magmatic fluids and the surface evaporation under acid conditions that they have experienced because group iii rehai and group iv non rehai were not or little affected by magmatic fluid input they were also not statistically different in δ37cl in summary chlorine isotope composition contains straightforward information for determining whether magmatic cl contributes to chloride in hot springs however its use as a tracer of magmatic fluid input will be more rationalized when the reservoir processes affecting the investigated hot springs are well understood based on general hydrochemistry specifically for a hydrothermal system hosted by silicate rocks like rehai occurrence of a group of hot springs with quite depleted δ37cl signals is a robust evidence supporting that it is a magmatic fluid affected system with identification of these hot springs depleted in 37cl and consequent confirmation of magmatic fluid input other hot springs with more enriched 37cl would indicate a less degree to which they are affected by magmatic fluids additional hydrochemical information can be used as a subsidiary tool for evaluating the effects of magmatic fluid input on various hot springs the approach to identifying a magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal system based on chlorine isotope composition in combination with the hydrochemistry developed in this study is promising for application in many unexplored geothermal regions across china and worldwide credit authorship contribution statement qinghai guo

1944,identification of hydrothermal systems affected by magmatic fluid input is relevant for geothermal energy development thus an approach for identifying such systems based on chlorine isotope composition and auxiliary hydrochemical indices was proposed the approach enabled us to distinguish rehai a magmatic hydrothermal area in the tengchong volcanic region of china from several other typical non magmatic hydrothermal areas in tengchong menglian shiqiang and jietou the hot springs in the non rehai areas featured high δ37cl values reflecting an exclusive contribution of chlorine from hostrock leaching by contrast some hot springs with much lower δ37cl values occurred in rehai all of which were nearly fully equilibrated waters with respect to reservoir hostrocks rich in chloride and bromide these springs should have the closest relationship with the fluids released from the underlying magma chamber notably the potential reservoir processes that geothermal waters may undergo after receiving an input of magmatic fluids can further alter their chlorine isotope compositions to various degrees therefore a deep understanding of these processes would help improve the use of the proposed approach based primarily on chlorine isotopes regarding rehai all the neutral to alkaline hot springs with δ37cl values ranging from 0 44 to 0 31 evolved from a parent geothermal fluid that received an input of magmatic fluids via adiabatic cooling conductive cooling mixing with low temperature shallow groundwaters or a combination of some of these processes by contrast the acidic rehai hot springs with the highest δ37cl values up to 1 12 were essentially locally perched groundwaters heated by geothermal steam separated from underlying geothermal fluids upon their adiabatic cooling thus they were much less to do with the parent geothermal fluid than the neutral to alkaline springs were hence only the neutral to alkaline rehai hot springs not strongly affected by the mixing of shallow groundwaters and adiabatic cooling can reflect the chlorine isotope characteristics of intrusive magmatic fluids overall chlorine isotope composition in combination with hydrochemistry has proven to be a robust tool for identifying a magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal system keywords cl isotope composition hydrochemistry hot spring parent geothermal fluid magmatic fluid reservoir process data availability all the research data related to this paper are included in the tables and the supplementary data 1 introduction high temperature hydrothermal systems are superior to other types of geothermal systems in exploitation and utilization worldwide high temperature hydrothermal systems are densely distributed in hotspots such as yellowstone national park and hawaii usa and tectonic plate boundaries namely the circum pacific mediterranean himalayan atlantic mid ocean ridge and red sea aden bay east african rift geothermal belts many hydrothermal systems in such geological settings should be closely related to shallow magmas that is they are not only heated by underlying magmas but are also directly affected by the release of magmatic fluids from these magmas nevertheless hydrothermal systems unrelated to shallow magma chambers exist in hotspots and active plate margins and in some cases there are no distinct differences between these systems and magmatic fluid affected systems in surface geothermal features e g hot spring temperatures notably a hydrothermal system in the vicinity of a shallow magma chamber that does not receive an input of magmatic fluid may also have much lower reservoir temperatures and therefore lower exploitation values than strictly defined magmatic hydrothermal systems that is those affected directly by magmatic fluid input guo et al 2017 guo 2022 thus these situations present a critical challenge in discriminating between magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal systems and other types i e hydrothermal systems unaffected by shallow magmas and those affected by shallow magmas in terms of thermal conduction but not magmatic fluid input in unexplored geothermal regions where only surface geothermal information is available such discrimination is vital for developing targeted strategies for geothermal exploration and exploitation secondary geophysical signals have been frequently used to indicate the possible existence of shallow magma chambers brown et al 1996 makovsky et al 1996 husen et al 2004 smith et al 2009 chu et al 2010 ye et al 2018 but they cannot indicate whether hydrothermal systems are affected by the input of magmatic fluids by contrast magma derived chemical components are theoretically more appropriate than geophysical signals for directly determining the occurrence of a magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal system however most magmatic gases including hf so2 h2s and co2 are severely affected by precipitation as secondary minerals e g fluorite anhydrite alunite pyrite and calcite in the deep underground owing to their high reactivity giggenbach 1988 moreover that residual magmatic f s and c remain is further masked by supergene geochemical processes such as the input of these elements from non magmatic sources or complex near surface redox processes as to s and c hence none of these constituents are suitable indicators of magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal systems additionally chemically inert gases related to magmas e g mantle he may originate from substantial depths and ascend to the surface through deep fractures therefore their detection in geothermal waters or vapors does not necessarily indicate the occurrence of a shallow magma chamber heating overlying hydrothermal systems either let alone input of magmatic fluids among the magmatic volatiles hcl is possibly the only one effective in bringing direct deep information indicative of existing magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal systems to the near surface although its proportion in typical magmatic gases is generally much lower than that of co2 and total gaseous s so2 and h2s giggenbach and le guern 1976 rose et al 1986 giggenbach 1987 giggenbach 1988 the primary reason for this phenomenon is that hcl is extremely hydrophilic especially at temperatures lower than those of magma ruaya and seward 1987 thus the released magmatic hcl could be substantially absorbed into deeply circulating geothermal waters and easily sampled in hot spring vents or geothermal wells upon geothermal water circulation the absorbed magmatic cl tends to remain in solution as chloride it does not readily precipitate with secondary minerals because chloride is a typical conservative constituent in aqueous environments at normal and high temperatures ellis 1970 arnorsson and andresdottir 1995 however abundant cl in geothermal water also does not certainly indicate the occurrence of a magmatic geothermal system because it is also likely from non magmatic sources for example the mixing of seawater or dissolution of halite hence cl dissolved in geothermal waters can serve as a tool for distinguishing hydrothermal systems receiving magmatic fluid inputs from those unaffected by magmatic fluids only when combined with its stable isotope composition the importance of cl isotope composition in evaluating the potential roles of magmatic fluid input lies in its potential to differentiate between magmatic cl and supergene cl i e cl originating from geochemical processes in supergenic zones e g rock weathering dissolution and seawater mixing either of which could be a predominant source of cl in geothermal waters although various types of magmas feature somewhat different cl isotope compositions they generally have depleted δ37cl values cl in arc magmas largely recycled from subducting slabs depleted in 37cl logically tends to have low δ37cl values li et al 2015 barnes et al 2008 basaltic magmas inheriting the δ37cl signatures of their mantle sources halldorsson et al 2016 which were commonly considered depleted bonifacie et al 2008 layne et al 2009 have low δ37cl values as well crustal silicic magmas have been even shown to have more depleted δ37cl values than basaltic magmas ranta et al 2021 because cl isotope fractionation is negligible under magmatic conditions schauble et al 2003 released magmatic fluids capable of strongly altering the hydrochemical and isotopic compositions of overlying geothermal waters should also be depleted in δ37cl by contrast non magmatic cl is expected to have different isotopic characteristics for example seawaters are marked by a generally homogeneous δ37cl value of 0 kaufmann et al 1984 godon et al 2004 and surface waters or shallow groundwaters of meteoric origins containing cl from the dissolution of relevant minerals such as halite are likely to have δ37cl values close to 0 or slightly higher than that eggenkamp et al 1995 li et al 2015 in summary magmatic cl is likely characterized by isotopic compositions different from those of the supergene cl for example cl originating from the leaching of cl bearing minerals or mixing of seawater thus cl isotope composition is potentially powerful in identifying magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal systems notably few such studies have been conducted therefore the primary aim of this study was to test the feasibility of using the cl isotope composition along with auxiliary hydrochemical indices to distinguish magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal systems from those of other types by considering the tengchong volcanic geothermal region in southwestern china as a typical study area tengchong is suitable for such a study because hydrothermal areas with and without shallow magma chambers have been found there see the next section for details in view that even in a magma heated hydrothermal area not all hot springs are affected by magmatic fluids we also showed how to distinguish magmatic fluid affected hot springs from those not affected in rehai a typical magmatic hydrothermal area in tengchong specifically three groups of rehai hot springs with being affected by magmatic fluid input to distinctively different degrees were identified as shown in fig s1 see the details for the classification of rehai hot springs in section 5 this study provides a reference for identification of unexplored magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal systems across china and worldwide 2 descriptions of the study areas most magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal systems in china are situated in the yunnan sichuan tibet yst geothermal province part of the mediterranean himalayan geothermal belt and the taiwan geothermal province part of the circum pacific geothermal belt fig 1 similar to the situation in the remaining active plate margins there are many unexplored hydrothermal systems with unknown heat sources either magmatic or non magmatic in these two geothermal provinces tengchong a typical volcanic geothermal region in the yst comprises tens of hydrothermal areas the tengchong volcanic region is in the tengchong terrane which is recognized as the southeastern continuation of the lhasa gangdise terrane where subduction related mantle magmatism is likely to occur pham et al 1986 zhou et al 1995 brown et al 1996 unsworth et al 2005 therefore magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal systems are highly likely to have formed in tengchong more importantly tengchong is unique to mainland china because only in this region have both quaternary volcanic activities been documented tong and zhang 1989 li et al 2000 and shallow magma chambers been presumed to exist based on geophysical evidence ye et al 2018 zhao et al 2021 by contrast all the other late cenozoic volcanoes across mainland china are distributed in northeastern china northern china southeastern china and northern tibet where magmatic hydrothermal activity has not been reported fig 1 tong et al 1990 the total area of the outcropping volcanic rocks in tengchong including basalt andesite andesite and dacite fig 1 exceeds 1000 km2 tong and zhang 1989 daying ma an and heikong hills are the youngest volcanoes in tengchong with k ar ages of 81 104 ka 23 83 ka jiang 1998 and 7 14 ka nakai et al 1993 respectively of the tengchong hydrothermal areas rehai menglian shiqiang and jietou were selected for this study rehai is characterized by the most intense hydrothermal activities the most diversified surface geothermal manifestations e g hydrothermal explosions fumaroles geysers steaming ground and hot springs and the occurrence of hot springs 44 96 c with the most varied hydrochemical types guo et al 2014a it consists of four subareas liuhuangtang zaotanghe langpu and huangguaqing fig 1 rehai is not situated in the central outcropping area of the tengchong volcanic rocks and the surface rocks in the rehai area are primarily miocene gravelstone and sandstone with andesite and basalt distributed in a scattered manner rehai is an ideal site to test whether the hot springs have chlorine isotope compositions indicative of magmatic fluid input because the existence of a basaltic magma chamber beneath rehai as shallow as 7 km has been inferred based on geological and geophysical observations bai et al 1994 liao et al 1997 liao and zhao 1999 bai et al 2001 the magma chamber was speculated to have formed during one of the stages of tengchong magmatism it could have originated from a partially melted upper mantle derived magmatic intrusion but then inevitably mixed with crustal materials during its ascent to shallow levels tong and zhang 1989 as a structurally complicated hydrothermal system rehai consists of multiple reservoir levels and the geothermal waters in various reservoirs are characterized by different recharge and flow regimes liao and zhao 1999 shangguan 2000 guo et al 2014a the acidic geothermal waters reside in the shallowest aquifers with miocene granitic gravelstone and sandstone as host rocks and are recharged by local precipitation they are essentially short circulated groundwater heated by steam separated from the underlying circumneutral geothermal fluids liao and zhao 1999 guo et al 2014a by contrast circumneutral geothermal fluids in deeper reservoirs are recharged primarily by precipitation in the gaoligong mountain area lying east of rehai fig 1 tong and zhang 1989 in the conceptual flow mode a large amount of precipitation infiltrates the gaoligong mountain areas and then flows laterally deep underground below rehai where it is heated by the underlying magma chamber and receives the input of magmatic fluids released from the magma tong and zhang 1989 thereafter the deepest geothermal fluid in rehai flows upward to feed the overlying reservoirs as observed in typical magmatic hydrothermal systems elsewhere for example yellowstone national park usa fournier 1979 and yangyi china guo et al 2009 relevant geological and geophysical investigations liao et al 1997 liao and zhao 1999 have suggested that the cap rocks of the circumneutral geothermal fluids in rehai were strongly altered miocene gravelstone and sandstone and the reservoir host rocks comprised granite and granitic gneiss fig 1 different from rehai the other three hydrothermal areas menglian shiqiang and jietou exhibited low temperature hydrothermal activities hot springs with temperatures varying from approximately 40 to 60 c are the sole surface geothermal manifestations although no boreholes have been drilled into the reservoirs in menglian shiqiang and jietou and there is an absence of detailed information on the stratigraphic distribution the reservoir hostrocks are presumed to be felsic rocks felsic rocks intercalated by carbonate rocks and carbonate rocks intercalated by felsic rocks according to the hydrochemical compositions of the geothermal waters to date there is no geological geophysical or geochemical evidence of the existence of shallow magmas below these three areas their heat sources are local crustal and mantle heat flows in a generally normal geothermal background specifically radiogenic heat from the upper crust crustal heat flow and conductive heat from the mantle mantle heat flow are responsible for the formation of these hydrothermal systems hence they can be regarded as typical non magmatic hydrothermal systems to show how their geothermal waters differ from those of magmatic fluid affected geothermal waters in terms of chlorine isotope compositions 3 methods 3 1 sample collection and analysis eighteen hot spring samples and one cold spring sample were collected from the tengchong volcanic geothermal region of the sampled hot springs 15 were in the rehai hydrothermal area eight at the liuhuangtang site five at the zaotanghe site and two at the langpu site and the other three were in the menglian shiqiang and jietou hydrothermal areas the cold spring sample was collected from the rehai area the locations of all sampling sites are presented in fig 1 moreover three rock samples two granite samples and one granitic gneiss sample corresponding to the reservoir host rocks of the rehai hydrothermal system were collected from the surrounding areas of rehai where these rocks outcrop before the fieldwork the water sampling bottles made of high density polyethylene were soaked in 5 hcl in the laboratory and then rinsed with ultrapure water thrice the samples were also rinsed with filtered spring water at the sampling sites the ph spring temperature t and electrical conductivity were measured beforehand using handheld meters all the samples except those for analysis of alkalinity were filtered on site with 0 22 μm pore size cellulose acetate membranes total alkalinity was determined on the sampling day via the gran titration method the hco3 and co3 2 concentrations of all spring water samples were calculated from the measured values of alkalinity and ph using phreeqc incorporating the wateq4f database parkhurst and appelo 1999 for analysis of metal and metalloid elements 14 m reagent grade hno3 was added to one sample split collected at each spring to realize a ph less than 1 whereas no chemicals were added to the sample splits for the analysis of major anions in the laboratory the concentrations of cl br so4 2 and f were determined by ion chromatography ic those of k na ca mg and si were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes and those of li rb cs b al and fe were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms the chlorine isotope compositions of the spring samples were measured using a thermo fisher triton thermal ionization mass spectrometer tims see the instrumental parameters in table s1 at the qinghai institute of salt lake of the chinese academy of sciences applying the procedures described by xiao and zhang 1992 xiao et al 1995 1998 and han et al 2019 the aqueous samples to be analyzed were passed through ba type and ag type resins to remove so4 2 and no3 respectively to eliminate their severe interference in chlorine isotope determination an h type resin to remove all the cations with the cl ions being converted to hcl and a cs type resin to form cs2cl the formed cs2cl was coated on a mass spectrometer metal tantalum tape 1 5 cm 0 098 cm 0 0025 cm which was vacuum degassed at 3a current for 1 h and treated with 2 5 μl graphite suspension in advance the ratio of 37cs2cl to 35cs2cl in the samples was determined using a multicollector tims instrument equipped with a central cup and eight independently movable faraday cups specifically the samples were loaded into the tims with its ion source vacuumed from 2 10 7 to 3 10 7 bar and the static double receiver method was used to obtain the 37cs2cl to 35cs2cl ratios the δ37cl values of the samples were calculated using the following equation δ 37 cl 37 cl 35 cl sample 37 cl 35 cl standard 1 1000 where the 37cl 35cl ratio of the iaea isl 354 nacl standard is 0 319090 0 000086 the rock samples used for the chloride and bromine analyses were crushed into a fine powder using a ball mill powdered rock samples 200 mesh were subjected to pyrohydrolysis for chloride and bromine extraction as described in wang et al 2018 in brief the powdered samples were mixed with quartz sand placed in a porcelain boat and heated for 25 min in a silica tube at 1200 c during which a constant oxygen flow and h2o vapor steam were maintained to extract the chloride and bromine the released chloride and bromine were collected using a mixed na2co3 nahco3 solution diluted with deionized water and analyzed using ic and icp ms respectively the sampling information in situ parameters chloride and bromide concentrations and chlorine isotope compositions of all spring samples are presented in table 1 and their hydrochemical compositions except chloride and bromide concentrations are listed in table s2 the sampling information and the chlorine and bromine contents of the rock samples are presented in table 2 3 2 t test a t test was used to determine whether the difference between the two groups of values was statistically significant or simply due to random chance assessing the difference between the values for two groups requires referencing the ratio of the difference between their means relative to the spread or variability of their values i e by obtaining the t value using the t value and degrees of freedom the sum of the sample numbers of both groups minus two the probability of these two groups being the same i e p level can be calculated a p level less than 0 05 indicates only a 5 chance that two sets of values are from the same group in this case they are significantly different 3 3 geothermometer measurements geothermometers have been widely used to estimate geothermal system temperatures based on the concentrations of relevant chemical constituents in a surface geothermal water sample the corresponding reservoir temperature can be calculated from the temperature dependent subsurface water rock equilibria in this study a quartz geothermometer fournier and potter 1982 was employed to estimate the reservoir temperatures which were then used for various purposes such as plotting an enthalpy relative to chloride diagram the quartz geothermometer proposed by fournier and potter 1982 is expressed as follows t 42 198 0 28831 m 3 6686 m 2 10000 3 1665 m 3 10000000 77 034 lg m where t is the estimated reservoir temperature and m represents the si concentration of the corresponding geothermal water sample mg sio2 l 3 4 isotope mass balance model in this study an isotope mass balance model presuming a successive infiltrating water flow in chemical and isotopic equilibrium with contacting reservoir rocks pennisi et al 2000 yamaoka et al 2015 was used to calculate the theoretical chloride concentrations and δ37cl values of the rehai geothermal waters assuming that the leaching of reservoir rocks instead of the input of magmatic fluids controls the chlorine geochemistry therefore the result is a function of the initial chlorine concentrations and isotope compositions of the infiltrating meteoric water and reservoir rock reacting with the water the ratio of the final chlorine concentration in the rock to that in the geothermal water i e the chlorine distribution coefficient the mass ratio of geothermal water to reservoir rock and the chlorine isotope fractionation factor at the reservoir temperature specifically the chloride concentrations and δ37cl values of the rehai geothermal waters in the case that they would be determined by leaching of reservoir rocks alone can be calculated using the following model cl water f cl rock i rcl water i d cl r δ 37 cl water f cl rock i 1000 δ 37 cl rock i rcl water i 1000 δ 37 cl water i cl rock i rcl water i d cl r α d cl r where cl water f and δ 37 cl water f are the cl concentration and the δ37cl value of the geothermal water at water rock interaction equilibrium respectively cl water i and cl rock i are the initial cl concentrations of the infiltrated water and the reservoir rock respectively δ 37 cl water i and δ 37 cl rock i are the initial δ37cl values of the infiltrated water and the reservoir rock respectively r is the mass ratio of the reacted geothermal water to the reacted reservoir rock d cl is the distribution coefficient of cl between the reacted reservoir rock and the reacted geothermal water defined as d cl cl rock f cl water f and α is the isotopic fractionation factor of chlorine between the reservoir rock and the geothermal water defined as α 37 35 cl rock f 37 35 cl water f 37 35 cl rock f and 37 35 cl water f are the 37cl 35cl ratios of the reservoir rock and the geothermal water at water rock interaction equilibrium respectively in the model the average chlorine content 344 7 ppm of three collected rehai rock samples two granite samples and one granitic gneiss sample was considered the initial chlorine content of the rehai reservoir rocks due to a lack of measured δ37cl values of the rock samples a δ37cl value range of acidic magmatic rocks 0 1 to 0 9 from the relevant literature cullen et al 2021 was used to represent the chlorine isotope compositions of the reservoir rocks regarding the infiltrating meteoric water an initial chloride concentration range from 1 to 5 mg l and a δ37cl value of 0 were assumed the chlorine distribution coefficient i e the final concentration ratio of cl in the rock to that in the geothermal water and the chlorine isotope fractionation factor i e the ratio of the 37cl 35cl value of the rock to that of the geothermal water between the rehai geothermal waters and the reservoir silicate rocks have been poorly constrained thus they were presumed to be 0 05 and 1 0005 respectively as in the literature cullen et al 2015 simulating the reactions of geothermal waters with silicate rocks at temperatures comparable to those of the rehai reservoirs the mass ratios of geothermal water to reservoir rock tried in the model were set to be 100 50 20 10 5 2 1 0 5 and 0 2 respectively see the numbers beside the curves in fig 4 3 5 enthalpy relative to chloride diagram for evaluating parent geothermal fluid pgf and reservoir processes reservoir processes including adiabatic cooling conductive cooling and mixing with low temperature shallow groundwater are likely to occur in a high temperature hydrothermal system e g rehai where a pgf residing in the deepest reservoir is expected to exist adiabatic cooling indicates that the temperature of a geothermal fluid either pgf or geothermal fluid in an upper reservoir decreases via its subsurface boiling during which no or little heat is transferred to the contacted rock by contrast in a conductive cooling process the geothermal fluid cools owing to the transfer of its heat to subsurface rocks and boiling does not occur these processes can change the temperatures hydrochemical characteristics and isotopic compositions of the upflowing pgf and geothermal fluids in the upper reservoirs to varying degrees forming diverse types of hot springs fed by reservoir fluids in this study an enthalpy relative to chloride diagram proposed by fournier 1979 was used to estimate the enthalpy value and chloride concentration of the pgf in rehai and identify the critical reservoir processes that the pgf and overlying reservoir fluids have undergone which are responsible for the formation of the rehai hot springs the steam tables recommended by keenan et al 1969 were used to convert the temperatures of the hot springs and reservoir fluids to their enthalpy values in the steam tables the enthalpy values of vapor and liquid and the heat of vaporization over a temperature range from 0 to 374 c were presented values were shown at every one degree celsius from which we could easily obtain the enthalpy values of the investigated hot springs and their corresponding reservoir fluids clarifying the reservoir processes improves the understanding of how the chlorine isotopic compositions of the rehai hot springs indicate the input of magmatic fluids into the rehai hydrothermal system 4 results 4 1 general hydrochemistry and the chloride and bromide concentrations of spring samples the hot springs in the four hydrothermal areas of the tengchong volcanic geothermal region exhibit distinctly hydrochemistry tables 1 and s2 the samples collected from menglian shiqiang and jietou are neutral to alkaline with moderate spring vent temperatures 42 to 61 c vent temperature means the temperature of the spring water at the center of a spring vent they have hco3 as the predominant anion and their major cations are na mg2 or ca2 by contrast the rehai hot springs are characterized by a diversified hydrochemistry with a wide range of ph values 1 3 to 9 2 and sampling temperatures 53 to 96 c they can be cl rich so4 2 rich or hco3 rich na is the primary cation in the neutral to alkaline rehai hot springs whereas h na and ca2 dominate in the acidic rehai hot springs of all the hot spring samples the neutral to alkaline samples collected from the liuhuangtang site of rehai have the highest cl and br concentrations 395 to 719 mg l and 1 71 to 2 33 mg l respectively followed by those from the zaotanghe and langpu sites of rehai 218 to 368 mg l and 0 63 to 0 97 mg l respectively the acid rehai hot springs and the hot springs in menglian shiqiang and jietou generally have much lower cl and br concentrations 9 2 to 42 8 mg l and undetected to 0 17 mg l respectively however the acidic rehai hot springs are marked by the highest molar br cl ratios exceeding 0 004 and the br cl ratios of the hot spring samples from liuhuangtang zaotanghe and langpu were comparable 0 001 to 0 002 in contrast with the neutral to alkaline rehai hot springs the sampled cold spring in rehai as expected has much lower concentrations of common dissolved constituents including cl and br it is neutral in ph and rich in na hco3 and cl 4 2 chlorine isotope compositions of spring samples as shown in table 1 the acid experiencing spring at liuhuangtang has the highest δ37cl value 1 12 followed by the hot springs in menglian shiqiang and jietou and the cold spring in rehai 0 74 to 0 85 and the acid old boiling pool at liuhuangtang 0 44 all of which are low in chloride of the chloride rich hot springs the zaotanghe and langpu springs with relatively low chloride concentrations generally feature high δ37cl values 0 02 to 0 31 and correspondingly the liuhuangtang springs with higher chloride concentrations have lower δ37cl values 0 44 to 0 06 to test for statistical differences in δ37cl among types of hot springs we conducted a t test by dividing the investigated hot springs into four groups neutral to alkaline hot springs at liuhuangtang group i neutral to alkaline hot springs at zaotanghe and langpu group ii acid hot springs at liuhuangtang group iii and neutral to alkaline hot springs at non rehai areas i e menglian shiqiang and jietou group iv see section 5 2 for the reasons for this classification the results show a significant difference in δ37cl between any two types of hot springs in rehai table 3 however although group i rehai and group ii rehai significantly differ in δ37cl from group iv non rehai there is no significant difference in δ37cl between group iii rehai and group iv non rehai table 3 a detailed analysis of the statistical results is discussed in section 5 4 3 chlorine and bromine contents of rock samples two granite samples collected from the study area have similar halogen compositions chlorine and bromine concentrations 369 7 and 0 59 ppm sample r2 and 372 3 and 0 51 ppm sample r3 respectively the granitic gneiss sample sample r1 has slightly lower chlorine and bromine concentrations 292 1 and 0 41 ppm respectively generally the rock samples had similar molar br cl ratios 0 00062 0 00071 and 0 00061 for r1 r2 and r3 respectively which were much lower than those of the rehai hot spring samples 0 0011 0 0075 tables 1 and 2 5 discussion 5 1 input of magmatic fluids indicated by the chlorine isotope compositions and the cl and br concentrations of rehai hot springs as shown in table 1 the neutral to alkaline chloride rich hot springs at the liuhuangtang site of rehai samples no 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 generally have low δ37cl values and are in sharp contrast with the hot springs sampled in the non rehai areas in tengchong menglian shiqiang and jietou with much higher δ37cl values showing their distinct geochemical geneses moreover negative correlations can be discerned between the δ37cl value and either spring vent temperature or corresponding reservoir temperature calculated using the quartz geothermometer for all the springs sampled in this study fig 2 likewise there is a negative correlation between the δ37cl value and cl concentration of the sampled springs fig 3 a reasonable explanation for these observations is the incorporation of magmatic chlorine which has low δ37cl values bonifacie et al 2008 layne et al 2009 li et al 2015 halldorsson et al 2016 ranta et al 2021 into the chloride rich rehai hot springs to assess if input of magmatic chlorine contributed to the chloride in the rehai hot springs this study employed the isotope mass balance model introduced in methods to calculate the theoretical chloride concentrations and δ37cl values of the rehai geothermal waters by considering only reservoir rock leaching the calculated results are illustrated in fig 4 showing that leaching of reservoir rocks alone could yield δ37cl values in geothermal water ranging from 0 01 to 0 87 under various presumed conditions this range covers the δ37cl values of most rehai hot springs in the zaotanghe site and the langpu site samples no 9 10 13 14 15 and 16 0 10 to 0 31 but not most of those in the liuhuangtang site with lower δ37cl values samples no 1 2 3 4 and 5 from 0 44 to 0 03 thus the input of magmatic chlorine is indispensable to rationalizing the formation of the five liuhuangtang hot springs with δ37cl values from 0 44 to 0 03 notably the δ37cl values of the rehai hot springs especially the neutral to alkaline springs also distinctively differ from those of typical non magmatic hot springs liu et al 1997 chen et al 2016 cold groundwaters li et al 2016 and surface waters liu et al 1997 chen et al 2021 with low medium total dissolved solid tds values due to reacting primarily with silicate rocks or silicate bearing sediments reported elsewhere in china instead the neutral to alkaline rehai hot springs are similar in chlorine isotope composition to other geothermal waters worldwide proven to be heated by magma chambers such as yellowstone national park usa zhang et al 2004 cullen et al 2021 taupo new zealand bernal et al 2014 la soufrière guadeloupe and montagne pelée martinique li et al 2015 fig 5 therefore the isotopic composition of dissolved chloride is a promising tracer for identifying magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal systems to evaluate the reliability of the chlorine isotope tracer for discerning magmatic chlorine we compared the total amount of available chlorine in the rehai reservoir rocks with the chlorine discharge flux of the rehai system the total area of rehai and the cumulative thickness of the rehai reservoirs are estimated to be 8 5 km2 tong and zhang 1989 and 1 km respectively hence the volume of the reservoir rocks in the rehai hydrothermal system is 8 5 km3 assuming that the average bulk density of the reservoir hostrocks is 2 6 g cm3 the total mass of the reservoir hostrocks can be up to 2 2 1013 kg the average chlorine content in the rehai reservoir hostrocks is 344 7 ppm therefore the total amount of chlorine in the rocks is 7 6 109 kg however only a small portion of this total chlorine could be leached from the rehai system because the chlorine in the majority of rocks that do not react with the geothermal waters is unleachable by contrast the chlorine discharge flux per year in rehai is approximately 1 4 106 kg according to the total spring discharge in the rehai hydrothermal area 119 l s and the average chloride concentration of the rehai hot springs 365 mg l referring to the u series dating results of the oldest hydrothermally altered minerals ever found zhu 1992 the minimum age of the rehai hydrothermal activity i e the rehai system was 175 000 years therefore the total flux of chlorine discharge in rehai since the formation of the rehai system would be 2 4 1011 kg provided that hot springs were discharged at their current natural rates and chloride concentrations thus the estimated total flux of chlorine in rehai is at least one order of magnitude higher than the leachable chlorine in the rehai reservoir rocks demonstrating that the chlorine in the rehai geothermal waters could be partially or even primarily from magmatic fluid input rather than exclusively from host rock leaching just as the chlorine isotope data have already indicated similar to chloride in magmatic fluid affected geothermal waters which may be derived mostly from magmatic chlorine existing as hcl a large portion of bromide in such geothermal waters could be from the input of underlying magmatic fluids as well where bromine occurs in the form of hbr aiuppa et al 2005 martin et al 2006 indeed the neutral to alkaline hot springs at liuhuangtang with low δ37cl values also feature high chloride and bromide concentrations by contrast the non rehai hot springs and the rehai cold spring with much higher δ37cl values have far lower chloride concentrations and no detectable bromide fig 6 table 1 suggesting that for the tengchong waters bromide from hostrock leaching at normal and elevated temperatures is negligible and that high concentrations of bromide likely originate from magmatic bromine this finding was also validated by the distinctively different molar br cl ratios between the rehai hot springs and reservoir rocks fig 6 although the concentration of bromine in magmatic fluids is typically several orders of magnitude lower than that of chlorine rodriguez et al 2016 a positive correlation between chloride and bromide in geothermal waters from magma heated hydrothermal systems can be reasonably expected the bromide concentrations of the rehai hot springs are positively correlated with their chloride concentrations fig 6 and the neutral to alkaline rehai hot springs located either at liuhuangtang or at zaotanghe and langpu have a narrow range of molar br cl ratios between 0 001 and 0 002 falling right into that of subduction related magmas 0 0007 to 0 004 balcone boissard et al 2010 as typical conservative constituents the ratios of bromide to chloride in the rehai geothermal waters are similar to those of the underlying magmatic fluids therefore the bromide concentration and molar br cl ratio indicate that the rehai geothermal waters known to have no hydraulic connection with seawater tend to receive bromide from magmatic fluids in summary by combining the chlorine isotope compositions and cl and br concentrations we can effectively identify a magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal system using rehai as an example notably further inspection of the bromide chloride relations shows that the two acidic hot springs at liuhuangtang experiencing and old boiling pool have abnormally high molar br cl ratios 0 0075 and 0 0043 respectively fig 6 the reasons for this phenomenon are discussed in detail in section 5 3 5 2 reservoir processes undergone by rehai geothermal waters potentially further altered their chlorine isotope compositions after input of magmatic fluids although the neutral to alkaline hot springs at liuhuangtang have low δ37cl values two liuhuangtang acid hot springs are characterized by much higher δ37cl values the acid experiencing spring at liuhuangtang sample no 7 has a δ37cl value of 1 12 even higher than those of the non rehai hot springs 0 74 to 0 82 and the cold spring in rehai 0 85 the neutral to alkaline hot springs at langpu and zaotanghe also have relatively higher δ37cl values than those at liuhuangtang these data seem to be contradictory to the previous conclusion that the rehai hydrothermal system is being affected by the input of magmatic fluids with quite low δ37cl values in improving the interpretation of the chlorine isotope compositions of various rehai hot springs a deep understanding of their geochemical genesis and the complicated reservoir processes they underwent is necessary in a high temperature hydrothermal system e g rehai a pgf with a uniform hydrochemical composition and in full equilibrium with its host rocks is expected to form giggenbach and stewart 1982 giggenbach 1988 which can further evolve into various hot springs by ascending to the surface via different subsurface channels fournier 1979 as shown in the ph cl so4 diagram fig 7 and the triangular na k mg1 2 diagram fig 8 the rehai hot springs can be divided into three groups group i comprises neutral to alkaline springs very rich in chloride plotted right on or close to the full equilibrium line in the na k mg1 2 diagram group ii comprises springs with relatively lower chloride concentrations located in the partially equilibrated or mixed area of the na k mg1 2 diagram and group iii comprises acidic springs very high in sulfate but depleted in chloride in the immature water area of the na k mg1 2 diagram correspondingly the group i samples represent the geothermal waters evolving directly from the pgf without being substantially mixed by shallow cold groundwater the group ii samples similarly evolve from the pgf but have also been largely affected by the mixing of shallow groundwater very low in chloride and the group iii samples are far less related to the pgf than those of groups i and ii except that their acidity and sulfate derive from the stepwise oxidation of h2s in geothermal gases separated from ascending geothermal fluids upon boiling essentially these acidic hot springs are locally perched shallow groundwater heated by high temperature geothermal gases and their dissolved constituents originate from the leaching of aquifer materials by shortly circulating groundwater and trace amounts of deeply derived substances carried by geothermal gases therefore they have very low chloride concentrations and do not reach equilibrium with most primary aquifer minerals the nature of the neutral to alkaline rehai hot springs and their relationship with the pgf can be further elaborated with the aid of an enthalpy relative to chloride plot fig 9 in fig 9 all the neutral to alkaline rehai hot springs and shallow reservoir fluids directly feeding these springs are plotted according to their enthalpy values and chloride concentrations notably the enthalpy values of the shallow reservoir fluids were calculated using a quartz geothermometer and their chloride concentrations were determined based on those of the hot springs and the cooling ways through which they evolved into the springs the location of the pgf in the enthalpy versus chloride plot was then defined by those of the shallow reservoir fluids and diverse cooling ways of the pgf specifically three cooling ways were considered when plotting fig 9 adiabatic cooling conductive cooling and mixing with the overlying water with relatively low temperatures geothermal fluids experiencing adiabatic cooling were plotted on a group of lines connecting the resulting waters and a point representing the separated steam with zero chloride and an enthalpy value of 2779 4 j g the conductive cooling lines connecting the initial fluids and resulting waters were vertical to the horizontal axis because their chloride concentrations were the same easier to understand the mixing lines were plotted by connecting the cold groundwater endmember represented by the cold spring sample no 11 collected in rehai and the pgf or deep geothermal fluids with hydrogeochemical compositions close to that of the pgf finally the chloride concentration and enthalpy value of the pgf were determined to be 415 mg l and 1407 j g corresponding to a temperature of 315 c respectively on the intersection of two lines bounding all the plotted sample points one line denotes the deep subsurface mixing between the pgf and the infiltrating waters and the other line is an adiabatic cooling line delineating the formation of the big boiling pool sample no 6 with the highest chloride concentration 719 1 mg l and sampling temperature 96 c equal to the local boiling point in rehai all neutral to alkaline hot springs sampled in the subareas of rehai grouped well in the enthalpy versus chloride plot regarding the four hot springs at liuhuangtang namely the big boiling pool sample no 6 glasses left spring sample no 2 drum beating spring sample no 3 and proconceptive left spring sample no 4 the highest chloride 573 to 719 mg l and sampling temperatures 93 to 96 c were formed predominantly by adiabatic cooling of the pgf or the fluids evolving from the pgf via slight deep mixing with infiltrating waters however two other springs at liuhuangtang proconceptive right sample no 5 and spring listening sample no 1 were formed primarily via conductive cooling of the pgf or slightly evolved pgf which resulted in their chloride concentrations 417 mg l and 395 mg l respectively very close to the pgf the obviously lower vent temperatures of these two springs 79 and 75 c respectively also implied that they were more likely to be controlled by conductive cooling than by adiabatic cooling by contrast the hot springs at the zaotanghe and langpu sites samples no 9 10 12 13 14 15 and 16 with much lower chloride concentrations 218 to 368 mg l than those at the liuhuangtang site clustered together because the shallow reservoir fluids feeding these springs were formed via the strong mixing of the pgf with shallow cold groundwater of these springs the frog mouth spring sample no 16 and pavilion left spring sample no 12 were products of the conductive cooling of shallow reservoir fluids whereas the others were adiabatic cooling products correspondingly the chloride concentrations of the former 218 and 239 mg l respectively were the lowest among all the neutral to alkaline rehai hot springs 5 3 effects of various processes after magmatic fluid input on the chlorine isotope compositions of rehai geothermal waters the complex reservoir processes that the rehai geothermal waters undergo revealed by the scattered but regular distribution of the rehai hot springs in the enthalpy versus chloride plot can well explain the statistical discrepancies in their chlorine isotope compositions confirmed by the t test analysis the rehai system consists of multiple levels of reservoirs with the deepest being that in which the pgf exists the pgf in full equilibrium with the host rocks could be directly formed from the isochemical dissolution of deep subsurface rocks by magmatic fluids as has been reported elsewhere e g nevado del ruiz in colombia giggenbach et al 1990 miravalles in costa rica giggenbach and soto 1992 marini et al 2003 waiotapu in new zealand giggenbach et al 1994 and yellowstone national park in the united states guo et al 2014b here isochemical dissolution means that the minerals in the deep subsurface rocks were completely dissolved in highly aggressive acidic magmatic fluids with their mineralogical structures collapsing thus the elements in the minerals could enter the liquid phase isochemically giggenbach 1988 therefore the pgf below rehai should have a chlorine isotope composition similar to that of the underlying magmatic fluids as a result the hot springs formed from the conductive cooling of the pgf namely proconceptive right sample no 5 and spring listening sample no 1 which changed little in their chemical compositions during the cooling have the lowest δ37cl values 0 44 and 0 32 respectively during the adiabatic cooling geothermal vapors rich in light chlorine isotope were separated and the δ37cl values of the remaining waters were expected to increase similarly mixing with low temperature waters with much higher δ37cl values increased those of the geothermal fluids as well although the increase would be limited because of the low chloride concentrations of low temperature waters thus the no 2 3 and 4 hot springs at liuhuangtang formed principally from adiabatic cooling had δ37cl values somewhat higher than those of the no 5 and 1 springs but were still low 0 14 0 17 and 0 03 respectively and the no 9 10 12 13 14 15 and 16 hot springs undergoing both mixing and adiabatic cooling had evidently higher δ37cl values 0 02 to 0 31 an exception is the big boiling pool no 6 hot spring the direct adiabatic cooling product of the pgf theoretically it should have a slightly lower δ37cl value than those of the no 2 3 and 4 hot springs but the reverse was true therefore other geochemical processes may have affected its chlorine isotope composition the area of the big boiling pool fig s2 is approximately more than 10 m2 much larger than those of the vents of the other rehai springs therefore strong surface evaporation might be responsible for its relatively high δ37cl value 0 06 strong evaporation is also suggested by its much higher tds value than that of other neutral to alkaline hot springs notably evaporation especially under acid conditions was proved capable of strongly increasing the δ37cl values of evaporated waters based on a systematic experimental study sharp et al 2010 proposed that sharp increases in δ37cl value occurred in remaining hydrochloric acid solutions as a result of strong evaporation owing to light chlorine being preferentially lost to the vapor phase at a 1000 ln a hcl g cl value of 3 92 loss of hydrogen chloride relatively enriched in 35cl via evaporation and consequent occurrence of acidic hot springs or hot lakes rich in heavier 37cl isotope have been frequently observed elsewhere as well rouwet and ohba 2015 capaccioni et al 2016 rodriguez et al 2016 the two acidic hot springs investigated in this study experiencing sample no 7 and old boiling pool sample no 8 were characterized by relatively large spring vents too fig s2 moreover they have very small discharges and are therefore susceptible to evaporation effects indeed the most acid spring experiencing ph 1 3 had the highest δ37cl value 1 12 and there was a clearly negative correlation between the δ37cl values and the ph values of the three rehai springs apparently affected by evaporation experiencing old boiling pool and big boiling pool fig s3 notably the occurrence of evaporation and its effects were also confirmed by the abnormally high molar br cl ratios of the two acidic hot springs fig 6 at a strongly acidic ph dissolved chloride and bromide ions tend to form aqueous hcl and hbr respectively followed by their loss as gaseous hcl and hbr upon evaporation the association constant lgk 1 961 for the reaction h3o cl hcl aq h2o is much higher than that lgk 0 116 for h3o br hbr aq h2o pokrovskii 1999 implying that at the same acidity the chloride ion is more readily associated with the hydrated hydrogen ion and lost from a liquid phase therefore compared with chloride more bromide remained in the two acid springs upon evaporation increasing their molar br cl ratios 6 conclusions magmatic and non magmatic hydrothermal systems occur in the tengchong volcanic geothermal region which serves as an ideal site for testing the feasibility of using chlorine isotope composition and auxiliary hydrochemical indices to detect magmatic fluid input notably the δ37cl values of the hot springs in the non magmatic tengchong hydrothermal areas typically menglian shiqiang and jietou ranged from 0 74 to 0 82 representing the isotopic imprint of the chlorine leached from reservoir hostrocks by contrast those of the hot springs in rehai potentially heated by shallow magma were affected by host rock leaching the input of magmatic fluids and various reservoir processes an overall understanding of the geochemical genesis of hot springs and the reservoir processes they have undergone is critical for employing their chlorine isotope compositions as tracers to indicate the contribution of magmatic chlorine in rehai three types of hot springs prevailed neutral to alkaline hot springs very rich in chloride and bromide group i neutral to alkaline hot springs with lower chloride and bromide concentrations but comparable br cl ratios group ii and acidic hot springs with the lowest chloride and bromide concentrations and abnormally high br cl ratios group iii a pgf formed directly under the impact of magmatic fluid input identified by the enthalpy versus chloride relationship of the rehai hot springs resided in the deepest reservoir the geothermal fluids in the upper reservoirs at different depths which feed the neutral to alkaline rehai hot springs evolved from the pgf via various cooling processes the acidic rehai hot springs however had little relationship to the pgf because they were geothermal steam heated shortly circulating groundwater of the three types of rehai hot springs only the springs in group i with low δ37cl values can indicate the occurrence of magmatic fluid input straightforwardly they inherited the chlorine isotopic characteristics of magmatic fluids to the highest degree because they were closely related to the pgf and little affected by the mixing of low temperature shallow groundwaters with high δ37cl values by contrast the springs in group ii were strongly mixed with shallow groundwaters and consequently their δ37cl values were elevated to some degree and the springs in group iii featured the highest δ37cl values owing to being unrelated to the pgf and of course the magmatic fluids and the surface evaporation under acid conditions that they have experienced because group iii rehai and group iv non rehai were not or little affected by magmatic fluid input they were also not statistically different in δ37cl in summary chlorine isotope composition contains straightforward information for determining whether magmatic cl contributes to chloride in hot springs however its use as a tracer of magmatic fluid input will be more rationalized when the reservoir processes affecting the investigated hot springs are well understood based on general hydrochemistry specifically for a hydrothermal system hosted by silicate rocks like rehai occurrence of a group of hot springs with quite depleted δ37cl signals is a robust evidence supporting that it is a magmatic fluid affected system with identification of these hot springs depleted in 37cl and consequent confirmation of magmatic fluid input other hot springs with more enriched 37cl would indicate a less degree to which they are affected by magmatic fluids additional hydrochemical information can be used as a subsidiary tool for evaluating the effects of magmatic fluid input on various hot springs the approach to identifying a magmatic fluid affected hydrothermal system based on chlorine isotope composition in combination with the hydrochemistry developed in this study is promising for application in many unexplored geothermal regions across china and worldwide credit authorship contribution statement qinghai guo
