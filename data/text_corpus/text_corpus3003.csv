15015,methanogen is a pivotal player in pollution treatment and energy recovery and emerging pollutants eps frequently occur in methanogen applied biotechnology such as anaerobic digestion ad however the direct effect and underlying mechanism of eps on crucial methanogen involved in its application still remain unclear the positive effect of chrysene ch on semi continuous ad of sludge and the robust methanogen was dissected in this study the methane yield in the digester with ch 100 mg kg dry sludge was 62 1 ml g vs substrate much higher than that in the control 46 1 ml g vs substrate both methane production from acetoclastic methanogenesis am and the am proportion in the methanogenic pathway were improved in ch shaped ad acetoclastic consortia especially methanosarcina and functional profiles of am were enriched by ch in favor of the corresponding methanogenesis further based on pure cultivation exposed to ch the methanogenic performance biomass survivability and activity of typical methanosarcina m barkeri were boosted notably itraq proteomics revealed that the manufacturing transcription and translation expression and biocatalytic activity of acetoclastic metalloenzymes particularly tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase and methyl coenzyme m reductase with cobalt nickel cofactor f430 and cobalamin and acetyl coa decarbonylase synthase with cobalt nickel active site of m barkeri were upregulated significantly with fold changes in the range of 1 21 3 20 due to the ch presence this study shed light on eps affecting industrially crucial methanogen at the molecular biology level during ad and had implications in the technical relevance of methanogens graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion methanogenesis acetoclastic methanogens metagenomics proteomics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction methane biological synthesis termed methanogenesis is a crucial link in the global carbon cycle methanogens are the only known microorganisms that govern methanogenesis which occurs in the most reduced anaerobic conditions such as marine and river sediments oil fields rumen and colon of animals and human engineered habitats e g bioreactors mayumi et al 2016 stolaroff et al 2012 yang et al 2019 the classification and biochemistry metabolism of methanogens are unique setting them apart from most other microorganisms currently methanogens are mainly classified into three groups i e acetoclastic hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic methanogens based on their substrate usage i e acetate co2 h2 and methanol katayama et al 2022 kong et al 2018 furthermore specific sets of enzymes and coenzymes e g coenzyme f430 and f420 unusual corrinoids with factor iii or pseudovitamin b12 ferredoxin thioredoxin cytochromes b and c and various vitamins e g thiamine riboflavin biotin and pantothenate are prerequisites for methanogenic biochemical reactions lang et al 2015 mccarver and lessner 2014 moore et al 2017 passaris et al 2018 wang et al 2011 due to the industrial economic importance of the underlying methanogenic events methanogen has always been considered a potential platform for technical application for example methanogen is already commonly used in wastewater treatment plants oil fields and coal beds to generate industrial relevant fuel enzmann et al 2018 garcia et al 2000 however due to difficulties in isolating and cultivating methanogens the metabolic properties of pure strains involved in technical applications are far from fully understood a well known example of methanogen application is anaerobic digestion ad of organic substrates characterized by waste treatment pollution reduction and the concomitant co2 neutral biogas production karakashev et al 2005 siddique and wahid 2018 the ad requires the coordinated action of a complex community of microbes with each member playing their special roles in the whole process based on the functional niche the microbiota in the ad system is divided up into fermentative bacteria and methanogenic archaea responsible for hydrolysis acidification and acetoclastic hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis am and hm liu and chen 2018 ren et al 2020 methanogenesis exerted by methanogenic populations is often more sensitive to environmental factors than non methanogenesis for instance the methanogenic consortia and pathways varied between differentiated operating conditions ph and temperature fan et al 2022 wormald et al 2020 substrates properties ammonia and long chain fatty acids deaver et al 2020 fotidis et al 2013 and pretreatment methods chemical and biological pretreatment chen et al 2020 wang and li 2016 till now one of the most widely studied environmental factors was ammonia which inhibited methanogenesis significantly and shifted the dominant pathway from am to hm with its increasing concentration hao et al 2021 li et al 2022 most notably the latest research has revealed that emerging pollutants eps is also one of the vital factors affecting methanogenesis during ad of organics chen et al 2021 duan et al 2016 stasinakis 2012 which is becoming a new research hotspot of waste treatment and disposal due to the daily use of chemicals organic waste such as sewage sludge is increasingly considered a reservoir of various eps including antibiotics environmental estrogens perfluorochemicals and microplastics chen et al 2021 duan et al 2016 wang et al 2021 zhi et al 2019 the reported studies on eps affecting ad or methanogenesis of biosolids mainly focused on the methane production and macro mechanisms from the perspective of microbial community for example a great many of antibiotics e g roxithromycin and erythromycin inhibited hydrolysis and methanogenesis xiao et al 2021 while a high dose of cephalexin enhanced these processes zhi and zhang 2019 furthermore nonylphenol an environmental estrogen has been documented to positively affect acidogenic and methanogenic populations with dose specific pattern by using tools of 16s rrna gene and meta omics sequencing duan et al 2021 however apart from the microbial community no information is currently available on the eps influenced ad and its underlying mechanism particularly methanogenesis from the perspective of pure functional methanogens the identification of key methanogenic strains and the explorations of their metabolic properties exposed to eps during ad could provide a novel decipherment at the individual level which is different from the microbial populations level and thus be beneficial to the development and optimization of industrially applicable processes making use of methanogens polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs represented by chrysene ch pose a great environmental concern due to their widespread occurrence and persistence the highly lipophilic pahs existed in high concentrations in methanogenic environments e g sludge up to 1000 mg kg dry sludge and soils 133 mg kg dry matter gao and zhu 2004 moreda et al 1998 thus in this study the effect of ch on ad of a typical organic waste i e sludge was investigated firstly methane production from am and hm was revealed and the alteration of dominant methanogenic pathways in the presence of ch was pinpointed by stable isotope technology to identify the key microorganisms especially methanogens influenced by ch the structure and functional traits of microbial community responsible for ch shaped methanogenesis were then deciphered most importantly the methane production and viability of a pure cultured methanogen strain methanosarcina bakeri exposed to ch were analyzed and its metabolic properties were profiled at the molecular biology level on the foundation of itarq proteomic analyses 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewage sludge methanogen and reagents the sludge utilized in this research originated from the secondary sedimentation tank of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in shanghai china prior to tests the sludge was screened by using a 1 mm 1 mm sieve to get rid of particulates and then enriched by static settlement at 4 c for 24 h the traits of treated sludge were ph 6 9 0 1 total suspended solids tss 15 7 0 5 g l volatile solids vs 10 4 0 3 g l total chemical oxygen demand 12 660 190 mg l soluble chemical oxygen demand 125 10 mg l total protein 8110 420 mg cod l total carbohydrate 1140 50 mg cod l lipid and oil 160 15 mg cod l to assess the effect of ch on methane production from sludge ad the sludge that did not contain ch was used in this study methanosarcina barkeri ms dsm 800 was acquired from deutsche sammlung von mikroorganismen und zellkulturen germany ch analytical standard and other chemicals table s1 used in the culture medium were purchased from merck germany ch stock solution 1 mg ml was prepared by dissolving 100 mg of ch into 100 ml of methanol 2 2 effect of ch on methane production during sludge ad the effect of ch on sludge ad were carried out in a collection of identical semi continuous flow anaerobic bioreactors made from serum bottles the fresh sludge originated from the wwtp was used for ad without extra inoculum and the volume of sludge in each bioreactor was 300 ml the ch contents were set to 0 control 50 100 and 200 mg kg dry sludge respectively since the pahs contents have been documented to be 0 31 94 mg kg dry sludge worldwide even reached 482 mg kg dry matter in earlier study moreda et al 1998 and ch is the most commonly detected 4 ring pah in sludge chen et al 2019 ch stock solution 0 0 79 1 57 and 3 14 ml respectively was added to mix with 1 l of sludge and then the mixture was spiked into the container and placed in a fume hood for methanol vaporization highly volatile when methanol in sludge could not be detected the ch containing stock sludge was obtained and supplemented to the semi continuous flow reactors allan et al 2007 li et al 2010 luo et al 2016 all digesters were purged with n2 to eliminate o2 sealed with a rubber stopper and cultured at 35 1 c in an air bath shaker with a stirring speed of 150 rpm the ph was controlled at 7 0 by adding 4 m naoh or 4 m hcl the srt in all bioreactors was controlled at 20 d by releasing 30 ml of digestion mixture and replenishing it with the same volume of fresh corresponding ch containing sludge every 2 days and the organic loading rate of ad was 0 63 g l d liquid samples were gathered to evaluate the content of soluble carbohydrates and proteins and for metagenomics sequencing gas samples in bioreactors were collected to monitor the methane concentration and the stable carbon isotopic of ch4 δch4 and co2 δco2 apparent fractionation factor αc is always used to evaluate the contribution of am and hm pathway to total methane production the value of αc is a composite of parameters in c flow and defined by δco2 and δch4 conrad 2005 lu et al 2013 i e 1 a c δ c o 2 10 3 δ c h 4 10 3 it should be noted that the methane formation is dominated by am hm and a mixture of am and hm when αc 1 027 αc 1 065 and αc 1 045 respectively the higher value of αc the greater relative contribution of hm to methane formation the hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis are included in the complete anaerobic digestion process of sludge macro polymers i e proteins and polysaccharides are depolymerized into bioavailable small molecule matters i e amino acids and monosaccharides via hydrolysis which are further converted into organic acids during acidification acetate and h2 co2 are utilized for methane formation via am and hm to explore the ch effect on the bioconversion processes of ad the tests were conducted by using synthetic wastewater in a series of identical batch ad bioreactors with a working volume of 300 ml for hydrolysis tests the synthetic wastewater was formed by dissolving 0 45 g of bsa model proteins and 0 09 g of dextran model carbohydrates in 270 ml tap water and the inoculum was 30 ml of fermentation mixture from semi continuous bioreactors the operating conditions were the same with the semi continuous bioreactors of sludge and the hydrolysis time was set as 2 d the soluble protein and carbohydrate concentrations were examined to evaluate hydrolysis efficiency for acidification tests the substrates in synthetic wastewater were 0 45 g of l glutamate model amino acids and 0 09 g of glucose model monosaccharides the acidification time was 3 d and scfas contents were measured to reveal the effect of ch on acidification for am tests the substrate in synthetic wastewater was 0 9 g acetate and the digestion time was 8 d for hm tests 300 ml of h2 co2 mixed gas vh2 vco2 4 1 filled the upper space and the digestion time was 2 d by monitoring the specific methane production and hydrogen consumption specific methane production respectively the effects of ch on am and hm were obtained text s1 mu et al 2011 zhao et al 2018 2 3 effect of ch on pure cultured m barkeri the effect of ch on m barkeri was investigated by using semi continuous anaerobic bottles filled with 200 ml of basal medium and 30 mm acetate see text s2 in supplementary materials the bioreactors with the pure strain were operated in the same way with those sludge semi continuous flow bioreactors 5 of the inoculum volume was inoculated to the medium and the concentration of ch in medium was equal to 100 mg kg 1 6 mg l defined as low dose of ch and 200 mg kg 3 2 mg l defined as high dose of ch in sludge ad reactors then the strain was cultured at 35 c ph 7 and the retention time was set as 20 d by removing 10 ml of mixed culture and replenishing it with the same volume of the corresponding ch and fresh medium every 2 days all the operations and inoculations were performed under anaerobic conditions when the methane yield in the cultivation went stable gas and mixed cultures were sampled to determine methane production extracellular polymeric substance eps and od600 respectively meanwhile the suspension of m barkeri was concentrated by centrifugation and was frozen in liquid nitrogen for key proteins identification and quantitation which were performed by using itraq proteomic analysis 2 4 analytic methods characteristics of sludge ph cod etc were determined by standard methods the extraction of extracellular polymeric substances eps and the analysis of proteins and polysaccharides were detailed in text s3 the short chain fatty acids ch4 h2 and co2 concentrations were measured by gas chromatography agilent 7820a with a flame ionization detector and a thermal conductivity detector carrier gas n2 respectively the stable carbon isotopic signatures of ch4 δ13ch4 and co2 δ13co2 were examined by a gv isoprime mass spectrometer linked to a gas chromatography agilent 6890 n with a cp poraplot q column text s3 all samples were tested in triplicate and the reported δ13c value has an average standard deviation within 0 3 2 5 statistical analysis all of the aforementioned assays were performed in triplicate and the results were presented as mean standard deviation a p value less than 0 05 was regarded as statistically significant when one way analysis of variance anova was used for statistical analyses 2 6 metagenomic sequencing analysis dna extraction from sludge samples was performed with the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross usa based on the manufacturer s protocol the quantities and purities of the extracted dna were measured by tbs 380 and nanodrop 2000 dna extract was fragmented to 300 bp to construct paired end library and sequenced using the illumina hiseq xten the raw data were deposited into the ncbi short read archive database with the accession number of prjna865928 the construction of the pe library and sequencing procedure was described in detail in text s4 the sequenced reads with low quality bases less than 20 or short length less than 50 bp or with n bases were discarded the clean reads which were acquired and then assembled by utilizing megahit contigs with the lengths greater than or equal to 300 bp were chosen as the final assembling results for each sample for the downstream analysis representative sequences of non redundant gene catalog were aligned to ncbi nr database and kegg database with an e value cutoff of 1e 5 using blastp for taxonomic and functional annotations 2 7 itraq proteomic analysis the total protein from m barkeri culture was extracted by using a urea lysis buffer 7 m urea 2 m thiourea and 1 sds with a protease inhibitor the bca protein assay kit pierce thermo usa was applied to detect protein concentrations after the reduction cysteine alkylation and digestion all samples were labeled with itraq reagents applied biosystems 4 390 812 according to the manufacturer s guidelines then peptides were desalted with a c18 solid phase extraction and analyzed through nano liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry protein digestion was operated following

into proteomexchange with the accession number of ipx0004818000 the peptide identification false discovery rate fdr was set to less than or equal to 0 01 the proteins with fold changes 1 2 or 0 83 and p 0 05 were considered to be differentially expressed 3 results and discussion 3 1 methane production in ch varied anaerobic digesters methane production fig 1 a illustrates the methane production from sludge ad with distinct concentrations of ch when the anaerobic digesters were running smoothly apparently low concentration of ch favorably altered methane production the average methane yield was detected to be 46 1 56 9 62 1 and 47 7 ml g vs substrate respectively in anaerobic digesters with 0 50 100 and 200 mg kg dry sludge ch the production of methane in ch reactor 100 mg kg dry sludge was 1 35 fold of that in the control and further increase of ch concentration to 200 mg kg dry sludge induced a methane production drops no significant difference in the methane yield between the reactor with high ch dose 200 mg kg dry sludge and control was observed thus the effect of ch on methane production was featured by low dose stimulation exhibiting a hormesis phenomenon similar results have been observed in sludge anaerobic digesters exposed to various eps i e estrogen antibiotic which indicated that the performance of sludge ad has a unique but highly generalized ability to cope with environmental challenges duan et al 2021 zhi et al 2019 based on the study of cod balance fig s2 ch enhanced cod recovery in the form of ch4 the contents of organic substrates proteins and carbohydrates were 39 0 39 6 of total cod in the presence of ch indicating that ch had no effect on sludge biodegradation whereas the cod to scfas efficiency especially cod to acetic acid efficiency were decreased greatly with ch addition specifically the cod to acetic acid efficiency accounted for 12 6 and 0 8 in the control and ch added 100 mg kg reactors consequently the cod to ch4 efficiency in the ch reactor held the highest proportion of 49 6 higher than that in the control reactor 36 0 the enhanced production of ch4 in the presence of ch was mainly attributed to more bioconversion of acetic acid methane production from am and hm methane in the biowaste anaerobic digesters is generated from acetate dismutation am and co2 reduction hm the proportion of am and hm in methanogenesis is of significant importance to methane yield from sludge ad particularly am is the most active methanogenesis pathway during ad of sludge contributing roughly two thirds of total methane formation gehring et al 2015 the variations of the methanogenesis pathways under ch disturbances in anaerobic digesters are usually evaluated by apparent fractionation factor αc determined by the values of δ13co2 and δ13ch4 methanogenesis is dominated by am when αc is less than 1 027 and a lower αc corresponds to a higher proportion of am in the methanogenesis pathway lu et al 2013 as shown in fig 1 b the average values of δ13ch4 and δ13co2 in anaerobic digesters were 49 23 and 24 32 47 50 and 26 04 41 76 and 29 89 48 44 and 24 09 respectively and the corresponding values of αc were 1 026 1 022 1 012 and 1 025 respectively with the concentrations of ch in the range of 0 200 mg kg obviously low ch concentration would not change the dominance of acetoclastic pathway during ad and even result in the increasing of the share of am in the methane production pathway although the proportion of acetoclastic pathway in methanogenesis was enhanced by low concentration of ch the methane production from each methanogenesis pathway remains unclear in this study the hydrolysis efficiencies of carbohydrates and proteins in anaerobic reactors were in the range of 75 0 78 9 and 66 0 69 0 respectively within 24 h and the productions of total scfas were in the range of 2851 3029 mg cod l within 3 d thus the positive effect of ch on ad was not originated from the impact of ch on hydrolysis and acidification fig s1 as for methanogenesis the specific production of methane from am was 20 3 ml g vs biomass d with low concentration of ch fig 1 c which was 1 48 fold of that in the control 13 7 ml g vs biomass d unlike am the specific production of methane from hm was 39 8 and 40 5 ml g vs biomass d in the control and the reactor with ch 100 mg kg respectively indicating that ch had no significant impact on hm therefore ch induced higher apparent methane yield by increasing not only the proportion of acetoclastic pathway but also the methane production from acetoclastic pathway that is the positive effect of ch on methane production from ad of sludge was mainly attributed to the enhancement of am as previously reported compared with hm high tolerance to environmental factors such as ammonia the response of am is sensitive and rapid to environment stress hao et al 2012 due to the characteristic difference between two corresponding methanogens 3 2 methanogenic consortia and functional traits in ch varied anaerobic digesters methanogenic consortia methanogenesis of sludge ad is catalyzed exclusively by methanogenic archaea i e the acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic consortia as methanogenesis especially am was enhanced in the presence of ch during sludge ad the key methanogens responsible for this alteration were further clarified as shown in fig 2 a the families methanobacteriaceae and methanosarcinaceae were the main methanogenic community in both control and ch 100 mg kg reactors the family methanosarcinaceae includes all methanogens methanosarcina and methanosaeta that are able to utilize acetate as a substrate for methanogenesis liu and whitman 2008 the relative abundances of which were 3 2 and 6 5 in the control and ch reactors respectively compared with acetoclastic methanosaeta with the relative abundance 1 in both reactors the relative abundance of acetoclastic methanosarcina was much higher under ch stress during ad for example the relative abundance of methanosarcina was 4 8 with ch which was more than 2 0 fold of that in the control reactor 2 0 furthermore m barkeri m mazei and m vacuolata etc belonging to the genus methanosarcina were detected and accumulated in ch reactor it has been reported that methanosarcina were resistant to environmental deterioration i e acetate and oxygen due to their self protection mechanism for instance they assigned more resources to improve the iron uptake to maintain the integrities of electron transport chains he et al 2019 and possessed a methanoferrodoxin with superoxide reductase activity and a functional thioredoxin reductase system horne et al 2013 besides as the mixotrophic methanogens methanosarcina dominate am when the environment changes and acetate concentration is above 10 3 m vavilin et al 2008 in this study the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanobacterium and methanobrevibacter was 1 0 1 7 much lower than the relative abundance of methanosarcina in ch shaped ad thus the shift of the methanogenic population especially the enriched methanosarcina under ch stress was conducive to methane biosynthesis via acetoclastic methanogenesis methanogenic functional traits the participation in biochemical reactions and the response to environmental changes of microbes is closely associated with not only the composition of the microbial consortia but also their functional properties fig 2 b shows that the relative abundance of most genes involved in protein manufacturing metal transporter cofactor vitamin biosynthesis and methane metabolism in ch digester was much higher up to 5 0 fold than that in the control notably based on acetoclastic methanosacina geneset among them manufacturing of protein mainly including transcription and translation of genetic information and the linking of amino acid is at the heart of the acetoclastic enzyme formation polymenis and aramayo 2015 the genes dbh xtha tror arsr erf1 alax rpl37a and rps28e etc involved in protein manufacturing were all stimulated by ch alteration of genes in the cells tissues and organs is the fundamental response induced by pahs campbell et al 1981 especially the abundances of functional genes responsible for dna repair synthesis cell proliferation growth transcription and mrna expression were in a dose dependent manner in cultured human cells or rare minnow embryos in the presence of pahs chramostová et al 2004 lampen et al 2004 yuan et al 2014 which were similar with the results observed in the present study metal transporter and cofactor vitamin biosynthesis are relevant to the catalytic performance of acetoclastic enzymes for instance metals with a range of valences such as zinc nickel and cobalt etc which are transported by cobalt nickel and zinc atp binding permease protein encoded by genes cbiomqn and znuabc act on the active sites of metalloenzymes kleifeld et al 2003 pahs molecules have been documented to be incorporated into lipid membranes and change architecture of lipid systems which is associated with the transmembrane transport hąc wydro et al 2019 cofactors vitamins including thiamine riboflavin cobalamin nicotinate coenzyme f430 pantothenate and coa are requisite for the enzymatic catalysis of biochemical reactions during methane metabolism zhao and van der donk 2003 what s more cofactors vitamins are used for a variety of other functional reasons from aiding in the stimulation for robust growth to forming the correct protein fold rodrigues et al 2012 in this study the genes cbixgdte cobaimbh ribbhe thicel nadbace cfbcde ilve pok pps coabc and dpck involved in cofactors vitamins biosynthesis increased in the presence of ch allowing for methane metabolism in sludge ad two functional modules of gene sets in methanogenic pathways are known acetate to methane m00357 and co2 to methane m00567 as shown in fig 2 b in genus methanosarcina the quantities of the majority of genes involved in m00357 cdh mtr mcr hdr etc were enhanced sharply thanks to ch in m00567 however the relative abundances of functional genes were lower by more than an order of magnitude compared with that in m00357 no significant difference was observed in the relative abundances of genes fwdabcd encoding formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase between control 0 0196 0 0210 and the ch reactor 0 0213 0 0217 the relative abundances of genes ftr mch mtd hmd mer and frh in control reactor were about 75 95 of the ch reactor indicating that ch has little effect on the functional genes in hydrogenotrophic pathway overall methanosarcina was the potential microorganism influenced by ch during methanogenesis and the alterations of the abundances and functions of methanosarcina were a significant drivers of the different methane production from ad 3 3 acetate fed m barkeri in ch varied incubations above results throw light on ch shaped biological process and functional profile of sludge ad from the point of microbial community while the ch influenced target functional strain belonging to genus methanosarcina is far from being fully understood therefore pure acetoclastic methanogen m barkeri was applied to further investigate the underlying mechanisms at the cellular and molecular levels m barkeri was selected as the model strain due to its following characteristics 1 with acetate as the major substrate in ad system 2 existed in both control and ch digesters 3 accumulated under the condition of ch stress methanogenic performance as shown in fig 3 a higher methane yield was produced in m barkeri incubation with low dose of ch 0 289 l g vs substrate depletion in standard condition vs substrate compared with that in the control 0 208 l g vs substrate the methane yield decreased to 0 248 l g vs substrate when the ch dose further increased indicating that the relationship between the ch dose and methane production was consistent with the result obtained in real sludge ad od600 is typically measured to estimate the growth and proliferation of methanogens reflecting the biomass and cell number to some extent ullah et al 2012 the final od600 of m barkeri suspension was 0 328 in the control whereas it increased to 0 442 with lose dose of ch fig 3 b which means that ch enhanced the biomass accumulation of m barkeri meanwhile the content of eps mainly eps proteins from m barkeri in medium with low ch dose 46 5 mg cod l was 1 45 fold of that in the control 32 1 mg cod l fig 3 c diverse variations can trigger the production of eps as a response to environmental stress which assist in biofilm formation and protection from unfavorable environment and is strongly associated with the survivability of cells costa et al 2018 in this study the presence of low dose of ch induced more eps production to alleviate the stress making more microbes survivable thus m barkeri exposed to ch possessed the higher biomass and stronger survivability than that without ch based on the results of od600 and eps accompanied by higher methane production to better define the ch influenced acetoclastic methanogenesis of m barkeri itraq quantitative proteomics was performed to analyze key proteins in the control and the ch low dose culture most of the increased proteins in m barkeri with ch were predicted to localize in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum according to subcellular localization studies fig 3 d providing important hints to the proteins metabolic functions of m barkeri under ch stress in the culture containing ch functional proteins resulting in methane production enhancement were summarized in three groups based on annotation and expression difference analysis of this set acetoclastic enzyme manufacturing cleavage of acetate to produce methane is a complex biological process in methanogen depending on enzymatic reaction the manufacturing of these specific enzymes is governed by the genetic information in dna transcription and translation the expression of dna polymerase iv dbh and exodeoxyribonuclease iii xth for dna replication and repair arsr family regulator and iron dependent repressor ider dtxr for transcription increased significantly in the presence of ch with a minimum fold change of 1 21 translation is the process in which ribosomes synthesize proteins carbone et al 2020 as shown in fig 3 e and f the ribosomal proteins l7ae l37ae l12 s5 s28e were upregulated significantly with a fold change of 1 27 1 80 in the presence of ch besides translation these ribosomal proteins also contributed to rna modification structural integrity of the ribosome ribosome assembling and translocation galperin et al 2021 roy chaudhuri et al 2008 wang et al 2009 further ch boosted the quantities of translation related proteins such as peptide chain release factor subunit erf1 for mrna surveillance and ser trna ala deacylase alax for trna biosynthesis consequently ch benefited the overall process for acetoclastic enzyme manufacturing from dna to protein laying the foundation for further biochemical enzyme reactions acetoclastic enzyme expression although more enzymes in m barkeri were manufactured thanks to ch according to above results only the expressed enzymes can participate in methanogenesis as shown in fig 3 e the expressions of acetyl coa decarbonylase synthase complex codh acs and energy conserving hydrogenase ferredoxin in m barkeri cultured by ch medium were upregulated significantly with fold changes of 2 65 and 1 26 respectively the codh acs catalyzes the demethylation of acetyl coa in a reaction that forms ch3 h4mpt which is the key executor in the methanogenesis from acetate and the function of the catabolic codh acs must be coupled with ferredoxin fischer et al 2019 seravalli and ragsdale 2000 in addition a significant upregulation of h4mpt methyltransferase mtr cob com heterodisulfide reductase hdr and ch3 com reductase mcr in the presence of ch was observed with a minimum fold change of 1 22 mtr is capable of transferring ch3 group from h4mpt to com mcr plays a key role in the terminal step of methanogenesis converting cob sh and ch3 com to the mixed heterodisulfide cob s s com and methane hdr is an iron sulfur protein that catalyzes the reduction of the disulfide bond between com and cob and is coupled to methane formation liu and whitman 2008 therefore in addition to the enzyme manufacturing the expression of enzymes involved in the methanogenesis of m barkeri was also enhanced by ch cofactor vitamin for enzyme biocatalysis the manufactured and expressed acetoclastic enzyme in m barkeri requires the non protein molecule i e a cofactor to assist its biocatalytic activity and increase the rate of a chemical reaction converting the inactive apoenzyme to an active holoenzyme fruk et al 2009 for example cobalamin vitamin b12 comprised of a central cobalt ion in an octahedral complex is an indispensable cofactor of mtr in methanogenesis marsh 1999 in m barkeri incubation exposed to ch the expressions of the cobalt transport protein cora cobalamin biosynthesis protein cbig sirohydrochlorin cobaltochelatase cbix and putative metal chaperone cobw involved in cobalamin formation were upregulated significantly with fold changes in the range of 1 20 1 60 besides nickel is localized in active site of codh acs and essential for the biosynthesis of tetrapyrrole coenzyme f430 prosthetic group of mcr during methanogenesis jaun and pfaltz 1986 the expression of putative nickel insertion protein larc cbix and atpase component niko of energizing module of nickel ecf transporter cbio were higher under ch stress indicating a higher nickel availability for ni enzyme coenzyme moreover organic cofactors are often vitamins or synthesized from vitamins and contain the nucleotide adenosine monophosphate amp as part of their structures such as coenzyme a fad and nad dym and eisenberg 2001 wang et al 2017 in this study ketol acid reductoisomerase nadp ilvc uncharacterized protein acpt hydroxyethylthiazole kinase thim and glutathione regulated potassium efflux system ancillary protein kefg embraced in the biosynthesis of pantothenate and coa thiamine and nadph dependent fmn reductase was significantly upregulated due to ch presence providing more cofactors or active site for the biocatalysis of acetoclastic enzymes and thus accelerating the rate of chemical reactions in conclusion ch stimulated enzyme particularly cobalt nickel enzyme manufacturing from dna to protein expression to catalyze biochemical reaction and cofactor generation process for the biocatalytic activity of enzyme in m barkeri based on functional protein analysis fig 3 f and thereby induced the improvement of methane production during acetoclastic methanonegesis obviously these proteomic results were agreed with the function traits obtained from the metagenomics analysis in real ad sludge system 3 4 environmental implications biotechnical application of methanogen s methane producing abilities is developed broadly as a powerful means to treat pollution and as an alternative power generation method and one of its common applications is as the core player in ad in the environments where methanogens are applied toxic and persistent organic pollutants especially eps are non negligible stress factors while the direct effect and underlying mechanism of eps on functional methanogens still remain unclear in this study acetoclastic methanosarcina was proved to be one of the target and robust methanogens in ch shaped ad actually as the most ecologically varied methanogen on earth methanosarcina possesses the ability to improve harsh conditions thereby enabling a larger variety of life to flourish and having far reaching application potential in the industry meanwhile the dose of eps applied was conducive to methane production from m barkeri according to the results in this study in other words for the sludge with high pahs content i e 482 mg kg dry matter in earlier study moreda et al 1998 it is possible to obtain the optimal methane production in methanogenic environments after incomplete removal of pahs to appropriate dose of pahs rather than the performing high cost complete degradation thus the dissection of the dose dependent effect of ch on the industrially important methanogens will assist to reduce the limitations for their successful development and process optimization and be a reference value for other biotechnology employing methanogens in the environmental toxicology field positive or negative effect of eps on organisms tissues and organs has been extensively reported different from the research object in toxicology study methanogenic archaea possess a unique biochemistry characterized partly by the presence of several specific enzymes which with one exception have not yet been observed in other groups of organisms in this study the global profile of ch shaped enzyme strategies from synthesis expression to catalysis of enzymes was excavated notably the abundances and activities of cobalt and nickel metalloenzymes i e codh acs with nickel active site mtr with cobalt containing cofactor cobalamin and mcr with nickel containing cofactor f430 were enhanced significantly by ch thus unlocking the effects of eps on methanogens and the underlying mechanisms from the perspective of specific enzyme systems by using molecular biological technique is of great significance in supplementing and extending the principles of environment toxicology 4 conclusions the direct effect and underlying mechanism of ch on target methanogen during sludge ad was investigated in this study ch gave a positive impact on methanogenesis in sludge ad when ch contents were within the range of 0 to 200 mg kg the methane production from am and am proportion in the methanogenic pathway was enhanced in ad under the condition of ch acetoclastic methanosarcina were enriched and functions of am increased by ch in favor of the corresponding methanogenesis moreover ch was beneficial to the methane production biomass survivability and activity of the acetoclastic methanogen m barkeri itraq tmt proteomics revealed that the manufacturing expression and catalytic activity of acetoclastic metalloenzymes especially mtr and mcr with cobalt nickel

15015,methanogen is a pivotal player in pollution treatment and energy recovery and emerging pollutants eps frequently occur in methanogen applied biotechnology such as anaerobic digestion ad however the direct effect and underlying mechanism of eps on crucial methanogen involved in its application still remain unclear the positive effect of chrysene ch on semi continuous ad of sludge and the robust methanogen was dissected in this study the methane yield in the digester with ch 100 mg kg dry sludge was 62 1 ml g vs substrate much higher than that in the control 46 1 ml g vs substrate both methane production from acetoclastic methanogenesis am and the am proportion in the methanogenic pathway were improved in ch shaped ad acetoclastic consortia especially methanosarcina and functional profiles of am were enriched by ch in favor of the corresponding methanogenesis further based on pure cultivation exposed to ch the methanogenic performance biomass survivability and activity of typical methanosarcina m barkeri were boosted notably itraq proteomics revealed that the manufacturing transcription and translation expression and biocatalytic activity of acetoclastic metalloenzymes particularly tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase and methyl coenzyme m reductase with cobalt nickel cofactor f430 and cobalamin and acetyl coa decarbonylase synthase with cobalt nickel active site of m barkeri were upregulated significantly with fold changes in the range of 1 21 3 20 due to the ch presence this study shed light on eps affecting industrially crucial methanogen at the molecular biology level during ad and had implications in the technical relevance of methanogens graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion methanogenesis acetoclastic methanogens metagenomics proteomics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction methane biological synthesis termed methanogenesis is a crucial link in the global carbon cycle methanogens are the only known microorganisms that govern methanogenesis which occurs in the most reduced anaerobic conditions such as marine and river sediments oil fields rumen and colon of animals and human engineered habitats e g bioreactors mayumi et al 2016 stolaroff et al 2012 yang et al 2019 the classification and biochemistry metabolism of methanogens are unique setting them apart from most other microorganisms currently methanogens are mainly classified into three groups i e acetoclastic hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic methanogens based on their substrate usage i e acetate co2 h2 and methanol katayama et al 2022 kong et al 2018 furthermore specific sets of enzymes and coenzymes e g coenzyme f430 and f420 unusual corrinoids with factor iii or pseudovitamin b12 ferredoxin thioredoxin cytochromes b and c and various vitamins e g thiamine riboflavin biotin and pantothenate are prerequisites for methanogenic biochemical reactions lang et al 2015 mccarver and lessner 2014 moore et al 2017 passaris et al 2018 wang et al 2011 due to the industrial economic importance of the underlying methanogenic events methanogen has always been considered a potential platform for technical application for example methanogen is already commonly used in wastewater treatment plants oil fields and coal beds to generate industrial relevant fuel enzmann et al 2018 garcia et al 2000 however due to difficulties in isolating and cultivating methanogens the metabolic properties of pure strains involved in technical applications are far from fully understood a well known example of methanogen application is anaerobic digestion ad of organic substrates characterized by waste treatment pollution reduction and the concomitant co2 neutral biogas production karakashev et al 2005 siddique and wahid 2018 the ad requires the coordinated action of a complex community of microbes with each member playing their special roles in the whole process based on the functional niche the microbiota in the ad system is divided up into fermentative bacteria and methanogenic archaea responsible for hydrolysis acidification and acetoclastic hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis am and hm liu and chen 2018 ren et al 2020 methanogenesis exerted by methanogenic populations is often more sensitive to environmental factors than non methanogenesis for instance the methanogenic consortia and pathways varied between differentiated operating conditions ph and temperature fan et al 2022 wormald et al 2020 substrates properties ammonia and long chain fatty acids deaver et al 2020 fotidis et al 2013 and pretreatment methods chemical and biological pretreatment chen et al 2020 wang and li 2016 till now one of the most widely studied environmental factors was ammonia which inhibited methanogenesis significantly and shifted the dominant pathway from am to hm with its increasing concentration hao et al 2021 li et al 2022 most notably the latest research has revealed that emerging pollutants eps is also one of the vital factors affecting methanogenesis during ad of organics chen et al 2021 duan et al 2016 stasinakis 2012 which is becoming a new research hotspot of waste treatment and disposal due to the daily use of chemicals organic waste such as sewage sludge is increasingly considered a reservoir of various eps including antibiotics environmental estrogens perfluorochemicals and microplastics chen et al 2021 duan et al 2016 wang et al 2021 zhi et al 2019 the reported studies on eps affecting ad or methanogenesis of biosolids mainly focused on the methane production and macro mechanisms from the perspective of microbial community for example a great many of antibiotics e g roxithromycin and erythromycin inhibited hydrolysis and methanogenesis xiao et al 2021 while a high dose of cephalexin enhanced these processes zhi and zhang 2019 furthermore nonylphenol an environmental estrogen has been documented to positively affect acidogenic and methanogenic populations with dose specific pattern by using tools of 16s rrna gene and meta omics sequencing duan et al 2021 however apart from the microbial community no information is currently available on the eps influenced ad and its underlying mechanism particularly methanogenesis from the perspective of pure functional methanogens the identification of key methanogenic strains and the explorations of their metabolic properties exposed to eps during ad could provide a novel decipherment at the individual level which is different from the microbial populations level and thus be beneficial to the development and optimization of industrially applicable processes making use of methanogens polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs represented by chrysene ch pose a great environmental concern due to their widespread occurrence and persistence the highly lipophilic pahs existed in high concentrations in methanogenic environments e g sludge up to 1000 mg kg dry sludge and soils 133 mg kg dry matter gao and zhu 2004 moreda et al 1998 thus in this study the effect of ch on ad of a typical organic waste i e sludge was investigated firstly methane production from am and hm was revealed and the alteration of dominant methanogenic pathways in the presence of ch was pinpointed by stable isotope technology to identify the key microorganisms especially methanogens influenced by ch the structure and functional traits of microbial community responsible for ch shaped methanogenesis were then deciphered most importantly the methane production and viability of a pure cultured methanogen strain methanosarcina bakeri exposed to ch were analyzed and its metabolic properties were profiled at the molecular biology level on the foundation of itarq proteomic analyses 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewage sludge methanogen and reagents the sludge utilized in this research originated from the secondary sedimentation tank of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in shanghai china prior to tests the sludge was screened by using a 1 mm 1 mm sieve to get rid of particulates and then enriched by static settlement at 4 c for 24 h the traits of treated sludge were ph 6 9 0 1 total suspended solids tss 15 7 0 5 g l volatile solids vs 10 4 0 3 g l total chemical oxygen demand 12 660 190 mg l soluble chemical oxygen demand 125 10 mg l total protein 8110 420 mg cod l total carbohydrate 1140 50 mg cod l lipid and oil 160 15 mg cod l to assess the effect of ch on methane production from sludge ad the sludge that did not contain ch was used in this study methanosarcina barkeri ms dsm 800 was acquired from deutsche sammlung von mikroorganismen und zellkulturen germany ch analytical standard and other chemicals table s1 used in the culture medium were purchased from merck germany ch stock solution 1 mg ml was prepared by dissolving 100 mg of ch into 100 ml of methanol 2 2 effect of ch on methane production during sludge ad the effect of ch on sludge ad were carried out in a collection of identical semi continuous flow anaerobic bioreactors made from serum bottles the fresh sludge originated from the wwtp was used for ad without extra inoculum and the volume of sludge in each bioreactor was 300 ml the ch contents were set to 0 control 50 100 and 200 mg kg dry sludge respectively since the pahs contents have been documented to be 0 31 94 mg kg dry sludge worldwide even reached 482 mg kg dry matter in earlier study moreda et al 1998 and ch is the most commonly detected 4 ring pah in sludge chen et al 2019 ch stock solution 0 0 79 1 57 and 3 14 ml respectively was added to mix with 1 l of sludge and then the mixture was spiked into the container and placed in a fume hood for methanol vaporization highly volatile when methanol in sludge could not be detected the ch containing stock sludge was obtained and supplemented to the semi continuous flow reactors allan et al 2007 li et al 2010 luo et al 2016 all digesters were purged with n2 to eliminate o2 sealed with a rubber stopper and cultured at 35 1 c in an air bath shaker with a stirring speed of 150 rpm the ph was controlled at 7 0 by adding 4 m naoh or 4 m hcl the srt in all bioreactors was controlled at 20 d by releasing 30 ml of digestion mixture and replenishing it with the same volume of fresh corresponding ch containing sludge every 2 days and the organic loading rate of ad was 0 63 g l d liquid samples were gathered to evaluate the content of soluble carbohydrates and proteins and for metagenomics sequencing gas samples in bioreactors were collected to monitor the methane concentration and the stable carbon isotopic of ch4 δch4 and co2 δco2 apparent fractionation factor αc is always used to evaluate the contribution of am and hm pathway to total methane production the value of αc is a composite of parameters in c flow and defined by δco2 and δch4 conrad 2005 lu et al 2013 i e 1 a c δ c o 2 10 3 δ c h 4 10 3 it should be noted that the methane formation is dominated by am hm and a mixture of am and hm when αc 1 027 αc 1 065 and αc 1 045 respectively the higher value of αc the greater relative contribution of hm to methane formation the hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis are included in the complete anaerobic digestion process of sludge macro polymers i e proteins and polysaccharides are depolymerized into bioavailable small molecule matters i e amino acids and monosaccharides via hydrolysis which are further converted into organic acids during acidification acetate and h2 co2 are utilized for methane formation via am and hm to explore the ch effect on the bioconversion processes of ad the tests were conducted by using synthetic wastewater in a series of identical batch ad bioreactors with a working volume of 300 ml for hydrolysis tests the synthetic wastewater was formed by dissolving 0 45 g of bsa model proteins and 0 09 g of dextran model carbohydrates in 270 ml tap water and the inoculum was 30 ml of fermentation mixture from semi continuous bioreactors the operating conditions were the same with the semi continuous bioreactors of sludge and the hydrolysis time was set as 2 d the soluble protein and carbohydrate concentrations were examined to evaluate hydrolysis efficiency for acidification tests the substrates in synthetic wastewater were 0 45 g of l glutamate model amino acids and 0 09 g of glucose model monosaccharides the acidification time was 3 d and scfas contents were measured to reveal the effect of ch on acidification for am tests the substrate in synthetic wastewater was 0 9 g acetate and the digestion time was 8 d for hm tests 300 ml of h2 co2 mixed gas vh2 vco2 4 1 filled the upper space and the digestion time was 2 d by monitoring the specific methane production and hydrogen consumption specific methane production respectively the effects of ch on am and hm were obtained text s1 mu et al 2011 zhao et al 2018 2 3 effect of ch on pure cultured m barkeri the effect of ch on m barkeri was investigated by using semi continuous anaerobic bottles filled with 200 ml of basal medium and 30 mm acetate see text s2 in supplementary materials the bioreactors with the pure strain were operated in the same way with those sludge semi continuous flow bioreactors 5 of the inoculum volume was inoculated to the medium and the concentration of ch in medium was equal to 100 mg kg 1 6 mg l defined as low dose of ch and 200 mg kg 3 2 mg l defined as high dose of ch in sludge ad reactors then the strain was cultured at 35 c ph 7 and the retention time was set as 20 d by removing 10 ml of mixed culture and replenishing it with the same volume of the corresponding ch and fresh medium every 2 days all the operations and inoculations were performed under anaerobic conditions when the methane yield in the cultivation went stable gas and mixed cultures were sampled to determine methane production extracellular polymeric substance eps and od600 respectively meanwhile the suspension of m barkeri was concentrated by centrifugation and was frozen in liquid nitrogen for key proteins identification and quantitation which were performed by using itraq proteomic analysis 2 4 analytic methods characteristics of sludge ph cod etc were determined by standard methods the extraction of extracellular polymeric substances eps and the analysis of proteins and polysaccharides were detailed in text s3 the short chain fatty acids ch4 h2 and co2 concentrations were measured by gas chromatography agilent 7820a with a flame ionization detector and a thermal conductivity detector carrier gas n2 respectively the stable carbon isotopic signatures of ch4 δ13ch4 and co2 δ13co2 were examined by a gv isoprime mass spectrometer linked to a gas chromatography agilent 6890 n with a cp poraplot q column text s3 all samples were tested in triplicate and the reported δ13c value has an average standard deviation within 0 3 2 5 statistical analysis all of the aforementioned assays were performed in triplicate and the results were presented as mean standard deviation a p value less than 0 05 was regarded as statistically significant when one way analysis of variance anova was used for statistical analyses 2 6 metagenomic sequencing analysis dna extraction from sludge samples was performed with the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross usa based on the manufacturer s protocol the quantities and purities of the extracted dna were measured by tbs 380 and nanodrop 2000 dna extract was fragmented to 300 bp to construct paired end library and sequenced using the illumina hiseq xten the raw data were deposited into the ncbi short read archive database with the accession number of prjna865928 the construction of the pe library and sequencing procedure was described in detail in text s4 the sequenced reads with low quality bases less than 20 or short length less than 50 bp or with n bases were discarded the clean reads which were acquired and then assembled by utilizing megahit contigs with the lengths greater than or equal to 300 bp were chosen as the final assembling results for each sample for the downstream analysis representative sequences of non redundant gene catalog were aligned to ncbi nr database and kegg database with an e value cutoff of 1e 5 using blastp for taxonomic and functional annotations 2 7 itraq proteomic

p 0 05 were considered to be differentially expressed 3 results and discussion 3 1 methane production in ch varied anaerobic digesters methane production fig 1 a illustrates the methane production from sludge ad with distinct concentrations of ch when the anaerobic digesters were running smoothly apparently low concentration of ch favorably altered methane production the average methane yield was detected to be 46 1 56 9 62 1 and 47 7 ml g vs substrate respectively in anaerobic digesters with 0 50 100 and 200 mg kg dry sludge ch the production of methane in ch reactor 100 mg kg dry sludge was 1 35 fold of that in the control and further increase of ch concentration to 200 mg kg dry sludge induced a methane production drops no significant difference in the methane yield between the reactor with high ch dose 200 mg kg dry sludge and control was observed thus the effect of ch on methane production was featured by low dose stimulation exhibiting a hormesis phenomenon similar results have been observed in sludge anaerobic digesters exposed to various eps i e estrogen antibiotic which indicated that the performance of sludge ad has a unique but highly generalized ability to cope with environmental challenges duan et al 2021 zhi et al 2019 based on the study of cod balance fig s2 ch enhanced cod recovery in the form of ch4 the contents of organic substrates proteins and carbohydrates were 39 0 39 6 of total cod in the presence of ch indicating that ch had no effect on sludge biodegradation whereas the cod to scfas efficiency especially cod to acetic acid efficiency were decreased greatly with ch addition specifically the cod to acetic acid efficiency accounted for 12 6 and 0 8 in the control and ch added 100 mg kg reactors consequently the cod to ch4 efficiency in the ch reactor held the highest proportion of 49 6 higher than that in the control reactor 36 0 the enhanced production of ch4 in the presence of ch was mainly attributed to more bioconversion of acetic acid methane production from am and hm methane in the biowaste anaerobic digesters is generated from acetate dismutation am and co2 reduction hm the proportion of am and hm in methanogenesis is of significant importance to methane yield from sludge ad particularly am is the most active methanogenesis pathway during ad of sludge contributing roughly two thirds of total methane formation gehring et al 2015 the variations of the methanogenesis pathways under ch disturbances in anaerobic digesters are usually evaluated by apparent fractionation factor αc determined by the values of δ13co2 and δ13ch4 methanogenesis is dominated by am when αc is less than 1 027 and a lower αc corresponds to a higher proportion of am in the methanogenesis pathway lu et al 2013 as shown in fig 1 b the average values of δ13ch4 and δ13co2 in anaerobic digesters were 49 23 and 24 32 47 50 and 26 04 41 76 and 29 89 48 44 and 24 09 respectively and the corresponding values of αc were 1 026 1 022 1 012 and 1 025 respectively with the concentrations of ch in the range of 0 200 mg kg obviously low ch concentration would not change the dominance of acetoclastic pathway during ad and even result in the increasing of the share of am in the methane production pathway although the proportion of acetoclastic pathway in methanogenesis was enhanced by low concentration of ch the methane production from each methanogenesis pathway remains unclear in this study the hydrolysis efficiencies of carbohydrates and proteins in anaerobic reactors were in the range of 75 0 78 9 and 66 0 69 0 respectively within 24 h and the productions of total scfas were in the range of 2851 3029 mg cod l within 3 d thus the positive effect of ch on ad was not originated from the impact of ch on hydrolysis and acidification fig s1 as for methanogenesis the specific production of methane from am was 20 3 ml g vs biomass d with low concentration of ch fig 1 c which was 1 48 fold of that in the control 13 7 ml g vs biomass d unlike am the specific production of methane from hm was 39 8 and 40 5 ml g vs biomass d in the control and the reactor with ch 100 mg kg respectively indicating that ch had no significant impact on hm therefore ch induced higher apparent methane yield by increasing not only the proportion of acetoclastic pathway but also the methane production from acetoclastic pathway that is the positive effect of ch on methane production from ad of sludge was mainly attributed to the enhancement of am as previously reported compared with hm high tolerance to environmental factors such as ammonia the response of am is sensitive and rapid to environment stress hao et al 2012 due to the characteristic difference between two corresponding methanogens 3 2 methanogenic consortia and functional traits in ch varied anaerobic digesters methanogenic consortia methanogenesis of sludge ad is catalyzed exclusively by methanogenic archaea i e the acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic consortia as methanogenesis especially am was enhanced in the presence of ch during sludge ad the key methanogens responsible for this alteration were further clarified as shown in fig 2 a the families methanobacteriaceae and methanosarcinaceae were the main methanogenic community in both control and ch 100 mg kg reactors the family methanosarcinaceae includes all methanogens methanosarcina and methanosaeta that are able to utilize acetate as a substrate for methanogenesis liu and whitman 2008 the relative abundances of which were 3 2 and 6 5 in the control and ch reactors respectively compared with acetoclastic methanosaeta with the relative abundance 1 in both reactors the relative abundance of acetoclastic methanosarcina was much higher under ch stress during ad for example the relative abundance of methanosarcina was 4 8 with ch which was more than 2 0 fold of that in the control reactor 2 0 furthermore m barkeri m mazei and m vacuolata etc belonging to the genus methanosarcina were detected and accumulated in ch reactor it has been reported that methanosarcina were resistant to environmental deterioration i e acetate and oxygen due to their self protection mechanism for instance they assigned more resources to improve the iron uptake to maintain the integrities of electron transport chains he et al 2019 and possessed a methanoferrodoxin with superoxide reductase activity and a functional thioredoxin reductase system horne et al 2013 besides as the mixotrophic methanogens methanosarcina dominate am when the environment changes and acetate concentration is above 10 3 m vavilin et al 2008 in this study the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanobacterium and methanobrevibacter was 1 0 1 7 much lower than the relative abundance of methanosarcina in ch shaped ad thus the shift of the methanogenic population especially the enriched methanosarcina under ch stress was conducive to methane biosynthesis via acetoclastic methanogenesis methanogenic functional traits the participation in biochemical reactions and the response to environmental changes of microbes is closely associated with not only the composition of the microbial consortia but also their functional properties fig 2 b shows that the relative abundance of most genes involved in protein manufacturing metal transporter cofactor vitamin biosynthesis and methane metabolism in ch digester was much higher up to 5 0 fold than that in the control notably based on acetoclastic methanosacina geneset among them manufacturing of protein mainly including transcription and translation of genetic information and the linking of amino acid is at the heart of the acetoclastic enzyme formation polymenis and aramayo 2015 the genes dbh xtha tror arsr erf1 alax rpl37a and rps28e etc involved in protein manufacturing were all stimulated by ch alteration of genes in the cells tissues and organs is the fundamental response induced by pahs campbell et al 1981 especially the abundances of functional genes responsible for dna repair synthesis cell proliferation growth transcription and mrna expression were in a dose dependent manner in cultured human cells or rare minnow embryos in the presence of pahs chramostová et al 2004 lampen et al 2004 yuan et al 2014 which were similar with the results observed in the present study metal transporter and cofactor vitamin biosynthesis are relevant to the catalytic performance of acetoclastic enzymes for instance metals with a range of valences such as zinc nickel and cobalt etc which are transported by cobalt nickel and zinc atp binding permease protein encoded by genes cbiomqn and znuabc act on the active sites of metalloenzymes kleifeld et al 2003 pahs molecules have been documented to be incorporated into lipid membranes and change architecture of lipid systems which is associated with the transmembrane transport hąc wydro et al 2019 cofactors vitamins including thiamine riboflavin cobalamin nicotinate coenzyme f430 pantothenate and coa are requisite for the enzymatic catalysis of biochemical reactions during methane metabolism zhao and van der donk 2003 what s more cofactors vitamins are used for a variety of other functional reasons from aiding in the stimulation for robust growth to forming the correct protein fold rodrigues et al 2012 in this study the genes cbixgdte cobaimbh ribbhe thicel nadbace cfbcde ilve pok pps coabc and dpck involved in cofactors vitamins biosynthesis increased in the presence of ch allowing for methane metabolism in sludge ad two functional modules of gene sets in methanogenic pathways are known acetate to methane m00357 and co2 to methane m00567 as shown in fig 2 b in genus methanosarcina the quantities of the majority of genes involved in m00357 cdh mtr mcr hdr etc were enhanced sharply thanks to ch in m00567 however the relative abundances of functional genes were lower by more than an order of magnitude compared with that in m00357 no significant difference was observed in the relative abundances of genes fwdabcd encoding formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase between control 0 0196 0 0210 and the ch reactor 0 0213 0 0217 the relative abundances of genes ftr mch mtd hmd mer and frh in control reactor were about 75 95 of the ch reactor indicating that ch has little effect on the functional genes in hydrogenotrophic pathway overall methanosarcina was the potential microorganism influenced by ch during methanogenesis and the alterations of the abundances and functions of methanosarcina were a significant drivers of the different methane production from ad 3 3 acetate fed m barkeri in ch varied incubations above results throw light on ch shaped biological process and functional profile of sludge ad from the point of microbial community while the ch influenced target functional strain belonging to genus methanosarcina is far from being fully understood therefore pure acetoclastic methanogen m barkeri was applied to further investigate the underlying mechanisms at the cellular and molecular levels m barkeri was selected as the model strain due to its following characteristics 1 with acetate as the major substrate in ad system 2 existed in both control and ch digesters 3 accumulated under the condition of ch stress methanogenic performance as shown in fig 3 a higher methane yield was produced in m barkeri incubation with low dose of ch 0 289 l g vs substrate depletion in standard condition vs substrate compared with that in the control 0 208 l g vs substrate the methane yield decreased to 0 248 l g vs substrate when the ch dose further increased indicating that the relationship between the ch dose and methane production was consistent with the result obtained in real sludge ad od600 is typically measured to estimate the growth and proliferation of methanogens reflecting the biomass and cell number to some extent ullah et al 2012 the final od600 of m barkeri suspension was 0 328 in the control whereas it increased to 0 442 with lose dose of ch fig 3 b which means that ch enhanced the biomass accumulation of m barkeri meanwhile the content of eps mainly eps proteins from m barkeri in medium with low ch dose 46 5 mg cod l was 1 45 fold of that in the control 32 1 mg cod l fig 3 c diverse variations can trigger the production of eps as a response to environmental stress which assist in biofilm formation and protection from unfavorable environment and is strongly associated with the survivability of cells costa et al 2018 in this study the presence of low dose of ch induced more eps production to alleviate the stress making more microbes survivable thus m barkeri exposed to ch possessed the higher biomass and stronger survivability than that without ch based on the results of od600 and eps accompanied by higher methane production to better define the ch influenced acetoclastic methanogenesis of m barkeri itraq quantitative proteomics was performed to analyze key proteins in the control and the ch low dose culture most of the increased proteins in m barkeri with ch were predicted to localize in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum according to subcellular localization studies fig 3 d providing important hints to the proteins metabolic functions of m barkeri under ch stress in the culture containing ch functional proteins resulting in methane production enhancement were summarized in three groups based on annotation and expression difference analysis of this set acetoclastic enzyme manufacturing cleavage of acetate to produce methane is a complex biological process in methanogen depending on enzymatic reaction the manufacturing of these specific enzymes is governed by the genetic information in dna transcription and translation the expression of dna polymerase iv dbh and exodeoxyribonuclease iii xth for dna replication and repair arsr family regulator and iron dependent repressor ider dtxr for transcription increased significantly in the presence of ch with a minimum fold change of 1 21 translation is the process in which ribosomes synthesize proteins carbone et al 2020 as shown in fig 3 e and f the ribosomal proteins l7ae l37ae l12 s5 s28e were upregulated significantly with a fold change of 1 27 1 80 in the presence of ch besides translation these ribosomal proteins also contributed to rna modification structural integrity of the ribosome ribosome assembling and translocation galperin et al 2021 roy chaudhuri et al 2008 wang et al 2009 further ch boosted the quantities of translation related proteins such as peptide chain release factor subunit erf1 for mrna surveillance and ser trna ala deacylase alax for trna biosynthesis consequently ch benefited the overall process for acetoclastic enzyme manufacturing from dna to protein laying the foundation for further biochemical enzyme reactions acetoclastic enzyme expression although more enzymes in m barkeri were manufactured thanks to ch according to above results only the expressed enzymes can participate in methanogenesis as shown in fig 3 e the expressions of acetyl coa decarbonylase synthase complex codh acs and energy conserving hydrogenase ferredoxin in m barkeri cultured by ch medium were upregulated significantly with fold changes of 2 65 and 1 26 respectively the codh acs catalyzes the demethylation of acetyl coa in a reaction that forms ch3 h4mpt which is the key executor in the methanogenesis from acetate and the function of the catabolic codh acs must be coupled with ferredoxin fischer et al 2019 seravalli and ragsdale 2000 in addition a significant upregulation of h4mpt methyltransferase mtr cob com heterodisulfide reductase hdr and ch3 com reductase mcr in the presence of ch was observed with a minimum fold change of 1 22 mtr is capable of transferring ch3 group from h4mpt to com mcr plays a key role in the terminal step of methanogenesis converting cob sh and ch3 com to the mixed heterodisulfide cob s s com and methane hdr is an iron sulfur protein that catalyzes the reduction of the disulfide bond between com and cob and is coupled to methane formation liu and whitman 2008 therefore in addition to the enzyme manufacturing the expression of enzymes involved in the methanogenesis of m barkeri was also enhanced by ch cofactor vitamin for enzyme biocatalysis the manufactured and expressed acetoclastic enzyme in m barkeri requires the non protein molecule i e a cofactor to assist its biocatalytic activity and increase the rate of a chemical reaction converting the inactive apoenzyme to an active holoenzyme fruk et al 2009 for example cobalamin vitamin b12 comprised of a central cobalt ion in an octahedral complex is an indispensable cofactor of mtr in methanogenesis marsh 1999 in m barkeri incubation exposed to ch the expressions of the cobalt transport protein cora cobalamin biosynthesis protein cbig sirohydrochlorin cobaltochelatase cbix and putative metal chaperone cobw involved in cobalamin formation were upregulated significantly with fold changes in the range of 1 20 1 60 besides nickel is localized in active site of codh acs and essential for the biosynthesis of tetrapyrrole coenzyme f430 prosthetic group of mcr during methanogenesis jaun and pfaltz 1986 the expression of putative nickel insertion protein larc cbix and atpase component niko of energizing module of nickel ecf transporter cbio were higher under ch stress indicating a higher nickel availability for ni enzyme coenzyme moreover organic cofactors are often vitamins or synthesized from vitamins and contain the nucleotide adenosine monophosphate amp as part of their structures such as coenzyme a fad and nad dym and eisenberg 2001 wang et al 2017 in this study ketol acid reductoisomerase nadp ilvc uncharacterized protein acpt hydroxyethylthiazole kinase thim and glutathione regulated potassium efflux system ancillary protein kefg embraced in the biosynthesis of pantothenate and coa thiamine and nadph dependent fmn reductase was significantly upregulated due to ch presence providing more cofactors or active site for the biocatalysis of acetoclastic enzymes and thus accelerating the rate of chemical reactions in conclusion ch stimulated enzyme particularly cobalt nickel enzyme manufacturing from dna to protein expression to catalyze biochemical reaction and cofactor generation process for the biocatalytic activity of enzyme in m barkeri based on functional protein analysis fig 3 f and thereby induced the improvement of methane production during acetoclastic methanonegesis obviously these proteomic results were agreed with the function traits obtained from the metagenomics analysis in real ad sludge system 3 4 environmental implications biotechnical application of methanogen s methane producing abilities is developed broadly as a powerful means to treat pollution and as an alternative power generation method and one of its common applications is as the core player in ad in the environments where methanogens are applied toxic and persistent organic pollutants especially eps are non negligible stress factors while the direct effect and underlying mechanism of eps on functional methanogens still remain unclear in this study acetoclastic methanosarcina was proved to be one of the target and robust methanogens in ch shaped ad actually as the most ecologically varied methanogen on earth methanosarcina possesses the ability to improve harsh conditions thereby enabling a larger variety of life to flourish and having far reaching application potential in the industry meanwhile the dose of eps applied was conducive to methane production from m barkeri according to the results in this study in other words for the sludge with high pahs content i e 482 mg kg dry matter in earlier study moreda et al 1998 it is possible to obtain the optimal methane production in methanogenic environments after incomplete removal of pahs to appropriate dose of pahs rather than the performing high cost complete degradation thus the dissection of the dose dependent effect of ch on the industrially important methanogens will assist to reduce the limitations for their successful development and process optimization and be a reference value for other biotechnology employing methanogens in the environmental toxicology field positive or negative effect of eps on organisms tissues and organs has been extensively reported different from the research object in toxicology study methanogenic archaea possess a unique biochemistry characterized partly by the presence of several specific enzymes which with one exception have not yet been observed in other groups of organisms in this study the global profile of ch shaped enzyme strategies from synthesis expression to catalysis of enzymes was excavated notably the abundances and activities of cobalt and nickel metalloenzymes i e codh acs with nickel active site mtr with cobalt containing cofactor cobalamin and mcr with nickel containing cofactor f430 were enhanced significantly by ch thus unlocking the effects of eps on methanogens and the underlying mechanisms from the perspective of specific enzyme systems by using molecular biological technique is of great significance in supplementing and extending the principles of environment toxicology 4 conclusions the direct effect and underlying mechanism of ch on target methanogen during sludge ad was investigated in this study ch gave a positive impact on methanogenesis in sludge ad when ch contents were within the range of 0 to 200 mg kg the methane production from am and am proportion in the methanogenic pathway was enhanced in ad under the condition of ch acetoclastic methanosarcina were enriched and functions of am increased by ch in favor of the corresponding methanogenesis moreover ch was beneficial to the methane production biomass survivability and activity of the acetoclastic methanogen m barkeri itraq tmt proteomics revealed that the manufacturing expression and catalytic activity of acetoclastic metalloenzymes especially mtr and mcr with cobalt nickel cofactor f430 and cobalamin and codh acs with cobalt nickel active site of m barkeri were upregulated significantly in the presence of ch declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

15016,bioactive polysaccharides pss are valuable resources that can be extracted from waste activated sludge was the ps extraction process causes cell lysis that may enhance hydrolytic processes during anaerobic digestion ad and thus increase the methane production thus coupling pss and methane recovery from was could be an efficient and sustainable sludge treatment in present study we comprehensively evaluated this novel process from the efficiencies of different coupling strategies properties of the extracted pss and environmental impacts the results showed that when the ps extraction was before ad it produced 76 03 2 00 ml of methane per gram of volatile solids vs and afforded a ps yield of 6 3 0 09 w w with a ps sulfate content of 13 15 0 06 in contrast when ps extraction was after ad the methane production decreased to 58 14 0 99 ml of methane per gram of vs and afforded a ps yield of 5 67 0 18 w w in vs with a ps sulfate content of 2 60 0 04 when there were two ps extractions before and after ad the methane production ps yield and sulfate content were 76 03 2 00 ml of methane per gram of vs 11 54 0 62 and 8 35 0 12 respectively then the bioactivity of the extracted pss was assessed by one anti inflammation assay and three anti oxidation assays and statistical analysis revealed that these four bioactivities of pss were influenced by their sulfate content protein content and monosaccharide composition especially the ratios of arabinose and rhamnose furthermore the environmental impact analysis shows that s1 was the best in five environmental indicators compared with other three non coupled processes these findings suggest that the coupling pss and methane recovery process should be further explored to determine its potential for large

request 1 introduction rising energy demand and resource scarcity have prompted the development of resource oriented wastewater treatment plants wwtps which recover resources such as water nutrients energy heavy metals alkalis acids bioelectricity and biofuels from wastewater or waste activated sludge was meena et al 2019 however traditional recovery approaches are energy inefficient and expensive and there is low market acceptance of recovered resources from wwtps ghaffar et al 2020 mito et al 2019 for example biofuel can only be recovered from was after it has been dewatered or carbonized which is extremely expensive xu and lancaster 2009 in addition although the cost of disposing of huge quantities of was can be alleviated by converting was to building materials via a simple and inexpensive process this does not recover its valuable organic substances tyagi and lo 2013 hence there is a need for methods to recover high value products from was as this will ensure that their economic benefits outweigh the recovery cost and there is sufficient demand for their marketization in recent years bioactive polysaccharides pss have been recognized as high value resources present in was which means that their recovery is likely to be economically viable in practical applications lin et al 2015 pss are natural polymers that play a critical role in biological metabolism and have many beneficial bioactivities like anti oxidative anti tumor anti coagulative anti bacterial anti viral and anti diabetic activities alkahtani et al 2020 chen et al 2019 gómez ordóñez et al 2014 pss with anti oxidative activities remove or prevent the generation of excess concentrations of reactive oxygen species e g oxygen radicals that can damage biomolecules e g dna these pss achieve this property by directly or indirectly quenching reactive oxygen species or their precursors through several mechanisms such as by increasing the activity of superoxide dismutase and have few side effects zhang et al 2011 hence pss have been widely explored for applications in anti bacterial materials health foods and drugs most studies of pss in wastewater have examined their effect on effluent quality but ignored their biological activities such that most pss are currently not efficiently recovered from sludge we recently demonstrated that bioactive pss are present in saline wastewater xue et al 2019 but it remains unclear how to effectively integrate ps recovery into current sludge treatment in addition it is a must to consider the upstream or downstream effects of any recovery technology so that we can achieve better environmental and economic benefits after ps extraction there is still large amounts of residual left which can cause possible environmental burdens anaerobic digestion ad is widely used for sludge treatment as it is a low cost method for the recovery of material and biogas hereinafter methane li et al 2019 verstraete et al 2005 xu et al 2020 it has been estimated that there are more than 1300 anaerobic digesters based on sewage sludge globally which demonstrates the broad applicability of ad hanum et al 2019 and ad technology cannot remove all organics of sludge which leaves space for ps recovery single resource recovery may not satisfy human s increasing needs and a collaborative network focusing on the recovery of more than resources has attracted people s attention van leeuwen et al 2018 as such the integration of ad with ps recovery would constitute a circular economy system for sludge treatment however there has been limited exploration of sludge treatment processes that combine methane and ps recovery from ad based biotechnology thus this study investigated the feasibility of coupling ad with ps extraction processes for sludge treatment in the following three aspects first we explored three scenarios that coupled ad based methane recovery with ps recovery from sludge and then compared the methane productions and ps yields second the compositions and bioactivities of recovered pss in each scenario were analyzed and the key factors affecting ps bioactivities were determined finally we determined and compared the effects on the environment of two processes to illustrate the potential utility of such coupled approaches one is that methane was recovered from sludge and pss were extracted from non sludge sources the other is coupling of methane and ps extraction from sludge 2 material and methods 2 1 sludge sources and characteristics the substrate and inoculum were was from secondary tank and ad sludge both of which were obtained from the shatin wwtp in hong kong the qualities of the influent and effluent of this wwtp are listed in table s1 in the supplementary information si some basic parameters of these two sludges are shown in table 1 2 2 the design of coupled and non coupled scenarios three scenarios s1 s2 and s3 were designed to evaluate how effectively ad coupled with ps recovery in sludge treatment as shown in fig 1 in s1 pss were directly extracted from the was and the residue was mixed with inoculum and then used in ad in s2 was was mixed with inoculum and used in ad and then pss were extracted from the resulting digestate in s3 pss were extracted from was before and after ad and then combined 2 3 general methods 2 3 1 biochemical methane potential batch tests to minimize possible ps degradation and its effects on experiments was and ad sludge obtained from the wwtp were immediately placed in a fridge at 4 c and were subsequently used within 1 week in experiments substrate 100 ml and inoculum 300 ml were mixed and transferred into 500 ml reaction bottles nitrogen gas was sparged into each bottle for 10 min to exclude oxygen and the bottles were then immediately capped with a rubber stopper and connected to an automatic methane potential test system bioprocess control sweden which thus comprised the reaction bottles gas washing bottles and a gas measurement device each gas washing bottle was filled with 4 m sodium hydroxide naoh for removing carbon dioxide co2 during ad the gas measurement device was used to automatically detect methane production all the reaction bottles were placed in a water bath 37 5 1 c to maintain a stable temperature batch testing was then performed and was stopped when no more methane was produced in a reaction bottle the bmp analysis was carried out in triplicate 2 3 2 ps extraction the ps extraction process was based on a modified alkaline extraction of fungal cell walls farkaš 2003 the sludge from each scenario was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 20 min the supernatant was discarded and the solids were treated with naoh solution 0 25 m the resulting solution was stirred at 300 rpm at room temperature for 2 h subsequently the ph of the mixture was adjusted to 7 0 2 with 4 m hydrochloric acid and then centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 20 min the supernatant was mixed with ethanol in a ratio of 1 4 v v and the resulting mixture was placed in a freezer at 36 c overnight the resulting precipitate was collected and then placed into a dialysis bag with a molecular weight cutoff of 8000 da dialysis was then performed for 2 days with the water 500 ml replaced every 2 h this afforded a liquid which was mixed with sevag solution chloroform 1 butanol 4 1 v v in a ratio of 1 1 v v to remove protein this step was finished by separating the phases in a separating funnel and the deproteinization operation was repeated a further two times finally pss were obtained after 1 week of freeze drying the combined aqueous extracts 2 4 properties of extracted pss 2 4 1 yield and component analysis the ps recovery ratio was calculated using eqs 1 and 2 as follows 1 yield p s recovered w biomass 100 2 w biomass vs volume where p s recovered is the weight of ps on a dry basis g wbiomass is the biomass weight g and the units of vs and volume are g l and l respectively the carbohydrate content of pss was measured using the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as the reference material nielsen 2017 while the protein content of pss was measured using the coomassie brilliant blue method with bovine serum albumin bsa as the reference material spector 1978 a barium sulfate turbidimetric method was used to determine sulfate content in pss zárate et al 2011 the monosaccharide content of pss was measured using a gas chromatography mass spectrometer agilent 7890b usa and the detailed procedures are provided in the si fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of all extracts were recorded using an ftir spectrometer bruker vertex 70 hyperion 1000 in a scan range of 400 4000 cm 1 at room temperature the absorbance of the samples and background were each measured using 64 scans the size excursion chromatography sec spectrum was carried out using a high pressure liquid chromatography hplc system agilent 1260 infinity ii lc system usa with an sec column pl aquagel oh mixed h 7 5 300 mm 8 µm whose results were shown in fig s1 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy was measured using a luminescence spectrometer f 4500 hitachi and scanning emission spectra were from 300 to 550 nm at 10 nm increments by varying the excitation wavelength from 200 to 400 nm at 10 nm increments excitation and emission slits were maintained at 10 nm and the scanning speed was set at 1200 nm min 1 for all the measurements 2 4 2 bioactivity assays we next assessed the anti inflammatory and anti oxidant activities of the extracted pss in assays samples of pss were dissolved in deionized water to a concentration of 100 mg l for the assays with further dilution performed as necessary a bsa assay was used to assess the anti inflammatory abilities of pss while a hydroxyl radical scavenging assay a reducing power measurement and a phosphomolybdenum assay were used to determine the anti oxidant ability of pss with ascorbic acid vc used as the positive control for bsa assay 50 μl of the sample solution was added to 0 45 ml of bas 5 then the mixture was incubated at 70 c for 30 min 2 5 ml phosphate buffer solution ph 6 3 was added into each test tube and the absorbance of each sample was recorded at 660 nm using a spectrophotometer for hydroxyl radical scavenging assay 0 5 ml of sample solution was mixed with 0 5 ml of feso4 9 mm 0 5 ml h2o2 and 0 5 ml of salicylic acid solution 9 mm after 10 min the optical density of the mixture was recorded at 510 nm for the reducing power the mixture of 0 2 ml of sample solution 0 5 ml of pbs ph 6 6 and 0 2 ml of potassium ferricyanide solution 1 w v was incubated at 50 c for 20 min then 0 5 ml of trichloroacetic acid solution 10 w v 1 4 ml distilled water and 0 28 ml of fecl3 0 1 w v were added after 10 min the absorbance was recorded at 700 nm for phosphomolybdenum assay 0 1 ml of sample solution was mixed with 1 ml phosphomolybdenum reagent 0 6 m sulphuric acid 28 mm sodium phosphate and 4 mm ammonium molybdate then the mixture was heated at 95 c for 90 min and its absorbance was measured at 695 nm these assays are detailed in our previous study liu et al 2021b the inhibition ratio for the bsa assay was calculated using eq 3 as follows 3 inhibition ratio absorbance of control absorbance of treated absorbance of blank sample absorbance of control 100 where the absorbance was recorded at 660 nm against blank using spectrophotometer shimadzu fig s2 shows the results of 3d eem and there were no peaks in the typical region ex em 380 540 250 400 for humic acid like substances chen et al 2003 which means that results of bioactivities would not be influenced by the color of humic acid like substances also the missing of obvious peaks in the region of ex em 280 380 250 330 chen et al 2003 indicated low protein content in the extracted pss in other regions almost no peak was shown in the 3d eem spectrum since the ps has no fluorescent signal xu et al 2022 there results were consistent with the component measurements as the results showed that the bioactivities of the pss were dosage dependent which means that effect of pss is dependent on its dosage usually positive relationship hereinafter the bioactivity of pss is represented by the slope of a linear regression of dosage vs bioactivity the results of anti oxidant assay tests are expressed in the unit of vc equivalents 2 4 3 correlations between ps bioactivities and components the pearson correlations between ps bioactivities and components and the significance levels p values of these correlations were calculated using spss standard version 7 5 norman h nie dale h bent c hadlai hull chicago raw data are given in table s2 the components of ps were nine monosaccharides together with protein sulfate and other impurities and these were compared with the results from assays of their four bioactivities i e anti inflammatory and three anti oxidant activities the components are expressed as percentages while the bioactivities are expressed as equivalents 2 5 environmental impacts assessment of coupled and non coupled scenarios the life cycle assessment boundary of methane recovery and ps production is depicted in fig 2 this boundary integrates the laboratory scale data and the corresponding practical operational data of the upstream raw material acquisition its transportation and downstream residual and digestate treatment the functional unit was set as the treatment of 1 l of was six environmental indicators were examined in the life cycle assessment global warming potential gwp fine particulate matter formation potential fpfp terrestrial acidification potential tap freshwater eutrophication potential fep marine eutrophication potential mep and human carcinogenic potential hcp the details of life cycle impact lci formation and the life cycle impact assessment lcia results with uncertainties are summarized in table s3 the separated ad and ps production processes were set as a baseline scenario fig 1 with which the optimal coupled ad and ps production process were compared to assess environmental impacts other three sources of pss were selected based on laboratory scale production and the following two criteria 1 the ps content of the source was less than 70 and 2 the bioactivities of the pss that can be obtained from the source were close to that of the pss obtained from the coupled ad and ps production process the three alternative sources of pss were opuntia macrorhiza western pricklypear fruit peels a1 red seaweed a2 and auriculariales a3 amamou et al 2020 su and li 2020 yu et al 2021 the material and energy inputs of the alternative ps production processes were determined based on the extraction processes described in the literatures the life cycle of ps production from the alternative sources consists of raw material acquisition transportation ps extraction and residual handling see the assumptions in the si however for the coupled process in this study only ps extraction and residual handling were required ad and digestate handling were included in the life cycle of the optimal coupled ad and ps production process and the separate ad process in order to recover methane a detailed inventory of the alternative sources is listed in table s4 the software used for lca analysis here was simapro 9 0 educational version zhou et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of methane production and ps yield fig 3 a depicts the methane production in the three coupled scenarios the methane production rate was relatively slow at the beginning of the experiment delays in methane production were also observed in previous studies and might result from suboptimal solid contents or inoculation ratios indren et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 liu et al 2016 the methane production rate increased substantially after 10 days and remained stable after day 22 in all three scenarios the final methane production was 76 03 2 01 ml g vs for s1 and s3 and 58 14 0 99 ml g vs for s2 showing that methane production increased by 30 7 when pss were extracted before ad methane production via ad varies widely due to the varying properties of inoculum and substrate ranging from 35 5 to 130 0 ml g vs ferrer et al 2008 wang and li 2016 in the current study the greater methane production in s1 and s3 than in s2 was probably due to cell lysis in s1 and s3 caused by treatment of the sludge with naoh solution during ps extraction therefore more economic benefits were attained in s1 and s3 as they had higher methane production indeed many studies have used alkaline substances typically naoh to destroy sludge flocs and thereby enhance methane production he et al 2021 liu et al 2018 romero güiza et al 2021 the alkaline pretreatment can greatly accelerate the solubilization hydrolysis of was by disrupting sludge cells and eps and leading to the leakage of intracellular material kim et al 2003 it is relatively simple and with low energy consumption based on specific conditions the reagents could be naoh koh mg oh 2 or ca oh 2 the methane production improvements ranged a lot due to the alkaline dosage for example li et al 2012 investigated the effect of naoh concentrations in was on methane production they found that the optimum naoh dose was 0 1 mol l and the biogas yield was 0 24 l gvs while the biogas production was only 0 15 l gvs if naoh dose was increased to 0 5 mol l li et al 2012 however the methane production of our study was quite low there are several possible reasons first the saline was contains very high na concentration chen et al 2008 which is thought to be one inhibitor for ad the bio methane production values by the bmp tests here were similar to those reported by our previous studies less than 100 ml g vs biswal et al 2020 liu et al 2021 besides highly complex polymers are of low biodegradability this could also explain why ps yield of s1 was almost the same as that of s2 in terms of methane content the results of different researchers were contradictory lin et al 1997 found that methane concentration was improved from 72 to 85 by decreasing the naoh dose but zhang et al 2015 observed that methane content was not significantly affected by alkaline pretreatment in this study alkaline method was chosen so it is still unclear what the effects of other pretreatment extraction methods on methane production and ps properties therefore it is quite interesting to investigate the effects of other extraction methods on the ps property and biogas production ps yields from natural sources depend on the source for example extracted pss can comprise as much as 55 of the dry weight of a seaweed sargassum binderi or as little as 2 54 of the dry weight of a halophyte e g artemisia capillaris mzoughi and majdoub 2021 qiu et al 2022 yu et al 2021 the ps yield in s1 was 6 3 0 09 of vs w w while the yield in s2 was 5 67 0 18 of vs w w fig 3b s3 involved two extractions and afforded an overall yield of 11 54 0 62 of vs w w which was almost the sum of the yields in s1 and s2 3 2 component analysis of pss the ftir spectra of pss extracts obtained in the three scenarios have very similar profiles fig 4 a indicating that these extracts contained the same chemical groups the broad bands at 3250 cm 1 indicate o h stretching of hydroxyl groups oh and the peaks at 2332 cm 1 represent co stretching wang et al 2017a the bands at 1486 cm 1 are attributable to the vibration of a carboxylic acid colthup 2012 while the peaks at 1260 cm 1 930 cm 1 and 775 cm 1 may indicate structures containing coso3 3 6 anhydro d galactose and ch respectively gómez ordóñez and rupérez 2011 all of these groups are characteristic features of polysaccharides fig 4b describes the compositions of the ps extracts obtained from the three scenarios the main components of all ps extracts were carbohydrate 71 84 protein 1 4 10 5 and other substances 18 which coincides with the organic composition of sludge ding et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 in other studies the carbohydrate content of pss has ranged from 21 to 93 hromádková et al 2013 lu et al 2008 sun et al 2010 however there were some small variations in the compositions of the ps extracts from the three scenarios the s1 extract extracted from sludge before ad had the lowest carbohydrate content 78 81 1 23 while that of the s2 extract extracted from sludge after ad was slightly higher 79 82 4 91 this might have been because certain polymers that compose the cell wall e g fucoidan are difficult to degrade due to their highly branched and sulfated structures sichert et al 2020 in these cases protein would be degraded prior to carbohydrate in ad which accounts for the higher carbohydrate content in the s2 extract than in the s1 extract sulfate content is a key parameter for the identification of pss because it is significantly related to pss bioactivities jiao et al 2011 nishino et al 1989 witvrouw and de clercq 1997 the sulfate contents of extracts are shown in fig 4c which reveals that this parameter was clearly affected by ad pss extracted from s1 had the highest sulfate content 13 15 0 06 which was almost four times that of s2 2 60 0 04 as the sulfate content indicates the proportion of sulfate groups covalently bonded to a carbon chain it is primarily affected by desulfation via cleavage of sulfate groups from the carbon chain this can occur due to a microorganism secreted arylsulfatase hydrolyzing sulfate esters of pss to inorganic sulfate wang et al 2016 which sulfate reducing bacteria can further transform to sulfide therefore ad can be applied to produce pss with different sulfate contents and the pss with a relatively low sulfate content s2 could potentially be re sulfated to produce novel high value pss with enhanced bioactivities fig 4d shows the monosaccharide components and proportions of the extracted pss monosaccharides are the basic unit of pss and thus the type of monosaccharide in a ps gives information on what type of ps it is liu et al 2021a the extracted samples in this study were hetero pss as they contained multiple in this case nine types of monosaccharides the molar percentages of these nine monosaccharides in the pss were determined and their proportions in the pss varied significantly the two most prevalent monosaccharides were rhamnose 31 56 63 04 and glucose 21 56 34 61 and thus these are likely to form the carbon framework of the pss glucose is the most wildly distributed monosaccharide colthup 2012 while many polysaccharides or lipopolysaccharides on the cell surface of bacteria or plants consist of rhamnose hauser and karnovsky 1958 other monosaccharides such as mannose xylose and fucose were present in relatively small proportions and thus may have formed the branched chains after ad the glucose proportion decreased but the rhamnose proportion increased these results demonstrate that digestion could change the structural compositions of pss indicating that ad favored the degradation of glucose and the production of rhamnose this might be due to the enzymes involved in metabolism that is glucose is a fundamental substrate in the metabolism of most microorganisms and is degraded faster than it is produced and in vitro experiments have shown that certain enzymes can degrade glucose of ps more easily than other saccharides luo et al 2021 wu et al 2021 in contrast it appeared that rhamnose was produced faster than it was degraded possibly due to a low activity of catabolism that can degrade rhamnose of ps but more evidence should be found at the micro level especially the existence and activity of enzymes like glucose 1 phosphate thymidylyltransferase rm1a for the synthesis of rhamnose giraud and naismith 2000 thus a key step for future studies is to sequence the genome of the microbial community in an ad system to determine monosaccharide metabolism 3 3 bioactivity assays of pss as mentioned we measured the anti inflammatory and anti oxidant abilities of the three ps extracts to validate their potential applications in pharmacy the results of the bsa assay are shown in fig 5 a extracts from all three scenarios had a certain level of anti inflammatory activity which was positively related to the concentration of pss effectiveness s1 s3 s2 the pss extracted from s1 had the best anti inflammatory activity 63 16 3 44 which was approximately 10 3 higher than that of the pss extracted from s2 and s3 these findings suggest that ad modifies the ps structure such that its anti inflammatory activities are reduced all the ps extracts showed a degree of anti oxidant activity in the three assays indicating that pss generated in the different scenarios may aid human health the hydroxyl radical is produced by a fenton reaction and is a strong oxidant the test results in fig 5b show that ad increased the hydroxyl radical scavenging effects of pss the slopes of lines s1 s3 are 0 106 0 160 and 0 124 respectively so the order of anti oxidant effectiveness of extracts from the three scenarios is s2 s3 s1 anti oxidants can donate electrons to quench free radicals and a high reducing power anti oxidant has high anti oxidation activity in the reducing power measurement potassium ferricyanide is reduced by anti oxidants and then reacts with ferric chloride to form prussian blue ii iii benzie and strain 1996 this can transform free aldehyde or carbonyl groups into reductive hemiacetal hydroxyls during ps formation from monosaccharides thereby generating the reducing power of pss el khadem 1988 fig 5c describes that the ps extract from s1 showed the highest reducing power while the ps extracts from s2 and s3 had almost the same lesser effect thus reducing power was decreased after ad the phosphomolybdenum assay involves the use of oxidative substances to reduce molybdenum ⅵ to molybdenum ⅴ thereby generating a color change hifney et al 2016 prieto et al 1999 in the phosphomolybdenum assay fig 5d the extract of s2 performed better than that of s1 these results suggest that ad can inhibit the reduction of ferric ions by pss and preserve their ability to reduce molybdenum ⅵ the differences in anti oxidant tests may derive from the structure variance and the anti oxidant effects are the result of several factors working together for each assay the dominant factor could be different typical structure information includes molecular weight mw carbonyl bond monosaccharide composition uronic acid and substituent type and number take mw as an example relatively low mw pss may have better anti oxidant effects because they have more reducing ends which is also observed in other literatures sun et al 2009 zhao et al 2004 the ad transformed the high mw pss into low mw pss in this study see fig s1 and the hydroxyl radical scavenging effect is mainly influenced by mw therefore s2 sample containing more low mw fragments had better ability to scavenge hydroxyl radicals the discussion about monosaccharide and sulfate was provided in section 3 4 more technologies like x ray crystallography xrd nuclear magnetic resonance nmr should be used to elaborate the structure of ps so that we can better understand the relationship between structure and bioactivity the coefficients of determination of extracts were larger than 0 99 suggesting that there was a very strong linear relationship between ps dosage and bioactive effectiveness the equivalent values of pss varied considerably due to different sources reducing power 0 052 0 420 mgvc mgpss and hydroxyl scavenging ability 0 062 1 140 mgvc mgpss see table s5 we also found that pss from sludge were anti oxidants reducing power 0 10 0 11 mgvc mgpss hydroxyl radical scavenging assay 0 11 0 16 mgvc mgpss in table s6 pss with better bioactivities may be able to be improved by chemical modification of these pss pawar 2017 therefore extracting bioactive pss from sludge warrants future exploration as was is much easier to obtain and less expensive than bioactive pss from other sources such as seaweeds 3 4 correlation between ps components and bioactivities the correlation between the components i e sulfates monosaccharides and protein and the bioactivity of pss is shown in fig 6 in general compared with pss not containing sulfate pss containing sulfate have greater bioactivity due to sulfate s effect on the charge density solubility and conformation of pss xie et al 2020 in the current study the results of the bsa assay hydroxyl radical scavenging assay and reducing power assay were positively related to pss sulfate content however the correlation coefficient of sulfate content to anti oxidant activity measured by the phosphomolybdenum assay was negative as has been reported in other studies kolender and matulewicz 2004 shao et al 2014 indicating that other parameters like molecular weight and uronic acid content may be more important for bioactivity than sulfate content the relationships between ps monosaccharide composition and bioactivities remain unclear whereas statistical methods can be applied to identify correlations between these two factors wang et al 2017b here we discuss the monosaccharides whose percentages positively influenced ps bioactivities with high significance p 0 05 the rhamnose and xylose content of pss played key roles in their activity in the reducing power assay whereas their galactose content was related to their anti oxidant activity in the phosphomolybdenum assay the arabinose content was critical to the anti inflammatory activity in the bsa assay studies have reported that pss containing high ratios of certain monosaccharides showed better performance in bioactivity assays than pss with lower ratios of these monosaccharides for example the bioactivities of mushroom pss have been found to be highly affected by their rhamnose or mannose content chen et al 2011 kim et al 2006 ma et al 2015 xiang et al 2012 in the current study the key monosaccharides required for ps bioactivities were rhamnose xylose galactose and arabinose protein is usually considered as an impurity in ps extracts and thus its correlation with ps bioactivity should be negative but it was found that the protein content contributed 94 1 of the ps extracts hydroxyl free radical scavenging ability this was consistent with the fact that some studies have shown that the presence of protein in ps extracts can increase these extracts anti oxidative performance bleakley and hayes 2017 martínez sanz et al 2019 thus a deproteination step could be excluded from processes targeting the production of pss with high hydroxyl radical scavenging ability 3 5 environmental impacts of the coupled and non coupled processes the two products generated were pss and methane in combined process for was treatment despite the high ps and methane recovery from s3 its double extraction process means it had higher environmental and economic burdens than s1 and s2 thus we investigated which coupled process resulted in the minimum environmental and economic impacts and generated the most recovered benefits then the joint indicators of value added by the recovered products and the life cycle environmental impacts of the process were calculated to select the optimal process joint environmental and cost impact is an effective indicator to use to select a process with the lowest environmental and cost burdens based on the lcia the gwp of s1 s2 and s3 were 5 14 5 25 and 10 3 kg co2e for the coupled ad and ps extraction of 1l was furthermore a monte carlo stochastic uncertainty analysis showed that the uncertainties of the results of the three scenarios were 11 1 11 0 and 4 51 respectively other environmental indicators revealed the same trends as shown by the gwp s1 had the least impact table s7 a preliminary cost analysis demonstrated that the overall costs of s2 accounting for added values of pss and methane were the lowest of all of the scenarios at 3 57 usd l was for was treatment table s8 this cost could be greatly decreased if economies of scale and industrialization are achieved in the future daly and farley 2011 for example the estimated unit cost would be 0 057 usd l was if the sludge treatment capacity is 10 000 times that of laboratory scale haldi and whitcomb 1967 the integrated environmental and cost impacts table 2 indicate that s1 and s2 had the same values in mep but for the other indicators s1 was better than s2 s3 had higher yield of pss and methane production than s1 and s2 but this could not offset the environmental burdens of s3 therefore s1 had the minimum environmental and cost impacts to this end a comparative lcia was conducted to manifest the environmental impacts of s1 and three baseline alternatives non coupled process the three pss shown in table s9 were chosen as reference materials as their purity and bioactivity were close to those of the extracts we studied see table s9 fig 7 shows the rank of the life cycle environmental impacts in different environmental indicators s1 had the second best performance in gwp and the best performance in the other five indicators these results were reasonable as s1 used nearly no cost sludge while other raw materials were more costly amamou et al 2020 in particular the treatment of 1l was in s1 produced 0 365 g of pss and the corresponding gwp was 0 44 kg co2e for ps extraction ad and digestate handling the gwps of a1 a2 and a3 to produce the equal amount of pss in s1 were 19 75 0 2577 and 35 27 kg co2e respectively the life cycle environmental impacts of coupled ad and ps extraction during was treatment were the lowest because was is a consistent and stable source of pss thus the coupled process has the potential to achieve a circular economy in the wastewater sector rodriguez 2020 table 3 summarizes the attributions of life cycle environmental impacts ps production dominated the environmental impacts in all scenarios s1 had the highest impact contribution from the ps production process and relatively lower impact contributions from ad and waste handling transportation and waste handling accounted for 9 5 and 4 5 of life cycle gwp respectively in a2 implying that compared with the extraction of ps unready raw material the extraction of pss from ready raw material has higher environmental impacts because of its downstream and upstream treatments the contributions of main chemicals and electricity consumption towards six environmental indicators are shown in fig s3 the total contribution of 1 butanol and chloroform can be up to 76 9 in hct among which chloroform was the dominant factor since the mixture of 1 butanol and chloroform is used to remove proteins optimization for deproteinization is highly recommended for further study 4 implication in this study we demonstrated the feasibility of coupling ad and ps extraction for was treatment although the lca analysis showed that our scenario brought less environmental burdens compared with pss from non sludge sources some uncertainties still remain in practical applications the main challenges come from larger scale operation in ps extraction quality control and marketable prospects of the ps products in terms of ps acquisition in a real plant simple chemical extraction like the alkaline method in this study is highly recommended which is also a typical pss extraction approach from seaweed in industries as for quality control of extracted ps this issue depends on its final application the bioactivity test reveals the potential uses in biological aspect but sequent toxicology experiments are necessary if we want to utilize the sludge ps in animal or human interface crude ps is advised to use in material fabrication like anti bacterial membrane without high structural completion further purification of crude ps and structural information from microscopic level such as substituents and glycosidic bond are essential if immunological or anti coagulant applications in vivo are considered there have been some investigations about biopolymer recoveries from sludge and the recovery of alginate like exopolysaccharides ale from aerobic granular sludge gives a very excellent demonstration lin et al 2010 2013 zahra et al 2022 we think the way we proposed is a good complement and helps to simultaneously recover more than one valuable resource in wwtp ale with a relatively high yield 15 25 may be employed as coating material or biosorbents for dyes and phosphate while the applications of pss we extracted in this study more focus on biological uses to conclude the resource recovery from sludge should be context specific according to the features of different sludges considering the balance between the cost and benefit more purification steps lead to higher extraction cost so crude ps is preferable for applications with relatively low economic benefits while pure ps can be applied in pharmaceutic industry with invaluable market demand another interesting issue is the existence of protein due to the limitation of extraction method the protein cannot be removed totally and the correlation analysis also shows that protein could have bioactivity protein is another important component of organics in sludge so recovering bioactive protein from sludge is also very attractive 5 conclusions this study evaluated the feasibility of simultaneous recovery of methane and pss from was and three strategies for coupling ad and pss recovery were comprehensively evaluated the results showed that pss extraction before ad could increase methane production by 37 1 the sulfate content in the extracted pss before ad was 13 15 while this value in the extracts after ad decreased to 2 60 the main monosaccharides of the pss were glucose 21 56 34 61 and rhamnose 21 56 34 61 ad decreased pss anti inflammatory activity and reducing power but enhanced their ability to reduce molybdenum ⅵ and scavenge hydroxyl radicals the correlation analysis indicated that sulfate content protein content and monosaccharides i e rhamnose and xylose of pss were closely related to their bioactivities the recovery of pss before ad was the best coupling strategy for was treatment among the three scenarios in terms of environmental effects such a scenario also ranked first in five environmental indicators compared with non coupled processes this work provides meaningful results

15016,bioactive polysaccharides pss are valuable resources that can be extracted from waste activated sludge was the ps extraction process causes cell lysis that may enhance hydrolytic processes during anaerobic digestion ad and thus increase the methane production thus coupling pss and methane recovery from was could be an efficient and sustainable sludge treatment in present study we comprehensively evaluated this novel process from the efficiencies of different coupling strategies properties of the extracted pss and environmental impacts the results showed that when the ps extraction was before ad it produced 76 03 2 00 ml of methane per gram of volatile solids vs and afforded a ps yield of 6 3 0 09 w w with a ps sulfate content of 13 15 0 06 in contrast when ps extraction was after ad the methane production decreased to 58 14 0 99 ml of methane per gram of vs and afforded a ps yield of 5 67 0 18 w w in vs with a ps sulfate content of 2 60 0 04 when there were two ps extractions before and after ad the methane production ps yield and sulfate content were 76 03 2 00 ml of methane per gram of vs 11 54 0 62 and 8 35 0 12 respectively then the bioactivity of the extracted pss was assessed by one anti inflammation assay and three anti oxidation assays and statistical analysis revealed that these four bioactivities of pss were influenced by their sulfate content protein content and monosaccharide composition especially the ratios of arabinose and rhamnose furthermore the environmental impact analysis shows that s1 was the best in five environmental indicators compared with other three non coupled processes these findings suggest that the coupling pss and methane recovery process should be further explored to determine its potential for large

terrestrial acidification potential ts total solids vc ascorbic acid vs volatile solids was waste activated sludge wwtp wastewater treatment plant data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rising energy demand and resource scarcity have prompted the development of resource oriented wastewater treatment plants wwtps which recover resources such as water nutrients energy heavy metals alkalis acids bioelectricity and biofuels from wastewater or waste activated sludge was meena et al 2019 however traditional recovery approaches are energy inefficient and expensive and there is low market acceptance of recovered resources from wwtps ghaffar et al 2020 mito et al 2019 for example biofuel can only be recovered from was after it has been dewatered or carbonized which is extremely expensive xu and lancaster 2009 in addition although the cost of disposing of huge quantities of was can be alleviated by converting was to building materials via a simple and inexpensive process this does not recover its valuable organic substances tyagi and lo 2013 hence there is a need for methods to recover high value products from was as this will ensure that their economic benefits outweigh the recovery cost and there is sufficient demand for their marketization in recent years bioactive polysaccharides pss have been recognized as high value resources present in was which means that their recovery is likely to be economically viable in practical applications lin et al 2015 pss are natural polymers that play a critical role in biological metabolism and have many beneficial bioactivities like anti oxidative anti tumor anti coagulative anti bacterial anti viral and anti diabetic activities alkahtani et al 2020 chen et al 2019 gómez ordóñez et al 2014 pss with anti oxidative activities remove or prevent the generation of excess concentrations of reactive oxygen species e g oxygen radicals that can damage biomolecules e g dna these pss achieve this property by directly or indirectly quenching reactive oxygen species or their precursors through several mechanisms such as by increasing the activity of superoxide dismutase and have few side effects zhang et al 2011 hence pss have been widely explored for applications in anti bacterial materials health foods and drugs most studies of pss in wastewater have examined their effect on effluent quality but ignored their biological activities such that most pss are currently not efficiently recovered from sludge we recently demonstrated that bioactive pss are present in saline wastewater xue et al 2019 but it remains unclear how to effectively integrate ps recovery into current sludge treatment in addition it is a must to consider the upstream or downstream effects of any recovery technology so that we can achieve better environmental and economic benefits after ps extraction there is still large amounts of residual left which can cause possible environmental burdens anaerobic digestion ad is widely used for sludge treatment as it is a low cost method for the recovery of material and biogas hereinafter methane li et al 2019 verstraete et al 2005 xu et al 2020 it has been estimated that there are more than 1300 anaerobic digesters based on sewage sludge globally which demonstrates the broad applicability of ad hanum et al 2019 and ad technology cannot remove all organics of sludge which leaves space for ps recovery single resource recovery may not satisfy human s increasing needs and a collaborative network focusing on the recovery of more than resources has attracted people s attention van leeuwen et al 2018 as such the integration of ad with ps recovery would constitute a circular economy system for sludge treatment however there has been limited exploration of sludge treatment processes that combine methane and ps recovery from ad based biotechnology thus this study investigated the feasibility of coupling ad with ps extraction processes for sludge treatment in the following three aspects first we explored three scenarios that coupled ad based methane recovery with ps recovery from sludge and then compared the methane productions and ps yields second the compositions and bioactivities of recovered pss in each scenario were analyzed and the key factors affecting ps bioactivities were determined finally we determined and compared the effects on the environment of two processes to illustrate the potential utility of such coupled approaches one is that methane was recovered from sludge and pss were extracted from non sludge sources the other is coupling of methane and ps extraction from sludge 2 material and methods 2 1 sludge sources and characteristics the substrate and inoculum were was from secondary tank and ad sludge both of which were obtained from the shatin wwtp in hong kong the qualities of the influent and effluent of this wwtp are listed in table s1 in the supplementary information si some basic parameters of these two sludges are shown in table 1 2 2 the design of coupled and non coupled scenarios three scenarios s1 s2 and s3 were designed to evaluate how effectively ad coupled with ps recovery in sludge treatment as shown in fig 1 in s1 pss were directly extracted from the was and the residue was mixed with inoculum and then used in ad in s2 was was mixed with inoculum and used in ad and then pss were extracted from the resulting digestate in s3 pss were extracted from was before and after ad and then combined 2 3 general methods 2 3 1 biochemical methane potential batch tests to minimize possible ps degradation and its effects on experiments was and ad sludge obtained from the wwtp were immediately placed in a fridge at 4 c and were subsequently used within 1 week in experiments substrate 100 ml and inoculum 300 ml were mixed and transferred into 500 ml reaction bottles nitrogen gas was sparged into each bottle for 10 min to exclude oxygen and the bottles were then immediately capped with a rubber stopper and connected to an automatic methane potential test system bioprocess control sweden which thus comprised the reaction bottles gas washing bottles and a gas measurement device each gas washing bottle was filled with 4 m sodium hydroxide naoh for removing carbon dioxide co2 during ad the gas measurement device was used to automatically detect methane production all the reaction bottles were placed in a water bath 37 5 1 c to maintain a stable temperature batch testing was then performed and was stopped when no more methane was produced in a reaction bottle the bmp analysis was carried out in triplicate 2 3 2 ps extraction the ps extraction process was based on a modified alkaline extraction of fungal cell walls farkaš 2003 the sludge from each scenario was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 20 min the supernatant was discarded and the solids were treated with naoh solution 0 25 m the resulting solution was stirred at 300 rpm at room temperature for 2 h subsequently the ph of the mixture was adjusted to 7 0 2 with 4 m hydrochloric acid and then centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 20 min the supernatant was mixed with ethanol in a ratio of 1 4 v v and the resulting mixture was placed in a freezer at 36 c overnight the resulting precipitate was collected and then placed into a dialysis bag with a molecular weight cutoff of 8000 da dialysis was then performed for 2 days with the water 500 ml replaced every 2 h this afforded a liquid which was mixed with sevag solution chloroform 1 butanol 4 1 v v in a ratio of 1 1 v v to remove protein this step was finished by separating the phases in a separating funnel and the deproteinization operation was repeated a further two times finally pss were obtained after 1 week of freeze drying the combined aqueous extracts 2 4 properties of extracted pss 2 4 1 yield and component analysis the ps recovery ratio was calculated using eqs 1 and 2 as follows 1 yield p s recovered w biomass 100 2 w biomass vs volume where p s recovered is the weight of ps on a dry basis g wbiomass is the biomass weight g and the units of vs and volume are g l and l respectively the carbohydrate content of pss was measured using the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as the reference material nielsen 2017 while the protein content of pss was measured using the coomassie brilliant blue method with bovine serum albumin bsa as the reference material spector 1978 a barium sulfate turbidimetric method was used to determine sulfate content in pss zárate et al 2011 the monosaccharide content of pss was measured using a gas chromatography mass spectrometer agilent 7890b usa and the detailed procedures are provided in the si fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of all extracts were recorded using an ftir spectrometer bruker vertex 70 hyperion 1000 in a scan range of 400 4000 cm 1 at room temperature the absorbance of the samples and background were each measured using 64 scans the size excursion chromatography sec spectrum was carried out using a high pressure liquid chromatography hplc system agilent 1260 infinity ii lc system usa with an sec column pl aquagel oh mixed h 7 5 300 mm 8 µm whose results were shown in fig s1 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy was measured using a luminescence spectrometer f 4500 hitachi and scanning emission spectra were from 300 to 550 nm at 10 nm increments by varying the excitation wavelength from 200 to 400 nm at 10 nm increments excitation and emission slits were maintained at 10 nm and the scanning speed was set at 1200 nm min 1 for all the measurements 2 4 2 bioactivity assays we next assessed the anti inflammatory and anti oxidant activities of the extracted pss in assays samples of pss were dissolved in deionized water to a concentration of 100 mg l for the assays with further dilution performed as necessary a bsa assay was used to assess the anti inflammatory abilities of pss while a hydroxyl radical scavenging assay a reducing power measurement and a phosphomolybdenum assay were used to determine the anti oxidant ability of pss with ascorbic acid vc used as the positive control for bsa assay 50 μl of the sample solution was added to 0 45 ml of bas 5 then the mixture was incubated at 70 c for 30 min 2 5 ml phosphate buffer solution ph 6 3 was added into each test tube and the absorbance of each sample was recorded at 660 nm using a spectrophotometer for hydroxyl radical scavenging assay 0 5 ml of sample solution was mixed with 0 5 ml of feso4 9 mm 0 5 ml h2o2 and 0 5 ml of salicylic acid solution 9 mm after 10 min the optical density of the mixture was recorded at 510 nm for the reducing power the mixture of 0 2 ml of sample solution 0 5 ml of pbs ph 6 6 and 0 2 ml of potassium ferricyanide solution 1 w v was incubated at 50 c for 20 min then 0 5 ml of trichloroacetic acid solution 10 w v 1 4 ml distilled water and 0 28 ml of fecl3 0 1 w v were added after 10 min the absorbance was recorded at 700 nm for phosphomolybdenum assay 0 1 ml of sample solution was mixed with 1 ml phosphomolybdenum reagent 0 6 m sulphuric acid 28 mm sodium phosphate and 4 mm ammonium molybdate then the mixture was heated at 95 c for 90 min and its absorbance was measured at 695 nm these assays are detailed in our previous study liu et al 2021b the inhibition ratio for the bsa assay was calculated using eq 3 as follows 3 inhibition ratio absorbance of control absorbance of treated absorbance of blank sample absorbance of control 100 where the absorbance was recorded at 660 nm against blank using spectrophotometer shimadzu fig s2 shows the results of 3d eem and there were no peaks in the typical region ex em 380 540 250 400 for humic acid like substances chen et al 2003 which means that results of bioactivities would not be influenced by the color of humic acid like substances also the missing of obvious peaks in the region of ex em 280 380 250 330 chen et al 2003 indicated low protein content in the extracted pss in other regions almost no peak was shown in the 3d eem spectrum since the ps has no fluorescent signal xu et al 2022 there results were consistent with the component measurements as the results showed that the bioactivities of the pss were dosage dependent which means that effect of pss is dependent on its dosage usually positive relationship hereinafter the bioactivity of pss is represented by the slope of a linear regression of dosage vs bioactivity the results of anti oxidant assay tests are expressed in the unit of vc equivalents 2 4 3 correlations between ps bioactivities and components the pearson correlations between ps bioactivities and components and the significance levels p values of these correlations were calculated using spss standard version 7 5 norman h nie dale h bent c hadlai hull chicago raw data are given in table s2 the components of ps were nine monosaccharides together with protein sulfate and other impurities and these were compared with the results from assays of their four bioactivities i e anti inflammatory and three anti oxidant activities the components are expressed as percentages while the bioactivities are expressed as equivalents 2 5 environmental impacts assessment of coupled and non coupled scenarios the life cycle assessment boundary of methane recovery and ps production is depicted in fig 2 this boundary integrates the laboratory scale data and the corresponding practical operational data of the upstream raw material acquisition its transportation and downstream residual and digestate treatment the functional unit was set as the treatment of 1 l of was six environmental indicators were examined in the life cycle assessment global warming potential gwp fine particulate matter formation potential fpfp terrestrial acidification potential tap freshwater eutrophication potential fep marine eutrophication potential mep and human carcinogenic potential hcp the details of life cycle impact lci formation and the life cycle impact assessment lcia results with uncertainties are summarized in table s3 the separated ad and ps production processes were set as a baseline scenario fig 1 with which the optimal coupled ad and ps production process were compared to assess environmental impacts other three sources of pss were selected based on laboratory scale production and the following two criteria 1 the ps content of the source was less than 70 and 2 the bioactivities of the pss that can be obtained from the source were close to that of the pss obtained from the coupled ad and ps production process the three alternative sources of pss were opuntia macrorhiza western pricklypear fruit peels a1 red seaweed a2 and auriculariales a3 amamou et al 2020 su and li 2020 yu et al 2021 the material and energy inputs of the alternative ps production processes were determined based on the extraction processes described in the literatures the life cycle of ps production from the alternative sources consists of raw material acquisition transportation ps extraction and residual handling see the assumptions in the si however for the coupled process in this study only ps extraction and residual handling were required ad and digestate handling were included in the life cycle of the optimal coupled ad and ps production process and the separate ad process in order to recover methane a detailed inventory of the alternative sources is listed in table s4 the software used for lca analysis here was simapro 9 0 educational version zhou et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of methane production and ps yield fig 3 a depicts the methane production in the three coupled scenarios the methane production rate was relatively slow at the beginning of the experiment delays in methane production were also observed in previous studies and might result from suboptimal solid contents or inoculation ratios indren et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 liu et al 2016 the methane production rate increased substantially after 10 days and remained stable after day 22 in all three scenarios the final methane production was 76 03 2 01 ml g vs for s1 and s3 and 58 14 0 99 ml g vs for s2 showing that methane production increased by 30 7 when pss were extracted before ad methane production via ad varies widely due to the varying properties of inoculum and substrate ranging from 35 5 to 130 0 ml g vs ferrer et al 2008 wang and li 2016 in the current study the greater methane production in s1 and s3 than in s2 was probably due to cell lysis in s1 and s3 caused by treatment of the sludge with naoh solution during ps extraction therefore more economic benefits were attained in s1 and s3 as they had higher methane production indeed many studies have used alkaline substances typically naoh to destroy sludge flocs and thereby enhance methane production he et al 2021 liu et al 2018 romero güiza et al 2021 the alkaline pretreatment can greatly accelerate the solubilization hydrolysis of was by disrupting sludge cells and eps and leading to the leakage of intracellular material kim et al 2003 it is relatively simple and with low energy consumption based on specific conditions the reagents could be naoh koh mg oh 2 or ca oh 2 the methane production improvements ranged a lot due to the alkaline dosage for example li et al 2012 investigated the effect of naoh concentrations in was on methane production they found that the optimum naoh dose was 0 1 mol l and the biogas yield was 0 24 l gvs while the biogas production was only 0 15 l gvs if naoh dose was increased to 0 5 mol l li et al 2012 however the methane production of our study was quite low there are several possible reasons first the saline was contains very high na concentration chen et al 2008 which is thought to be one inhibitor for ad the bio methane production values by the bmp tests here were similar to those reported by our previous studies less than 100 ml g vs biswal et al 2020 liu et al 2021 besides highly complex polymers are of low biodegradability this could also explain why ps yield of s1 was almost the same as that of s2 in terms of methane content the results of different researchers were contradictory lin et al 1997 found that methane concentration was improved from 72 to 85 by decreasing the naoh dose but zhang et al 2015 observed that methane content was not significantly affected by alkaline pretreatment in this study alkaline method was chosen so it is still unclear what the effects of other pretreatment extraction methods on methane production and ps properties therefore it is quite interesting to investigate the effects of other extraction methods on the ps property and biogas production ps yields from natural sources depend on the source for example extracted pss can comprise as much as 55 of the dry weight of a seaweed sargassum binderi or as little as 2 54 of the dry weight of a halophyte e g artemisia capillaris mzoughi and majdoub 2021 qiu et al 2022 yu et al 2021 the ps yield in s1 was 6 3 0 09 of vs w w while the yield in s2 was 5 67 0 18 of vs w w fig 3b s3 involved two extractions and afforded an overall yield of 11 54 0 62 of vs w w which was almost the sum of the yields in s1 and s2 3 2 component analysis of pss the ftir spectra of pss extracts obtained in the three scenarios have very similar profiles fig 4 a indicating that these extracts contained the same chemical groups the broad bands at 3250 cm 1 indicate o h stretching of hydroxyl groups oh and the peaks at 2332 cm 1 represent co stretching wang et al 2017a the bands at 1486 cm 1 are attributable to the vibration of a carboxylic acid colthup 2012 while the peaks at 1260 cm 1 930 cm 1 and 775 cm 1 may indicate structures containing coso3 3 6 anhydro d galactose and ch respectively gómez ordóñez and rupérez 2011 all of these groups are characteristic features of polysaccharides fig 4b describes the compositions of the ps extracts obtained from the three scenarios the main components of all ps extracts were carbohydrate 71 84 protein 1 4 10 5 and other substances 18 which coincides with the organic composition of sludge ding et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 in other studies the carbohydrate content of pss has ranged from 21 to 93 hromádková et al 2013 lu et al 2008 sun et al 2010 however there were some small variations in the compositions of the ps extracts from the three scenarios the s1 extract extracted from sludge before ad had the lowest carbohydrate content 78 81 1 23 while that of the s2 extract extracted from sludge after ad was slightly higher 79 82 4 91 this might have been because certain polymers that compose the cell wall e g fucoidan are difficult to degrade due to their highly branched and sulfated structures sichert et al 2020 in these cases protein would be degraded prior to carbohydrate in ad which accounts for the higher carbohydrate content in the s2 extract than in the s1 extract sulfate content is a key parameter for the identification of pss because it is significantly related to pss bioactivities jiao et al 2011 nishino et al 1989 witvrouw and de clercq 1997 the sulfate contents of extracts are shown in fig 4c which reveals that this parameter was clearly affected by ad pss extracted from s1 had the highest sulfate content 13 15 0 06 which was almost four times that of s2 2 60 0 04 as the sulfate content indicates the proportion of sulfate groups covalently bonded to a carbon chain it is primarily affected by desulfation via cleavage of sulfate groups from the carbon chain this can occur due to a microorganism secreted arylsulfatase hydrolyzing sulfate esters of pss to inorganic sulfate wang et al 2016 which sulfate reducing bacteria can further transform to sulfide therefore ad can be applied to produce pss with different sulfate contents and the pss with a relatively low sulfate content s2 could potentially be re sulfated to produce novel high value pss with enhanced bioactivities fig 4d shows the monosaccharide components and proportions of the extracted pss monosaccharides are the basic unit of pss and thus the type of monosaccharide in a ps gives information on what type of ps it is liu et al 2021a the extracted samples in this study were hetero pss as they contained multiple in this case nine types of monosaccharides the molar percentages of these nine monosaccharides in the pss were determined and their proportions in the pss varied significantly the two most prevalent monosaccharides were rhamnose 31 56 63 04 and glucose 21 56 34 61 and thus these are likely to form the carbon framework of the pss glucose is the most wildly distributed monosaccharide colthup 2012 while many polysaccharides or lipopolysaccharides on the cell surface of bacteria or plants consist of rhamnose hauser and karnovsky 1958 other monosaccharides such as mannose xylose and fucose were present in relatively small proportions and thus may have formed the branched chains after ad the glucose proportion decreased but the rhamnose proportion increased these results demonstrate that digestion could change the structural compositions of pss indicating that ad favored the degradation of glucose and the production of rhamnose this might be due to the enzymes involved in metabolism that is glucose is a fundamental substrate in the metabolism of most microorganisms and is degraded faster than it is produced and in vitro experiments have shown that certain enzymes can degrade glucose of ps more easily than other saccharides luo et al 2021 wu et al 2021 in contrast it appeared that rhamnose was produced faster than it was degraded possibly due to a low activity of catabolism that can degrade rhamnose of ps but more evidence should be found at the micro level especially the existence and activity of enzymes like glucose 1 phosphate thymidylyltransferase rm1a for the synthesis of rhamnose giraud and naismith 2000 thus a key step for future studies is to sequence the genome of the microbial community in an ad system to determine monosaccharide metabolism 3 3 bioactivity assays of pss as mentioned we measured the anti inflammatory and anti oxidant abilities of the three ps extracts to validate their potential applications in pharmacy the results of the bsa assay are shown in fig 5 a extracts from all three scenarios had a certain level of anti inflammatory activity which was positively related to the concentration of pss effectiveness s1 s3 s2 the pss extracted from s1 had the best anti inflammatory activity 63 16 3 44 which was approximately 10 3 higher than that of the pss extracted from s2 and s3 these findings suggest that ad modifies the ps structure such that its anti inflammatory activities are reduced all the ps extracts showed a degree of anti oxidant activity in the three assays indicating that pss generated in the different scenarios may aid human health the hydroxyl radical is produced by a fenton reaction and is a strong oxidant the test results in fig 5b show that ad increased the hydroxyl radical scavenging effects of pss the slopes of lines s1 s3 are 0 106 0 160 and 0 124 respectively so the order of anti oxidant effectiveness of extracts from the three scenarios is s2 s3 s1 anti oxidants can donate electrons to quench free radicals and a high reducing power anti oxidant has high anti oxidation activity in the reducing power measurement potassium ferricyanide is reduced by anti oxidants and then reacts with ferric chloride to form prussian blue ii iii benzie and strain 1996 this can transform free aldehyde or carbonyl groups into reductive hemiacetal hydroxyls during ps formation from monosaccharides thereby generating the reducing power of pss el khadem 1988 fig 5c describes that the ps extract from s1 showed the highest reducing power while the ps extracts from s2 and s3 had almost the same lesser effect thus reducing power was decreased after ad the phosphomolybdenum assay involves the use of oxidative substances to reduce molybdenum ⅵ to molybdenum ⅴ thereby generating a color change hifney et al 2016 prieto et al 1999 in the phosphomolybdenum assay fig 5d the extract of s2 performed better than that of s1 these results suggest that ad can inhibit the reduction of ferric ions by pss and preserve their ability to reduce molybdenum ⅵ the differences in anti oxidant tests may derive from the structure variance and the anti oxidant effects are the result of several factors working together for each assay the dominant factor could be different typical structure information includes molecular weight mw carbonyl bond monosaccharide composition uronic acid and substituent type and number take mw as an example relatively low mw pss may have better anti oxidant effects because they have more reducing ends which is also observed in other literatures sun et al 2009 zhao et al 2004 the ad transformed the high mw pss into low mw pss in this study see fig s1 and the hydroxyl radical scavenging effect is mainly influenced by mw therefore s2 sample containing more low mw fragments had better ability to scavenge hydroxyl radicals the discussion about monosaccharide and sulfate was provided in section 3 4 more technologies like x ray crystallography xrd nuclear magnetic resonance nmr should be used to elaborate the structure of ps so that we can better understand the relationship between structure and bioactivity the coefficients of determination of extracts were larger than 0 99 suggesting that there was a very strong linear relationship between ps dosage and bioactive effectiveness the equivalent values of pss varied considerably due to different sources reducing power 0 052 0 420 mgvc mgpss and hydroxyl scavenging ability 0 062 1 140 mgvc mgpss see table s5 we also found that pss from sludge were anti oxidants reducing power 0 10 0 11 mgvc mgpss hydroxyl radical scavenging assay 0 11 0 16 mgvc mgpss in table s6 pss with better bioactivities may be able to be improved by chemical modification of these pss pawar 2017 therefore extracting bioactive pss from sludge warrants future exploration as was is much easier to obtain and less expensive than bioactive pss from other sources such as seaweeds 3 4 correlation between ps components and bioactivities the correlation between the components i e sulfates monosaccharides and protein and the bioactivity of pss is shown in fig 6 in general compared with pss not containing sulfate pss containing sulfate have greater bioactivity due to sulfate s effect on the charge density solubility and conformation of pss xie et al 2020 in the current study the results of the bsa assay hydroxyl radical scavenging assay and reducing power assay were positively related to pss sulfate content however the correlation coefficient of sulfate content to anti oxidant activity measured by the phosphomolybdenum assay was negative as has been reported in other studies kolender and matulewicz 2004 shao et al 2014 indicating that other parameters like molecular weight and uronic acid content may be more important for bioactivity than sulfate content the relationships between ps monosaccharide composition and bioactivities remain unclear whereas statistical methods can be applied to identify correlations between these two factors wang et al 2017b here we discuss the monosaccharides whose percentages positively influenced ps bioactivities with high significance p 0 05 the rhamnose and xylose content of pss played key roles in their activity in the reducing power assay whereas their galactose content was related to their anti oxidant activity in the phosphomolybdenum assay the arabinose content was critical to the anti inflammatory activity in the bsa assay studies have reported that pss containing high ratios of certain monosaccharides showed better performance in bioactivity assays than pss with lower ratios of these monosaccharides for example the bioactivities of mushroom pss have been found to be highly affected by their rhamnose or mannose content chen et al 2011 kim et al 2006 ma et al 2015 xiang et al 2012 in the current study the key monosaccharides required for ps bioactivities were rhamnose xylose galactose and arabinose protein is usually considered as an impurity in ps extracts and thus its correlation with ps bioactivity should be negative but it was found that the protein content contributed 94 1 of the ps extracts hydroxyl free radical scavenging ability this was consistent with the fact that some studies have shown that the presence of protein in ps extracts can increase these extracts anti oxidative performance bleakley and hayes 2017 martínez sanz et al 2019 thus a deproteination step could be excluded from processes targeting the production of pss with high hydroxyl radical scavenging ability 3 5 environmental impacts of the coupled and non coupled processes the two products generated were pss and methane in combined process for was treatment despite the high ps and methane recovery from s3 its double extraction process means it had higher environmental and economic burdens than s1 and s2 thus we investigated which coupled process resulted in the minimum environmental and economic impacts and generated the most recovered benefits then the joint indicators of value added by the recovered products and the life cycle environmental impacts of the process were calculated to select the optimal process joint environmental and cost impact is an effective indicator to use to select a process with the lowest environmental and cost burdens based on the lcia the gwp of s1 s2 and s3 were 5 14 5 25 and 10 3 kg co2e for the coupled ad and ps extraction of 1l was furthermore a monte carlo stochastic uncertainty analysis showed that the uncertainties of the results of the three scenarios were 11 1 11 0 and 4 51 respectively other environmental indicators revealed the same trends as shown by the gwp s1 had the least impact table s7 a preliminary cost analysis demonstrated that the overall costs of s2 accounting for added values of pss and methane were the lowest of all of the scenarios at 3 57 usd l was for was treatment table s8 this cost could be greatly decreased if economies of scale and industrialization are achieved in the future daly and farley 2011 for example the estimated unit cost would be 0 057 usd l was if the sludge treatment capacity is 10 000 times that of laboratory scale haldi and whitcomb 1967 the integrated environmental and cost impacts table 2 indicate that s1 and s2 had the same values in mep but for the other indicators s1 was better than s2 s3 had higher yield of pss and methane production than s1 and s2 but this could not offset the environmental burdens of s3 therefore s1 had the minimum environmental and cost impacts to this end a comparative lcia was conducted to manifest the environmental impacts of s1 and three baseline alternatives non coupled process the three pss shown in table s9 were chosen as reference materials as their purity and bioactivity were close to those of the extracts we studied see table s9 fig 7 shows the rank of the life cycle environmental impacts in different environmental indicators s1 had the second best performance in gwp and the best performance in the other five indicators these results were reasonable as s1 used nearly no cost sludge while other raw materials were more costly amamou et al 2020 in particular the treatment of 1l was in s1 produced 0 365 g of pss and the corresponding gwp was 0 44 kg co2e for ps extraction ad and digestate handling the gwps of a1 a2 and a3 to produce the equal amount of pss in s1 were 19 75 0 2577 and 35 27 kg co2e respectively the life cycle environmental impacts of coupled ad and ps extraction during was treatment were the lowest because was is a consistent and stable source of pss thus the coupled process has the potential to achieve a circular economy in the wastewater sector rodriguez 2020 table 3 summarizes the attributions of life cycle environmental impacts ps production dominated the environmental impacts in all scenarios s1 had the highest impact contribution from the ps production process and relatively lower impact contributions from ad and waste handling transportation and waste handling accounted for 9 5 and 4 5 of life cycle gwp respectively in a2 implying that compared with the extraction of ps unready raw material the extraction of pss from ready raw material has higher environmental impacts because of its downstream and upstream treatments the contributions of main chemicals and electricity consumption towards six environmental indicators are shown in fig s3 the total contribution of 1 butanol and chloroform can be up to 76 9 in hct among which chloroform was the dominant factor since the mixture of 1 butanol and chloroform is used to remove proteins optimization for deproteinization is highly recommended for further study 4 implication in this study we demonstrated the feasibility of coupling ad and ps extraction for was treatment although the lca analysis showed that our scenario brought less environmental burdens compared with pss from non sludge sources some uncertainties still remain in practical applications the main challenges come from larger scale operation in ps extraction quality control and marketable prospects of the ps products in terms of ps acquisition in a real plant simple chemical extraction like the alkaline method in this study is highly recommended which is also a typical pss extraction approach from seaweed in industries as for quality control of extracted ps this issue depends on its final application the bioactivity test reveals the potential uses in biological aspect but sequent toxicology experiments are necessary if we want to utilize the sludge ps in animal or human interface crude ps is advised to use in material fabrication like anti bacterial membrane without high structural completion further purification of crude ps and structural information from microscopic level such as substituents and glycosidic bond are essential if immunological or anti coagulant applications in vivo are considered there have been some investigations about biopolymer recoveries from sludge and the recovery of alginate like exopolysaccharides ale from aerobic granular sludge gives a very excellent demonstration lin et al 2010 2013 zahra et al 2022 we think the way we proposed is a good complement and helps to simultaneously recover more than one valuable resource in wwtp ale with a relatively high yield 15 25 may be employed as coating material or biosorbents for dyes and phosphate while the applications of pss we extracted in this study more focus on biological uses to conclude the resource recovery from sludge should be context specific according to the features of different sludges considering the balance between the cost and benefit more purification steps lead to higher extraction cost so crude ps is preferable for applications with relatively low economic benefits while pure ps can be applied in pharmaceutic industry with invaluable market demand another interesting issue is the existence of protein due to the limitation of extraction method the protein cannot be removed totally and the correlation analysis also shows that protein could have bioactivity protein is another important component of organics in sludge so recovering bioactive protein from sludge is also very attractive 5 conclusions this study evaluated the feasibility of simultaneous recovery of methane and pss from was and three strategies for coupling ad and pss recovery were comprehensively evaluated the results showed that pss extraction before ad could increase methane production by 37 1 the sulfate content in the extracted pss before ad was 13 15 while this value in the extracts after ad decreased to 2 60 the main monosaccharides of the pss were glucose 21 56 34 61 and rhamnose 21 56 34 61 ad decreased pss anti inflammatory activity and reducing power but enhanced their ability to reduce molybdenum ⅵ and scavenge hydroxyl radicals the correlation analysis indicated that sulfate content protein content and monosaccharides i e rhamnose and xylose of pss were closely related to their bioactivities the recovery of pss before ad was the best coupling strategy for was treatment among the three scenarios in terms of environmental effects such a scenario also ranked first in five environmental indicators compared with non coupled processes this work provides meaningful results

15017,chlorite clo2 is an undesirable toxic byproduct commonly produced in the chlorine dioxide and ultraviolet chlorine dioxide oxidation processes various methods have been developed to remove clo2 but require additional chemicals or energy input in this study an overlooked mitigation pathway of clo2 by solar light photolysis with a bonus for simultaneous removal of micropollutant co present was reported clo2 could be efficiently decomposed to chloride cl and chlorate by simulated solar light ssl at water relevant phs with cl yield up to 65 at neutral ph multiple reactive species including hydroxyl radical oh ozone o3 chloride radical cl and chlorine oxide radical clo were generated in the ssl clo2 system with the steady state concentrations following the order of o3 0 8 μμ clo 4 4 10 6 μμ oh 1 1 10 7 μμ cl 6 8 10 8 μμ at neutral ph under investigated condition bezafibrate bzf as well as the selected six other micropollutants was efficiently degraded by the ssl clo2 system with pseudofirst order rate constants ranging from 0 057 to 0 21 min 1 at ph 7 0 while most of them were negligibly degraded by ssl or clo2 treatment alone kinetic modeling of bzf degradation by ssl clo2 at phs 6 0 8 0 suggested that oh contributed the most followed by cl o3 and clo the presence of water background components i e humic acid bicarbonate and chloride exhibited negative effects on bzf degradation by the ssl clo2 system mainly due to their competitive scavenging of reactive species therein the mitigation of clo2 and bzf under photolysis by natural solar light or in realistic waters was also confirmed this study discovered an overlooked natural mitigation pathway for clo2 and micropollutants which has significant implications for understanding their fate in natural environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorite clo2 solar light photolysis bezafibrate reactive chlorine species micropollutant data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chlorite clo2 is commonly known as an inorganic byproduct generated mainly in the chlorine dioxide clo2 hupperich et al 2020 rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 or ultra violet clo2 uv clo2 zhao et al 2022 oxidation processes for instance it is reported that the molar yield of clo2 is up to 50 70 during clo2 reaction with organic and or inorganic substances hupperich et al 2020 gan et al 2020 clo2 possesses adverse health effects and therefore is restricted in drinking water the maximum contaminant level of clo2 is set at 0 7 and 1 mg l respectively by the environmental protection agency in china ministry of health 2022 and u s us epa 2006 to minimize the adverse effect of clo2 the dosage of clo2 is restricted to 1 4 mg l in drinking water treatment gan et al 2020 while it is in the range of 2 10 mg l in wastewater treatment in order to maintain efficient microbial inactivation bischoff et al 2013 de koning et al 2008 specially it was reported that clo2 has supplanted chlorine to become the dominant paper pulp bleaching agent gordon and rosenblatt 2005 and high dosages of clo2 with concentrations varying from dozens of mg l to g l were recommended used in the bleaching process liu et al 2022 phenolic structures in lignin were the major reactive sites susceptible to clo2 attack and the reactions between these two were expected to generate a large quantity of clo2 based on the results from model phenols hupperich et al 2020 as a result the discharge of clo2 in paper pulp bleaching field and likely in some wastewater treatment processes zhong et al 2019 would be of serious concern to water safety for instance a maximum of 7 mg l 104 μm of clo2 was expected for wastewater using 10 mg l clo2 assuming a molar yield of 70 hence various methods were explored to remove excess clo2 including chemical reduction by ferrous sorlini and collivignarelli 2005a cassol et al 2022 henderson et al 2001 or sulfite salts fogelman et al 1989 griese et al 1991 and physical adsorption by activated carbon sorlini and collivignarelli 2005b nancygonce and avoudrias 1994 though of considerable effectiveness those methods require additional chemical oxidants which may limit their broad application photolysis is a promising method for the mitigation of clo2 with an additional bonus by generating multiple reactive species eqs 1 10 which might be utilized for the simultaneous removal of contaminants co present wang et al 2021 1 clo 2 2 h v clo o 2 o h 2 o oh o h 3 2 clo c l 2 o 2 4 c l 2 o 2 clo 2 h 2 o clo 3 2 hocl 5 clo 2 h v cl o o 3 p 6 o 3 p o 2 o

no to no2 no3 and so2 to so4 2 in flue gas meanwhile clo2 was finally transformed to chloride cl clo2 and chlorine gas cl2 reactive species including clo and oh were demonstrated to play the leading roles while cl2o2 and clo2 might be also involved therein however a high dosage of clo2 10 0 g l was used in those studies in addition traditional uv lamps are fragile and costly with short lifespans and potential contamination of mercury yang et al 2022 yin et al 2018 yin and shang 2020 comparatively solar light as a naturally available light source is environmental friendly and energy saving the ability of clo2 decomposition by photolysis at wavelengths in uv b 311 nm and uv a 365 nm ranges in addition to the uv c range 254 nm buxton and subhani 1972a implied a potential mitigation pathway of clo2 by natural solar light especially considering the ability of uv a and uv b but not uv c light to penetrate the atmosphere reaching the earth surface widel et al 2014 yang et al 2022 however this natural mitigation pathway of clo2 might likely have been overlooked in previous studies furthermore the reactive species likely produced during solar light photolysis of clo2 may also contribute to the natural mitigation process of micropollutants co present yet up till now little is known about the photolysis of clo2 by solar light whether clo2 could be effectively mitigated by solar light photolysis will reactive species be generated in the process and utilized for the removal of organic contaminants what are the key influencing factors in the solar clo2 process in regard to the above scientific unknowns photolysis of clo2 by solar light sl was systematically investigated in the study firstly mitigation of clo2 by simulated sl ssl and its transformation products were explored secondly mitigation of bezafibrate bzf a widely used medicine for lipid regulation as a model compound and six other selected micropollutants that were frequently reported in the natural environment i e atrazine atz ibuprofen ibp carbamazepine cbz atenolol atl phenol and sulfamethoxazole smx was studied reactive species generated in the ssl clo2 system were identified and quantified and their roles in the degradation of bzf were articulated thirdly the impacts of operating parameters ph clo2 dosage and water matrices cl hco3 and ha on bzf degradation by ssl clo2 were examined finally the efficiency of bzf degradation and clo2 mitigation by ssl clo2 in realistic waters or by natural solar light nsl photolysis was comparatively investigated 2 material and methods chemicals and reagents

with a 300 w xenon arclamp hsx f300 beijing nbet technology co ltd was used as the source of ssl with its emission band in the range of 290 to 800 nm fig s1a the incident light intensity was checked with an optical power meter pm100d s405c thorlabs at the plane of the reaction solution before each experiment and was maintained at 270 mw cm2 using the controller on the simulator batch experiments were performed in a quartz reactor diameter 5 cm 50 ml placed 0 25 m below the lamp under magnetic stirring fig s2 the pre determined volume of clo2 stock solution was added into buffered solution 10 mm borate ph 5 0 9 0 containing a target compound e g one of the selected micropollutants or probe compounds with or without a scavenging reagent e g tba or water background matrices e g chloride cl bicarbonate hco3 and humic acid ha solution ph was re measured after the addition of clo2 and adjusted to the desired value using naoh or h2so4 if necessary and then the reactions were initiated by turning on the light simulator the ph changes during the reaction period were within 0 2 control experiments of bzf degradation by ssl or clo2 alone were also conducted following the above procedures 0 4 ml of samples were collected and quenched by 0 6 ml sodium thiosulfate 0 2 w w with the molar ratio of thiosulfate to clo2 15 at a defined time interval hereafter samples were filtered through 0 22 µm filters before high performance liquid chromatography hplc analysis parallel samples were also withdrawn without quenching and immediately analyzed by ion chromatography ic for quantification of residual clo2 cl and chlorate clo3 generated to evaluate the impact of dissolved oxygen do on the degradation of bzf by the ssl clo2 system 10 mm borate buffered solutions at ph 7 0 were purged with n2 for 30 min and the reactor were immediately sealed off the air before initiating the reactions following the procedures mentioned above batch reactions of clo2 100 ml photolysis by ssl were conducted under different conditions samples were withdrawn at pre determined time intervals and immediately transferred to amber vials containing pre added cinnamic acid 10 0 μm in the absence of ssl photolysis to quantify the concentrations of o3 produced zhao et al 2022 cinnamic acid could quickly react with ozone at a 1 1 stoichiometric ratio to produce benzaldehyde ko3 cinnamic 3 8 105 m 1s 1 which could be determined by hplc forsyth et al 2013 leitzke et al 2001 to better understand the mitigation of clo2 and bzf under nsl experiments were conducted on a sunny day noon on june 26th wuyi university china 113⁰e 23⁰n following the same experimental procedures as those performed above concentrations of residual clo2 and bzf and generated cl and clo3 were measured the temperature for all the experiments was maintained at 25 1 c all experiments were conducted in triplicates and averaged results with error bars representing standard deviations were displayed in figures analytical methods the emission spectrum of the ssl was determined by a miniature spectrometer ocean optics usb2000 usa and the absorption spectra of clo2 was obtained by a uv visible spectrophotometer uv 1900 shimadu co japan concentrations of selected micropollutants probe compounds and benzaldehyde were monitored by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1290 infinity ii equipped with a diode array detector and a c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 μm each 20 μl sample was injected and separated by the column with a flow rate of 1 ml min using either methanol acetic acid or acetonitrile acetic acid as the mobile phase table s1 concentrations of clo2 cl and clo3 were quantified by ion chromatography ic dione ics 2000 equipped with a dionex as19 column 4 mm 250 mm with the detection limit of 0 1 μm for each of them 3 results and discussion 3 1 mitigation of chlorite by ssl photolysis and its transformation products the mitigation of clo2 by ssl was investigated at environment relevant phs of 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 with a baseline clo2 concentration of 100 μm corresponding to the highest concentration likely encountered in wastewater treatment processes as aforementioned as shown in fig 1 clo2 was gradually degraded by ssl photolysis under investigated phs with degradation efficiencies around 40 37 and 36 within 30 min at ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 respectively supplementary experiments showed that clo2 was stable under investigated conditions without ssl photolysis fig s3 the results suggested that clo2 could be considerably mitigated by ssl photolysis which was supported by the overlap of the absorption spectrum of clo2 and the output spectrum of ssl in the wavelength range of 290 350 nm fig s1 it is documented that inorganic chlorine containing products including cl clo3 clo2 hocl and or dichlorine dioxide cl2o2 were produced during uv photolysis of clo2 hao et al 2019a 2019b wang et al 2021 however only two major products as cl and clo3 were detected in the ssl clo2 system and their concentrations slowly accumulated with the degradation of clo2 for instance the concentrations of cl and clo3 reached 24 7 and 11 1 μm respectively at ph 7 0 after 30 min reaction fig 1b the slight differences between the sum of cl and clo3 and initial clo2 5 under conditions investigated in this study suggested that other chlorine containing species were minorly produced in the ssl clo2 system the yields of cl and clo3 i e the ratio of the concentration of cl or clo3 generated to clo2 consumed were further calculated as could be seen in fig s4 the yields of cl and clo3 first increased within the initial 5 min and then kept relatively stable as the reaction proceeded the yields of cl were around 61 3 1 7 65 0 4 6 and 32 0 3 1 calculated with data obtained after 5 min respectively at ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 suggesting that clo2 was mostly transferred to cl at ph 7 0 similarly wang et al 2021 reported that the generation of cl dominated over clo3 at ph 7 0 during uv photolysis of clo2 clo3 was the main product of clo2 photolysis by ssl at alkaline ph with yield of around 65 9 3 6 at ph 8 0 fig s4c hence mitigation of clo2 by solar light transformed it mainly to cl under neutral to acid conditions and mainly to clo3 under alkaline conditions assuming the same molar yields of clo3 35 and cl 65 were obtained for lower clo2 concentration e g 0 7 mg l 10 4 μm the maximum limit in drinking water to those obtained at high clo2 concentration e g 100 μm 6 75 mg at neutral ph the concentrations of clo3 and cl were anticipated to be around 0 30 and 0 24 mg l after complete consumption of clo2 i e 0 7 mg l which were exactly within the regulation limits in drinking water i e 0 7 and 250 mg l respectively by the environmental protection agency in china ministry of health 2022 the results confirmed the safety of the ssl clo2 system in terms of clo3 and cl generation if applicated in drinking water treatment 3 2 mitigation of micropollutants by the ssl clo2 system multiple reactive species e g clo oh o 3p were reported to be generated during photolysis of clo2 which might also be generated in the ssl clo2 system and contributed to the degradation of micropollutants hence the mitigation of bzf as a model compound by the ssl clo2 system at ph 7 0 was studied as shown in fig 2 a bzf was relatively stable by ssl or clo2 treatment alone at ph 7 0 in contrast bzf was 100 transformed by the ssl clo2 system within 30 min and its degradation followed the pseudo first order rate law with the observed first order rate constant k obs of 0 13 min 1 the insert in fig 2a the mitigation of other micropollutants ibp atz cbz atl phenol and smx frequently detected in aqueous environments by the ssl clo2 the system was studied as shown in fig 2b the selected micropollutants were hardly degraded 10 by clo2 or ssl photolysis alone except atz and smx which were moderately degraded by ssl photolysis alone with k obs of 0 0092 and 0 061 min 1 respectively similar results were also reported in previous studies where atz prosen and zupančič kralj 2005 torrents et al 1997 and smx gonzález et al 2009 niu et al 2013 boreen et al 2004 were slowly degraded by solar photolysis due to the direct absorption of light the photolysis of clo2 by ssl remarkably accelerated the degradation rates of selected micropollutants with k obs ranging between 0 057 to 0 21 min 1 fig 2b the results demonstrated a broad spectra ability of the ssl clo2 system to mitigate micropollutants therefore it is expected that the micropollutants co present with clo2 could be mitigated to different extents in natural waters under solar light photolysis which might have long been overlooked 3 3 identification and quantification of reactive species generated in the ssl clo2 system the reactive species likely involved in the ssl clo2 system i e oh cl clo o 3p were identified and quantified using specific scavengers and or probe compounds the impact of tba as a scavenger of oh cl and clo wu et al 2017 lee et al 2022 on bzf degradation by the ssl clo2 system was examined as shown in fig s5a the presence of 1 mm tba significantly inhibited the degradation of bzf with its removal efficiency decreasing from 100 to around 32 1 within 30 min further increasing tba concentration to 5 mm decreased bzf degradation to around 10 the results suggested that oh cl and or clo were likely involved in the ssl clo2 system furthermore it was found that n2 purging could obviously decrease the degradation of bzf by the ssl clo2 system wherein bzf was degraded from 100 without n2 purging to around 68 2 with n2 purging fig s5b it is reported that o 3p can be generated by light photolysis of clo2 buxton and subhani 1972b and it reacts rapidly with o2 at a second order rate constant k app of 4 0 109 m 1s 1 generating ozone o3 buxton and subhani 1972b chuang et al 2022 hence the generation of o3 in the ssl clo2 system was measured and shown in fig s6 o3 concentration fluctuated in a narrow range of 0 6 to 0 8 μm at phs 6 0 9 0 as o3 shows considerable reactivity towards bzf k app of 4 24 103 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 dantas et al 2007 it possibly contributed to the degradation of bzf in the ssl clo2 system the negative impact of nitrogen purging on bzf degradation most likely due to its inhibition to o3 formation however as o2 reacts rapidly with carbon centered radicals naumov and von sonntag 2011 it might also participate partially in the reactions by reaction with carbon centered bzf intermediates generated from oh and or cl attack of bzf which warrants further investigation further the steady state concentrations of oh cl and clo were quantified using nb ba and dmob as probe compounds respectively li et al 2022 guo et al 2017 zhao et al 2021 2022 choo et al 2022 based on their rate constants with the reactive species table s2 nb can be rapidly degraded by oh buxton et al 1988 but not cl clo and o3 bulman et al 2019 watts and linden 2007 hoigné and bader 1983 it was thus used as a probe compound to oh ba shows high reactivity towards oh and cl but not clo and o3 mártire et al 2001 alfassi et al 1987 buxton et al 1988 hoigné and bader 1983 it was used as a probe compound to cl after subtracting the contribution of oh dmob is reactive towards oh clo cl and o3 o neill et al 1976 alfassi et al 1988 1987 muñoz and von sonntag 2000 hence dmob could be used as a probe compound to clo after subtracting the contributions of oh cl and o3 the steady state concentrations of oh oh ss clo clo ss and cl cl ss could finally be determined via the degradation kinetics of those three probe compounds as displayed in eqs 11 13 see details in text s1 11 k o b s n b k o h n b oh s s 12 k o b s b a k o h b a oh

represented the pseudo first order rate constant of nb ba and dmob degradation by the ssl clo2 system respectively k oh nb k oh ba k oh dmob represented the second order rate constant of nb ba and dmob reaction with oh respectively k c l b a and k c l d m o b represented the second order rate constant of ba and dmob reaction with cl respectively k c l o d m o b and k o 3 d m o b represented the second order rate constant of dmob reaction with clo and o3 respectively o3 averaged represented the averaged concentration of o3 the pseudo first order degradation kinetics of nb ba and dmob at phs 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 were shown in fig s7 and the calculated values of oh ss clo ss and cl ss were listed in table 1 clo dominated over oh and cl with its concentration 1 2 orders of magnitude higher similar results were also reported in uv photolysis of clo2 zhao et al 2021 moreover the steady state concentrations of oh and cl slightly decreased with the increase of ph while those of clo and o3 kept relatively stable for instance the oh ss decreased moderately from 1 44 10 13 to 9 29 10 14 m as ph increased from 6 0 to 8 0 the decreased concentrations of reactive species at higher ph were likely due to the lower quantum yield фclo2 and or molar absorption coefficient εclo2 m 1cm 1 of clo2 therein as could be seen from fig s8 the molar absorption coefficient of clo2 at a specific wavelength was relatively stable at phs 6 0 8 0 фclo2 of clo2 was then calculated following the methods reported previously bezares cruz et al 2004 sun et al 2014 text s2 and the results were shown in table 1 фclo2 slightly decreased as the ph increased from 6 0 to 8 0 accounting for the relatively lower concentrations of reactive species therein the slight decrease in фclo2 at higher ph indicated that the ssl clo2 system was relatively insensitive to the change of solution ph which may benefit the degradation of micropollutants co present as discussed in the following section 3 4 impacts of reaction conditions on bzf mitigation by the ssl clo2 system ph mitigation of bzf by the ssl clo2 system over a wide ph range of 5 0 9 0 was studied as shown in fig 3 a bzf could be efficiently degraded at each ph with its degradation rates slightly decreasing from 0 20 min 1 at ph 5 0 to 0 13 min 1 at ph 7 0 and 0 12 min 1 at ph 9 0 as bzf has a pka value of 3 6 tang et al 2014 the speciation change of bzf over the investigated ph ranges should have a slight impact on its reaction with the reactive species hence the decreased degradation efficiency of bzf at higher ph was likely due to the lower фclo2 which resulted in the lower concentrations of reactive species therein despite that bzf was less effectively degraded at higher ph it was almost completely degraded in 30 min even at ph 9 0 demonstrating the robust performance of ssl clo2 in terms of solution ph the degradation kinetics of bzf under different phs were fitted by considering the contributions of each reactive species using the obtained concentrations as shown in table 1 and fig s6 text s3 it could be seen from fig s9 that the degradation of bzf was well fitted by the kinetic model at each ph the contributions of clo oh cl and o3 to bzf degradation at phs 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 were calculated by the ratio of the product of k app of reactive species with bzf and their steady state concentrations or averaged concentration for o3 to the experimentally measured k obs k app reactive species ss k obs as could be seen from fig 3b the contribution of each reactive species to bzf kept relatively stable under investigated conditions in line well with their relatively constant concentrations in table 1 oh contributed the most to the degradation of bzf followed by cl o3 and clo for instance contributions of oh cl o3 and clo at ph 7 0 were 38 9 32 6 20 2 and 7 4 respectively the differences 10 between the sum of the contributions and 100 at each ph were probably ascribed to the experimental errors clo2 dosage the impact of clo2 concentration 25 500 μm on bzf degradation by the ssl clo2 system at ph 7 0 was studied as shown in fig 4 bzf was effectively degraded by 79 1 within 30 min even at a low clo2 concentration of 25 μm suggesting the effectiveness of the system in mitigation of micropollutants moreover the degradation rates of bzf gradually increased with increasing clo2 concentration and the k obs elevated from 0 049 to 0 29 min 1 as clo2 concentration increased from 25 to 500 μm increasing nearly 6 folds the increased dosage of clo2 could induce higher concentrations of reactive species thus enhancing the degradation rates of bzf on the other hand clo2 itself is also a reducing reagent and it can rapidly capture reactive species generated e g clo oh cl and o3 zhao et al 2021 guo et al 2017 table s2 hence though clo2 concentration was increased by nearly 20 folds i e from 25 to 500 μm the k obs of bzf was only increased by 6 folds the insert figure in fig 4 demonstrated a slowed down increasing rate of k obs as a function of clo2 concentration which might also be due to the scavenging role of clo2 therein water matrices impacts of water matrices including humic acid ha 0 10 mgc l bicarbonate hco3 0 10 μm and chloride cl 0 100 μm on bzf degradation by the ssl clo2 system at ph 7 0 were investigated the presence of ha remarkably inhibited bzf degradation with a stronger inhibition at a higher ha concentration fig 5 a for instance the degradation efficiency of bzf decreased from 100 without ha to 61 2 and 34 4 respectively in the presence of 3 and 10 mgc l ha control experiments showed that clo2 was stable in the presence of water matrices alone fig s10 the inhibition effect of ha on micropollutant degradation was frequently reported and it was mainly ascribed to i the light filter effect of ha wang et al 2016 fang et al 2014 luo et al 2015 and ii the competitive consumption of reactive species by ha sun et al 2021 fang et al 2014 kong et al 2016 as shown in fig 5b an inhibitive effect of hco3 on bzf by the ssl clo2 system was obtained the degradation efficiency of bzf was around 100 80 1 69 4 and 56 7 respectively in the presence of 0 1 5 and 10 mm hco3 hco3 could rapidly capture oh and cl leading to the formation of co3 chuang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 since co3 is a less reactive radical compared to oh and cl kong et al 2018 yang et al 2021 its formation might finally result in the reduced degradation of bzf fig 5c showed that the presence of cl displayed a negative effect on bzf degradation but the inhibition effect was less significant compared to that of hco3 at the same concentration level for instance the presence of 10 mm hco3 and cl decreased bzf degradation efficiency from 100 to 56 7 and 92 2 respectively though cl could rapidly capture oh forming cloh eq 14 it possessed an even faster reverse reaction rate which could generate oh again eq 15 pan et al 2018 yang et al 2014 the mild inhibition effect of cl on the degradation kinetics of micropollutants in oh based aops has been documented in the literature pan et al 2018 14 oh c l clo h 4 3 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 15 clo h oh c l 6 1 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 in addition to oh the presence of cl could also scavenge cloh eq 16 and cl eq 17 generating the less reactive secondary radicals as cl2 lei et al 2021 it is reported that the k app of bzf with cl and cl2 was around 1 04 1010 and 3 24 108 m 1s 1 respectively lei et al 2019 hence the generation of cl2 via cl scavenge by cl would retard the transformation of bzf 16 clo h c l cl 2 o h 6 1 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 17 cl c l cl 2 8 5 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 as a result the combined effects of cl on the concentrations of oh and cl led to a decreased degradation of bzf by the ssl clo2 system light source in addition to ssl mitigation of clo2 by nsl and its ability to mitigate bzf were further tested the nsl with an intensity of 96 mw cm2 measured at the plane of the reaction solution by thorlabs optical power meter pm100d s405c before the experiment was obtained on a sunny day noon on june 26th wuyi university china 113⁰e 23⁰n as shown in fig 6 a clo2 could be efficiently decomposed by nsl where around 28 2 of clo2 was degraded within 60 min the slower mitigation rates of clo2 under photolysis by nsl compared to that by ssl were attributed to the weaker light intensity of nsl i e around one third that of the ssl the evolution kinetics of inorganic products of clo2 were monitored and shown in fig 6a concentrations of cl and clo3 gradually increased with their concentrations reaching 17 5 and 8 5 respectively after 60 min of reaction the yields of cl and clo3 were around 62 3 and 30 0 in line with the results obtained under ssl moreover bzf could be effectively degraded even by nsl photolysis of clo2 with k obs of 0 043 min 1 fig 6b the insert though the degradation rate of bzf under nsl was slower than that by ssl k obs of 0 13 min 1 it was still degraded by 71 6 in 30 min the above results indicated that clo2 could be considerably mitigated under photolysis by nsl along with the mitigation of micropollutants co present 3 5 mitigation of clo2 and bzf in realistic waters the mitigation of clo2 and bzf in different real waters groundwater gw surface water sw and effluents of wastewater treatment plant wwtp as compared to deionized water di was investigated the quality of those real waters was presented in table s3 to be noticed the phs of real waters was adjusted to 7 0 by naoh or h2so4 before experiments to ensure a comparison of the results with those obtained in buffered di water as shown in fig 7 a clo2 could be considerably mitigated in different water matrices with its rates following the order of wwtp sw gw di around 37 4 40 7 45 0 and 48 4 of clo2 was degraded in 30 min in di gw sw and wwtp respectively the faster degradation rates of clo2 in the effluent of wwtp than di water was likely related to the higher organic contents therein table s3 which could consume quantities of reactive species generated during clo2 photolysis thus leading to the faster consumption rate of clo2 therein similar results were also reported during photolysis of clo2 where the clo2 decomposition rate was increased with the addition of organic compounds e g benzoic acid even inert to clo2 peng et al 2022 furthermore bzf was also effectively degraded in each water with the degradation efficiency following the order of di gw sw wwtp contrary to that obtained for clo2 the results were not difficult to understand taking into account the scavenging effects of organic matters and anions e g cl and hco3 present in natural water and wastewater matrices even though bzf was the least degraded in effluents of wwtp it still reached to 73 6 in 30 min the results again indicated that micropollutants co present with clo2 could be considerably mitigated in natural waters under photolysis by solar light 4 conclusion this work for the first time demonstrated that clo2 could be effectively mitigated to cl and clo3 under photolysis by both simulated and natural solar light over a wide ph range meanwhile the generated reactive species including clo oh cl and o3 could induce the degradation of micropollutants co present the following conclusions could be obtained 1 clo2 could be effectively mitigated by solar photolysis wherein micropollutants co existed were degraded 2 clo2 was mainly transformed to cl and clo3 under photolysis by solar light cl dominated over clo3 at neutral to acid condition while clo3 prevailed at alkaline ph 3 micropollutants with diverse structures could be considerably mitigated by solar light photolysis of clo2 in this study the pseudo first order rate constants of bzf ibp atz cbz atl phenol and smx degradation by ssl clo2 ranged from 0 057 to 0 21 min 1 at ph 7 0 4 reactive species including clo oh cl and o3 were generated in ssl clo2 system and contributed to the degradation of micropollutants therein 5 increasing ph slightly decreased bzf degradation by ssl clo2 mainly due to the decreased quantum yield of clo2 therein 6 the presence of water matrices negatively affected bzf degradation by ssl clo2 mostly via the competitive consumption of reactive species 7 both clo2 and bzf could be efficiently mitigated by nsl or by ssl photolysis in different real waters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

15017,chlorite clo2 is an undesirable toxic byproduct commonly produced in the chlorine dioxide and ultraviolet chlorine dioxide oxidation processes various methods have been developed to remove clo2 but require additional chemicals or energy input in this study an overlooked mitigation pathway of clo2 by solar light photolysis with a bonus for simultaneous removal of micropollutant co present was reported clo2 could be efficiently decomposed to chloride cl and chlorate by simulated solar light ssl at water relevant phs with cl yield up to 65 at neutral ph multiple reactive species including hydroxyl radical oh ozone o3 chloride radical cl and chlorine oxide radical clo were generated in the ssl clo2 system with the steady state concentrations following the order of o3 0 8 μμ clo 4 4 10 6 μμ oh 1 1 10 7 μμ cl 6 8 10 8 μμ at neutral ph under investigated condition bezafibrate bzf as well as the selected six other micropollutants was efficiently degraded by the ssl clo2 system with pseudofirst order rate constants ranging from 0 057 to 0 21 min 1 at ph 7 0 while most of them were negligibly degraded by ssl or clo2 treatment alone kinetic modeling of bzf degradation by ssl clo2 at phs 6 0 8 0 suggested that oh contributed the most followed by cl o3 and clo the presence of water background components i e humic acid bicarbonate and chloride exhibited negative effects on bzf degradation by the ssl clo2 system mainly due to their competitive scavenging of reactive species therein the mitigation of clo2 and bzf under photolysis by natural solar light or in realistic waters was also confirmed this study discovered an overlooked natural mitigation pathway for clo2 and micropollutants which has significant implications for understanding their fate in natural environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorite clo2 solar light photolysis bezafibrate reactive chlorine species micropollutant data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chlorite clo2 is commonly known as an inorganic byproduct generated mainly in the chlorine dioxide clo2 hupperich et al 2020 rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 or ultra violet clo2 uv clo2 zhao et al 2022 oxidation processes for instance it is reported that the molar yield of clo2 is up to 50 70 during clo2 reaction with organic and or inorganic substances hupperich et al 2020 gan et al 2020 clo2 possesses adverse health effects and therefore is restricted in drinking water the maximum contaminant level of clo2 is set at 0 7 and 1 mg l respectively by the environmental protection agency in china ministry of health 2022 and u s us epa 2006 to minimize the adverse effect of clo2 the dosage of clo2 is restricted to 1 4 mg l in drinking water treatment gan et al 2020 while it is in the range of 2 10 mg l in wastewater treatment in order to maintain efficient microbial inactivation bischoff et al 2013 de koning et al 2008 specially it was reported that clo2 has supplanted chlorine to become the dominant paper pulp bleaching agent gordon and rosenblatt 2005 and high dosages of clo2 with concentrations varying from dozens of mg l to g l were recommended used in the bleaching process liu et al 2022 phenolic structures in lignin were the major reactive sites susceptible to clo2 attack and the reactions between these two were expected to generate a large quantity of clo2 based on the results from model phenols hupperich et al 2020 as a result the discharge of clo2 in paper pulp bleaching field and likely in some wastewater treatment processes zhong et al 2019 would be of serious concern to water safety for instance a maximum of 7 mg l 104 μm of clo2 was expected for wastewater using 10 mg l clo2 assuming a molar yield of 70 hence various methods were explored to remove excess clo2 including chemical reduction by ferrous sorlini and collivignarelli 2005a cassol et al 2022 henderson et al 2001 or sulfite salts fogelman et al 1989 griese et al 1991 and physical adsorption by activated carbon sorlini and collivignarelli 2005b nancygonce and avoudrias 1994 though of considerable effectiveness those methods require additional chemical oxidants which may limit their broad application photolysis is a promising method for the mitigation of clo2 with an additional bonus by generating multiple reactive species eqs 1 10 which might be utilized for the simultaneous removal of contaminants co present wang et al 2021 1 clo 2 2 h v clo o 2 o h 2 o oh o h 3 2 clo c l 2 o 2 4 c l 2 o 2 clo 2 h 2 o clo 3 2 hocl 5 clo 2 h v cl o o 3 p 6 o 3 p o 2 o

no to no2 no3 and so2 to so4 2 in flue gas meanwhile clo2 was finally transformed to chloride cl clo2 and chlorine gas cl2 reactive species including clo and oh were demonstrated to play the leading roles while cl2o2 and clo2 might be also involved therein however a high dosage of clo2 10 0 g l was used in those studies in addition traditional uv lamps are fragile and costly with short lifespans and potential contamination of mercury yang et al 2022 yin et al 2018 yin and shang 2020 comparatively solar light as a naturally available light source is environmental friendly and energy saving the ability of clo2 decomposition by photolysis at wavelengths in uv b 311 nm and uv a 365 nm ranges in addition to the uv c range 254 nm buxton and subhani 1972a implied a potential mitigation pathway of clo2 by natural solar light especially considering the ability of uv a and uv b but not uv c light to penetrate the atmosphere reaching the earth surface widel et al 2014 yang et al 2022 however this natural mitigation pathway of clo2 might likely have been overlooked in previous studies furthermore the reactive species likely produced during solar light photolysis of clo2 may also contribute to the natural mitigation process of micropollutants co present yet up till now little is known about the photolysis of clo2 by solar light whether clo2 could be effectively mitigated by solar light photolysis will reactive species be generated in the process and utilized for the removal of organic contaminants what are the key influencing factors in the solar clo2 process in regard to the above scientific unknowns photolysis of clo2 by solar light sl was systematically investigated in the study firstly mitigation of clo2 by simulated sl ssl and its transformation products were explored secondly mitigation of bezafibrate bzf a widely used medicine for lipid regulation as a model compound and six other selected micropollutants that were frequently reported in the natural environment i e atrazine atz ibuprofen ibp carbamazepine cbz atenolol atl phenol and sulfamethoxazole smx was studied reactive species generated in the ssl clo2 system were identified and quantified and their roles in the degradation of bzf were articulated thirdly the impacts of operating parameters ph clo2 dosage and water matrices cl hco3 and ha on bzf degradation by ssl clo2 were examined finally the efficiency of bzf degradation and clo2 mitigation by ssl clo2 in realistic waters or by natural solar light nsl photolysis was comparatively investigated 2 material and methods chemicals and reagents

with a 300 w xenon arclamp hsx f300 beijing nbet technology co ltd was used as the source of ssl with its emission band in the range of 290 to 800 nm fig s1a the incident light intensity was checked with an optical power meter pm100d s405c thorlabs at the plane of the reaction solution before each experiment and was maintained at 270 mw cm2 using the controller on the simulator batch experiments were performed in a quartz reactor diameter 5 cm 50 ml placed 0 25 m below the lamp under magnetic stirring fig s2 the pre determined volume of clo2 stock solution was added into buffered solution 10 mm borate ph 5 0 9 0 containing a target compound e g one of the selected micropollutants or probe compounds with or without a scavenging reagent e g tba or water background matrices e g chloride cl bicarbonate hco3 and humic acid ha solution ph was re measured after the addition of clo2 and adjusted to the desired value using naoh or h2so4 if necessary and then the reactions were initiated by turning on the light simulator the ph changes during the reaction period were within 0 2 control experiments of bzf degradation by ssl or clo2 alone were also conducted following the above procedures 0 4 ml of samples were collected and quenched by 0 6 ml sodium thiosulfate 0 2 w w with the molar ratio of thiosulfate to clo2 15 at a defined time interval hereafter samples were filtered through 0 22 µm filters before high performance liquid chromatography hplc analysis parallel samples were also withdrawn without quenching and immediately analyzed by ion chromatography ic for quantification of residual clo2 cl and chlorate clo3 generated to evaluate the impact of dissolved oxygen do on the degradation of bzf by the ssl clo2 system 10 mm borate buffered solutions at ph 7 0 were purged with n2 for 30 min and the reactor were immediately sealed off the air before initiating the reactions following the procedures mentioned above batch reactions of clo2 100 ml photolysis by ssl were conducted under different conditions samples were withdrawn at pre determined time intervals and immediately transferred to amber vials containing pre added cinnamic acid 10 0 μm in the absence of ssl photolysis to quantify the concentrations of o3 produced zhao et al 2022 cinnamic acid could quickly react with ozone at a 1 1 stoichiometric ratio to produce benzaldehyde ko3 cinnamic 3 8 105 m 1s 1 which could be determined by hplc forsyth et al 2013 leitzke et al 2001 to better understand the mitigation of clo2 and bzf under nsl experiments were conducted on a sunny day noon on june 26th wuyi university china 113⁰e 23⁰n following the same experimental procedures as those performed above concentrations of residual clo2 and bzf and generated cl and clo3 were measured the temperature for all the experiments was maintained at 25 1 c all experiments were conducted in triplicates and averaged results with error bars representing standard deviations were displayed in figures analytical methods the emission spectrum of the ssl was determined by a miniature spectrometer ocean optics usb2000 usa and the absorption spectra of clo2 was obtained by a uv visible spectrophotometer uv 1900 shimadu co japan concentrations of selected micropollutants probe compounds and benzaldehyde were monitored by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1290 infinity ii equipped with a diode array detector and a c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 μm each 20 μl sample was injected and separated by the column with a flow rate of 1 ml min using either methanol acetic acid or acetonitrile acetic acid as the mobile phase table s1 concentrations of clo2 cl and clo3 were quantified by ion chromatography ic dione ics 2000 equipped with a dionex as19 column 4 mm 250 mm with the detection limit of 0 1 μm for each of them 3 results and discussion 3 1 mitigation of chlorite by ssl photolysis and its transformation products the mitigation of clo2 by ssl was investigated at environment relevant phs of 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 with a baseline clo2 concentration of 100 μm corresponding to the highest concentration likely encountered in wastewater treatment processes as aforementioned as shown in fig 1 clo2 was gradually degraded by ssl photolysis under investigated phs with degradation efficiencies around 40 37 and 36 within 30 min at ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 respectively supplementary experiments showed that clo2 was stable under investigated conditions without ssl photolysis fig s3 the results suggested that clo2 could be considerably mitigated by ssl photolysis which was supported by the overlap of the absorption spectrum of clo2 and the output spectrum of ssl in the wavelength range of 290 350 nm fig s1 it is documented that inorganic chlorine containing products including cl clo3 clo2 hocl and or dichlorine dioxide cl2o2 were produced during uv photolysis of clo2 hao et al 2019a 2019b wang et al 2021 however only two major products as cl and clo3 were detected in the ssl clo2 system and their concentrations slowly accumulated with the degradation of clo2 for instance the concentrations of cl and clo3 reached 24 7 and 11 1 μm respectively at ph 7 0 after 30 min reaction fig 1b the slight differences between the sum of cl and clo3 and initial clo2 5 under conditions investigated in this study suggested that other chlorine containing species were minorly produced in the ssl clo2 system the yields of cl and clo3 i e the ratio of the concentration of cl or clo3 generated to clo2 consumed were further calculated as could be seen in fig s4 the yields of cl and clo3 first increased within the initial 5 min and then kept relatively stable as the reaction proceeded the yields of cl were around 61 3 1 7 65 0 4 6 and 32 0 3 1 calculated with data obtained after 5 min respectively at ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 suggesting that clo2 was mostly transferred to cl at ph 7 0 similarly wang et al 2021 reported that the generation of cl dominated over clo3 at ph 7 0 during uv photolysis of clo2 clo3 was the main product of clo2 photolysis by ssl at alkaline ph with yield of around 65 9 3 6 at ph 8 0 fig s4c hence mitigation of clo2 by solar light transformed it mainly to cl under neutral to acid conditions and mainly to clo3 under alkaline conditions assuming the same molar yields of clo3 35 and cl 65 were obtained for lower clo2 concentration e g 0 7 mg l 10 4 μm the maximum limit in drinking water to those obtained at high clo2 concentration e g 100 μm 6 75 mg at neutral ph the concentrations of clo3 and cl were anticipated to be around 0 30 and 0 24 mg l after complete consumption of clo2 i e 0 7 mg l which were exactly within the regulation limits in drinking water i e 0 7 and 250 mg l respectively by the environmental protection agency in china ministry of health 2022 the results confirmed the safety of the ssl clo2 system in terms of clo3 and cl generation if applicated in drinking water treatment 3 2 mitigation of micropollutants by the ssl clo2 system multiple reactive species e g clo oh o 3p were reported to be generated during photolysis of clo2 which might also be generated in the ssl clo2 system and contributed to the degradation of micropollutants hence the mitigation of bzf as a model compound by the ssl clo2 system at ph 7 0 was studied as shown in fig 2 a bzf was relatively stable by ssl or clo2 treatment alone at ph 7 0 in contrast bzf was 100 transformed by the ssl clo2 system within 30 min and its degradation followed the pseudo first order rate law with the observed first order rate constant k obs of 0 13 min 1 the insert in fig 2a the mitigation of other micropollutants ibp atz cbz atl phenol and smx frequently detected in aqueous environments by the ssl clo2 the system was studied as shown in fig 2b the selected micropollutants were hardly degraded 10 by clo2 or ssl photolysis alone except atz and smx which were moderately degraded by ssl photolysis alone with k obs of 0 0092 and 0 061 min 1 respectively similar results were also reported in previous studies where atz prosen and zupančič kralj 2005 torrents et al 1997 and smx gonzález et al 2009 niu et al 2013 boreen et al 2004 were slowly degraded by solar photolysis due to the direct absorption of light the photolysis of clo2 by ssl remarkably accelerated the degradation rates of selected micropollutants with k obs ranging between 0 057 to 0 21 min 1 fig 2b the results demonstrated a broad spectra ability of the ssl clo2 system to mitigate micropollutants therefore it is expected that the micropollutants co present with clo2 could be mitigated to different extents in natural waters under solar light photolysis which might have long been overlooked 3 3 identification and quantification of reactive species generated in the ssl clo2 system the reactive species likely involved in the ssl clo2 system i e oh cl clo o 3p were identified and quantified using specific scavengers and or probe compounds the impact of tba as a scavenger of oh cl and clo wu et al 2017 lee et al 2022 on bzf degradation by the ssl clo2 system was examined as shown in fig s5a the presence of 1 mm tba significantly inhibited the degradation of bzf with its removal efficiency decreasing from 100 to around 32 1 within 30 min further increasing tba concentration to 5 mm decreased bzf degradation to around 10 the results suggested that oh cl and or clo were likely involved in the ssl clo2 system furthermore it was found that n2 purging could obviously decrease the degradation of bzf by the ssl clo2 system wherein bzf was degraded from 100 without n2 purging to around 68 2 with n2 purging fig s5b it is reported that o 3p can be generated by light photolysis of clo2 buxton and subhani 1972b and it reacts rapidly with o2 at a second order rate constant k app of 4 0 109 m 1s 1 generating ozone o3 buxton and subhani 1972b chuang et al 2022 hence the generation of o3 in the ssl clo2 system was measured and shown in fig s6 o3 concentration fluctuated in a narrow range of 0 6 to 0 8 μm at phs 6 0 9 0 as o3 shows considerable reactivity towards bzf k app of 4 24 103 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 dantas et al 2007 it possibly contributed to the degradation of bzf in the ssl clo2 system the negative impact of nitrogen purging on bzf degradation most likely due to its inhibition to o3 formation however as o2 reacts rapidly with carbon centered radicals naumov and von sonntag 2011 it might also participate partially in the reactions by reaction with carbon centered bzf intermediates generated from oh and or cl attack of bzf which warrants further investigation further the steady state concentrations of oh cl and clo were quantified using nb ba and dmob as probe compounds respectively li et al 2022 guo et al 2017 zhao et al 2021 2022 choo et al 2022 based on their rate constants with the reactive species table s2 nb can be rapidly degraded by oh buxton et al 1988 but not cl clo and o3 bulman et al 2019 watts and linden 2007 hoigné and bader 1983 it was thus used as a probe compound to oh ba shows high reactivity towards oh and cl but not clo and o3 mártire et al 2001 alfassi et al 1987 buxton et al 1988 hoigné and bader 1983 it was used as a probe compound to cl after subtracting the contribution of oh dmob is reactive towards oh clo cl and o3 o neill et al 1976 alfassi et al 1988 1987 muñoz and von sonntag 2000 hence dmob could be used as a probe compound to clo after subtracting the contributions of oh cl and o3 the steady state concentrations of oh oh ss clo clo ss and cl cl ss could finally be determined via the degradation kinetics of those three probe compounds as displayed in eqs 11 13 see details in text s1 11 k o b s n b k o h n b oh s s 12 k o b s b a k o h b a oh s s k c l b a cl s s 13 k o b s d m o b k o h d m o b oh s s k c l d m o b cl s s k c l o d m o b clo s s k o 3 d m o b o 3 a v e r a g e d where k o b s n b k o b s b a and k o b s d m o b represented the pseudo first order rate constant of nb ba and dmob degradation by the ssl clo2 system respectively k oh nb k oh ba k oh dmob represented the second order rate constant of nb ba and dmob reaction with oh respectively k c l b a and k c l d m o b represented the second order rate constant of ba and dmob reaction with cl respectively k c l o d m o b and k o 3 d m o b represented the second order rate constant of dmob reaction with clo and o3 respectively o3 averaged represented the averaged concentration of o3 the pseudo first order degradation kinetics of nb ba and dmob at phs 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 were shown in fig s7 and the calculated values of oh ss clo ss and cl ss were listed in table 1 clo dominated over oh and cl with its concentration 1 2 orders of magnitude higher similar results were also reported in uv photolysis of clo2 zhao et al 2021 moreover the steady state concentrations of oh and cl slightly decreased with the increase of ph while those of clo and o3 kept relatively stable for instance the oh ss decreased moderately from 1 44 10 13 to 9 29 10 14 m as ph increased from 6 0 to 8 0 the decreased concentrations of reactive species at higher ph were likely due to the lower quantum yield фclo2 and or molar absorption coefficient εclo2 m 1cm 1 of clo2 therein as could be seen from fig s8 the molar absorption coefficient of clo2 at a specific wavelength was relatively stable at phs 6 0 8 0 фclo2 of clo2 was then calculated following the methods reported previously bezares cruz et al 2004 sun et al 2014 text s2 and the results were shown in table 1 фclo2 slightly decreased as the ph increased from 6 0 to 8 0 accounting for the relatively lower concentrations of reactive species therein the slight decrease in фclo2 at higher ph indicated that the ssl clo2 system was relatively insensitive to the change of solution ph which may benefit the degradation of micropollutants co present as discussed in the following section 3 4 impacts of reaction conditions on bzf mitigation by the ssl clo2 system ph mitigation of bzf by the ssl clo2 system over a wide ph range of 5 0 9 0 was studied as shown in fig 3 a bzf could be efficiently degraded at each ph with its degradation rates slightly decreasing from 0 20 min 1 at ph 5 0 to 0 13 min 1 at ph 7 0 and 0 12 min 1 at ph 9 0 as bzf has a pka value of 3 6 tang et al 2014 the speciation change of bzf over the investigated ph ranges should have a slight impact on its reaction with the reactive species hence the decreased degradation efficiency of bzf at higher ph was likely due to the lower фclo2 which resulted in the lower concentrations of reactive species therein despite that bzf was less effectively degraded at higher ph it was almost completely degraded in 30 min even at ph 9 0 demonstrating the robust performance of ssl clo2 in terms of solution ph the degradation kinetics of bzf under different phs were fitted by considering the contributions of each reactive species using the obtained concentrations as shown in table 1 and fig s6 text s3 it could be seen from fig s9 that the degradation of bzf was well fitted by the kinetic model at each ph the contributions of clo oh cl and o3 to bzf degradation at phs 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 were calculated by the ratio of the product of k app of reactive species with bzf and their steady state concentrations or averaged concentration for o3 to the experimentally measured k obs k app reactive species ss k obs as could be seen from fig 3b the contribution of each reactive species to bzf kept relatively stable under investigated conditions in line well with their relatively constant concentrations in table 1 oh contributed the most to the degradation of bzf followed by cl o3 and clo for instance contributions of oh cl o3 and clo at ph 7 0 were 38 9 32 6 20 2 and 7 4 respectively the differences 10 between the sum of the contributions and 100 at each ph were probably ascribed to the experimental errors clo2 dosage the impact of clo2 concentration 25 500 μm on bzf degradation by the ssl clo2 system at ph 7 0 was studied as shown in fig 4 bzf was effectively degraded by 79 1 within 30 min even at a low clo2 concentration of 25 μm suggesting the effectiveness of the system in mitigation of micropollutants moreover the degradation rates of bzf gradually increased with increasing clo2 concentration and the k obs elevated from 0 049 to 0 29 min 1 as clo2 concentration increased from 25 to 500 μm increasing nearly 6 folds the increased dosage of clo2 could induce higher concentrations of reactive species thus enhancing the degradation rates of bzf on the other hand clo2 itself is also a reducing reagent and it can rapidly capture reactive species generated e g clo oh cl and o3 zhao et al 2021 guo et al 2017 table s2 hence though clo2 concentration was increased by nearly 20 folds i e from 25 to 500 μm the k obs of bzf was only increased by 6 folds the insert figure in fig 4 demonstrated a slowed down increasing rate of k obs as a function of clo2 concentration which might also be due to the scavenging role of clo2 therein water matrices impacts of water matrices including humic acid ha 0 10 mgc l bicarbonate hco3 0 10 μm and chloride cl 0 100 μm on bzf degradation by the ssl clo2 system at ph 7 0 were investigated the presence of ha remarkably inhibited bzf degradation with a stronger inhibition at a higher ha concentration fig 5 a for instance the degradation efficiency of bzf decreased from 100 without ha to 61 2 and 34 4 respectively in the presence of 3 and 10 mgc l ha control experiments showed that clo2 was stable in the presence of water matrices alone fig s10 the inhibition effect of ha on micropollutant degradation was frequently reported and it was mainly ascribed to i the light filter effect of ha wang et al 2016 fang et al 2014 luo et al 2015 and ii the competitive consumption of reactive species by ha sun et al 2021 fang et al 2014 kong et al 2016 as shown in fig 5b an inhibitive effect of hco3 on bzf by the ssl clo2 system was obtained the degradation efficiency of bzf was around 100 80 1 69 4 and 56 7 respectively in the presence of 0 1 5 and 10 mm hco3 hco3 could rapidly capture oh and cl leading to the formation of co3 chuang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 since co3 is a less reactive radical compared to oh and cl kong et al 2018 yang et al 2021 its formation might finally result in the reduced degradation of bzf fig 5c showed that the presence of cl displayed a negative effect on bzf degradation but the inhibition effect was less significant compared to that of hco3 at the same concentration level for instance the presence of 10 mm hco3 and cl decreased bzf degradation efficiency from 100 to 56 7 and 92 2 respectively though cl could rapidly capture oh forming cloh eq 14 it possessed an even faster reverse reaction rate which could generate oh again eq 15 pan et al 2018 yang et al 2014 the mild inhibition effect of cl on the degradation kinetics of micropollutants in oh based aops has been documented in the literature pan et al 2018 14 oh c l clo h 4 3 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 15 clo h oh c l 6 1 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 in addition to oh the presence of cl could also scavenge cloh eq 16 and cl eq 17 generating the less reactive secondary radicals as cl2 lei et al 2021 it is reported that the k app of bzf with cl and cl2 was around 1 04 1010 and 3 24 108 m 1s 1 respectively lei et al 2019 hence the generation of cl2 via cl scavenge by cl would retard the transformation of bzf 16 clo h c l cl 2 o h 6 1 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 17 cl c l cl 2 8 5 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 as a result the combined effects of cl on the concentrations of oh and cl led to a decreased degradation of bzf by the ssl clo2 system light source in addition to ssl mitigation of clo2 by nsl and its ability to mitigate bzf were further tested the nsl with an intensity of 96 mw cm2 measured at the plane of the reaction solution by thorlabs optical power meter pm100d s405c before the experiment was obtained on a sunny day noon on june 26th wuyi university china 113⁰e 23⁰n as shown in fig 6 a clo2 could be efficiently decomposed by nsl where around 28 2 of clo2 was degraded within 60 min the slower mitigation rates of clo2 under photolysis by nsl compared to that by ssl were attributed to the weaker light intensity of nsl i e around one third that of the ssl the evolution kinetics of inorganic products of clo2 were monitored and shown in fig 6a concentrations of cl and clo3 gradually increased with their concentrations reaching 17 5 and 8 5 respectively after 60 min of reaction the yields of cl and clo3 were around 62 3 and 30 0 in line with the results obtained under ssl moreover bzf could be effectively degraded even by nsl photolysis of clo2 with k obs of 0 043 min 1 fig 6b the insert though the degradation rate of bzf under nsl was slower than that by ssl k obs of 0 13 min 1 it was still degraded by 71 6 in 30 min the above results indicated that clo2 could be considerably mitigated under photolysis by nsl along with the mitigation of micropollutants co present 3 5 mitigation of clo2 and bzf in realistic waters the mitigation of clo2 and bzf in different real waters groundwater gw surface water sw and effluents of wastewater treatment plant wwtp as compared to deionized water di was investigated the quality of those real waters was presented in table s3 to be noticed the phs of real waters was adjusted to 7 0 by naoh or h2so4 before experiments to ensure a comparison of the results with those obtained in buffered di water as shown in fig 7 a clo2 could be considerably mitigated in different water matrices with its rates following the order of wwtp sw gw di around 37 4 40 7 45 0 and 48 4 of clo2 was degraded in 30 min in di gw sw and wwtp respectively the faster degradation rates of clo2 in the effluent of wwtp than di water was likely related to the higher organic contents therein table s3 which could consume quantities of reactive species generated during clo2 photolysis thus leading to the faster consumption rate of clo2 therein similar results were also reported during photolysis of clo2 where the clo2 decomposition rate was increased with the addition of organic compounds e g benzoic acid even inert to clo2 peng et al 2022 furthermore bzf was also effectively degraded in each water with the degradation efficiency following the order of di gw sw wwtp contrary to that obtained for clo2 the results were not difficult to understand taking into account the scavenging effects of organic matters and anions e g cl and hco3 present in natural water and wastewater matrices even though bzf was the least degraded in effluents of wwtp it still reached to 73 6 in 30 min the results again indicated that micropollutants co present with clo2 could be considerably mitigated in natural waters under photolysis by solar light 4 conclusion this work for the first time demonstrated that clo2 could be effectively mitigated to cl and clo3 under photolysis by both simulated and natural solar light over a wide ph range meanwhile the generated reactive species including clo oh cl and o3 could induce the degradation of micropollutants co present the following conclusions could be obtained 1 clo2 could be effectively mitigated by solar photolysis wherein micropollutants co existed were degraded 2 clo2 was mainly transformed to cl and clo3 under photolysis by solar light cl dominated over clo3 at neutral to acid condition while clo3 prevailed at alkaline ph 3 micropollutants with diverse structures could be considerably mitigated by solar light photolysis of clo2 in this study the pseudo first order rate constants of bzf ibp atz cbz atl phenol and smx degradation by ssl clo2 ranged from 0 057 to 0 21 min 1 at ph 7 0 4 reactive species including clo oh cl and o3 were generated in ssl clo2 system and contributed to the degradation of micropollutants therein 5 increasing ph slightly decreased bzf degradation by ssl clo2 mainly due to the decreased quantum yield of clo2 therein 6 the presence of water matrices negatively affected bzf degradation by ssl clo2 mostly via the competitive consumption of reactive species 7 both clo2 and bzf could be efficiently mitigated by nsl or by ssl photolysis in different real waters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

15018,antibiotic resistance genes args in biofilters of drinking water treatment plants dwtps are regarded to be a remarkable potential health risk to human a global survey on args in biofilters may help evaluate their risk features as a whole this study aims to explore the compositions risks and ecological genesis of args in the biofilters of dwtps in total 98 metagenomes of dwtp biofilters were collected from sequence read archive sra of national center for biotechnology information ncbi and the main arg types were recognized with multidrug bacitracin and beta lactam as the first three types source water types surface water vs groundwater were found to significantly influence antibiotic resistome overpassing biofilter media and locations although arg abundances of surface water biofilters were approximately five times higher than that of groundwater biofilters the risk pattern of args was highly similar between surface water biofilters and groundwater biofilters and up to 99 61 of the args on average belong to the least risk and unassessed ranks and only 0 23 the highest risk rank monobactam biosynthesis pathway and prodigiosin biosynthesis pathway two antibiotics biosynthesis pathways were observed to be positively correlated with several arg types and total arg abundance in samples of surface water and groundwater biofilters respectively suggesting their potential roles in ecological genesis of args overall the results of this study would deepen our understanding of the arg risks in biofilters of dwtps and shed light on their ecological genesis inside graphical abstract image graphical abstract data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to increasing human usage and discharge of antibiotics antibiotic resistant genes args are enriched in the surrounding area of anthropogenic activity increased arg levels in the environment are expected to increase the probability of horizontal transfer to human pathogens resulting in antibiotic resistance pathogens hence args have been defined as emerging environmental contaminants pruden et al 2006 and have risen as emerging global concerns although args are currently regarded as notorious as a whole the risk of each arg sequence for human health varies largely zhang et al 2021 2022 the reasons for the differential health risk amongst arg sequences mainly lie in the various definitions of resistance and antibiotic resistance genes martínez et al 2014 for example there are up to three definitions of resistance currently martínez et al 2014 including 1 the clinical definition of antibiotic resistance based on minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoints 2 the epidemiological definition of antibiotic resistance enables determining low level resistance and 3 the operational definition of antibiotic resistance gene centric definition of resistance there are two main definitions of args martínez et al 2014 including 1 the ecological definition of args genes that protect an organism from the inhibitory effect of antimicrobial produced by neighbouring organism 2 the operational definition of args the gene that confers resistance to antibiotics when it is present or when it increases susceptibility to antibiotics when it is absent martínez et al 2007 therefore many args that are not relevant to human health or without further functional verification have been incorporated into arg databases widely used as references for arg quantification in metagenomic studies arg risk ranking is therefore a foundation for risk estimation of args and has been proposed for a long time bengtsson palme and larsson 2015 martínez et al 2014 two recent studies developed two arg risk ranking frameworks and provided related scripts zhang et al 2021 2022 both of which consider similar features of args including human accessibility human associated enrichment gene mobility pathogenicity host pathogenicity clinical availability according to the arg risk ranking framework developed by zhang et al 2021 human associated mobile args that are present in eskape enterococcus faecium staphylococcus aureus klebsiella pneumoniae acinetobacter baumannii pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter species pathogens are regarded as the highest risk rank rank i human associated args which are genetically mobile but absent in eskape pathogens are assigned to rank ii human associated but not mobile args are assigned to rank iii and args not enriched in human associated environments are assigned to the lowest risk rank rank iv these tools largely facilitate arg risk assessment in the metagenome args in drinking water have raised concerns recently in many countries people drink tap water directly without boiling it boiling had demonstrated to be much more efficient in removing intracellular and extracellular args in tap water than chlorination wan et al 2021b hence exposed to residual extracellular dna and microbes inside args in the drinking water purification process are receiving more and more attention including the source water dong et al 2019 xu et al 2016 biofiltration wan et al 2021a xu et al 2020 pipeline transportation xu et al 2016 yang et al 2020 arg accumulation in the filters of biofiltration wan et al 2021a xu et al 2020 and pipeline transportation xu et al 2016 was observed which further arose concerns about the health risk of args in drinking water treatment processes arg enrichment was commonly observed in environments contaminated by antibiotics heavy metals he et al 2017 polyaromatic hydrocarbons maurya et al 2021 and disinfectants zhang et al 2017 with antibiotics and heavy metals as the main selective stressors for args however the source water of drinking water is relatively clean and absent of high concentrations of exogenous contaminants of antibiotics or heavy metals hence arg enrichment in the biofilters of drinking water treatment can hardly be attributed to these exogenous contaminants and more likely resulted from endogenic ecological processes such as one organism producing antibiotics to inhibit the growth and metabolism of neighbouring microbes however the potential ecological genesis of args in dwtp biofilters had been largely unknown the objectives of this study were to 1 profile arg compositions in filter of drinking water biofiltration 2 estimate arg health risks there for human and 3 explore the potential ecological genesis of args 98 metagenomes of the drinking water biofiltration systems were collected globally and analysed using bioinformatics and statistics to achieve these goals the results of this study provide a comprehensive assessment of the health risks and ecological genesis of args in biofilters in drinking water biofiltration and could enhance our understanding of the health risks of args in biofilters in drinking water treatment plants 2 methods 2 1 data collection metagenome data of the biofilters in drinking water treatment plants were collected by the two following methods 1 searching against ncbi sra using a search strategy wgs strategy or wga strategy not amplicon strategy and sand filt and library layout paired properties and study type metagenomics properties and 2 searching against web of science using a search strategy ts filt and ti metagenomic or bioinformatic and ab drinking water in total 98 metagenome data in sra format were collected after some manual correction supplementary sheet metadata these samples are from china dutch denmark switzerland and the usa the source water includes surface water and groundwater the biofilter materials include sand activated carbon coal and their mixtures 2 2 metagenomic data processing the downloaded sra files were first transformed to paired end fastq format using a command fasterq dump split 3 e 10 mem 500 mb and the quality filter was conducted using fastp v0 23 1 chen et al 2018 with the default parameters to obtain clean reads to get better assembly performance metaspades v1 15 bankevich et al 2012 rather than the time efficient megahit li et al 2016 was used for the assembly of clean reads from each sample to harvest contigs arg risk assessment in zhang s study zhang et al 2021 was based on a relatively small arg database containing 4050 arg sequences which were mainly a subset of an extended arg database argoap v2 0 yin et al 2018 containing 12 085 arg sequences hence total arg abundance was estimated using scripts in argoap v2 0 yin et al 2018 based on a combined arg database containing 12 253 arg sequences supplementary sheet arg database containing arg sequences in zhang s study zhang et al 2021 and argoap v2 0 yin et al 2018 the resulting arg abundance at the sequence level was integrated with arg risk rank information at the sequence level from zhang s study zhang et al 2021 generating arg abundance at various risk ranks the kegg pathway abundances in each sample were estimated as follows the open reading frames orfs in each contig were predicted using prodigal v2 6 3 p meta and the amino acid sequence of orf was combined and clustered using cd hit v4 8 1 c 0 9 as 0 8 g 1 to generate a non reductant protein catalogue which was uploaded into kegg website for annotation using ghostkoala kanehisa et al 2016 the encoding nucleotide sequence of the non reductant protein catalogue was combined to generate a corresponding non reductant gene catalogue and the clean reads of each sample were then mapped to it using bbmap v 38 96 to estimate the abundance of non reductant genes under slow mapping mode the abundance of microbial community was estimated using kraken 2 software suite lu et al 2022 using a standard kraken 2 database downloaded on december 20 2022 containing reference sequences of bacteria archaea viral and fungi 2 3 statistic methods statistical results were considered significant at p 0 05 level principal coordinate analysis based on bray curtis distance was used to evaluate the overall antibiotic resistome profiles of all samples and a subset of samples from china that used sand as biofilter media the significance of the differences in antibiotic resistome profiles between groundwater and surface water biofilters were evaluated with a nonparametric dissimilarity test adonis total arg abundance the abundance of the ten most abundant types of args and args of different risk ranks in groundwater biofilters and surface water biofilters were compared with the wilcoxon test redundancy analysis rda was used to illustrate the correlations between major bacterial taxa genus level and the top five most abundant arg types the correlation between kegg pathways and arg abundance was explored with spearman s rank correlation coefficient ordinary least square ols regression between total arg abundance in groundwater biofilters with prodigiosin biosynthesis pathway and total arg abundance in surface water biofilters with monobactam biosynthesis pathway was analysed random forest modelling was used to evaluate the influence of multiple factors on arg abundance in drinking water biofilters 3 results and discussion 3 1 antibiotic resistome in drinking water biofilters 3 1 1 compositions of antibiotic resistome in biofilters the detected args confer resistance to sixteen types of commonly used antibiotics fig 1 a supplementary sheet arg abundance analysis of the classification of the identified args revealed that the composition of antibiotic resistomes in groundwater and surface water biofilters were different from each other fig 1a in groundwater biofilters args that confer resistance to bacteriocin were the most abundant type accounted for 40 61 of total arg abundance followed by multidrug resistance genes 33 32 then macrolide resistance genes 6 32 in surface water biofilters multidrug resistance genes were the most abundant type of arg 36 23 followed by beta lactam resistance genes 20 45 and bacitracin resistance genes 15 45 as the second and third most abundant types of args respectively interestingly for both groundwater biofilters and surface water biofilters the dominant types of args differed from the dominant types of args reported in corresponding water systems by previous studies for example wu et al 2020 reported that multidrug and beta lactam resistance genes were the main type of args in groundwater while sulfonamides multidrug and aminoglycosides were the most abundant types of args in surface water stoll et al 2012 found that arg encoding resistance to sulfonamides and trimethoprim were most frequently detected in surface water systems in both the northern and southern hemispheres other than multidrug resistance genes all the other types of args reported to be prevalent in water systems were found to have a low relative abundance less than 5 in our biofilter samples supplementary sheet arg abundance these findings indicated that the args in water biofilters might not originate mainly from source water and biofiltration may be related to the genesis and accumulation of some types args gu et al 2021 wan et al 2021a accumulation of args on water biofilters has been reported before and found to be related to the formation of biofilms which are hotspots for bacterial horizontal gene transfer wan et al 2021a xu et al 2020 considering the source waster of drinking water is very clean and absent from common arg enriching factors such as high concentrations of antibiotics and heavy metals the difference in antibiotic resistome between source water systems in previous studies and biofilters of drinking water in this study might point to a possibility that certain endogenous ecological factors inside the biofilters drive the antibiotic resistome to evolve greatly resulting in enrichment of args of ecological definition rather than clinical definition the ecological genesis of args in the biofilters will be explored in later section 3 1 2 distinct antibiotic resistome profiles in groundwater biofilters and surface water biofilters principal coordinate analysis showed that the overall compositions of resistome in the samples differed significantly based on source water type fig 1b which was supported by the result of the nonparametric dissimilarity test adonis r2 0 174 p 0 001 to eliminate the potential effects of biofilter media and or country of origin on resistome profile the resistome composition of a subset of samples from china that used sand as biofilter media was analysed fig s1 the results further confirmed that the resistome profiles for groundwater and surface water biofilters differed significantly from each other adonis r2 0 163 p 0 007 comparison of arg abundance in the two groups of samples showed that the abundances of args in surface water biofilters were significantly higher wilcoxon test p 0 001 than that in groundwater biofilters fig 1c fig s2 and was approximately five times higher than that of the latter 0 83 copy args cell vs 0 17 copy args cell 0 53 copy args 16s rdna vs 0 12 copy args 16s rdna supplementary sheet arg abundance these arg abundances are comparable to previous relevant studies wan et al 2021a xu et al 2020 in addition to total arg abundance the abundance of the ten most abundant types of args were all significantly lower wilcoxon test p 0 001 in groundwater biofilters than in surface water biofilters fig 1d fig s3 these results together indicated that source water type played a key role in influencing antibiotic resistome in drinking water biofilters rda analysis results and the taxa of bacterial contigs containing args showed that the differences in the resistome profiles might be related to the differences in the bacterial communities rda analysis of the correlations between the top five most abundant types of args and major bacterial genera 1 table s2 supplementary sheet abundance of bacterial species showed that in both groundwater biofilters and surface water biofilters hydrogenophaga which was abundant in both types of samples correlated with most selected args fig s4 however other than bacterial genera correlated with the selected args the two types of samples differed for example nitrosomonas nitrospira and pseudomonas strongly correlated with the selected args in groundwater biofilters but not the selected args in surface water biofilters while klebsiella and bosea had a strong correlation with the selected args in surface water biofilters but not in groundwater biofilters fig s4 the taxa of bacterial contigs containing args further supported that the differences in the resistome profiles were related to the differences in bacterial communities in these two types of water environments as shown in table s3 other than pseudomonas the bacterial genera with the highest arg counts were very different for groundwater and surface water biofilters 3 2 risk ranks of args and its influence factors as mentioned in the method section the abundance of args with risk ranks was estimated based on an arg database in zhang s study zhang et al 2021 accounting for only 33 4050 of 12 253 of the size of an arg database used for total arg abundance estimation however the summed abundance of args with risk rank information averagely accounted for 64 of the total arg abundance estimated based on the combined arg database supplementary sheet abundance of arg with a specific risk rank since the arg database with risk rank information was a random subset of the combined arg database the ratio amongst args of various risk ranks could represent the features of the whole antibiotic resistome as shown in fig 2 a most args detected in both groundwater biofilters 90 26 and surface water biofilters 88 46 had the lowest risk rank of iv in addition a considerable percentage of args 9 52 for groundwater biofilters and 10 54 for surface water biofilters could not be assigned to any risk rank unassessed hence args with least risk rank iv and without definite risk unassessed composed the absolute majority of args of biofilters of both source water types accounting for 99 78 and 99 41 99 61 on average of the total arg abundances in groundwater biofilters and surface water biofilters respectively supplementary sheet abundance of arg with a specific risk rank comparison of the abundance of args of various risk ranks in groundwater biofilters and surface water biofilters revealed that the abundance of rank i rank iv and unassessed args were significantly higher wilcoxon test p 0 001 in surface water biofilters than in groundwater biofilters fig 2b specifically the abundance and percentage of highest risk rank args rank i in surface water biofilters 4 17 10 3 arg copies cell 0 462 of total arg abundance were approximately 102 times and 16 times higher than that of groundwater biofilters 4 07 10 5 arg copies cell 0 028 of total arg abundance respectively the much higher abundance of highest ranked args in surface water biofilters than that in groundwater biofilters could be partially attributed to the probability that surface water is more prone to arg enriching contaminations of antibiotics and heavy metals before being used for drinking water source water in summary the majority 99 61 on average of args in biofilters are not human associated rank iv and unassessed and human associated args rank i only accounted for a very low ratio 0 23 on average our results illustrated that although args are prevalent in drinking water biofilters most args are either enriched in human associated environments or present in eskape pathogens therefore the potential public health risks of arg dissemination associated with drinking water biofiltration are much lower than expected when only the abundance of total args was considered neglecting the differential risk rank of various arg sequences we attributed this observation partly to the potential endogenic ecological processes such as one organism producing antibiotics to inhibit the growth and metabolism of neighbouring microbes and neighbouring microbes evolving to be resistant to the antibiotics resulting in enrichment of args of ecological definition rather than clinical definition if this was the case the previous observations of arg enrichment in biofilters wan et al 2021a and our observations that the majority of args in biofilters are not human associated would be interpreted simultaneously this speculation has been explored below 3 3 ecological genesis of args in biofilters the potential ecological genesis of args in biofilters was explored based on the hypothesis that abundances of some antibiotics biosynthesis kegg pathways in the metagenome would positively correlate to abundances of certain arg types subtypes in total 13 kegg pathways were identified manually to be relevant to antibiotic biosynthesis supplementary sheet antibiotics biosynthesis kegg pathways as expected correlation analysis revealed that prodigiosin biosynthesis was significantly spearman s correlation p 0 001 positively correlated with the abundance of several different types of args in groundwater biofilters but not significantly correlated with the abundance of any type of args in surface water biofilters in contrast monobactam biosynthesis was not significantly correlated with the abundance of any type of arg in groundwater biofilters but significantly correlated with the abundance of most of the major types of args in surface water biofilters table 1 ols regression analysis results further demonstrated that total arg abundance in groundwater biofilters and surface water biofilters had a significant and strong positive relationship with the kegg pathways of prodigiosin biosynthesis r2 0 263 p value 0 001 and monobactam biosynthesis r2 0 431 p value 0 001 respectively fig 3 a b monobactams are effective only against aerobic gram negative bacteria inhibit the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall greenwood and irving 2012 and are monocyclic and bacterially produced β lactam antibiotics monobactams showed the highest positive correlation cor r 0 803821 p value 0 with β lactam resistance table 1 and this observation was in line with expectations given monobactams biosynthesis pathway is just responsible for producing monobactams a type of monocyclic β lactam agents however no significant correlation was observed between the prodigiosin biosynthesis pathway and tested args table 1 although the prodigiosin biosynthesis pathway was significantly correlated spearman s rank correlation analysis p 0 001 with resistances of fosfomycin macrolide lincosamide streptogramin rifamycin tetracycline and unclassified the reasons may be attributed to three aspects 1 no prodigiosin resistance genes have been identified and they are missing in current arg databases including argoap v2 0 yin et al 2018 we used in this study 2 the role of prodigiosin in membrane disruption was proposed ravindran et al 2020 and the damaged membrane would facilitate arg spread via direct transfer of extracellular args containing sequences into cells and 3 the nutrients concentrations in groundwater are often extremely low including phosphate organics etc which would enhance prodigiosin biosynthesis since prodigiosin biosynthesis was known to be enhanced by phosphate limitation todd guay and demchick 1995 and low atp level per cell haddix 2021 the contributions of multiple factors filter media was not considered for groundwater samples as all groundwater biofilters used sand as biofilter media to the total abundance of args in drinking water biofilters were evaluated with a random forest model fig 3c d the results revealed that other than the biosynthesis pathway of certain antibiotic compounds bacterial community and location also contributed significantly p 0 05 to the total abundance of args in water biofilters it is not surprising that bacterial community played an important role in determining the presence of args as bacteria are both the hosts of args and the producers of antibiotic compounds that related to the genesis of args in water biofilters i e both prodigiosin and monobactam o sullivan et al 1982 williamson et al 2006 the observed differences in groundwater resistome and surface water resistome may also be partially explained by the differences in the bacterial communities in these two types of water systems ji et al 2022 the impact of location on arg abundance in water biofilters was very likely due to the differences in antibiotic use practices in different countries blommaert et al 2014 forslund et al 2013 however it should be noted that although anthropogenic antibiotic use patterns could significantly influence the antibiotic resistome profiles in drinking water biofilters they are not the main cause of the presence and accumulation of args in drinking water biofilters as shown by our results figs 2 and 3 most of the args detected in drinking water biofilters were not present in human associated environments and the abundance of args was largely determined by the biosynthesis of certain natural antibiotic compounds 4 conclusion in summary our findings show that the antibiotic resistome profiles in drinking water biofilters used to treat groundwater and surface water were distinct from each other and such differences are likely due to the bacterial communities and the biosynthesis of natural antimicrobial compounds in these two water systems specifically arg accumulation in the groundwaters is likely caused by prodigiosin compounds which can facilitate microbial gene transfer by damaging bacterial cell membranes while the antibiotic resistance in surface biofilters was more likely related to the selection pressure from naturally produced monobactam a kind of β lactam antibiotic compound in addition our study provided a first global scale investigation of antibiotic resistance in drinking water biofilters and showed that most of the args in drinking water biofilters were not enriched in human associated environments and had a very low human health risk this finding provides an important

15018,antibiotic resistance genes args in biofilters of drinking water treatment plants dwtps are regarded to be a remarkable potential health risk to human a global survey on args in biofilters may help evaluate their risk features as a whole this study aims to explore the compositions risks and ecological genesis of args in the biofilters of dwtps in total 98 metagenomes of dwtp biofilters were collected from sequence read archive sra of national center for biotechnology information ncbi and the main arg types were recognized with multidrug bacitracin and beta lactam as the first three types source water types surface water vs groundwater were found to significantly influence antibiotic resistome overpassing biofilter media and locations although arg abundances of surface water biofilters were approximately five times higher than that of groundwater biofilters the risk pattern of args was highly similar between surface water biofilters and groundwater biofilters and up to 99 61 of the args on average belong to the least risk and unassessed ranks and only 0 23 the highest risk rank monobactam biosynthesis pathway and prodigiosin biosynthesis pathway two antibiotics biosynthesis pathways were observed to be positively correlated with several arg types and total arg abundance in samples of surface water and groundwater biofilters respectively suggesting their potential roles in ecological genesis of args overall the results of this study would deepen our understanding of the arg risks in biofilters of dwtps and shed light on their ecological genesis inside graphical abstract image graphical abstract data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to increasing human usage and discharge of antibiotics antibiotic resistant genes args are enriched in the surrounding area of anthropogenic activity increased arg levels in the environment are expected to increase the probability of horizontal transfer to human pathogens resulting in antibiotic resistance pathogens hence args have been defined as emerging environmental contaminants pruden et al 2006 and have risen as emerging global concerns although args are currently regarded as notorious as a whole the risk of each arg sequence for human health varies largely zhang et al 2021 2022 the reasons for the differential health risk amongst arg sequences mainly lie in the various definitions of resistance and antibiotic resistance genes martínez et al 2014 for example there are up to three definitions of resistance currently martínez et al 2014 including 1 the clinical definition of antibiotic resistance based on minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoints 2 the epidemiological definition of antibiotic resistance enables determining low level resistance and 3 the operational definition of antibiotic resistance gene centric definition of resistance there are two main definitions of args martínez et al 2014 including 1 the ecological definition of args genes that protect an organism from the inhibitory effect of antimicrobial produced by neighbouring organism 2 the operational definition of args the gene that confers resistance to antibiotics when it is present or when it increases susceptibility to antibiotics when it is absent martínez et al 2007 therefore many args that are not relevant to human health or without further functional verification have been incorporated into arg databases widely used as references for arg quantification in metagenomic studies arg risk ranking is therefore a foundation for risk estimation of args and has been proposed for a long time bengtsson palme and larsson 2015 martínez et al 2014 two recent studies developed two arg risk ranking frameworks and provided related scripts zhang et al 2021 2022 both of which consider similar features of args including human accessibility human associated enrichment gene mobility pathogenicity host pathogenicity clinical availability according to the arg risk ranking framework developed by zhang et al 2021 human associated mobile args that are present in eskape enterococcus faecium staphylococcus aureus klebsiella pneumoniae acinetobacter baumannii pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter species pathogens are regarded as the highest risk rank rank i human associated args which are genetically mobile but absent in eskape pathogens are assigned to rank ii human associated but not mobile args are assigned to rank iii and args not enriched in human associated environments are assigned to the lowest risk rank rank iv these tools largely facilitate arg risk assessment in the metagenome args in drinking water have raised concerns recently in many countries people drink tap water directly without boiling it boiling had demonstrated to be much more efficient in removing intracellular and extracellular args in tap water than chlorination wan et al 2021b hence exposed to residual extracellular dna and microbes inside args in the drinking water purification process are receiving more and more attention including the source water dong et al 2019 xu et al 2016 biofiltration wan et al 2021a xu et al 2020 pipeline transportation xu et al 2016 yang et al 2020 arg accumulation in the filters of biofiltration wan et al 2021a xu et al 2020 and pipeline transportation xu et al 2016 was observed which further arose concerns about the health risk of args in drinking water treatment processes arg enrichment was commonly observed in environments contaminated by antibiotics heavy metals he et al 2017 polyaromatic hydrocarbons maurya et al 2021 and disinfectants zhang et al 2017 with antibiotics and heavy metals as the main selective stressors for args however the source water of drinking water is relatively clean and absent of high concentrations of exogenous contaminants of antibiotics or heavy metals hence arg enrichment in the biofilters of drinking water treatment can hardly be attributed to these exogenous contaminants and more likely resulted from endogenic ecological processes such as one organism producing antibiotics to inhibit the growth and metabolism of neighbouring microbes however the potential ecological genesis of args in dwtp biofilters had been largely unknown the objectives of this study were to 1 profile arg compositions in filter of drinking water biofiltration 2 estimate arg health risks there for human and 3 explore the potential ecological genesis of args 98 metagenomes of the drinking water biofiltration systems were collected globally and analysed using bioinformatics and statistics to achieve these goals the results of this study provide a comprehensive assessment of the health risks and ecological genesis of args in biofilters in drinking water biofiltration and could enhance our understanding of the health risks of args in biofilters in drinking water treatment plants 2 methods 2 1 data collection metagenome data of the biofilters in drinking water treatment plants were collected by the two following methods 1 searching against ncbi sra using a search strategy wgs strategy or wga strategy not amplicon strategy and sand filt and library layout paired properties and study type metagenomics properties and 2 searching against web of science using a search strategy ts filt and ti metagenomic or bioinformatic and ab drinking water in total 98 metagenome data in sra format were collected after some manual correction supplementary sheet metadata these samples are from china dutch denmark switzerland and the usa the source water includes surface water and groundwater the biofilter materials include sand activated carbon coal and their mixtures 2 2 metagenomic data processing the downloaded sra files were first transformed to paired end fastq format using a command fasterq dump split 3 e 10 mem 500 mb and the quality filter was conducted using fastp v0 23 1 chen et al 2018 with the default parameters to obtain clean reads to get better assembly performance metaspades v1 15 bankevich et al 2012 rather than the time efficient megahit li et al 2016 was used for the assembly of clean reads from each sample to harvest contigs arg risk assessment in zhang s study zhang et al 2021 was based on a relatively small arg database containing 4050 arg sequences which were mainly a subset of an extended arg database argoap v2 0 yin et al 2018 containing 12 085 arg sequences hence total arg abundance was estimated using scripts in argoap v2 0 yin et al 2018 based on a combined arg database containing 12 253 arg sequences supplementary sheet arg database containing arg sequences in zhang s study zhang et al 2021 and argoap v2 0 yin et al 2018 the resulting arg abundance at the sequence level was integrated with arg risk rank information at the sequence level from zhang s study zhang et al 2021 generating arg abundance at various risk ranks the kegg pathway abundances in each sample were estimated as follows the open reading frames orfs in each contig were predicted using prodigal v2 6 3 p meta and the amino acid sequence of orf was combined and clustered using cd hit v4 8 1 c 0 9 as 0 8 g 1 to generate a non reductant protein catalogue which was uploaded into kegg website for annotation using ghostkoala kanehisa et al 2016 the encoding nucleotide sequence of the non reductant protein catalogue was combined to generate a corresponding non reductant gene catalogue and the clean reads of each sample were then mapped to it using bbmap v 38 96 to estimate the abundance of non reductant genes under slow mapping mode the abundance of microbial community was estimated using kraken 2 software suite lu et al 2022 using a standard kraken 2 database downloaded on december 20 2022 containing reference sequences of bacteria archaea viral and fungi 2 3 statistic methods statistical results were considered significant at p 0 05 level principal coordinate analysis based on bray curtis distance was used to evaluate the overall antibiotic resistome profiles of all samples and a subset of samples from china that used sand as biofilter media the significance of the differences in antibiotic resistome profiles between groundwater and surface water biofilters were evaluated with a nonparametric dissimilarity test adonis total arg abundance the abundance of the ten most abundant types of args and args of different risk ranks in groundwater biofilters and surface water biofilters were compared with the wilcoxon test redundancy analysis rda was used to illustrate the correlations between major bacterial taxa genus level and the top five most abundant arg types the correlation between kegg pathways and arg abundance was explored with spearman s rank correlation coefficient ordinary least square ols regression between total arg abundance in groundwater biofilters with prodigiosin biosynthesis pathway and total arg abundance in surface water biofilters with monobactam biosynthesis pathway was analysed random forest modelling was used to evaluate the influence of multiple factors on arg abundance in drinking water biofilters 3 results and discussion 3 1 antibiotic resistome in drinking water biofilters 3 1 1 compositions of antibiotic resistome in biofilters the detected args confer resistance to sixteen types of commonly used antibiotics fig 1 a supplementary sheet arg abundance analysis of the classification of the identified args revealed that the composition of antibiotic resistomes in groundwater and surface water biofilters were different from each other fig 1a in groundwater biofilters args that confer resistance to bacteriocin were the most abundant type accounted for 40 61 of total arg abundance followed by multidrug resistance genes 33 32 then macrolide resistance genes 6 32 in surface water biofilters multidrug resistance genes were the most abundant type of arg 36 23 followed by beta lactam resistance genes 20 45 and bacitracin resistance genes 15 45 as the second and third most abundant types of args respectively interestingly for both groundwater biofilters and surface water biofilters the dominant types of args differed from the dominant types of args reported in corresponding water systems by previous studies for example wu et al 2020 reported that multidrug and beta lactam resistance genes were the main type of args in groundwater while sulfonamides multidrug and aminoglycosides were the most abundant types of args in surface water stoll et al 2012 found that arg encoding resistance to sulfonamides and trimethoprim were most frequently detected in surface water systems in both the northern and southern hemispheres other than multidrug resistance genes all the other types of args reported to be prevalent in water systems were found to have a low relative abundance less than 5 in our biofilter samples supplementary sheet arg abundance these findings indicated that the args in water biofilters might not originate mainly from source water and biofiltration may be related to the genesis and accumulation of some types args gu et al 2021 wan et al 2021a accumulation of args on water biofilters has been reported before and found to be related to the formation of biofilms which are hotspots for bacterial horizontal gene transfer wan et al 2021a xu et al 2020 considering the source waster of drinking water is very clean and absent from common arg enriching factors such as high concentrations of antibiotics and heavy metals the difference in antibiotic resistome between source water systems in previous studies and biofilters of drinking water in this study might point to a possibility that certain endogenous ecological factors inside the biofilters drive the antibiotic resistome to evolve greatly resulting in enrichment of args of ecological definition rather than clinical definition the ecological genesis of args in the biofilters will be explored in later section 3 1 2 distinct antibiotic resistome profiles in groundwater biofilters and surface water biofilters principal coordinate analysis showed that the overall compositions of resistome in the samples differed significantly based on source water type fig 1b which was supported by the result of the nonparametric dissimilarity test adonis r2 0 174 p 0 001 to eliminate the potential effects of biofilter media and or country of origin on resistome profile the resistome composition of a subset of samples from china that used sand as biofilter media was analysed fig s1 the results further confirmed that the resistome profiles for groundwater and surface water biofilters differed significantly from each other adonis r2 0 163 p 0 007 comparison of arg abundance in the two groups of samples showed that the abundances of args in surface water biofilters were significantly higher wilcoxon test p 0 001 than that in groundwater biofilters fig 1c fig s2 and was approximately five times higher than that of the latter 0 83 copy args cell vs 0 17 copy args cell 0 53 copy args 16s rdna vs 0 12 copy args 16s rdna supplementary sheet arg abundance these arg abundances are comparable to previous relevant studies wan et al 2021a xu et al 2020 in addition to total arg abundance the abundance of the ten most abundant types of args were all significantly lower wilcoxon test p 0 001 in groundwater biofilters than in surface water biofilters fig 1d fig s3 these results together indicated that source water type played a key role in influencing antibiotic resistome in drinking water biofilters rda analysis results and the taxa of bacterial contigs containing args showed that the differences in the resistome profiles might be related to the differences in the bacterial communities rda analysis of the correlations between the top five most abundant types of args and major bacterial genera 1 table s2 supplementary sheet abundance of bacterial species showed that in both groundwater biofilters and surface water biofilters hydrogenophaga which was abundant in both types of samples correlated with most selected args fig s4 however other than bacterial genera correlated with the selected args the two types of samples differed for example nitrosomonas nitrospira and pseudomonas strongly correlated with the selected args in groundwater biofilters but not the selected args in surface water biofilters while klebsiella and bosea had a strong correlation with the selected args in surface water biofilters but not in groundwater biofilters fig s4 the taxa of bacterial contigs containing args further supported that the differences in the resistome profiles were related to the differences in bacterial communities in these two types of water environments as shown in table s3 other than pseudomonas the bacterial genera with the highest arg counts were very different for groundwater and surface water biofilters 3 2 risk ranks of args and its influence factors as mentioned in the method section the abundance of args with risk ranks was estimated based on an arg database in zhang s study zhang et al 2021 accounting for only 33 4050 of 12 253 of the size of an arg database used for total arg abundance estimation however the summed abundance of args with risk rank information averagely accounted for 64 of the total arg abundance estimated based on the combined arg database supplementary sheet abundance of arg with a specific risk rank since the arg database with risk rank information was a random subset of the combined arg database the ratio amongst args of various risk ranks could represent the features of the whole antibiotic resistome as shown in fig 2 a most args detected in both groundwater biofilters 90 26 and surface water biofilters 88 46 had the lowest risk rank of iv in addition a considerable percentage of args 9 52 for groundwater biofilters and 10 54 for surface water biofilters could not be assigned to any risk rank unassessed hence args with least risk rank iv and without definite risk unassessed composed the absolute majority of args of biofilters of both source water types accounting for 99 78 and 99 41 99 61 on average of the total arg abundances in groundwater biofilters and surface water biofilters respectively supplementary sheet abundance of arg with a specific risk rank comparison of the abundance of args of various risk ranks in groundwater biofilters and surface water biofilters revealed that the abundance of rank i rank iv and unassessed args were significantly higher wilcoxon test p 0 001 in surface water biofilters than in groundwater biofilters fig 2b specifically the abundance and percentage of highest risk rank args rank i in surface water biofilters 4 17 10 3 arg copies cell 0 462 of total arg abundance were approximately 102 times and 16 times higher than that of groundwater biofilters 4 07 10 5 arg copies cell 0 028 of total arg abundance respectively the much higher abundance of highest ranked args in surface water biofilters than that in groundwater biofilters could be partially attributed to the probability that surface water is more prone to arg enriching contaminations of antibiotics and heavy metals before being used for drinking water source water in summary the majority 99 61 on average of args in biofilters are not human associated rank iv and unassessed and human associated args rank i only accounted for a very low ratio 0 23 on average our results illustrated that although args are prevalent in drinking water biofilters most args are either enriched in human associated environments or present in eskape pathogens therefore the potential public health risks of arg dissemination associated with drinking water biofiltration are much lower than expected when only the abundance of total args was considered neglecting the differential risk rank of various arg sequences we attributed this observation partly to the potential endogenic ecological processes such as one organism producing antibiotics to inhibit the growth and metabolism of neighbouring microbes and neighbouring microbes evolving to be resistant to the antibiotics resulting in enrichment of args of ecological definition

explored based on the hypothesis that abundances of some antibiotics biosynthesis kegg pathways in the metagenome would positively correlate to abundances of certain arg types subtypes in total 13

15019,algae dominate primary production in groundwater and oceans and play a critical role in global carbon dioxide fixation and climate change but are threatened by ongoing global warming events such as heatwaves and increasing microplastic mp pollution however whether and how ecologically important phytoplankton respond to the combined effects of warming and mps remain poorly understood we thus investigated the combined effects of these factors on carbon and nitrogen storage and the mechanisms underlying the alterations in the physiological performance of a model diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum exposed to a warming stressor 25 c compared with 21 c and polystyrene mp acclimation although warmer conditions decreased the cell viability the diatoms subjected to the synergistic effects of mps and warming showed significant increases in the growth rate 1 10 fold and nitrogen uptake rate 1 26 fold metabolomics and transcriptomic analyses revealed that mps and warming mainly promoted fatty acid metabolism the urea cycle glutamine and glutamate production and the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle due to an increased level of 2 oxoglutarate which is the hub of carbon and nitrogen metabolism and accounts for the acquisition and utilization of carbon and nitrogen our findings emphasize the nonnegligible effects of mps and hws on the algal carbon and nitrogen cycles in

due to their small sizes and have been detected in various water environments and organisms gao et al 2021 the photosynthesis and nitrogen cycling processes of phytoplankton may be significantly affected by mps prata et al 2019 the frequency of extreme climate events such as heatwaves hws which is another pressing stressor is increasing substantially and these events are lasting longer bartosiewicz et al 2021 consequently global warming will result in a marked decrease in the net primary production of waters schubert et al 2019 zhou et al 2022 compared with the effects of a single stressor the dual stresses of mps and hws on algae are of environmental significance whereas the related information in water remains largely unknown diatoms as typical algae are responsible for global net primary production and play key roles in biological carbon pumps in groundwater and oceans leblanc et al 2018 pandey et al 2017 algae in waters conduct photosynthesis and assimilatory processes such as nitrogen fixation nitrate reduction and ammonia uptake carey et al 2012 diatoms are affected by warming as revealed by a smaller cell size and alterations in the elemental composition and growth rate righetti et al 2019 high temperature also impairs photosynthetic electron transport and carbon fixation feijão et al 2018 for example diatoms exposed to mps exhibit growth inhibition and a reduced photosynthetic yield and these effects disrupt the carbon cycles in waters bellingeri et al 2019 bellingeri et al 2020 chen et al 2020 nitrogen assimilation and fixation provide bioavailable nitrogen e g ammonium salt for the ecosystem yan et al 2021 diatoms potentially save energy by promoting amino acid synthesis and nitrogen assimilation as rapid evolutionary responses to warming cheng et al 2022 thangaraj and sun 2021 however the combined effects of mps and warming on carbon storage and nitrogen assimilation in algae and the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown exploring the changes in carbon and nitrogen metabolism can help accurately project the combined effects of mps and warming on the biogeochemical cycles of diatoms microsized polystyrene is one of the most abundant classes of polymers detected in aquatic environments chen et al 2021 macleod et al 2021 given the possible rising temperature at the end of this century and the definition of a hw as lasting for at least 5 consecutive days polystyrene mp acclimated phaeodactylum tricornutum p tricornutum was subjected to three stages 15 d including pretreatment for 5 d exposure to a simulated hw 25 c for 5 d and transfer to benign conditions 21 c for 5 d to assess their physiological and metabolic responses and adaptation fig 1 a in the present study a key hypothesis is that carbon and nitrogen metabolism may play a key role in adaptation to the combined effects of mps and warming bellingeri et al 2020 cheng et al 2022 thangaraj and sun 2021 the physiological traits of carbon and nitrogen storage were investigated in detail using multiple techniques the findings provide a holistic understanding of the interactive effects of mps and hws on the regulation of growth photosynthesis nitrate utilization efficiency differentially expressed genes degs and differentially expressed metabolites dems in p tricornutum acclimation to mps enhanced nitrogen assimilation and carbon cycling in diatoms under warming conditions the ignored promotion of carbon and nitrogen storage observed in this study encourages a re evaluation of aqueous

3 1 mps increased the viability and nitrate utilization of diatoms the average size of the mps was approximately 1 μm fig s1a and the ftir spectrum of the mps showed c o stretching of alcohols 1000 1100 cm 1 and carbon double bonds 1600 1680 cm 1 fig s1b li et al 2019 xu et al 2019 the zeta potential of the mps in water and f 2 medium was negative fig s1c five days of acclimation to 10 mg l mps significantly increased the average cell number and particulate organic carbon poc content of p tricornutum figs s2 s4 exposure to mps reduced the chlorophyll a content compared with that of the control group fig 1b and this reduction can be potentially attributed to increases in the cell number and division rate of p tricornutum cheng et al 2022 the average photosynthetic efficiency fv fm relative electron transport rate retr and quantum yield of photosystem ii psii yii levels of the mps group were decreased by 9 33 5 and 19 3 respectively compared with those of the control group fig 1c e as shown in fig s5 mps attached to the diatom cell surfaces and this attachment may have decreased the chlorophyll content and photosynthetic activity through a shadowing effect prata et al 2018 the total protein and ros levels were slightly increased after acclimation to mps but the differences in the ros levels were not significant fig 1f and g mps significantly increased the algal cell membrane permeability and disturbed the homeostasis of the mitochondrial membrane potential fig 1h and i fig 1 shows the complicated responses of p tricornutum to mps however some studies have proposed that exposure to 10 mg l polystyrene mps 1 2 μm inhibits the growth of chlorella pyrenoidosa mao et al 2018 and exerts negative effects on the photosynthesis of p helgolandica which may be due to cellular internalization and metabolic disorders chen et al 2020 a previous study showed that mps ps 2 μm at a concentration of 3 96 μg l has no effect on photosynthesis in the marine diatom chaetoceros neogracile and a member of prymnesiophyceae tisochrysis lutea long et al 2017 the discrepancies in the responses of algae to mp exposure are determined by the algal species and the types and concentrations of mps in stage i mp acclimation increased the rate of extracellular no 3 uptake by 24 5 compared with that of the control group fig 2 a and after exposure to mps for 5 days the extracellular no 3 and no 2 concentrations in the media were reduced by 51 3 and 39 3 respectively fig 2b however the particulate organic nitrogen pon content of p tricornutum did not significantly differ between the control and 10 mg l mp treated groups fig 2c mp acclimation increased the level of nitrate reductase nr an enzyme essential for the assimilation of nitrate by approximately twofold fig 2d which was consistent with the detected increase in nitrate levels figs 2e f ammonium nitrogen is a critical precursor for conversion into nitrogen carrying amino acids tong et al 2019 exposure to mps decreased the nitrite reductase nir activity by 7 fig 2g and the nh 4 n level in algal cells by approximately 10 fig 2h nr catalyzes the reduction of nitrate to nitrite with electrons from reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nad p h levitan et al 2015 upon exposure to mps the nitrogen in diatom cells is primarily transported as no 3 n and no 2 n rather than nh 4 n in stage i the activities of glutamine synthetase gs and glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase gogat increased but were significantly after mp acclimation in stage ⅰ fig 2i and j the increased n uptake induced by mps treatment facilitated the growth of diatoms as evidenced by a higher cell density figs s2 and s3 and elevated nitrogen assimilation rates fig 2a the presence of mps altered the intracellular nitrogen storage forms and nitrogen assimilation processes as illustrated in fig 2k 3 2 mps accelerated nitrogen utilization under elevated temperature stress warmer temperatures may stimulate or restrict the growth of marine phytoplankton depending on the level of warming cheng et al 2022 righetti et al 2019 compared with 21 c hw treatment significantly inhibited the growth of diatoms but mp exposure still increased the cell number compared with that of the control group even under hw stress figs s6 and s7 the average growth rate of the mp treated algae under hw 25 c and 21 c conditions showed immediate and sustained increases 1 08 and 1 10 fold respectively p 0 05 compared with the control algae respectively fig 3 a b and s8 the aforementioned results implied that mp treatment enhanced the adaptation of diatoms to hw conditions p tricornutum exhibits three principal morphotypes triradiate fusiform and oval celi et al 2022 after p tricornutum was embedded in epoxy resin prior to tem imaging the algal samples were cut randomly using an ultramicrotome and were visualized using different cut sections and viewing angles the different morphotypes and viewing angles of the diatoms did not affect the reliability of the results because the effects of the different treatments on the diatoms were compared by analyzing the ultrastructure integrity and degree of damage to organelles e g mitochondrion cell wall nucleus and chloroplast as shown in fig s8 after exposure to mps and hw conditions slightly shrunken and concave algal surfaces were observed fig s9a whereas the intracellular ultrastructure showed no obvious damage fig s9b a nonmonotonic response was observed after mp and hw treatment figs s10 s13 which indicated that the concentrations of mps to which the diatoms were exposed may have been close to their tolerance threshold wu et al 2019 the algal cells had a significantly higher chlorophyll a content in the hw conditions 0 11 0 02 pg cell stage ⅱ than in the control environment 0 053 0 003 pg cell stage ⅱ as shown in fig 3c and s14 moderate warming drives intracellular transport processes and enzymatic turnover rates to affect phytoplankton growth and physiology raven and geider 1988 toseland et al 2013 and then increases the chlorophyll a level of diatoms however the mp and hw treatments did not significantly affect the intrinsic psii efficiency of the diatoms figs 3d g and s15 s17 similarly an insignificant change in the fv fm of skeletonema dohrnii has been observed under warm conditions chen et al 2020 the n uptake rate and pon level of mp acclimated p tricornutum were higher than those of the untreated group indicating that mps accelerated nitrogen uptake in diatoms fig 4 a and s18 s20 the mean 14n 15n ion count ratios of the mps hw group 2 13 obtained by nanosims imaging were stronger than those of the group subjected to the hw treatment alone 1 85 fig 4b and these ions were mainly distributed in the mitochondria and chloroplasts where the carbon and nitrogen cycles of p tricornutum occur fig 4c and d at 21 c nr activity in algae in stages ⅰ to ⅲ are increased by 1 88 fold 4 36 fold and 1 17 fold after mp acclimation respectively figs s21 in the diatoms exposed to hw conditions nr activity in algae in stages i to iii was increased by 1 88 fold 2 17 fold and 8 86 fold respectively after mp acclimation which was consistent with the observed depletion of extracellular nitrate fig 5 b s22 and s23 based on star plots of the integrated biomarker response version 2 ibrv2 index fig 5a the activities of nr and gs and the concentrations of extracellular no 3 n and no 2 n displayed high standardized values among the nine biomarkers mp treatment improved the uptake of nitrogen which was then decomposed by nr for the synthesis of amino acids in the diatoms the ibrv2 values 13 63 implied an obvious disturbance of the nitrogen assimilation process of p tricornutum after mp and hw treatment fig 5b temperature is a critical factor affecting the phytoplankton stoichiometry for both species and metabolic rates yvon durocher et al 2017 although the hw treatment decreased the nitrogen uptake rate and enzymatic activity mp acclimation facilitated the transformation of no 3 and the accumulation of nh 4 indicating that the combination of mp acclimation with hw treatment yielded an unexpected combined effect figs s20 and s21 3 3 molecular mechanisms underlying the observed increases in carbon and nitrogen storage we identified 688 degs in the mp hw exposed group compared with the hw group p value 0 05 and log2 fold change 1 figs s24 and s25 after mp acclimation under hw conditions genes enriched in fatty acid metabolism carbon metabolism and arginine biosynthesis were upregulated figs s26 and s27 the expression of 2 oxoglutarate which was identified as the hub gene closely coupled to the carbon and nitrogen metabolism of diatoms was upregulated with a log2 fold change ranging from 1 05 to 1 42 after the mp and hw treatments fig s28 to optimize their growth the first priority of diatoms is to assimilate nitrogen into proteins and use carbon skeletons that are primarily supplied by the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle tréguer et al 2018 the degs related to the tca cycle e g 7195620 7202926 and 7195500 were also upregulated with log2 fold changes of 1 4 1 14 and 1 35 respectively fig 6 a under stress conditions diatoms store 20 50 more carbon as energy in the form of lipids predominantly triacylglycerols tags hu et al 2008 corresponding to the observed upregulation of the genes fabf and fabi and alkanes involved in fatty acid metabolism biosynthesis after mp acclimation fig 6a fatty acid metabolism led to thermal adaptation and diatoms sustained a high growth rate under warmer conditions by supplying fatty acids liang et al 2019 collectively the results demonstrate that mp acclimation clearly increased energy metabolism and carbon acquisition and utilization to support high growth rates and stable ps ⅱ under hw conditions fig 6a s27 and s30 table s6 in the nitrogen assimilation process the most highly upregulated genes e g 7195539 7205108 7203740 and 7194881 with log2 fold changes of 1 16 1 08 1 48 and 1 47 respectively were associated with nitrate and urea uptake and assimilation fig 5d s31 and s32 table s7 these results were consistent with the detected increases in the cell growth rate and the content of nitrogen assimilating enzymes fig 3 s15 and s16 nitrate assimilation in the form of ornithine ammonia and aspartate occurs in the chloroplast smith et al 2019 after mp acclimation diatoms upregulated the degs 7203740 related to the production of glutamine and glutamate with the aim of providing a non exhausted supply of α ketoglutarate α kg to sustain nitrate assimilation in the chloroplast fig 6a the diatom ornithine urea cycle represents a key pathway for anaplerotic carbon fixation into nitrogenous compounds and is essential for diatom growth allen et al 2011 the degs e g 7194881 and 7197615 with log2 fold changes of 1 47 and 1 40 respectively related to the urea cycle were enhanced by mps fig 6a for the urea cycle to function as an arginine biosynthetic pathway during anabolic cellular states continuous nitrogen inputs in the form of ornithine ammonia and aspartate are needed kaliannan 2019 the diatom ornithine urea cycle ouc is an important cellular hub for the redistribution and turnover of inorganic carbon and nitrogen from catabolism and or photorespiration smith et al 2019 after mp acclimation and hw treatment we identified 14 degs related to highly nitrate sensitive hns genes for cellular processes e g nitrate and urea assimilation asp ala metabolism pro synthesis and nitrogen metabolism and these findings provide insights into the roles of mps in nitrate assimilation fig 6b the omics analysis provided a mechanistic understanding of the effects of mp acclimation and exposure to hw stress mp acclimation promoted enhancements in carbon and nitrogen utilization and energy generation from lipid catabolism which ultimately lead to thermal adaptation phytoplankton exhibit high phenotypic plasticity in the face of environmental stress due to their rapid generation capacity and strong adaptive potential under fluctuating environmental conditions zhang et al 2021 the readjustment of nutrient cycling and energy metabolism is an important adaptive strategy used by phytoplankton to adapt to mps and warming given the available evidence of the existence of global warming and increases in mp pollution the inputs and outputs of ocean nitrogen and carbon storage merit further consideration furthermore 66 metabolites involved in amino acid metabolism fatty acid metabolism and carbohydrate secondary metabolism were identified in the control and mp groups and the results are listed in a heatmap fig s33 principal component analysis pca fig s34 and the heatmap of the metabolites revealed that mps disturbed the metabolic profile the tca cycle which supplies the carbon skeletons for diatoms was primarily upregulated to optimize diatom growth fig s35 mp exposure upregulated the citrate cycle galactose biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and glycerolipid metabolism fig s35 based on these results p tricornutum cells respond to mp acclimation by increasing energy production through mechanisms involving carbohydrate catabolism and lipid catabolism in addition alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism were also upregulated fig s35 consistent with the observed increase in nitrogen assimilation fig 2 in contrast the synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies butanoate and pentose phosphate metabolism were downregulated fig s36 coefficient plots of the metabolites were created using an orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis opls da model with nitrogen uptake as the y variable and the metabolite as the x variable to distinguish the negative and positive contributions of metabolites to nitrogen related pathways fig s37 more than 15 metabolites e g nonanoic acid talose eicosapentaenoic acid and palmitic acid with variable importance in projection vip values greater than 1 2 exhibited a significant connection to the observed increase in n uptake by diatoms fig s37 this finding was consistent with the regulation of cell permeability by eicosapentaenoic acid which plays a beneficial role in membrane organization fig 1h and potentially promotes nitrogen transport into algal cells kawamoto et al 2009 the aforementioned changes in metabolism provide insights into the mechanisms through which mps and hw conditions affect carbon and nutrient storage in algal cells figs s38 s41 4 conclusion mp pollution in groundwater and oceans has become a global issue as a result of the increase in global temperature due to human activities efforts have been devoted to investigating the effect of warming on algae which offset greenhouse gas emissions however the combined effects of mps with hw conditions remain largely unknown particularly the effects on carbon and nitrogen cycles and storage in waters in this study mps with a diameter of 1 µm increased the expression of algal carbon and nitrogen metabolism related genes and promoted nitrogen utilization and growth under hw conditions mp acclimation mainly induced the urea cycle glutamine and glutamate production and the tca cycle through 2 oxoglutarate which is the hub of carbon and nitrogen metabolism this study provides an in depth understanding of the mechanism through which algae adapt to mps and warming environments as illustrated in fig 7 small diameter 1 µm mp pollution and warming may influence algal growth nutrient distributions and carbon cycling

15019,algae dominate primary production in groundwater and oceans and play a critical role in global carbon dioxide fixation and climate change but are threatened by ongoing global warming events such as heatwaves and increasing microplastic mp pollution however whether and how ecologically important phytoplankton respond to the combined effects of warming and mps remain poorly understood we thus investigated the combined effects of these factors on carbon and nitrogen storage and the mechanisms underlying the alterations in the physiological performance of a model diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum exposed to a warming stressor 25 c compared with 21 c and polystyrene mp acclimation although warmer conditions decreased the cell viability the diatoms subjected to the synergistic effects of mps and warming showed significant increases in the growth rate 1 10 fold and nitrogen uptake rate 1 26 fold metabolomics and transcriptomic analyses revealed that mps and warming mainly promoted fatty acid metabolism the urea cycle glutamine and glutamate production and the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle due to an increased level of 2 oxoglutarate which is the hub of carbon and nitrogen metabolism and accounts for the acquisition and utilization of carbon and nitrogen our findings emphasize the nonnegligible effects of mps and hws on the algal carbon and nitrogen cycles in waters keywords polystyrene microplastics algae nitrogen assimilation carbon storage warming data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction over 51 trillion pieces of microplastics mps plastic debris 5 mm are estimated to have accumulated in groundwater and oceans and that number is increasing allen et al 2022 van sebille et al 2015 mps exhibit high bioavailability due to their small sizes and have been detected in various water environments and organisms gao et al 2021 the photosynthesis and nitrogen cycling processes of phytoplankton may be significantly affected by mps prata et al 2019 the frequency of extreme climate events such as heatwaves hws which is another pressing stressor is increasing substantially and these events are lasting longer bartosiewicz et al 2021 consequently global warming will result in a marked decrease in the net primary production of waters schubert et al 2019 zhou et al 2022 compared with the effects of a single stressor the dual stresses of mps and hws on algae are of environmental significance whereas the related information in water remains largely unknown diatoms as typical algae are responsible for global net primary production and play key roles in biological carbon pumps in groundwater and oceans leblanc et al 2018 pandey et al 2017 algae in waters conduct photosynthesis and assimilatory processes such as nitrogen fixation nitrate reduction and ammonia uptake carey et al 2012 diatoms are affected by warming as revealed by a smaller cell size and alterations in the elemental composition and growth rate righetti et al 2019 high temperature also impairs photosynthetic electron transport and carbon fixation feijão et al 2018 for example diatoms exposed to mps exhibit growth inhibition and a reduced photosynthetic yield and these effects disrupt the carbon cycles in waters bellingeri et al 2019 bellingeri et al 2020 chen et al 2020 nitrogen assimilation and fixation provide bioavailable nitrogen e g ammonium salt for the ecosystem yan et al 2021 diatoms potentially save energy by promoting amino acid synthesis and nitrogen assimilation as rapid evolutionary responses to warming cheng et al 2022 thangaraj and sun 2021 however the combined effects of mps and warming on carbon storage and nitrogen assimilation in algae and the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown exploring the changes in carbon and nitrogen metabolism can help accurately project the combined effects of mps and warming on the biogeochemical cycles of diatoms microsized polystyrene is one of the most abundant classes of polymers detected in aquatic environments chen et al 2021 macleod et al 2021 given the possible rising temperature at the end of this century and the definition of a hw as lasting for at least 5 consecutive days polystyrene mp acclimated phaeodactylum tricornutum p tricornutum was subjected to three stages 15 d including pretreatment for 5 d exposure to a simulated hw 25 c for 5 d and transfer to benign conditions 21 c for 5 d to assess their physiological and metabolic responses and adaptation fig 1 a in the present study a key hypothesis is that carbon and nitrogen metabolism may play a key role in adaptation to the combined effects of mps and warming bellingeri et al 2020 cheng et al 2022 thangaraj and sun 2021 the physiological traits of carbon and nitrogen storage were investigated in detail using multiple techniques the findings provide a holistic understanding of the interactive effects of mps and hws on the

3 1 mps increased the viability and nitrate utilization of diatoms the average size of the mps was approximately 1 μm fig s1a and the ftir spectrum of the mps showed c o stretching of alcohols 1000 1100 cm 1 and carbon double bonds 1600 1680 cm 1 fig s1b li et al 2019 xu et al 2019 the zeta potential of the mps in water and f 2 medium was negative fig s1c five days of acclimation to 10 mg l mps significantly increased the average cell number and particulate organic carbon poc content of p tricornutum figs s2 s4 exposure to mps reduced the chlorophyll a content compared with that of the control group fig 1b and this reduction can be potentially attributed to increases in the cell number and division rate of p tricornutum cheng et al 2022 the average photosynthetic efficiency fv fm relative electron transport rate retr and quantum yield of photosystem ii psii yii levels of the mps group were decreased by 9 33 5 and 19 3 respectively compared with those of the control group fig 1c e as shown in fig s5 mps attached to the diatom cell surfaces and this attachment may have decreased the chlorophyll content and photosynthetic activity through a shadowing effect prata et al 2018 the total protein and ros levels were slightly increased after acclimation to mps but the differences in the ros levels were not significant fig 1f and g mps significantly increased the algal cell membrane permeability and disturbed the homeostasis of the mitochondrial membrane potential fig 1h and i fig 1 shows the complicated responses of p tricornutum to mps however some studies have proposed that exposure to 10 mg l polystyrene mps 1 2 μm inhibits the growth of chlorella pyrenoidosa mao et al 2018 and exerts negative effects on the photosynthesis of p helgolandica which may be due to cellular internalization and metabolic disorders chen et al 2020 a previous study showed that mps ps 2 μm at a concentration of 3 96 μg l has no effect on photosynthesis in the marine diatom chaetoceros neogracile and a member of prymnesiophyceae tisochrysis lutea long et al 2017 the discrepancies in the responses of algae to mp exposure are determined by the algal species and the types and concentrations of mps in stage i mp acclimation increased the rate of extracellular no 3 uptake by 24 5 compared with that of the control group fig 2 a and after exposure to mps for 5 days the extracellular no 3 and no 2 concentrations in the media were reduced by 51 3 and 39 3 respectively fig 2b however the particulate organic nitrogen pon content of p tricornutum did not significantly differ between the control and 10 mg l mp treated groups fig 2c mp acclimation increased the level of nitrate reductase nr an enzyme essential for the assimilation of nitrate by approximately twofold fig 2d which was consistent with the detected increase in nitrate levels figs 2e f ammonium nitrogen is a critical precursor for conversion into nitrogen carrying amino acids tong et al 2019 exposure to mps decreased the nitrite reductase nir activity by 7 fig 2g and the nh 4 n level in algal cells by approximately 10 fig 2h nr catalyzes the reduction of nitrate to nitrite with electrons from reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nad p h levitan et al 2015 upon exposure to mps the nitrogen in diatom cells is primarily transported as no 3 n and no 2 n rather than nh 4 n in stage i the activities of glutamine synthetase gs and glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase gogat increased but were significantly after mp acclimation in stage ⅰ fig 2i and j the increased n uptake induced by mps treatment facilitated the growth of diatoms as evidenced by a higher cell density figs s2 and s3 and elevated nitrogen assimilation rates fig 2a the presence of mps altered the intracellular nitrogen storage forms and nitrogen assimilation processes as illustrated in fig 2k 3 2 mps accelerated nitrogen utilization under elevated temperature stress warmer temperatures may stimulate or restrict the growth of marine phytoplankton depending on the level of warming cheng et al 2022 righetti et al 2019 compared with 21 c hw treatment significantly inhibited the growth of diatoms but mp exposure still increased the cell number compared with that of the control group even under hw stress figs s6 and s7 the average growth rate of the mp treated algae under hw 25 c and 21 c conditions showed immediate and sustained increases 1 08 and 1 10 fold respectively p 0 05 compared with the control algae respectively fig 3 a b and s8 the aforementioned results implied that mp treatment enhanced the adaptation of diatoms to hw conditions p tricornutum exhibits three principal morphotypes triradiate fusiform and oval celi et al 2022 after p tricornutum was embedded in epoxy resin prior to tem imaging the algal samples were cut randomly using an ultramicrotome and were visualized using different cut sections and viewing angles the different morphotypes and viewing angles of the diatoms did not affect the reliability of the results because the effects of the different treatments on the diatoms were compared by analyzing the ultrastructure integrity and degree of damage to organelles e g mitochondrion cell wall nucleus and chloroplast as shown in fig s8 after exposure to mps and hw conditions slightly shrunken and concave algal surfaces were observed fig s9a whereas the intracellular ultrastructure showed no obvious damage fig s9b a nonmonotonic response was observed after mp and hw treatment figs s10 s13 which indicated that the concentrations of mps to which the diatoms were exposed may have been close to their tolerance threshold wu et al 2019 the algal cells had a significantly higher chlorophyll a content in the hw conditions 0 11 0 02 pg cell stage ⅱ than in the control environment 0 053 0 003 pg cell stage ⅱ as shown in fig 3c and s14 moderate warming drives intracellular transport processes and enzymatic turnover rates to affect phytoplankton growth and physiology raven and geider 1988 toseland et al 2013 and then increases the chlorophyll a level of diatoms however the mp and hw treatments did not significantly affect the intrinsic psii efficiency of the diatoms figs 3d g and s15 s17 similarly an insignificant change in the fv fm of skeletonema dohrnii has been observed under warm conditions chen et al 2020 the n uptake rate and pon level of mp acclimated p tricornutum were higher than those of the untreated group indicating that mps accelerated nitrogen uptake in diatoms fig 4 a and s18 s20 the mean 14n 15n ion count ratios of the mps hw group 2 13 obtained by nanosims imaging were stronger than those of the group subjected to the hw treatment alone 1 85 fig 4b and these ions were mainly distributed in the mitochondria and chloroplasts where the carbon and nitrogen cycles of p tricornutum occur fig 4c and d at 21 c nr activity in algae in stages ⅰ to ⅲ are increased by 1 88 fold 4 36 fold and 1 17 fold after mp acclimation respectively figs s21 in the diatoms exposed to hw conditions nr activity in algae in stages i to iii was increased by 1 88 fold 2 17 fold and 8 86 fold respectively after mp acclimation which was consistent with the observed depletion of extracellular nitrate fig 5 b s22 and s23 based on star plots of the integrated biomarker response version 2 ibrv2 index fig 5a the activities of nr and gs and the concentrations of extracellular no 3 n and no 2 n displayed high standardized values among the nine biomarkers mp treatment improved the uptake of nitrogen which was then decomposed by nr for the synthesis of amino acids in the diatoms the ibrv2 values 13 63 implied an obvious disturbance of the nitrogen assimilation process of p tricornutum after mp and hw treatment fig 5b temperature is a critical factor affecting the phytoplankton stoichiometry for both species and metabolic rates yvon durocher et al 2017 although the hw treatment decreased the nitrogen uptake rate and enzymatic activity mp acclimation facilitated the transformation of no 3 and the accumulation of nh 4 indicating that the combination of mp acclimation with hw treatment yielded an unexpected combined effect figs s20 and s21 3 3 molecular mechanisms underlying the observed increases in carbon and nitrogen storage we identified 688 degs in the mp hw exposed group compared with the hw group p value 0 05 and log2 fold change 1 figs s24 and s25 after mp acclimation under hw conditions genes enriched in fatty acid metabolism carbon metabolism and arginine biosynthesis were upregulated figs s26 and s27 the expression of 2 oxoglutarate which was identified as the hub gene closely coupled to the carbon and nitrogen metabolism of diatoms was upregulated with a log2 fold change ranging from 1 05 to 1 42 after the mp and hw treatments fig s28 to optimize their growth the first priority of diatoms is to assimilate nitrogen into proteins and use carbon skeletons that are primarily supplied by the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle tréguer et al 2018 the degs related to the tca cycle e g 7195620 7202926 and 7195500 were also upregulated with log2 fold changes of 1 4 1 14 and 1 35 respectively fig 6 a under stress conditions diatoms store 20 50 more carbon as energy in the form of lipids predominantly triacylglycerols tags hu et al 2008 corresponding to the observed upregulation of the genes fabf and fabi and alkanes involved in fatty acid metabolism biosynthesis after mp acclimation fig 6a fatty acid metabolism led to thermal adaptation and diatoms sustained a high growth rate under warmer conditions by supplying fatty acids liang et al 2019 collectively the results demonstrate that mp acclimation clearly increased energy metabolism and carbon acquisition and utilization to support high growth rates and stable ps ⅱ under hw conditions fig 6a s27 and s30 table s6 in the nitrogen assimilation process the most highly upregulated genes e g 7195539 7205108 7203740 and 7194881 with log2 fold changes of 1 16 1 08 1 48 and 1 47 respectively were associated with nitrate and urea uptake and assimilation fig 5d s31 and s32 table s7 these results were consistent with the detected increases in the cell growth rate and the content of nitrogen assimilating enzymes fig 3 s15 and s16 nitrate assimilation in the form of ornithine ammonia and aspartate occurs in the chloroplast smith et al 2019 after mp acclimation diatoms upregulated the degs 7203740 related to the production of glutamine and glutamate with the aim of providing a non exhausted supply of α ketoglutarate α kg to sustain nitrate assimilation in the chloroplast fig 6a the diatom ornithine urea cycle represents a key pathway for anaplerotic carbon fixation into nitrogenous compounds and is essential for diatom growth allen et al 2011 the degs e g 7194881 and 7197615 with log2 fold changes of 1 47 and 1 40 respectively related to the urea cycle were enhanced by mps fig 6a for the urea cycle to function as an arginine biosynthetic pathway during anabolic cellular states continuous nitrogen inputs in the form of ornithine ammonia and aspartate are needed kaliannan 2019 the diatom ornithine urea cycle ouc is an important cellular hub for the redistribution and turnover of inorganic carbon and nitrogen from catabolism and or photorespiration smith et al 2019 after mp acclimation and hw treatment we identified 14 degs related to highly nitrate sensitive hns genes for cellular processes e g nitrate and urea assimilation asp ala metabolism pro synthesis and nitrogen metabolism and these findings provide insights into the roles of mps in nitrate assimilation fig 6b the omics analysis provided a mechanistic understanding of the effects of mp acclimation and exposure to hw stress mp acclimation promoted enhancements in carbon and nitrogen utilization and energy generation from lipid catabolism which ultimately lead to thermal adaptation phytoplankton exhibit high phenotypic plasticity in the face of environmental stress due to their rapid generation capacity and strong adaptive potential under fluctuating environmental conditions zhang et al 2021 the readjustment of nutrient cycling and energy metabolism is an important adaptive strategy used by phytoplankton to adapt to mps and warming given the available evidence of the existence of global warming and increases in mp pollution the inputs and outputs of ocean nitrogen and carbon storage merit further consideration furthermore 66 metabolites involved in amino acid metabolism fatty acid metabolism and carbohydrate secondary metabolism were identified in the control and mp groups and the results are listed in a heatmap fig s33 principal component analysis pca fig s34 and the heatmap of the metabolites revealed that mps disturbed the metabolic profile the tca cycle which supplies the carbon skeletons for diatoms was primarily upregulated to optimize diatom growth fig s35 mp exposure upregulated the citrate cycle galactose biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and glycerolipid metabolism fig s35 based on these results p tricornutum cells respond to mp acclimation by increasing energy production through mechanisms involving carbohydrate catabolism and lipid catabolism in addition alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism were also upregulated fig s35 consistent with the observed increase in nitrogen assimilation fig 2 in contrast the synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies butanoate and pentose phosphate metabolism were downregulated fig s36 coefficient plots of the metabolites were created using an orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis opls da model with nitrogen uptake as the y variable and the metabolite as the x variable to distinguish the negative and positive contributions of metabolites to nitrogen related pathways fig s37 more than 15 metabolites e g nonanoic acid talose eicosapentaenoic acid and palmitic acid with variable importance in projection vip values greater than 1 2 exhibited a significant connection to the observed increase in n uptake by diatoms fig s37 this finding was consistent with the regulation of cell permeability by eicosapentaenoic acid which plays a beneficial role in membrane organization fig 1h and potentially promotes nitrogen transport into algal cells kawamoto et al 2009 the aforementioned changes in metabolism provide insights into the mechanisms through which mps and hw conditions affect carbon and nutrient storage in algal cells figs s38 s41 4 conclusion mp pollution in groundwater and oceans has become a global issue as a result of the increase in global temperature due to human activities efforts have been devoted to investigating the effect of warming on algae which offset greenhouse gas emissions however the combined effects of mps with hw conditions remain largely unknown particularly the effects on carbon and nitrogen cycles and storage in waters in this study mps with a diameter of 1 µm increased the expression of algal carbon and nitrogen metabolism related genes and promoted nitrogen utilization and growth under hw conditions mp acclimation mainly induced the urea cycle glutamine and glutamate production and the tca cycle through 2 oxoglutarate which is the hub of carbon and nitrogen metabolism this study provides an in depth understanding of the mechanism through which algae adapt to mps and warming environments as illustrated in fig 7 small diameter 1 µm mp pollution and warming may influence algal growth nutrient distributions and carbon cycling alterations in diatom nitrogen metabolism have far reaching implications for the phytoplankton community structure and marine fertility including modifications to biogeochemical cycles zehr and capone
