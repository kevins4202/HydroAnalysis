24480,we present the qtac r package which enables the analysis and assessment of general complex systems in terms of the adaptive cycle metaphor according to the metaphor complex systems typically develop through alternating phases of consolidation and reorganization being defined by the systemic properties of potential connectedness and resilience qtac builds on a recently published universal method of quantifying the adaptive cycle based on time series of abundance data networks of information transfer are estimated yielding insight into the internal interaction structure of the system and the functional role of its components potential connectedness and resilience are computed on basis of the information networks defining the system s course through the cycle we illustrate the application of qtac via an exemplary case study on grassland communities graphical abstract keywords complex systems adaptive cycle information networks r package biodiversity 1 software and data availability statement the qtac r package is available through the github repository schrenk et al 2020b under the mit license it was first released in august 2020 the code runs on windows and linux operating systems with r version 3 6 or higher all data used in this article is provided as supplementary material of the paper and through the github repository 2 introduction understanding complex systems remains one of the most challenging endeavors in many scientific disciplines ranging from ecology over economy to social sciences a particular difficulty lies in the fact that emerging system wide phenomena need to be connected with the specific functional role of single components to get a concise picture an established qualitative framework for the assessment of complex systems is provided by the adaptive cycle metaphor it was originally introduced in ecological context by holling in 1986 holling 1986 and taken up in a more general form in the course of gunderson s and holling s panarchy concept in the early 2000s gunderson and holling 2002 the metaphor describes complex systems development as alternation of phases of growth consolidation and predictability with phases of release reorganization and stochasticity recently a generally applicable method to quantify the adaptive cycle on basis of abundance data has been published by zu castell and schrenk 2020 in contrast to previously published methods of quantifying the adaptive cycle e g beier et al 2009 pelling and manuel navarrete 2011 and angeler et al 2016 it is independent of the concrete instantiation of the underlying system in this article we present the qtac r package which allows a straightforward application of this method according to the adaptive cycle metaphor the development of complex systems is shaped by three systemic properties the system s potential to react to future changes the connectedness among its components and the system s resilience capturing the ability of the system to counteract unexpected perturbations phases of growth and consolidation are characterized by an increase in potential and connectedness at the cost of resilience sudden decreases in connectedness and potential accompanied by sudden increases in resilience mark the beginning of phases of release and reorganization this interplay allows a complex system to repeatedly adapt to a changing environment in balancing stability and adaptability the method presented by zu castell and schrenk provides a way to estimate the course of a system through the adaptive cycle for arbitrary complex systems it has been applied to both real and simulated data zu castell and schrenk 2020 schrenk et al 2021 the method consists of two main steps in the first step pairwise transfer entropy as being defined in schreiber 2000 is estimated on basis of time series of abundance data considering the system s components as nodes and the transfer entropy as edges this step yields a directed weighted network capturing a model of the system s interaction structure in the second step potential connectedness and resilience are computed on basis of the inferred information network here the definitions of potential and connectedness are inspired by notions introduced by ulanowicz in the course of his ascendancy theory see e g ulanowicz et al 2009 a variant of the common spectral graph theoretical notion of connectivity see e g chung 1997 is used to measure resilience by shifting the time frame serving as basis for the estimation of transfer entropy in the first step a series of networks and thereby of the three systemic variables can be determined with the latter allowing to assess system wide behavior and the networks giving insights into the role of single components the method provides a holistic approach for the analysis of complex systems so far case studies on ecological economic and microbiological systems have been conducted in zu castell and schrenk 2020 and schrenk et al 2020a 2021 the r package qtac quantifying the adaptive cyle makes the method accessible to the scientific community the functions included in the package allow for a straightforward import of the data estimation of information networks and computation of the systemic variables the information theoretic estimations are based on functions provided by the jidt toolkit lizier 2014 via various parameters the user can adjust the estimation to the system properties and the underlying question qtac offers two and three dimensional visualization of the results at first we present the qtac workflow including a description of its main functions subsequently we illustrate the application of the method and common follow up analyses using an example of grassland communities of varying species and functional richness the underlying data was collected in course of the jena experiment weisser et al 2017 a long term biodiversity experiment possibilities and limits of system and parameter choice are discussed in the course of this case study we conclude with a short outlook on planned enhancements of the package 3 qtac workflow as schematically displayed in fig 1 qtac offers a simple and clear workflow which is organized around the two main steps of the underlying method see zu castell and schrenk 2020 for details in the following we will present the workflow in more detail 3 1 input data in order to conduct a system analysis with qtac the user needs to provide time series of abundance data by abundance data we denote any kind of data reflecting the strength of a component and capturing the success or failure resulting from its interactions the term abundance therefore is used in a more general sense in an ecosystem abundance of species could for example be quantified via biomass or the number of individuals in an economic system the capital or the number of employees may quantify abundances of a company note that both type of components and unit of abundances may differ from each other within the observed system since qtac estimates the degree of randomness in time series data the approach is independent of the concrete instantiation of the time series hence an ecosystem could for example include animal species quantified by their number of individuals and plant species quantified by their respective biomass however qtac relies on equidistantly sampled time series if this is not the case this property can be achieved by a preceeding interpolation step besides time series need to have a length of at least five time points since otherwise a reliable statistical estimation is not feasible as for the overall lengths of the time series the package can easily deal with longer series obviously longer series lead to increased computing effort also interpretability of the results depends on enough data being available 3 2 estimating and visualizing information dynamics the main function qtac allows the user to extract information dynamics from time series data by information dynamics we denote the temporal change of the network of pairwise information transfer resulting from effective interactions among the system s components let a 1 a n and b 1 b n denote the time series of abundance data of two components a and b respectively following the methodology described in zu castell and schrenk 2020 directed information transfer t b a from b to a at time point t is determined on basis of their abundance data within a preceeding time window a t w 1 a t and b t w 1 b t respectively the size w of this time window is user defined note that the choice of this and all further parameters requires a certain background knowledge of the observed system optionally some of the parameters can be estimated using appropriate optimization methods see e g lizier 2014 sensitivity analyses should be conducted to study the impact of the parameter choices in qtac information transfer is quantified by the established measure of transfer entropy schreiber 2000 it is estimated by means of the kraskov stögbauer grassberger estimator as being incorporated in the jidt toolkit lizier 2014 various customizable parameters are inherited from this toolkit the estimator is based on the principles of a simple kernel estimator and is optimized to deal with small sample sizes see kaiser and schreiber 2002 and kraskov et al 2004 for details this procedure is repeated for every ordered pair of components and every time point w t n note that if the length of the timeseries is below 15 two additional data points are interpolated between each pair of data points a i a i 1 by means of a piecewise cubic spline before the estimation thereby increasing stability of the results the spline function is computed using the r package pracma borchers 2019 qtac conducts a significance test as part of the estimations this bootstrapping test is part of the jidt toolkit lizier 2014 the function qtac signfactor allows the user to filter the results of qtac with respect to their significance before further processing using the function qtac networks the user can visualize the estimated information dynamics in form of a series of directed weighted networks the nodes of which represent the system s components and the edges of which represent the respective information transfer the visualization function is based on the r package igraph and offers various layout options inherited from this package csardi and nepusz 2006 3 3 computing and visualizing the systemic variables following the method by zu castell and schrenk 2020 potential connectedness and resilience are defined as properties of the system s information network at the respective time consider the directed weighted network g of information transfers e among the system s components v at time point t i e g v e b a b a v v with weight function ω v v r 0 e b a t b a then the system s potential at the given time is defined as p y x v v t y x log 2 t y x t and the system s connectedness as c y x v v t y x log 2 t y x t x v t y x y v t y x where t y x v v t y x the two definitions are inspired by the information theoretical measures of capacity and ascendancy which were originally introduced by ulanowicz et al 2009 the definition of resilience given by zu castell and schrenk 2020 is the directed analog to the established spectral graph theoretical measure of connectivity see e g chung 1997 with a denoting the adjacency matrix of g d o u t and d i n its directed degree matrices and c 0 a standardization constant the graph s directed laplacian matrices are given as l o u t c d o u t 1 2 d o u t a and l i n c d i n a d i n 1 2 then resilience is defined as the smallest real part of the non trivial eigenvalues of l o u t and l i n i e r min r σ σ spec l o u t spec l i n σ 0 in qtac the computation of the systemic variables on basis of a series of information networks is performed by the function qtac maturation here the user can choose between different standardization constants c especially when comparing different systems standardization can prove useful in order to choose a suitable value the user should answer questions like should resilience in this case depend on the absolute edge weights of the information network g consequently should a complete network with uniform edge weight 2 be more resilient than a complete network with uniform edge weight 1 or should the resilience depend on the number of nodes of g hence should a complete network on 10 nodes be more resilient than a complete network on 5 nodes there are no generally applicable answers to these questions they depend on the specific research question and the context to be studied only the inherent relative nature of the notion of resilience has been frequently discussed compare e g allen et al 2018 let m denote the maximal edge weight of g then qtac provides non trivial standardization with respect to the number of nodes of g via c n 1 n with respect to the maximal edge weight of g via c 1 m or with respect to both via c n 1 n m the function returns a series of the three systemic variables defining the system s course through the adaptive cycle in the respective time period qtac offers various possibilities to visualize the development of the systemic variables via qtac 2dplot the variables can be plotted separately against time the function qtac 2dmixplot returns two dimensional plots as well with two variables plotted against each other in order to visualize the development of the variables in the typical layout of the adaptive cycle metaphor qtac provides the function qtac 3dplot it is based on the r package rgl adler et al 2019 and returns a three dimensional plot of the variables which can be rotated and thereby examined from different angles in all cases a curve through the data points is computed via a piecewise cubic smoothing spline which is inherited from the r package pracma borchers 2019 4 use case exploring grassland communities we illustrate the application of qtac by means of an exemplary test case of grassland communities the data underlying this test case stems from the jena experiment a grassland biodiversity experiment located near jena germany see weisser et al 2017 within the last years a multitude of studies has been performed on basis of data gained in the experiment covering biodiversity effects on aboveground productivity marquard et al 2013 diversity stability relationships roscher et al 2011 and effects of management intensity on grassland resistance vogel et al 2012 in the course of the main experiment 82 plots of 20 m 20 m were set up on former arable land in 2002 mixtures of 1 2 4 8 16 and 60 regional grassland species were established in these plots the species had been assigned to four functional groups in advance namely grasses small herbs tall herbs and legume species the composition of species in each plot was determined randomly with constraints to ensure all possible combinations of species number and number of functional groups twice a year the plots were mown and non sown species were weeded aside from that no further treatments took place see jena experiment 2002 for a description of the main experiment including a list of all 60 species and their respective functional group in the following case study we investigate and compare the systemic development of the 34 communities of at least 8 species our analysis is based on species specific biomass data collected once a year from 2002 to 2010 in june prior to the first mowing weigelt et al 2016 we provide the data and code underlying the following figures with this article data casestudies 7z results casestudies 7z and code casestudies md we want to demonstrate the exploration of a single plant system namely the community in plot b4a18 in which 16 species of four different functional groups were sown the data is part of weigelt et al 2016 we recommend to always inspect the time series data before starting the analysis to get a first impression of the system at hand see fig 2 a in order to gain an insight into the information dynamics we want to study the development of the system s information network recall that the network at a given time point is estimated on basis of a window of a fixed length of preceding abundance data thereby every network reflects a temporally more local rather than the global information structure of the system by shifting the window along the time series the development of the information structure can be captured with the window size determining the time point of the earliest network estimated a larger window size generally leads to a shorter analysis period the choice of this parameter is always a trade off between statistical stability provided by large window sizes and a more precise temporal resolution gained by small window sizes qtac generally does not accept window sizes below five in order to guarantee statistical reliability of the results in order to extract and follow the strong dynamics in abundance data of plot b4a18 fig 2 a we need the analysis period to start as early as possible hence we choose a window size of w 5 years allowing us to analyze the system s information structure from 2006 on crucial parameters for estimating transfer entropy are the time and species independent embedding length of source l w and destination past history k w see schreiber 2000 they should be chosen in a way such that knowing the past l states of the source variable no further relevant information about its next state is gained by extending to more than l states the same applies for k and the destination variable due to computational reasons k l 1 is a common choice however choosing k too small information being contained in the past of the destination variable may be erroneously considered as information transfer from the source variable equally choosing l too large information transfer might be over estimated as well on the other hand choosing l too small or k too large an existing information transfer might not be recognized compare e g lizier 2014 in the absence of sufficient background knowledge of the system components one can estimate the embedding lengths using for example the ragwitz optimization method as provided with the jidt toolkit lizier 2014 recall that in the case of a window size below 15 two additional data points are interpolated between each pair of successive data points hence one originally preceeding data point corresponds to three interpolated preceeding data points the user should be aware of this fact when choosing the history lengths in the case of community b4a18 we choose a history length of four corresponding to almost one and a half years in reality a sensitivity analysis shows that our results are robust with respect to both a slightly lower and slightly higher history length compare fig a 1 we choose a comparably low level of random gaussian noise added in the estimation namely 1e 30 a certain amount of noise is required to guarantee the functioning of the estimator see kraskov 2008 however especially in the case of short time series high noise levels can lead to very unstable results our choice is based on a sensitivity analysis conducted in advance fig a 2 displays the mean and standard deviation of the systemic variables for different levels of noise added and 20 computations each clearly potential is robust across all levels of random noise connectedness shows to be robust for all noise levels except for 1e 08 a 2 a note that this is the default value of random noise in the jidt package resilience shows a high standard deviation across all noise levels this is due to the fact that resilience in contrast to potential and connectedness is a local measure being highly sensitive to the existence or non existence of single edges in the underlying information network using a noise level of 1e 30 the only value showing a remarkably high standard deviation is the resilience in 2008 before analyzing a specific information network in detail the user should compare the networks of different runs to get a better understanding of what edges might lead to jumps in resilience the respective information transfers should be interpreted with care based on the chosen parameters the function qtac returns adjacency and significance matrices for every year between 2006 and 2010 we filter the results using a significance level of 0 1 in this specific case lower significance levels lead to consistently very sparse adjacency matrices suggesting that structuring information transfer was lost in the process of filtering fig a 3 shows the systemic variables for lower significance levels it can be clearly seen that the results are robust down to a significance level of 0 05 in order to assure reliable results we recommend not to use a significance level above 0 1 the filtered networks are plotted by means of qtac network using layout nicely nodes positions reflect their network theoretic relation to each other thereby enabling an impression of the overall development of the network at first sight see fig 2 b f nodes are colored according to the functional group of the respective species considering the development of the information network we observe an interesting pattern in 2006 there already is a subcommunity of closely connectedness nodes including b horadecus t campestre and l campestris throughout the following year connectivity within the subcommunity increases while starting from 2008 it more and more separates from the rest of the network in 2010 the network eventually splits into two components one being the subcommunity including three further species namely c cristatus t hybridum c pratensis this subcommunity takes in a central position in the overall network except for c pratensis the community consists of grasses and legumes only from the point of view of the adaptive cycle the sudden and relatively strong structural change in the network from 2007 to 2008 can hint towards the transition to a new cycle from 2008 on the new structure intensifies showing in an increasing separation of the subcommunity besides the internal organization and connectivity in both subcommunities increases such directed development usually indicates an r k phase the development of the three systemic variables computed via qtac maturation and visualized via qtac 2dplot fig 3 a and qtac 3dplot fig 3 b confirm our first impression connectedness and potential are comparably high in 2006 while potential already decreases connectedness remains almost constant during the first year resilience strongly decreases this pattern suggests a late k phase from 2007 to 2008 connectedness strongly decreases while resilience strongly increases indicating a classical ω phase the ω phase coincides with the onset of the separation of the subcommunity besides the rest of the network seems to be more loosely connected from 2008 to 2009 connectedness and potential increase while resilience decreases this behavior is characteristic of an r phase from 2009 on the increase in potential and connectedness continues however more slowly suggesting that the system has entered the early k phase atypically resilience increases during this year considering the networks this phenomenon can be traced back to the disappearance of the edge between t hybridum and l autumnalis the three dimensional graphs in fig 4 have been colored according to the typical color scheme of the adaptive cycle s phases a helpful visualization tool for information networks are heatmaps showing eigencentralities of the nodes eigencentrality measures a node s degree of connection within the network as being interpreted as communication network see csardi and nepusz 2006 it thus to some degree indicates importance of a node for the system as a whole the heatmap of the community in plot b4a18 fig 5 clearly reflects the gradual emergence of the subcommunity especially for large systems such a heatmap can help to gain an overview of the network s topology and the position of single components within the network for example compare the case study on a prairie forest ecotone in zu castell and schrenk 2020 following previous publications on the jena experiment see e g vogel et al 2012 we want to compare resilience as well as potential and connectedness of different plots thereby gaining insight into the relation of each of these properties to community size and composition at first we restrict ourselves to the 16 communities of eight species grouped according to the functional diversity of their respective plant community we compute potential connectedness and resilience of each community on basis of their information network in 2010 fig 6 visualizes the results in form of a boxplot note that each of the four groups of functional diversity contains exactly four communities fig 6 c shows that the median of resilience is maximal for communities consisting of four functional groups this matches earlier results in allan et al 2011 it was shown that the level of functioning is higher in more diverse communities due to turnover of functionally complementary species figs 6 a b display the results for potential and connectedness in both cases we cannot observe as clear patterns as in the case of resilience of course with only four communities existing for each degree of functional diversity the number of samples is rather small it would be interesting to conduct the analysis with a higher number of samples in order to investigate the relation between resilience and species richness we compute the resilience of all 34 communities in 2010 per default resilience of a network is standardized with respect to the maximal information transfer occurring in the network yielding a certain comparability across time points here using res stand maxweightnodes we standardize not only with respect to maximal edge weight but with respect to the number of nodes as well we visualize the results in form of a scatterplot to make clear that the sizes of the groups strongly vary note that in previous publications on the jena experiment the common expectation of resilience increasing with species richness could only be confirmed under high treatment intensity however such treatment was not applied in the main experiment see vogel et al 2012 accordingly fig 7 shows that variance and mean resilience cleary decrease with increasing species richness being generally of wide interest the results of our small exemplary case study could serve as starting point for comprehensive large scale studies on the relation between resilience functional diversity and species richness in plant communities we continue with the application of qtac to one of the large communities namely the community in plot b1a22 consisting of 60 species again we get a quick overview of the system by means of the development of the components abundances fig 8 in contrast to the analysis of community b4a18 we will not consider the information networks themselves but make use of the eigencentrality heatmap shown in fig 9 observe that in every year there is a clearly outstanding subcommunity of highly central species the composition of this community only slightly changes during the analysis period in order to get an insight into the functional role of the species in these central subcommunities we consider the species specific in and outflows by inflow we denote all information being transferred to the respective species analogously outflow sums all information being transferred from the respective species to others simply put the information being transferred from species a to species b at a specific time point measures the degree to which a s upcoming abundance is influenced by b s abundance in ecological terms such a transfer could for example reflect effective competitive mutualistic or commensalistic interactions among the species as exemplarily shown using the examples of t campestre t dubium and t fragiferum fig 10 a c most central species are constant net inflowers hence the amount of information received and processed dominates we interpret information processing as active adaptation of the respective component to its environment in contrast most species showing low centrality either do not show a clear information profile or are net outflowers as l corniculatus fig 10 d overall from an information theoretic point of view the system consists of a developing small core of active species which can be seen as key players of the system and a large amount of peripheral rather passive species interestingly the most central species are not automatically the most abundant species finally we want to consider the development of the systemic variables of the community fig 11 shows that both potential and connectedness almost monotonously increase throughout the analysis period resilience overall decreases this interplay suggests that the system has been in an r k phase for the last years 5 conclusion the r package qtac combines the analysis of component specific behavior and emergent phenomena thereby enabling a holistic approach to the understanding of complex systems in the form of time series of abundance data only the most basic and mostly available information about a system is required the generality of the underlying method as well as the clear workflow allow usability across the wide range of disciplines working with measurement units that are equivalent to abundance however a certain background knowledge of the system and its components is necessary to make reasonable parameter choices besides we recommend users to conduct a sensitivity analysis with respect to technical parameters like the amount of noise added in the estimation or the level of significance in the filtering process future work is mainly going to be dedicated to customizability of the network estimation in a very heterogeneous set of system components component wise choices of embedding length and embedding delay could increase preciseness of the estimations the same applies for the parameter indicating the delay between source and destination variables especially in spatially ordered systems causal delays can strongly depend on the respective pair of components in this sense higher customizability increases the applicability of our method in spatio temporal analysis this branch of system analysis has steadily gained in importance throughout the last years compare fang et al 2019 islam et al 2021 chen and quan 2021 for social ecological and economic examples we have taken first steps into this direction analyzing flood events in a system of gauging stations in eastern germany credit authorship contribution statement hannah schrenk

r package pracma borchers 2019 qtac conducts a significance test as part of the estimations this bootstrapping test is part of the jidt toolkit lizier 2014 the function qtac signfactor allows the user to filter the results of qtac with respect to their significance before further processing using the function qtac networks the user can visualize the estimated information dynamics in form of a series of directed weighted networks the nodes of which represent the system s components and the edges of which represent the respective information transfer the visualization function is based on the r package igraph and offers various layout options inherited from this package csardi and nepusz 2006 3 3 computing and visualizing the systemic variables following the method by zu castell and schrenk 2020 potential connectedness and resilience are defined as properties of the system s information network at the respective time consider the directed weighted network g of information transfers e among the system s components v at time point t i e g v e b a b a v v with weight function ω v v r 0 e b a t b a then the system s potential at the given time is defined as p y x v v t y x log 2 t y x t and the system s connectedness as c y x v v t y x log 2 t y x t x v t y x y v t y x where t y x v v t y x the two definitions are inspired by the information theoretical measures of capacity and ascendancy which were originally introduced by ulanowicz et al 2009 the definition of resilience given by zu castell and schrenk 2020 is the directed analog to the established spectral graph theoretical measure of connectivity see e g chung 1997 with a denoting the adjacency matrix of g d o u t and d i n its directed degree matrices and c 0 a standardization constant the graph s directed laplacian matrices are given as l o u t c d o u t 1 2 d o u t a and l i n c d i n a d i n 1 2 then resilience is defined as the smallest real part of the non trivial eigenvalues of l o u t and l i n i e r min r σ σ spec l o u t spec l i n σ 0 in qtac the computation of the systemic variables on basis of a series of information networks is performed by the function qtac maturation here the user can choose between different standardization constants c especially when comparing different systems standardization can prove useful in order to choose a suitable value the user should answer questions like should resilience in this case depend on the absolute edge weights of the information network g consequently should a complete network with uniform edge weight 2 be more resilient than a complete network with uniform edge weight 1 or should the resilience depend on the number of nodes of g hence should a complete network on 10 nodes be more resilient than a complete network on 5 nodes there are no generally applicable answers to these questions they depend on the specific research question and the context to be studied only the inherent relative nature of the notion of resilience has been frequently discussed compare e g allen et al 2018 let m denote the maximal edge weight of g then qtac provides non trivial standardization with respect to the number of nodes of g via c n 1 n with respect to the maximal edge weight of g via c 1 m or with respect to both via c n 1 n m the function returns a series of the three systemic variables defining the system s course through the adaptive cycle in the respective time period qtac offers various possibilities to visualize the development of the systemic variables via qtac 2dplot the variables can be plotted separately against time the function qtac 2dmixplot returns two dimensional plots as well with two variables plotted against each other in order to visualize the development of the variables in the typical layout of the adaptive cycle metaphor qtac provides the function qtac 3dplot it is based on the r package rgl adler et al 2019 and returns a three dimensional plot of the variables which can be rotated and thereby examined from different angles in all cases a curve through the data points is computed via a piecewise cubic smoothing spline which is inherited from the r package pracma borchers 2019 4 use case exploring grassland communities we illustrate the application of qtac by means of an exemplary test case of grassland communities the data underlying this test case stems from the jena experiment a grassland biodiversity experiment located near jena germany see weisser et al 2017 within the last years a multitude of studies has been performed on basis of data gained in the experiment covering biodiversity effects on aboveground productivity marquard et al 2013 diversity stability relationships roscher et al 2011 and effects of management intensity on grassland resistance vogel et al 2012 in the course of the main experiment 82 plots of 20 m 20 m were set up on former arable land in 2002 mixtures of 1 2 4 8 16 and 60 regional grassland species were established in these plots the species had been assigned to four functional groups in advance namely grasses small herbs tall herbs and legume species the composition of species in each plot was determined randomly with constraints to ensure all possible combinations of species number and number of functional groups twice a year the plots were mown and non sown species were weeded aside from that no further treatments took place see jena experiment 2002 for a description of the main experiment including a list of all 60 species and their respective functional group in the following case study we investigate and compare the systemic development of the 34 communities of at least 8 species our analysis is based on species specific biomass data collected once a year from 2002 to 2010 in june prior to the first mowing weigelt et al 2016 we provide the data and code underlying the following figures with this article data casestudies 7z results casestudies 7z and code casestudies md we want to demonstrate the exploration of a single plant system namely the community in plot b4a18 in which 16 species of four different functional groups were sown the data is part of weigelt et al 2016 we recommend to always inspect the time series data before starting the analysis to get a first impression of the system at hand see fig 2 a in order to gain an insight into the information dynamics we want to study the development of the system s information network recall that the network at a given time point is estimated on basis of a window of a fixed length of preceding abundance data thereby every network reflects a temporally more local rather than the global information structure of the system by shifting the window along the time series the development of the information structure can be captured with the window size determining the time point of the earliest network estimated a larger window size generally leads to a shorter analysis period the choice of this parameter is always a trade off between statistical stability provided by large window sizes and a more precise temporal resolution gained by small window sizes qtac generally does not accept window sizes below five in order to guarantee statistical reliability of the results in order to extract and follow the strong dynamics in abundance data of plot b4a18 fig 2 a we need the analysis period to start as early as possible hence we choose a window size of w 5 years allowing us to analyze the system s information structure from 2006 on crucial parameters for estimating transfer entropy are the time and species independent embedding length of source l w and destination past history k w see schreiber 2000 they should be chosen in a way such that knowing the past l states of the source variable no further relevant information about its next state is gained by extending to more than l states the same applies for k and the destination variable due to computational reasons k l 1 is a common choice however choosing k too small information being contained in the past of the destination variable may be erroneously considered as information transfer from the source variable equally choosing l too large information transfer might be over estimated as well on the other hand choosing l too small or k too large an existing information transfer might not be recognized compare e g lizier 2014 in the absence of sufficient background knowledge of the system components one can estimate the embedding lengths using for example the ragwitz optimization method as provided with the jidt toolkit lizier 2014 recall that in the case of a window size below 15 two additional data points are interpolated between each pair of successive data points hence one originally preceeding data point corresponds to three interpolated preceeding data points the user should be aware of this fact when choosing the history lengths in the case of community b4a18 we choose a history length of four corresponding to almost one and a half years in reality a sensitivity analysis shows that our results are robust with respect to both a slightly lower and slightly higher history length compare fig a 1 we choose a comparably low level of random gaussian noise added in the estimation namely 1e 30 a certain amount of noise is required to guarantee the functioning of the estimator see kraskov 2008 however especially in the case of short time series high noise levels can lead to very unstable results our choice is based on a sensitivity analysis conducted in advance fig a 2 displays the mean and standard deviation of the systemic variables for different levels of noise added and 20 computations each clearly potential is robust across all levels of random noise connectedness shows to be robust for all noise levels except for 1e 08 a 2 a note that this is the default value of random noise in the jidt package resilience shows a high standard deviation across all noise levels this is due to the fact that resilience in contrast to potential and connectedness is a local measure being highly sensitive to the existence or non existence of single edges in the underlying information network using a noise level of 1e 30 the only value showing a remarkably high standard deviation is the resilience in 2008 before analyzing a specific information network in detail the user should compare the networks of different runs to get a better understanding of what edges might lead to jumps in resilience the respective information transfers should be interpreted with care based on the chosen parameters the function qtac returns adjacency and significance matrices for every year between 2006 and 2010 we filter the results using a significance level of 0 1 in this specific case lower significance levels lead to consistently very sparse adjacency matrices suggesting that structuring information transfer was lost in the process of filtering fig a 3 shows the systemic variables for lower significance levels it can be clearly seen that the results are robust down to a significance level of 0 05 in order to assure reliable results we recommend not to use a significance level above 0 1 the filtered networks are plotted by means of qtac network using layout nicely nodes positions reflect their network theoretic relation to each other thereby enabling an impression of the overall development of the network at first sight see fig 2 b f nodes are colored according to the functional group of the respective species considering the development of the information network we observe an interesting pattern in 2006 there already is a subcommunity of closely connectedness nodes including b horadecus t campestre and l campestris throughout the following year connectivity within the subcommunity increases while starting from 2008 it more and more separates from the rest of the network in 2010 the network eventually splits into two components one being the subcommunity including three further species namely c cristatus t hybridum c pratensis this subcommunity takes in a central position in the overall network except for c pratensis the community consists of grasses and legumes only from the point of view of the adaptive cycle the sudden and relatively strong structural change in the network from 2007 to 2008 can hint towards the transition to a new cycle from 2008 on the new structure intensifies showing in an increasing separation of the subcommunity besides the internal organization and connectivity in both subcommunities increases such directed development usually indicates an r k phase the development of the three systemic variables computed via qtac maturation and visualized via qtac 2dplot fig 3 a and qtac 3dplot fig 3 b confirm our first impression connectedness and potential are comparably high in 2006 while potential already decreases connectedness remains almost constant during the first year resilience strongly decreases this pattern suggests a late k phase from 2007 to 2008 connectedness strongly decreases while resilience strongly increases indicating a classical ω phase the ω phase coincides with the onset of the separation of the subcommunity besides the rest of the network seems to be more loosely connected from 2008 to 2009 connectedness and potential increase while resilience decreases this behavior is characteristic of an r phase from 2009 on the increase in potential and connectedness continues however more slowly suggesting that the system has entered the early k phase atypically resilience increases during this year considering the networks this phenomenon can be traced back to the disappearance of the edge between t hybridum and l autumnalis the three dimensional graphs in fig 4 have been colored according to the typical color scheme of the adaptive cycle s phases a helpful visualization tool for information networks are heatmaps showing eigencentralities of the nodes eigencentrality measures a node s degree of connection within the network as being interpreted as communication network see csardi and nepusz 2006 it thus to some degree indicates importance of a node for the system as a whole the heatmap of the community in plot b4a18 fig 5 clearly reflects the gradual emergence of the subcommunity especially for large systems such a heatmap can help to gain an overview of the network s topology and the position of single components within the network for example compare the case study on a prairie forest ecotone in zu castell and schrenk 2020 following previous publications on the jena experiment see e g vogel et al 2012 we want to compare resilience as well as potential and connectedness of different plots thereby gaining insight into the relation of each of these properties to community size and composition at first we restrict ourselves to the 16 communities of eight species grouped according to the functional diversity of their respective plant community we compute potential connectedness and resilience of each community on basis of their information network in 2010 fig 6 visualizes the results in form of a boxplot note that each of the four groups of functional diversity contains exactly four communities fig 6 c shows that the median of resilience is maximal for communities consisting of four functional groups this matches earlier results in allan et al 2011 it was shown that the level of functioning is higher in more diverse communities due to turnover of functionally complementary species figs 6 a b display the results for potential and connectedness in both cases we cannot observe as clear patterns as in the case of resilience of course with only four communities existing for each degree of functional diversity the number of samples is rather small it would be interesting to conduct the analysis with a higher number of samples in order to investigate the relation between resilience and species richness we compute the resilience of all 34 communities in 2010 per default resilience of a network is standardized with respect to the maximal information transfer occurring in the network yielding a certain comparability across time points here using res stand maxweightnodes we standardize not only with respect to maximal edge weight but with respect to the number of nodes as well we visualize the results in form of a scatterplot to make clear that the sizes of the groups strongly vary note that in previous publications on the jena experiment the common expectation of resilience increasing with species richness could only be confirmed under high treatment intensity however such treatment was not applied in the main experiment see vogel et al 2012 accordingly fig 7 shows that variance and mean resilience cleary decrease with increasing species richness being generally of wide interest the results of our small exemplary case study could serve as starting point for comprehensive large scale studies on the relation between resilience functional diversity and species richness in plant communities we continue with the application of qtac to one of the large communities namely the community in plot b1a22 consisting of 60 species again we get a quick overview of the system by means of the development of the components abundances fig 8 in contrast to the analysis of community b4a18 we will not consider the information networks themselves but make use of the eigencentrality heatmap shown in fig 9 observe that in every year there is a clearly outstanding subcommunity of highly central species the composition of this community only slightly changes during the analysis period in order to get an insight into the functional role of the species in these central subcommunities we consider the species specific in and outflows by inflow we denote all information being transferred to the respective species analogously outflow sums all information being transferred from the respective species to others simply put the information being transferred from species a to species b at a specific time point measures the degree to which a s upcoming abundance is influenced by b s abundance in ecological terms such a transfer could for example reflect effective competitive mutualistic or commensalistic interactions among the species as exemplarily shown using the examples of t campestre t dubium and t fragiferum fig 10 a c most central species are constant net inflowers hence the amount of information received and processed dominates we interpret information processing as active adaptation of the respective component to its environment in contrast most species showing low centrality either do not show a clear information profile or are net outflowers as l corniculatus fig 10 d overall from an information theoretic point of view the system consists of a developing small core of active species which can be seen as key players of the system and a large amount of peripheral rather passive species interestingly the most central species are not automatically the most abundant species finally we want to consider the development of the systemic variables of the community fig 11 shows that both potential and connectedness almost monotonously increase throughout the analysis period resilience overall decreases this interplay suggests that the system has been in an r k phase for the last years 5 conclusion the r package qtac combines the analysis of component specific behavior and emergent phenomena thereby enabling a holistic approach to the understanding of complex systems in the form of time series of abundance data only the most basic and mostly available information about a system is required the generality of the underlying method as well as the clear workflow allow usability across the wide range of disciplines working with measurement units that are equivalent to abundance however a certain background knowledge of the system and its components is necessary to make reasonable parameter choices besides we recommend users to conduct a sensitivity analysis with respect to technical parameters like the amount of noise added in the estimation or the level of significance in the filtering process future work is mainly going to be dedicated to customizability of the network estimation in a very heterogeneous set of system components component wise choices of embedding length and embedding delay could increase preciseness of the estimations the same applies for the parameter indicating the delay between source and destination variables especially in spatially ordered systems causal delays can strongly depend on the respective pair of components in this sense higher customizability increases the applicability of our method in spatio temporal analysis this branch of system analysis has steadily gained in importance throughout the last years compare fang et al 2019 islam et al 2021 chen and quan 2021 for social ecological and economic examples we have taken first steps into this direction analyzing flood events in a system of gauging stations in eastern germany credit authorship contribution statement hannah schrenk

24481,methane ch4 is a second largest contributor of global warming after carbon dioxide co2 and it is crucial to understand how management practices affect ch4 emissions among field crops paddy rice alone has accounted for about 10 12 of the total ch4 emission in 2010 the process based denitrification and decomposition dndc model can be applied to quantify greenhouse gas ghg emissions from agricultural soils capturing both the daily time scale and cumulative growing season ch4 fluxes by dndc may help to devise appealing mitigation approaches for better rice management in this study dndc was calibrated with a parameter adjustment approach under two treatments 140 kg n ha 1 without biochar and 140 kg n ha 1 with 2 biochar simulation results show that the model predicted the daily ch4 fluxes in good agreement with measurements under both treatments next dndc was validated with the adjusted parameters against the remaining biochar and n treatments and the model performed well in prediction of ch4 fluxes as indicated by several statistical indexes rmse ranged from 6 74 to 7 62 g ch4 ha 1 d 1 the d index varied between 0 92 to 0 98 and mpd and nrmse were at 10 94 17 43 and 17 54 24 52 respectively in terms of cumulative growing season ch4 efflux dndc under simulated all treatments except the control further dndc predicted above ground dry weights and volumetric water contents in good agreement with the measurements moreover model poorly predicted soil temperature ph and soil moisture content the value of the d index varied from 0 12 to 0 38 for both soil temperature and ph subsequently dndc successfully identified the significant impact of biochar on ch4 emission and model error was strongly correlated with ph of soils with no biochar amendments in conclusion the dndc model can capture the daily time scale as well as annual scale ch4 fluxes though dndc must be validated by intensive measurements of additional soil variables including dissolved organic carbon doc and microbial composition under different biochar types graphical abstract image graphical abstract keyword methane paddy rice dndc model parameter adjustment calibration biochar 1 introduction atmospheric ch4 is the second most vital contributor to global warming after carbon dioxide co2 ipcc 2013 the world meteorological organization 2016 has reported a 2 5 time increase in ch4 concentration e g 1834 0 ppb in the atmosphere since the pre industrial period among contributors to ch4 emissions paddy rice an important small grain cereal crop which provides the main food source for more than half of the people of the world frolking et al 2002 khush 2005 has been recognized as a major single source contributor of ch4 emissions wang et al 2017 alternative approaches to mitigate ch4 emissions from paddy fields along with sustainable rice production are mandatory shang et al 2011 mueller et al 2012 in paddy fields growth and development of rice could be an important regulator for ch4 flux organic matter derived from root exudates and dead roots acts as substrate for methanogens to produce ch4 yuan et al 2014 other factors such as soil attributes e g soil ph temperature and field management practices e g irrigation and fertilizer application could strongly regulate ch4 efflux from paddy rice conrad 2002 several studies woolf et al 2010 liu et al 2014 shen et al 2014 cernansky 2015 have documented that biochar bc amendments could be a good choice to mitigate ghg fluxes from agricultural soils biochar addition can alter the methanogen to methanotroph ratio in rice fields resulting in lower methane emissions feng et al 2012 further bc addition can increase soil ph zhang et al 2012 carvalho et al 2016 and lower soil bulk density zhang et al 2010 however conversely zhang et al 2010 observed an increase in ch4 efflux by 31 to 49 with bc addition over their control n fertilization is known an important factor for ch4 emissions but results from published reports wang et al 1992 cai et al 1997 on ch4 efflux by n addition in rice fields are still unclear for example cai et al 1997 observed that n addition in the form of urea could reduce ch4 production however wang et al 1992 found that urea addition could promote it therefore the underlying mechanisms controlling ch4 emissions from the combined effects of bc and n are still uncertain dimassi et al 2013 dolan et al 2006 because of the strong spatial and temporal variations in ch4 emissions its estimation and simulation from rice fields remain a challenging task over the last few decades several process based models have been developed to estimate ch4 efflux from agricultural soils cao et al 1995 huang et al 1998 2004 matthews et al 2000 li 2000 fumoto et al 2008 xie et al 2010 these models have been employed to simulate spatial temporal trends of cumulative seasonal as well as annual ch4 emission from rice fields some of them have been validated against long term field observations under different field management practices but the denitrification and decomposition dndc model so far has not been calibrated and validated for ch4 efflux from paddy rice under bc and n fertilization therefore an attempt was made with the following objectives 1 to assess model predictive performance before and after model parameter adjustment 2 to evaluate the dndc model for ch4 emissions under various rates of bc and n fertilizer and 3 identify the variables that influence ch4 efflux on dndc model performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental description the current

arranged in all pots zainol et al 1991 a 20 ml syringe was inserted up to 7 cm soil depth at the center of each pot dheri et al 2015 the base of the syringe was placed on a 2 cm thick layer of fine gravel to ensure equilibrium mixtures of soil air in the inserted syringes zainol et al 1991 an imaginary drawing is published by shaukat et al 2019 the principle of diffusion equilibrium rather than mass flow governed the flow of soil air into the syringe zainol et al 1991 dheri et al 2015 a 3 way stopcock was inserted on each syringe to avoid the escape of accumulated air from the syringe shaukat et al 2019 the collection of gas fluxes was started at 27 days after transplanting and proceeded at fortnight intervals the 10 ml air tight gas vials were used to collect gas samples for a duration of 20 min from each syringe by inserting a needle on the stopcocks shaukat et al 2019 2 3 determination of ch4 concentration as documented by shaukat et al 2019 ch4 concentration from air samples stored in vials was analyzed within 24 h after sampling using a gc 2014 gas chromatograph shimadzu kyoto japan equipped with a porapak q stainless steel column 2 m length 4 mm od 80 100 mesh the gas chromatograph was equipped with a flame ionization detector for ch4 and the working temperatures of the injector detector and column were adjusted to 200 200 and 70 c respectively helium 99 999 purity was used as a carrier gas 30 ml min 1 and a make up gas 95 argon and 5 ch4 was also used for the ecd the gc 2014 was calibrated before and after each set of measurements using 1 01 7 99 and 50 5 µl ch4 l 1 in helium as a primary standard 2 4 dndc model 2 4 1 description of dndc dndc ver 9 5 downloaded at february 2019 from http www dndc sr unh edu is a process based model and it can simulate c and n cycling in agroecosystems it contains both biochemical and physio chemical components li 2000 giltrap et al 2010 as shown in fig 1 the physio chemical sub modules in dndc such as crop growth soil climate and decomposition govern the primary drivers into soil environmental factors like soil moisture temperature redox potential soil ph and substrates e g ammonium ion nh4 nitrate ion no3 and dissolved organic carbon doc the biochemical sub modules include nitrification fermentation and denitrification which predict n and c transformation that are mediated by soil microbes and govern by the aforementioned soil environmental factors li 2000 these sub modules control the prediction of ch4 nh3 n2o dinitrogen n2 and co2 emissions from soil plant systems to the atmosphere 2 4 2 ch4 prediction by dndc the possible pathways for emission of ch4 through anaerobic and aerobic soil layers have been reported by deng et al 2017 dndc model has the capability to capture the fate of soil organic carbon soc which is partitioned to doc and microbial biomass after decomposition in soil layers doc is highly mobile and acts as source of soil microbial energy and at the end it is oxidized to co2 mediated by aerobic condition an instantaneous pool of doc also exists in soil and the size of doc pool is determined by the balance between its production and consumption rates li et al 1992 dndc model predicts ch4 flux by accounting its production oxidation and transport under anaerobic conditions the fermentation and syntrophy of doc lead to formation of three precursors of ch4 production which include acetate ch3cooh co2 and h2 it is limitation of dndc to predict fermentation and syntrophy separately and these two processes are combined into one which is referred as anaerobic decomposition of doc firstly dndc model calculate the ch4 production rate as the result of hydrogenotrophic or acetotrophic methanogensis in soils for this purpose michaleis menten kinetics are used in dndc to estimate the quantity of ch4 produced in the consequence of methane producing reactions in soils the eq 1 is used in dndc to calculate ch4 production rate through acetotrophic methanogensis 1 v c h 4 α v m a x α c h 3 c o o h k m a c h 3 c o o h where v c h 4 α indicates the methane production rate as the result of acetotrophic methanogensis mol m 3 s 1 vmax α is the maximum methane production rate due to acetotrophic methanogensis mol m 3 s 1 and k mα indicates the concentration of acetate during a half of the maximum methane production rate mol m 3 s 1 in dndc eq 2 is applied to calculate ch4 production rate through hydrogenotrophic methanogensis 2 v c h 4 b v m a x b c o 2 k m b 1 c o 2 h 2 k m b 2 h 2 where v c h 4 b shows the ch4 production rate as the result of hydrogenotrophic methanogensis mol m 3 s 1 co2 and h2 are co2 and h2 concentrations in mol m 3 s 1 respectively vmax b is the maximum methane production rate due to hydrogenotrophic methanogensis mol m 3 s 1 and k mb 1 and k mb 2 indicate co2 and h2 respectively at a half of the maximum methane production rate mol m 3 s 1 lastly dndc calculate the total daily ch4 production by summing the h2 induced and acetate induced ch4 production in the soils fig 2 also displays the emission of ch4 under anaerobic conditions via three ways i e diffusion ebullition and plant driven transport fumoto et al 2008 methane diffusion across the predicted soil layers is determined by the ch4 gradient between these layers and it is calculated by using eq 3 3 d d f i f d c h 4 i c h 4 i 1 where ddf i indicates the ch4 diffusion rate in ith layer mol m 3 s 1 f d is the value of diffusion coefficient s 1 and it is a function of clay fractions in soil which can be calculated by eq 4 ch4 i and ch4 i 1 are concentrations of ch4 in soil layer ith and i 1 respectively 4 f d 0 5 1 c l a y in case soil water is overfilled with ch4 production then excess ch4 is escaped from the soil layers by process of ebullition and it can be calculated by the following equation 5 c h 4 s t 5 357 0 0285 e 0 0414 t 0 0115 where ch4st indicates saturated ch4 concentration in soil water kg c m 3 and t is the soil temperature c in dndc model it is assumed that ebullition is independent from the texture of soil 2 4 3 limitations of dndc in spite of frequent applications of dndc model to predict ghg fluxes from agricultural soils it also have some limitation that are 1 dndc model could not simulate the lateral flows of nutrients and water and it is assumed that there should be a homogenous microbial population of heterotroph and autotroph smith et al 2008 2 dndc shows uncertainty in estimation of soil moisture because it uses a cascade water flow model uzoma et al 2015 3 there is no management option to control the mobile carbon derived from biochar thus organic carbon derived from straw was selected under manure type of dndc s crop management options improvements in organic amendments of dndc framework should be considered for better controlling of organic c derived from biochar 4 prediction of ch4 emissions from paddy fields by dndc also needs some additional information like planting depths of rice seedlings number seedlings per hill and age of transplanted seedlings it is suggested to incorporate this information in future dndc s versions to predict the ch4 flux more accurately although there are some limitations of dndc but this model is considered more flexible and user friendly due to a simple framework for model inputs and outputs 2 5 dndc simulation and evaluation 2 5 1 model setup in this study the observed weather data were obtained from sensors situated in the greenhouse the soil used in this experiment has been classified as a loam

relationship between the predicted and observed values of ch4 flux was also fitted by a linear regression y α bx here y and x indicate the predicted and observed data respectively to evaluate dndc

observed ch4 fluxes and model performance the model error was applied as an assessment of dndc performance and was computed by eq 7 the spearman s rank correlation test was used to compute the rho

treatments e g wbcn140 and 2bcn140 against observed seasonal ch4 fluxes dndc was calibrated with two treatments because we did further partitioning of soc in the input files of bc treatments table 1 before calibration dndc performance was tested against input files of wbcn140 and 2bcn140 treatments under default values of soil and crop parameters under wbcn140 2bcn140 treatments dndc predicted

during rice growth period fig 2a given this very poor performance of model under both treatments we tested the potential performance of dndc through calibration specifically soil parameters listed in table 1 first the crop parameters biomass production biomass fraction and tdd in both treatments were adjusted according to measured biomass accumulation in stem leaves and roots further manual adjustment in soil parameters table 1 were done to make dndc simulations closer to observed values of ch4 fluxes after dndc s calibration simulation results under both treatments exhibited seasonal ch4 dynamics that well matched the observed ch4 fluxes the statistical indexes comparing modeled and observed daily ch4 emissions were also in excellent ranges e g mpd was 6 05 rmse 4 00 g ch4 ha 1 d

measured daily ch4 fluxes were significantly correlated r2 0 81 0 95 p 0 01 with intercept ranging from 4 42 to 7 39 p 0 05 and slopes were from 0 83 to 0 96 fig 3 a c the model performance was good as the calculated rmse ranged from 6 74 to 7 62 g ch4 ha 1 d 1 mpd and nrmse were at 10 94 17 43 and 17 54 24 52 respectively and me was very satisfactory ranging from 0 71 to 0 93 under n combinations with and without bc amendment table 2 additionally the model captured the changing patterns of seasonal ch4 emissions from transplanting to harvest under all treatments very well fig 4 a

and nrmse was also low at 22 61 the value of mae at 0 38 g plant 1 represented the over prediction of final dry weights of a plant under some treatments fig 5 3 3 soil parameters in this study the simulated dynamics in soil temperature were in poor agreement with measurements under all treatments the calculated mpd ranged from 0 72 to 2 52 rmse ranged from 1 43 to 1 56 c nrmse was high at 6 43 6 79 mae ranged from 0 19 to 0 54 c d index was very low at 0 12 0 16 and me ranged from 3 85 to 3 79 under pots with and without bc amendments table 2 the linear regression between modeled and measured soil temperature showed that slopes ranged from 0 88 to 0 79 intercept between 40 36 and 41 54 p 0 01 and co efficient of determination r2 between 0 34 and 0 38 p 0 01 fig 6 a c dndc predicted the volumetric water contents vwcs in good agreement with measurements under all treatments the calculated rmse ranged from 3 65 to 4 13 m3 m 3 mpd and nrmse were at 2 53 2 03 and 5 91 7 59 respectively and me was also excellent ranging from 0 85 to 0 90 and d index was varied from 0 97 to 0 98 under n combinations with and without bc amendments the modeled and measured daily vwcs were significantly correlated r2 0 91 0 94 p 0 01 with intercept ranging from 0 35 to 7 63 p 0 05 and slopes were from 1 02 to 1 12 fig 7 a c furthermore dndc predicted relatively higher daily vwcs dynamics under bc treatments compared to n alone treatments fig 7a i in terms of soil ph the computed mpd ranged from 0 09 to 3 80 rmse was from 0 16 to 10 28 nrmse was not very high and ranged from 2

simulate annual ch4 fluxes the modeled and measured values for cumulative ch4 emissions over the growing period were also compared by 1 1 line fit fig 9 the unfertilized pot had modeled cumulative growing season ch4 flux of 1 931 kg ha 1 against the observed cumulative flux of 1 934 kg ch4 ha 1 dndc with n fertilized pots 70 and 140 kg n ha 1 without bc amendments had modeled cumulative growing season ch4 fluxes from 1 60 to 1 99 kg ha 1 and measurements ranged from 2 55 to 2 9 kg ch4 ha 1 furthermore the model under predicted the cumulative growing season ch4 fluxes from pots amended with 2 and 4 bc with no n and simulated values varied from 2 03 to 2 78 kg ha 1 against the measurements of 3 69 to 3 96 kg ch4 ha 1 respectively the pots with 2 and 4 bc addition and fertilized by 70 and 140 kg n ha 1 had modeled cumulative growing season ch4 fluxes of 2 08 3 54 kg ha 1 against observed fluxes of 3 12 4 40 kg ch4 ha 1 considering all treatments the difference was significant between modeled and measured cumulative ch4 fluxes wilcoxon signed rank p 0 005 and dndc mostly under simulated the cumulative growing season ch4 fluxes fig 9 3 5 field management in this study dndc identified the impact of n fertilization and bc amendments on ch4 fluxes the n addition had a non significant effect on both modeled and measured ch4 fluxes kruskal wallis p 0 3 but bc addition significantly affected the predicted and observed ch4 fluxes kruskal wallis p 0 01 3 6 correlation with n bc and environmental parameters correlation analysis was performed to determine variables that could have an effect on modeled and measured ch4 fluxes as well as on dndc s performance the daily predicted ch4 fluxes were negatively corelated with minimum air temperature whilst rho values for maximum air temperature were closer to 0 under all treatments tab s1 furthermore the predicted and observed ch4 fluxes were strong and positively correlated with minimum air temperature and soil ph of bc amended soils tab s1 but soil ph of n fertilized pots was negatively correlated with modeled and measured ch4 fluxes in relation to vwcs the modeled and measured ch4 emissions were negatively associated under all treatments tab s1 in terms of model error it was negatively correlated with soil temperature soil ph nitrogen addition max and min air temperature but positively correlated with vwcs under n only treatments table 3 furthermore model error was also negatively correlated with max and min air temperature soil temperature ph and vwcs under n and bc amended soils however it was positively correlated with bc addition table 3 4 discussion dndc being a process based model can simulate the effects of agricultural management systems on environment and depict the possibilities of the underlying processes for better understanding dou et al 2014 compared with other models dndc has the ability to predict the dynamics of nutrient flows and emissions by capturing all mechanistic steps that are involved in site mode dndc can simulate accurately the ghg emissions in our agro ecosystem and management strategies for mitigating ghg fluxes and improving the farm productivity in regional mode dndc can assist in developing national ghg inventories and evaluate the variations in ghg emissions due to changed farm management practices li et al 2002 the recent version of dndc can also simulate the vertical and horizontal movements of water and nutrients at the watershed or landscape levels due to incorporation of two fundamental hydrologic features including the modified universal soil loss equation and the soil conservation service curve function to be convenient for identifying the means to reduce ch4 fluxes a biogeochemical model should have the capability of 1 reasonably simulating ch4 flux including temporal trends and seasonal magnitude and 2 capturing a significant variation in ch4 fluxes by management strategies of interest and input parameters adjusted firstly dndc model admirably simulated the temporal daily scale ch4 fluxes both under as well as over simulating the ch4 emissions against observed values under all treatments fig 4a i the parameters adjustment during calibration process improved the dndc model s prediction for ch4 however we reported some discrepancies in predicting the soil temperature we adjusted the model parameters under two treatments 1 140 kg n ha 1 and 2 2 bc added in pots of 140 kg ha 1 the purpose of calibrating dndc in this way was to adjust the soc partitioning into different c pools including resistant litter humads humus and bc the fixed and mobile c fractions of bc were controlled through biochar c and manuring options respectively in dndc and these c adjustments were done according to kyaw 2015 secondly the simulations of dndc were strongly correlated with air temperature rather than soil temperature which could be associated with a cooling effect of bc application due to higher values of vwcs in bc added pots throughout growing period of rice fig 8 a i similarly saarnio et al 2013 documented that bc addition enhanced the surface soil moisture content by 10 30 in terms of cumulative growing season ch4 emissions dndc predominantly under predicted ch4 fluxes fig 9 we surmised that dndc could not consider the effect of soil depth on diffusion rate of ch4 and only predicts heterogeneous soil profile at soil depth of 50 cm which may result the model to estimate ch4 emissions peaks earlier as compared to observed fluxes in field fig 4 thus dndc underestimates the overall magnitude of ch4 emissions some researchers reported inconsistent predictions of gaseous emissions even after calibration uzoma et al 2015 congreves et al 2016 however several studies ludwig et al 2011 cui et al 2014 abalos et al 2016 deng et al 2016 showed that dndc simulated the ghg emissions in good agreement with the measured data after its calibration ludwig et al 2011 and abalos et al 2016 applied very intensive datasets to calibrate dndc using a multi level calibration approach with additional variables measured and used this multi level calibration approach improved the prediction of gaseous emissions but could not be applied to the dataset used in the current study as the additional variables were not recorded which was a limitation dndc over simulated the cumulative ch4 flux by 13 to 38 under bc amended pots additionally it also over predicted the ch4 efflux from bc added soils by 15 to 39 in comparison with that from the n only treated pots these results corroborate with those reported by kyaw 2015 who also observed higher ch4 fluxes from bc treatments dndc predicts the ch4 efflux by accounting soil redox potential soc sources dissolved organic carbon doc and co2 available for the activities of methanogens soil texture soil moisture and temperature and ch4 diffusion rate li 2000 here the anaerobic conditions of paddy soils due to high vwcs low soil bulk density higher soil ph and fixed c contents derived from bc favored higher methanogenic activity dalal et al 2008 zweiten et al 2009 therefore dndc simulated ch4 emissions by considering these underlying ch4 driving mechanisms some of which were measured and modeled in this study we suggest that more studies under different ecosystems must be conducted to count those variables which were missing in this study such as microbial biomass doc from root exudates as well as from bc the potential impact of bc amendments on emissions of non co2 ghgs may also vary with soils and site conditions as well as bc characteristics spokas and reicosky 2009 simulation performance of dndc can be improved by calibrating it with dataset developed under different bc types higher ch4 prediction under bc treatments may suggest that the model would have considered the texture of this treatment as an unfavorable factor for ch4 diffusion lower values of ch4 emissions predicted by dndc under n fertilized and control treatments might be associated with lower doc in soils as compared to bc treatments hence measurements and validations across different environments might improve the model performance for predicting ghg emissions 5 conclusion after calibration by a parameter adjustment approach dndc s evaluation results show that the rmse ranged from 6 74 to 7 62 g ch4 ha 1 d 1 and the d index varied between 0 92 to 0 98 dndc under simulated the cumulative ch4 emissions from all treatments except the control despite a good response in predicting ch4 flux at the daily time scale dndc poorly predicted the soil temperature and soil ph values and predicted very well the soil moisture content however model performance increased with increase in ph of soils amended by bc in conclusion dndc can capture the daily time scale and growing season cumulative ch4 fluxes by applying a parameter adjustment approach during model calibration this study also suggests that dndc must be calibrated and validated across the different environments by using intensive measurements of additional soil variables such as doc and alteration in microbial archaea in the soils by supplying different types of bc credit author

24481,methane ch4 is a second largest contributor of global warming after carbon dioxide co2 and it is crucial to understand how management practices affect ch4 emissions among field crops paddy rice alone has accounted for about 10 12 of the total ch4 emission in 2010 the process based denitrification and decomposition dndc model can be applied to quantify greenhouse gas ghg emissions from agricultural soils capturing both the daily time scale and cumulative growing season ch4 fluxes by dndc may help to devise appealing mitigation approaches for better rice management in this study dndc was calibrated with a parameter adjustment approach under two treatments 140 kg n ha 1 without biochar and 140 kg n ha 1 with 2 biochar simulation results show that the model predicted the daily ch4 fluxes in good agreement with measurements under both treatments next dndc was validated with the adjusted parameters against the remaining biochar and n treatments and the model performed well in prediction of ch4 fluxes as indicated by several statistical indexes rmse ranged from 6 74 to 7 62 g ch4 ha 1 d 1 the d index varied between 0 92 to 0 98 and mpd and nrmse were at 10 94 17 43 and 17 54 24 52 respectively in terms of cumulative growing season ch4 efflux dndc under simulated all treatments except the control further dndc predicted above ground dry weights and volumetric water contents in good agreement with the measurements moreover model poorly predicted soil temperature ph and soil moisture content the value of the d index varied from 0 12 to 0 38 for both soil temperature and ph subsequently dndc successfully identified the significant impact of biochar on ch4 emission and model error was strongly correlated with ph of soils with no biochar amendments in conclusion the dndc model can capture the daily time scale as well as annual scale ch4 fluxes though dndc must be validated by intensive measurements of additional soil variables including dissolved organic carbon doc and microbial composition under different biochar types graphical abstract image graphical abstract keyword methane paddy rice dndc model parameter adjustment calibration biochar 1 introduction atmospheric ch4 is the second most vital contributor to global warming after carbon dioxide co2 ipcc 2013 the world meteorological organization 2016 has reported a 2 5 time increase in ch4 concentration e g 1834 0 ppb in the atmosphere since the pre industrial period among contributors to ch4 emissions paddy rice an important small grain cereal crop which provides the main food source for more than half of the people of the world frolking et al 2002 khush 2005 has been recognized as a major single source contributor of ch4 emissions wang et al 2017 alternative approaches to mitigate ch4 emissions from paddy fields along with sustainable rice production are mandatory shang et al 2011 mueller et al 2012 in paddy fields growth and development of rice could be an important regulator for ch4 flux organic matter derived from root exudates and dead roots acts as substrate for methanogens to produce ch4 yuan et al 2014 other factors such as soil attributes e g soil ph temperature and field management practices e g irrigation and fertilizer application could strongly regulate ch4 efflux from paddy rice conrad 2002 several studies woolf et al 2010 liu et al 2014 shen et al 2014 cernansky 2015 have documented that biochar bc amendments could be a good choice to mitigate ghg fluxes from agricultural soils biochar addition can alter the methanogen to methanotroph ratio in rice fields resulting in lower methane emissions feng et al 2012 further bc addition can increase soil ph zhang et al 2012 carvalho et al 2016 and lower soil bulk density zhang et al 2010 however conversely zhang et al 2010 observed an increase in ch4 efflux by 31 to 49 with bc addition over their control n fertilization is known an important factor for ch4 emissions but results from published reports wang et al 1992 cai et al 1997 on ch4 efflux by n addition in rice fields are still unclear for example cai et al 1997 observed that n addition in the form of urea could reduce ch4 production however wang et al 1992 found that urea addition could promote it therefore the underlying mechanisms controlling ch4 emissions from the combined effects of bc and n are still uncertain dimassi et al 2013 dolan et al 2006 because of the strong spatial and temporal variations in ch4 emissions its estimation and simulation from rice fields remain a challenging task over the last few decades several process based models have been developed to estimate ch4 efflux from agricultural soils cao et al 1995 huang et al 1998 2004 matthews et al 2000 li 2000 fumoto et al 2008 xie et al 2010 these models have been employed to simulate spatial temporal trends of cumulative seasonal as well as annual ch4 emission from rice fields some of them have been validated against long term field observations under different field management practices but the denitrification and decomposition dndc model so far has not been calibrated and validated for ch4 efflux from paddy rice under bc and n fertilization therefore an attempt was made with the following objectives 1 to assess model predictive performance before and after model parameter adjustment 2 to evaluate the dndc model for ch4 emissions under various rates of bc and n fertilizer and 3 identify the variables that influence ch4 efflux on dndc model performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental description the current study was conducted at the greenhouse of kottman hall the ohio state university osu columbus oh 43 210 usa 40 0030 n 83 0269 w from november 2017 to february 2018 detailed information about the experimental setup soil properties and crop managements have been reported by shaukat et al 2019 in this experiment the eight combinations of bc and n rates were assembled wbcn0 the control without bc

and 140 kg n ha 1 2 2 gas sampling and measurement each pot was irrigated up to 2 50 cm after every two days during the whole growth period shaukat et al 2019 a modified setup to collect ch4 flux was arranged in all pots zainol et al 1991 a 20 ml syringe was inserted up to 7 cm soil depth at the center of each pot dheri et al 2015 the base of the syringe was placed on a 2 cm thick layer of fine gravel to ensure equilibrium mixtures of soil air in the inserted syringes zainol et al 1991 an imaginary drawing is published by shaukat et al 2019 the principle of diffusion equilibrium rather than mass flow governed the flow of soil air into the syringe zainol et al 1991 dheri et al 2015 a 3 way stopcock was inserted on each syringe to avoid the escape of accumulated air from the syringe shaukat et al 2019 the collection of gas fluxes was started at 27 days after transplanting and proceeded at fortnight intervals the 10 ml air tight gas vials were used to collect gas samples for a duration of 20 min from each syringe by inserting a needle on the stopcocks shaukat et al 2019 2 3 determination of ch4 concentration as documented by shaukat et al 2019 ch4 concentration from air samples stored in vials was analyzed within 24 h after sampling using a gc 2014 gas chromatograph shimadzu kyoto japan equipped with a porapak q stainless steel column 2 m length 4 mm od 80 100 mesh the gas chromatograph was equipped with a flame ionization detector for ch4 and the working temperatures of the injector detector and column were adjusted to 200 200 and 70 c respectively helium 99 999 purity was used as a carrier gas 30 ml min 1 and a make up gas 95 argon and 5 ch4 was also used for the ecd the gc 2014 was calibrated before and after each set of measurements using 1 01 7 99 and 50 5 µl ch4 l 1 in helium as a primary standard 2 4 dndc model 2 4 1 description of dndc dndc ver 9 5 downloaded at february 2019 from http www dndc sr unh edu is a process based model and it can simulate c and n cycling in agroecosystems it contains both biochemical and physio chemical components li 2000 giltrap et al 2010 as shown in fig 1 the physio chemical sub modules in dndc such as crop growth soil climate and decomposition govern the primary drivers into soil environmental factors like soil moisture temperature redox potential soil ph and substrates e g ammonium ion nh4 nitrate ion no3 and dissolved organic carbon doc the biochemical sub modules include nitrification fermentation and denitrification which predict n and c transformation that are mediated by soil microbes and govern by the aforementioned soil environmental factors li 2000 these sub modules control the prediction of ch4 nh3 n2o dinitrogen n2 and co2 emissions from soil plant systems to the atmosphere 2 4 2 ch4 prediction by dndc the possible pathways for emission of ch4 through anaerobic and aerobic soil layers have been reported by deng et al 2017 dndc model has the capability to capture the fate of soil organic carbon soc which is partitioned to doc and microbial biomass after decomposition in soil layers doc is highly mobile and acts as source of soil microbial energy and at the end it is oxidized to co2 mediated by aerobic condition an instantaneous pool of doc also exists in soil and the size of doc pool is determined by the balance between its production and consumption rates li et al 1992 dndc model predicts ch4 flux by accounting its production oxidation and transport under anaerobic conditions the fermentation and syntrophy of doc lead to formation of three precursors of ch4 production which include acetate ch3cooh co2 and h2 it is limitation of dndc to predict fermentation and syntrophy separately and these two processes are combined into one which is referred as anaerobic decomposition of doc firstly dndc model calculate the ch4 production rate as the result of hydrogenotrophic or acetotrophic methanogensis in soils for this purpose michaleis menten kinetics are used in dndc to estimate the quantity of ch4 produced in the consequence of methane producing reactions in soils the eq 1 is used in dndc to calculate ch4 production rate through acetotrophic methanogensis 1 v c h 4 α v m a x α c h 3 c o o h k m a c h 3 c o o h where v c h 4 α indicates the methane production rate as the result of acetotrophic methanogensis mol m 3 s 1 vmax α is the maximum methane production rate due to acetotrophic methanogensis mol m 3 s 1 and k mα indicates the concentration of acetate during a half of the maximum methane production rate mol m 3 s 1 in dndc eq 2 is applied to calculate ch4 production rate through hydrogenotrophic methanogensis 2 v c h 4 b v m a x b c o 2 k m b 1 c o 2 h 2 k m b 2 h 2 where v c h 4 b shows the ch4 production rate as the result of hydrogenotrophic methanogensis mol m 3 s 1 co2 and h2 are co2 and h2 concentrations in mol m 3 s 1 respectively vmax b is the maximum methane production rate due to hydrogenotrophic methanogensis mol m 3 s 1 and k mb 1 and k mb 2 indicate co2 and h2 respectively at a half of the maximum methane production rate mol m 3 s 1 lastly dndc calculate the total daily ch4 production by summing the h2 induced and acetate induced ch4 production in the soils fig 2 also displays the emission of ch4 under anaerobic conditions via three ways i e diffusion ebullition and plant driven transport fumoto et al 2008 methane diffusion across the predicted soil layers is determined by the ch4 gradient between these layers and it is calculated by using eq 3 3 d d f i f d c h 4 i c h 4 i 1 where ddf i indicates the ch4 diffusion rate in ith layer mol m 3 s 1 f d is the value of diffusion coefficient s 1 and it is a function of clay fractions in soil which can be calculated by eq 4 ch4 i and ch4 i 1 are concentrations of ch4 in soil layer ith and i 1 respectively 4 f d 0 5 1 c l a y in case soil water is overfilled with ch4 production then excess ch4 is escaped from the soil layers by process of ebullition and it can be calculated by the following equation 5 c h 4 s t 5 357 0 0285 e 0 0414 t 0 0115 where ch4st indicates saturated ch4 concentration in soil water kg c m 3 and t is the soil temperature c in dndc model it is assumed that ebullition is independent from the texture of soil 2 4 3 limitations of dndc in spite of frequent applications of dndc model to predict ghg fluxes from agricultural soils it also have some limitation that are 1 dndc model could not simulate the lateral flows of nutrients and water and it is assumed that there should be a homogenous microbial population of heterotroph and autotroph smith et al 2008 2 dndc shows uncertainty in estimation of soil moisture because it uses a cascade water flow model uzoma et al 2015 3 there is no management option to control the mobile carbon derived from biochar thus organic carbon derived from straw was selected under manure type of dndc s crop management options improvements in organic amendments of dndc framework should be considered for better controlling of organic c derived from biochar 4 prediction of ch4 emissions from paddy fields by dndc also needs some additional information like planting depths of rice seedlings number seedlings per hill and age of transplanted seedlings it is suggested to incorporate this information in future dndc s versions to predict the ch4 flux more accurately although there are some limitations of dndc but this model is considered more flexible and user friendly due to a simple framework for model inputs and outputs 2 5 dndc simulation and evaluation 2 5 1 model setup in this study the observed weather data were obtained from sensors situated in the greenhouse the soil used in this experiment has been classified as a loam in the crosby soil series usda 2012 the land use type was selected as paddy rice field and default values of other soil parameters including clay fraction porosity field capacity wilting points and conductivity were used to run the model the measured value of soil organic matter was used to set the soil bulk density default values of soil parameters such as initial n concentration at surface

management practices e g timing and level of fertilization application and bc management data nine input files were generated one for each treatment a spin up period of five years was established in dndc prior to main experimental study for stabilizing the partitioning of c and n pools derived by bc in soils and similar scheme was also applied previously reported studies fumoto et al 2008 smith et al 2008 and 2010 perlman et al 2013 in order to stabilize the c pools in soils 2 5 2 statistical analyses six statistical indices including mean percent difference mpd root mean squared error rmse

treatments e g wbcn140 and 2bcn140 against observed seasonal ch4 fluxes dndc was calibrated with two treatments because we did further partitioning of soc in the input files of bc treatments table 1 before calibration dndc performance was tested against input files of wbcn140 and 2bcn140 treatments under default values of soil and crop parameters under wbcn140 2bcn140 treatments dndc predicted

during rice growth period fig 2a given this very poor performance of model under both treatments we tested the potential performance of dndc through calibration specifically soil parameters listed in table 1 first the crop parameters biomass production biomass fraction and tdd in both treatments were adjusted according to measured biomass accumulation in stem leaves and roots further manual adjustment in soil parameters table 1 were done to make dndc simulations closer to observed values of ch4 fluxes after dndc s calibration simulation results under both treatments exhibited seasonal ch4 dynamics that well matched the observed ch4 fluxes the statistical indexes comparing modeled and observed daily ch4 emissions were also in excellent ranges e g mpd was 6 05 rmse 4 00 g ch4 ha 1 d

measured daily ch4 fluxes were significantly correlated r2 0 81 0 95 p 0 01 with intercept ranging from 4 42 to 7 39 p 0 05 and slopes were from 0 83 to 0 96 fig 3 a c the model performance was good as the calculated rmse ranged from 6 74 to 7 62 g ch4 ha 1 d 1 mpd and nrmse were at 10 94 17 43 and 17 54 24 52 respectively and me was very satisfactory ranging from 0 71 to 0 93 under n combinations with and without bc amendment table 2 additionally the model captured the changing patterns of seasonal ch4 emissions from transplanting to harvest under all treatments very well fig 4 a

and nrmse was also low at 22 61 the value of mae at 0 38 g plant 1 represented the over prediction of final dry weights of a plant under some treatments fig 5 3 3 soil parameters in this study the simulated dynamics in soil temperature were in poor agreement with measurements under all treatments the calculated mpd ranged from 0 72 to 2 52 rmse ranged from 1 43 to 1 56 c nrmse was high at 6 43 6 79 mae ranged from 0 19 to 0 54 c d index was very low at 0 12 0 16 and me ranged from 3 85 to 3 79 under pots with and without bc amendments table 2 the linear regression between modeled and measured soil temperature showed that slopes ranged from 0 88 to 0 79 intercept between 40 36 and 41 54 p 0 01 and co efficient of determination r2 between 0 34 and 0 38 p 0 01 fig 6 a c dndc

respectively and me was also excellent ranging from 0 85 to 0 90 and d index was varied from 0 97 to 0 98 under n combinations with and without bc amendments the modeled and measured daily vwcs were significantly correlated r2 0 91 0 94 p 0 01 with intercept ranging from 0 35 to 7 63 p 0 05 and slopes were from 1 02 to 1 12 fig 7 a c furthermore dndc predicted relatively higher daily vwcs dynamics under bc treatments compared to n alone treatments fig 7a i in terms of soil ph the computed mpd ranged from 0 09 to 3 80 rmse was from 0 16 to 10 28 nrmse was not very high and ranged from 2

simulate annual ch4 fluxes the modeled and measured values for cumulative ch4 emissions over the growing period were also compared by 1 1 line fit fig 9 the unfertilized pot had modeled cumulative growing season ch4 flux of 1 931 kg ha 1 against the observed cumulative flux of 1 934 kg ch4 ha 1 dndc with n fertilized pots 70 and 140 kg n ha 1 without bc amendments had modeled cumulative growing season ch4 fluxes from 1 60 to 1 99 kg ha 1 and measurements ranged from 2 55 to 2 9 kg ch4 ha 1 furthermore the model under predicted the cumulative growing season ch4 fluxes from pots amended with 2 and 4 bc with no n and simulated values varied from 2 03 to 2 78 kg ha 1 against the measurements of 3 69 to 3 96 kg ch4 ha 1 respectively the pots with 2 and 4 bc addition and fertilized by 70 and 140 kg n ha 1 had modeled cumulative growing season ch4 fluxes of 2 08 3 54 kg ha 1 against observed fluxes of 3 12 4 40 kg ch4 ha 1 considering all treatments the difference was significant between modeled and measured cumulative ch4 fluxes wilcoxon signed rank p 0 005 and dndc mostly under simulated the cumulative growing season ch4 fluxes fig 9 3 5 field management in this study dndc identified the impact of n fertilization and bc amendments on ch4 fluxes the n addition had a non significant effect on both modeled and measured ch4 fluxes kruskal wallis p 0 3 but bc addition significantly affected the predicted and observed ch4 fluxes kruskal wallis p 0 01 3 6 correlation with n bc and environmental parameters correlation analysis was performed to determine variables that could have an effect on modeled and measured ch4 fluxes as well as on dndc s performance the daily predicted ch4 fluxes were negatively corelated with minimum air temperature whilst rho values for maximum air temperature were closer to 0 under all treatments tab s1 furthermore the predicted and observed ch4 fluxes were strong and positively correlated with minimum air temperature and soil ph of bc amended soils tab s1 but soil ph of n fertilized pots was negatively correlated with modeled and measured ch4 fluxes in relation to vwcs the modeled and measured ch4 emissions were negatively associated under all treatments tab s1 in terms of model error it was negatively correlated with soil temperature soil ph nitrogen addition max and min air temperature but positively correlated with vwcs under n only treatments table 3 furthermore model error was also negatively correlated with max and min air temperature soil temperature ph and vwcs under n and bc amended soils however it was positively correlated with bc addition table 3 4 discussion dndc being a process based model can simulate the effects of agricultural management systems on environment and depict the possibilities of the underlying processes for better understanding dou et al 2014 compared with other models dndc has the ability to predict the dynamics of nutrient flows and emissions by capturing all mechanistic steps that are involved in site mode dndc can simulate accurately the ghg emissions in our agro ecosystem and management strategies for mitigating ghg fluxes and improving the farm productivity in regional mode dndc can assist in developing national ghg inventories and evaluate the variations in ghg emissions due to changed farm management practices li et al 2002 the recent version of dndc can also simulate the vertical and horizontal movements of water and nutrients at the watershed or landscape levels due to incorporation of two fundamental hydrologic features including the modified universal soil loss equation and the soil conservation service curve function to be convenient for identifying the means to reduce ch4 fluxes a biogeochemical model should have the capability of 1 reasonably simulating ch4 flux including temporal trends and seasonal magnitude and 2 capturing a significant variation in ch4 fluxes by management strategies of interest and input parameters adjusted firstly dndc model admirably simulated the temporal daily scale ch4 fluxes both under as well as over simulating the ch4 emissions against observed values under all treatments fig 4a i the parameters adjustment during calibration process improved the dndc model s prediction for ch4 however we reported some discrepancies in predicting the soil temperature we adjusted the model parameters under two treatments 1 140 kg n ha 1 and 2 2 bc added in pots of 140 kg ha 1 the purpose of calibrating dndc in this way was to adjust the soc partitioning into different c pools including resistant litter humads humus and bc the fixed and mobile c fractions of bc were controlled through biochar c and manuring options respectively in dndc and these c adjustments were done according to kyaw 2015 secondly the simulations of dndc were strongly correlated with air temperature rather than soil temperature which could be associated with a cooling effect of bc application due to higher values of vwcs in bc added pots throughout growing period of rice fig 8 a i similarly saarnio et al 2013 documented that bc addition enhanced the surface soil moisture content by 10 30 in terms of cumulative growing season ch4 emissions dndc predominantly under predicted ch4 fluxes fig 9 we surmised that dndc could not consider the effect of soil depth on diffusion rate of ch4 and only predicts heterogeneous soil profile at soil depth of 50 cm which may result the model to estimate ch4 emissions peaks earlier as compared to observed fluxes in field fig 4 thus dndc underestimates the overall magnitude of ch4 emissions some researchers reported inconsistent predictions of gaseous emissions even after calibration uzoma et al 2015 congreves et al 2016 however several studies ludwig et al 2011 cui et al 2014 abalos et al 2016 deng et al 2016 showed that dndc simulated the ghg emissions in good agreement with the measured data after its calibration ludwig et al 2011 and abalos et al 2016 applied very intensive datasets to calibrate dndc using a multi level calibration approach with additional variables measured and used this multi level calibration approach improved the prediction of gaseous emissions but could not be applied to the dataset used in the current study as the additional variables were not recorded which was a limitation dndc over simulated the cumulative ch4 flux by 13 to 38 under bc amended pots additionally it also over predicted the ch4 efflux from bc added soils by 15 to 39 in comparison with that from the n only treated pots these results corroborate with those reported by kyaw 2015 who also observed higher ch4 fluxes from bc treatments dndc predicts the ch4 efflux by accounting soil redox potential soc sources dissolved organic carbon doc and co2 available for the activities of methanogens soil texture soil moisture and temperature and ch4 diffusion rate li 2000 here the anaerobic conditions of paddy soils due to high vwcs low soil bulk density higher soil ph and fixed c contents derived from bc favored higher methanogenic activity dalal et al 2008 zweiten et al 2009 therefore dndc simulated ch4 emissions by considering these underlying ch4 driving mechanisms some of which were measured and modeled in this study we suggest that more studies under different ecosystems must be conducted to count those variables which were missing in this study such as microbial biomass doc from root exudates as well as from bc the potential impact of bc amendments on emissions of non co2 ghgs may also vary with soils and site conditions as well as bc characteristics spokas and reicosky 2009 simulation performance of dndc can be improved by calibrating it with dataset developed under different bc types higher ch4 prediction under bc treatments may suggest that the model would have considered the texture of this treatment as an unfavorable factor for ch4 diffusion lower values of ch4 emissions predicted by dndc under n fertilized and control treatments might be associated with lower doc in soils as compared to bc treatments hence measurements and validations across different environments might improve the model performance for predicting ghg emissions 5 conclusion after calibration by a parameter adjustment approach dndc s evaluation results show that the rmse ranged from 6 74 to 7 62 g ch4 ha 1 d 1 and the d index varied between 0 92 to 0 98 dndc under simulated the cumulative ch4 emissions from all treatments except the control despite a good response in predicting ch4 flux at the daily time scale dndc poorly predicted the soil temperature and soil ph values and predicted very well the soil moisture content however model performance increased with increase in ph of soils amended by bc in conclusion dndc can capture the daily time scale and growing season cumulative ch4 fluxes by applying a parameter adjustment approach during model calibration this study also suggests that dndc must be calibrated and validated across the different environments by using intensive measurements of additional soil variables such as doc and alteration in microbial archaea in the soils by supplying different types of bc credit author

to study sediment transport pollutant dynamics saline water intrusion algal blooms temperature stratification and other related topics flow and concentrations of sediment and heavy metals in the blackstone river usa during three storm events were simulated using a 1d model within the framework of efdc the contributions of point sources non point sources and sediment resuspension to heavy metals were evaluated through scenario analysis by ji et al 2002 in their study a linear adsorption assumption was incorporated into the efdc model the modified model simulated settling and resuspension of fecal bacteria simultaneously with sediment transport under different conditions bai and lung 2005 the efdc model results confirmed that most of the sediment and metals were transported in relatively short bursts during floods and were stored in depositional spots within the lower don river mansoor et al 2018 salinity plays a fundamental role in estuaries and tidal rivers salinity stratification and salt intrusion were simulated by efdc with varying parameters such as river flow rate wind and tide salinity intruded further upstream under a scenario with low flow and downriver local wind conditions jiang et al 2009 jeong et al 2010 zhou et al 2012 efdc simulations showed that net salt transport due to estuarine circulation during neap tide was greater than during the spring tide while saltwater intrusion was stronger during the spring tide than neap tide zhou et al 2012 liu et al 2019 studied an estuary in dry seasons and found that large scale land reclamation decreased landward salt transport resulting in decreased salinity and a shortened salt intrusion length using efdc efdc has been used to address the eutrophic status of surface water in applications such as algal bloom simulation assessment and management it was determined that biomanipulation and water transfer could delay the peak chl a concentration in the guanting reservoir he et al 2011 in the taihu lake water age analysis using efdc determined that the most efficient flow rate for water transfer was 100 m3 s li et al 2011 efdc model results showed that doubling water flow

suitability based on these water quality parameters simulations can also be carried out to investigate the characteristics of manmade facilities the numerical results of a mike 3 analysis of do

conditions chen et al 2019 a mike model with manning s roughness coefficient estimation was used to estimate chloride concentrations in the emergent and submerged aquatic vegetation in a constructed wetland the resulting data agreed well with measured data with an error about 15 min and wise 2010 mike 3 was used by lessin and raudsepp 2007 to separate the narva bay coastal area into zones with different trophic status based on the inorganic nitrogen and phytoplankton concentrations they quantified and introduced processes and mechanisms of delaying eelgrass recovery into the mike 3 model the loss of over 70 of the eelgrass area in odense and roskilde fjord estuaries was caused by a combination of lugworm burial of seeds and seedlings resuspension from macroalgae and wave action kuusemae et al 2016 results from mike 21 modeling indicated that tidal energy device arrays which increased the residence time of the flow accounted for up to 25 of the variability in phytoplankton concentrations in coastal and inshore areas schuchert et al 2018 4 6 wasp 4 6 1 description of wasp wasp has a flexible framework for modeling aquatic systems wasp allows the user to run 1d 2d 3d

efdc and wasp ranked as the top three models in citations apparently these models have caught the attention of a wide range of researchers in the last five years and over the last two decades users in different countries have different preferences the usa was the most productive country in research using models such as aquatox and ce qual w2 chinese researchers took a leading role in publications

24483,fluctuations in natural nitrous oxide emissions n2o are not fully understood especially on the qinghai tibetan plateau in order to characterize the differences in historical n2o variations among different regions of the qinghai tibetan plateau and investigate how a warmer and wetter climate change would affect the n2o fluxes over the qinghai tibetan plateau a process based model triplex ghg has been validated using 14 sites with annual n2o emission fluxes and is used to estimate the spatiotemporal patterns of natural n2o fluxes and predict its future trend for the qinghai tibetan plateau the temperature increasing by 1 5 c and the precipitation increasing by 10 considering the model performance evaluation indicators r2 0 83 rrmse 44 6 pbias 7 18 the performance of the model for simulating annual n2o fluxes is moderate the estimated average total natural n2o emissions of the qinghai tibetan plateau from 1970 to 2017 were 0 313 tg n yr 1 ranging from 0 305 tg n yr 1 1983 to 0 325 tg n yr 1 2006 the estimated total natural n2o emissions of the qinghai tibetan plateau slightly increased from 1970 to 2017 with a mean increase of 0 0002 tg n yr 1 between the 1970s and 2010s most increases in n2o flux were observed in the northern and southeastern regions of the qinghai tibetan plateau the area in which the rate of n2o released was greater than 15 µg n m 2 h 1 was mainly found in plateau temperate regions regions with relatively high temperatures released more n2o which indicates that temperature is a dominant factor for n2o emissions in high altitude regions natural n2o emissions of the qinghai tibetan plateau will increase up to 0 335 tg n yr 1 by approximately 6 13 by 2050 if the climate continues to become warmer and wetter keywords nitrous oxide emission qinghai tibetan plateau spatiotemporal pattern climate change model simulation future prediction 1 introduction since the industrial revolution atmospheric n2o concentrations have increased continuously and reached approximately 333 6 ppb in 2021 data from the noaa esrl global monitoring division n2o is a long lived 120 year greenhouse gas ghg with a stable molecular structure and relative global warming potential that is 298 times that of co2 ciais et al 2013 n2o can induce photochemical reactions through solar ultraviolet radiation in the upper stratosphere participate in the decomposition of the ozone layer increase ultraviolet radiation to the surface and endanger human health ravishankara et al 2009 nitrification and denitrification are the main biochemical processes regulating the formation and consumption of soil n2o both processes are affected not only by microbial activities in various soil microenvironments e g soil temperature moisture and aeration clay content ph and carbon c and nitrogen n availability but also by both natural disturbances and human management practices e g synthetic n fertilizer use manure n application irrigation and tillage these result in great spatial heterogeneity in n2o fluxes under different environmental conditions mørkved et al 2007 cuhel et al 2010 kato et al 2011 yue et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 however our understanding of the processes and mechanisms underlying terrestrial n2o emissions as well as our ability to quantify these emissions is limited and this contributes to the large degree of uncertainty in estimates of both historical and future n2o emissions the qinghai tibet plateau has a substantial effect on the regional and global climate systems and the ecological economy it is also a sensitive indicator of climate change chen et al 2013 due to the harsh climate of the qinghai tibetan plateau there is an obvious lack of in situ measurements aimed at understanding the n2o flux that varies along the spatial gradient of environmental changes on a plot region or larger scale kato et al 2011 in addition the lack of in situ n2o measurements compromises our ability to extrapolate n2o emissions from the plot to the regional scale previous studies in the qinghai tibet plateau have focused mainly on characterizing temporal changes in n2o fluxes in several plots using various modeling frameworks including a mechanistic model based on michaelis menten kinetics müller et al 1997 an empirical model related to soil properties conen et al 2001 and a process based model water and nitrogen management model wnmm nswdpi du et al 2016 however the spatial pattern of n2o emissions from the qinghai tibetan plateau has not yet been estimated using these methods although recent progress has been made in quantifying n2o budgets and estimating the spatial variation of global terrestrial n2o fluxes by the n2o model inter comparison project nmip tian et al 2018 2019 high resolution estimates of the spatial variation in n2o fluxes across the qinghai tibetan plateau are still lacking the timing and magnitude of the increase in temperature in the qinghai tibetan plateau have been earlier and more extensively compared with the rest of the northern hemisphere and global averages respectively liu and chen 2000 xu et al 2008 over the past several decades 1961 2012 the temperature of the qinghai tibetan plateau has increased 0 3 0 4 c decade 1 yan and liu 2014 you et al 2016 which is far more rapid than the average global temperature increase 0 06 c decade 1 during 1880 2012 ipcc 2013 in addition precipitation on the qinghai tibetan plateau has slightly increased since 1960 xu et al 2008 chen et al 2013 most studies have focused on estimating recent changes in n2o emissions tian et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 by contrast few studies have evaluated the effects of a warmer and wetter climate change on n2o fluxes griffis et al 2017 kesik et al 2006 although griffis et al 2017 showed that warmer and wetter conditions will result in increases in soil n2o emissions worldwide how n2o emissions might change under the warmer and wetter climate on the qinghai tibetan plateau remains unclear this knowledge gap impedes our ability to predict the ecological consequences of climate change in the qinghai tibetan plateau and take appropriate countermeasures currently there is a lack of spatial quantification of n2o emissions and more accurate model simulations and predictions are urgently needed to infer n2o fluxes on the qinghai tibet plateau hu et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 du et al 2016 based on the biogeochemical cycling of c and n we developed a process oriented model triplex ghg that describes c and n dynamics and ghg emissions zhu et al 2015a zhang et al 2017 the model was calibrated at a global scale using daily data and was found to perform reasonably well in estimating annual n2o emissions based on the validation results in our previous study zhang et al 2017 this study is a supplementary validation and a new application of this model on the qinghai tibetan plateau knowledge of the natural n2o emissions on the qinghai tibetan plateau can enhance our understanding of how the third pole environment responds to climate change which in turn would help policy makers make more informed decisions on issues related to management laws and regulations of ghgs in order to characterize the spatiotemporal variation in historical n2o emissions among different regions of the qinghai tibetan plateau and investigate how a warmer and wetter climate change would affect the n2o fluxes over the qinghai tibetan plateau we use the triplex ghg model to 1 estimate the spatiotemporal variations of n2o emission and 2 predict variation in n2o emissions on the qinghai tibetan plateau under a warmer and wetter future scenario 2 material and methods 2 1 model description the process based triplex ghg model consists of six basic submodules a land surface submodule a vegetation dynamic submodule a plant phenology submodule a soil biogeochemical submodule a methane ch4 submodule zhu et al 2014 2015a and an n2o submodule zhang et al 2017 the basic framework of land surface processes carbon balance and vegetation dynamic processes was mainly adopted from the ibis model foley et al 1996 kucharik et al 2000 and the soil n cycle and its limitation on vegetation productivity were coupled into the model by liu et al 2005 the land surface submodule is mainly used to simulate the exchange of energy water and co2 among the atmosphere vegetation canopy and ground surface using the lsx land surface transfer scheme surface process model pollard and thompson 1995 the plant phenology submodule is mainly used to simulate plant phenology and photosynthesis foley et al 1996 the soil biogeochemical submodule describes the soil c and n processes and considers their coupling the feedback of n on c assimilation in the n2o submodule the major biochemical processes that regulate n2o formation include nitrification and denitrification zhang et al 2017 and the major theoretical foundations for these processes was mainly adopted from the denitrification decomposition dndc model li et al 2000 li 2016 soil organic carbon soc and soil mineral nitrogen mn are mainly produced through the decomposition of different residue types leaves wood or roots which are regulated by the c n ratios of these pools and they can subsequently provide substrates e g doc nh4 and no3 for nitrification and denitrification during proportional allocations because nitrification and denitrification occur simultaneously in the soil the model adopts the concept of an anaerobic balloon li et al 2000 the soil anaerobic state i e the anaerobic balloon volume fraction is used to allocate the concentration of substrates for example doc nh4 and no3 inside for denitrification and outside for nitrification the balloon in the nitrification process nh4 and doc which are closely linked to nitrifier activity fang and moncrieff 2005 are both considered based on the michaelis menten equation michaelis and menten 1913 with the effect of moisture and ph the activity of nitrifiers alters the rates of soil respiration and n assimilation and thus the concentrations of nutrients such as doc nh4 and no3 in the soil zhang et al 2017 n2o emissions produced by nitrification in the model is set as part of the soil nitrification rate 0 02 0 09 mørkved et al 2007 and this ratio is also affected by soil temperature and soil moisture williams and fehsenfeld 1991 ingwersen et al 1999 each step of denitrification can be regarded as an independent reaction but competition for doc is formed between these reactions leffelaar and wessel 1988 the model is set to an hourly step for denitrification and the relative growth rate of denitrifiers in each step depends not only on the doc concentration but also on the mineral n concentration chapin iii et al 2011 therefore the michaelis menten equation based on doc and mineral n was used to simulate the relative growth rate of denitrifiers to account for the competition between different reactions for doc and the production and consumption of nitrogen containing compounds li 2016 in addition the pirt equation pirt 1965 regulated by temperature and moisture was used to calculate the consumption rates of no3 no2 no and n2o in each denitrification stage and this method considers changes in n containing compounds that microorganisms need to maintain their survival and growth a more detailed description and information are provided by zhang et al 2017 2 2 model forcing data in this study we applied a series of spatiotemporal datasets to represent environmental changes at a spatial resolution of 10 km 10 km from 1970 to 2017 these data included daily climate conditions such as the minimum average and maximum temperature values precipitation specific humidity air pressure and wind speed the driven climate data in the qinghai tibetan plateau regions were generated based on the interpolation of original daily station based meteorological data 91 stations in the qinghai tibetan plateau regions from 1970 to 2017 at a national scale with a resolution of 10 km using the program anusplin anusplin is a package of program modules developed for fitting surfaces of noisy data as functions of independent spline variables and parametric linear sub models which are referred to as covariates hutchinson 1984 hutchinson and gessler 1994 2004 the method can be viewed as a generalization of standard multivariate linear regression hutchinson 2004 anusplin has been used in many studies from regional to global scales price et al 2000 hijmans et al 2005 macdonald et al 2020 to improve the accuracy of the interpolation we included the digital elevation model dem data as a covariate in anusplin dem data were obtained from the 90 m srtm shuttle radar topography mission and were resampled to 10 km for this study for the model initialization the soil dataset was derived from the 1 1000 000 china soil dataset shi et al 2004 wei et al 2013 which includes soil texture soil clay sand and silt fraction soil ph soil carbon and soil carbon to nitrogen ratio data the vegetation cover dataset was derived from the vegetation map of china 1 4000 000 hou 1979 the in situ data sampled from the atmosphere at the mauna loa observatory keeling et al 2005 in hawaii were utilized as the atmospheric co2 concentration data used during the period of 1970 2017 all datasets were transformed and re projected to the same projection system and resolution 10 km 10 km 2 3 model validation and simulations the model was calibrated at a global scale using multi year daily n2o flux data in our previous study zhang et al 2017 specifically we selected 23 parameters to conduct the sensitivity analysis and found that the maximum nitrification rate coefficient coenr was the most sensitive one we adjusted the coenr for n2o emissions to fit the best performing model through parameter fitting for 29 calibration sites which includes various biome types tropical forests temperate forests boreal forests and grasslands for each biome type the average parameter values for all data collection sites in the corresponding biome were used as the default values of coenr the model was previously validated using annual observation at 52 sites globally zhang et al 2017 however no sites from the qinghai tibetan plateau were used to validate this model in this study due to a lack of daily n2o flux data on the qinghai tibetan plateau across multiple years we used the default value of this parameter to conduct the model validation we compiled measured annual n2o flux data from the published literature for 14 sites on the qinghai tibetan plateau that have been largely free of anthropogenic disturbances for model validation table 1 provides detailed information on the validation sites including the geographic location latitude longitude and specific site vegetation type mean annual air temperature mean total precipitation altitude experimental year soc content soil ph and references to clarity the effect of climate variability on natural n2o fluxes the potential effects of atmospheric deposition and land management practices were excluded from model simulations the model historical simulation went through an initial 300 year spin up procedure the initial 300 year spin up was driven with multiyear between 1970 and 1990 averaged historical meteorological data to achieve a relative equilibrium state in the carbon pools before analysis to reach soil carbon equilibrium the model has an internal speed up process during the soil spin up period the vegetation distribution remained unchanged during the period of 1970 2017 the qinghai tibetan temperature is anticipated to increase by 1 5 c and models project an increase in precipitation of approximately 10 by 2050 chen et al 2013 which was used as a warmmer and wetter future scenario in this study on this basis we increased the temperature data of 2010s by 1 5 c and the precipitation data by 10 as the future scenario of 2050 to predict the variations of n2o fluxes these data served as the meteorological input data for the future scenario simulation future co2 concentration data was change over the time of model simulation while the other driven data remained unchanged 2 4 statistical analysis five statistics were used to evaluate model performance relative root mean square error rrmse model efficiency nash sutcliffe

the number of data points and x is the mean of the measured data zonal statistics were conducted for 11 regions based on the framework of china s geo ecological regional system proposed by zheng 1996 this division considers the variation characteristics of precipitation and temperature at the same time the qinghai tibetan plateau was divided into 11 natural regions fig s1 including three temperature zones and four arid humid regions the guoluo nagqu alpine shrub meadow zone h1b1 the south qinghai alpine steppe zone h1c1 the qutang alpine steppe zone h1c2 the kunlun mountains alpine desert zone h1d1 the west sichuan alpine coniferous forest h2ab1 the east tibet qilian alpine coniferous steppe h2c1 the south tibet alpine shrub steppe zone h2c2 the qaidam basin desert zone h2d1 the kunlun mountains north desert zone h2d2 the nagri mountain desert zone h2d3 and the subtropical broadleaf evergreen forest region h3 analysis of variance was used to assess differences in n2o emissions among different regions or periods followed by multiple comparisons using the lsd least significant difference method all analyses were performed using r version 3 6 2 r 2019 the threshold for statistical significance was p 0 05 for all statistical analyses 3 results 3 1 model validation fig 1 shows the simulated means of annual n2o emissions versus the measured means of annual n2o emissions for all sites in the study area during validation simulated and measured n2o emissions are close to the 1 1 line over a wide range of annual n2o emission rates between 0 47 and 19 0 µg n m 2 h 1 and the annual observed and simulated n2o emission data are highly correlated r2 0 83 p 0 01 the ef d and pbias are 0 733 0 894 and 7 18 respectively table 2 indicating good performance for estimating n2o fluxes however the model has an rrmse value of 44 6 indicating poor agreement with the observed n2o flux data table 2 the high rrmse value likely stems from the fact that the model greatly underestimates the n2o flux values of some sites with higher annual n2o emission rates for example the simulated annual n2o flux of the site located in the zoige meadow 11 36 µg n m 2 h 1 is approximately half of the measured value 19 0 µg n m 2 h 1 considering model performance evaluation indicators we conclude that the performance of the model for simulating annual n2o fluxes is moderate which indicates that the triplex ghg model could be used to model the annual n2o emissions on the qinghai tibetan plateau 3 2 historical spatiotemporal patterns of estimated natural n2o emissions in the qinghai tibetan plateau from 1970 to 2017 the estimated total n2o emissions on the qinghai tibetan plateau is 0 313 0 005 tg n yr 1 ranging from 0 305 tg n yr 1 the lowest value occurs in 1983 to 0 325 tg n yr 1 the highest value occurs in 2006 fig 2 a the estimated natural n2o emissions show slight increasing trends with a mean increase of 0 202 gg n yr 1 over the study period fig 2a however there is a significant decrease in the estimated total n2o emissions on the qinghai tibetan plateau during the 1990s 0 7 gg n yr 1 especially during the 2nd half of the 1990s the largest growth rate of the modelled n2o emissions per decade is observed in the 2000s with an increase of 0 37 gg n yr 1 and the largest increase of the modelled n2o emissions occur between 1988 and 1989 10 80 gg n the order of the contribution percentage of each region to total n2o emissions on the qinghai tibetan plateau in the 2010s is as follows h1c2 18 39 h2ab1 16 34 h1b1 11 57 h2d1 11 41 h2c2 9 89 h1d1 8 55 h2c1 7 86 h1c1 6 75 h2d2 4 60 h2d3 2 77 h3 1 87 fig 2b the estimated n2o fluxes range from 0 to 35 µg n m 2 h 1 fig 2c low n2o flux levels 3 µg n m 2 h 1 are observed for some high altitude areas grid cells distributed along the gangdise and kunlun mountains the estimated total n2o budget of the plateau sub frigid e g h1c2 h1b1 and h1d1 region is high however this is caused by its larger area compared with other regions in the qinghai tibetan plateau fig 2c the estimated n2o fluxes from the plateau sub frigid region i e h1 are significantly lower compared with those from the plateau temperate region and the subtropical broadleaf evergreen forest region i e h2 and h3 respectively fig 3 the estimated n2o fluxes from the arid region i e d 11 39 0 24 µg n m 2 h 1 are significantly lower than those from the humid semi humid region i e a b 11 59 0 26 µg n m 2 h 1 and the semi arid region i e c 11 67 0 20 µg n m 2 h 1 among ecoclimate zones h2c2 has the highest and h1c1 has the lowest estimated n2o fluxes 15 80 0 10 µg n m 2 h 1 and 9 75 0 42 µg n m 2 h 1 respectively compared with other regions fig 3 fig 4 shows the spatial distributions of the estimated natural n2o flux increases the average value during the 2010s minus that during the 1970s on the qinghai tibetan plateau and the temporal patterns from the 1970s to the 2010s of the natural n2o emissions from different regions between the 1970s and 2010s the most of the estimated n2o flux increases occur in the northern and southeastern parts of the qinghai tibetan plateau some areas that have experienced decrease between the 1970s and 2010s are mainly distributed in the southwestern and northeastern regions of the qinghai tibetan plateau e g h1c2 and h2d3 in addition some areas scattered in the southeastern regions of the qinghai tibetan plateau show pronounced decreases in n2o fluxes e g h1b1 and h2ab1 the estimated natural n2o emissions of the h1c1 and h3 regions which are located in the central and southeastern parts of the qinghai tibet plateau are relatively stable from the 1970s to 2010s whereas the estimated n2o emissions in other regions increase fig 4 in particular the estimated n2o emissions of h2d2 increased from 10 05 gg n in the 1970s to 14 51 gg n in the 2010s although the estimated increase in n2o flux for many grid cells is large in h2ab1 the total estimated n2o emissions show a slight downward trend albeit not significantly from the 1990s to 2010s fig 4 overall an increasing trend in the estimated n2o emissions is observed in arid or semiarid regions on the qinghai tibetan plateau during the study period whereas a relatively stable trend is observed in humid or semi humid regions 3 3 effect of climate precipitation and temperature change on the estimated natural n2o fluxes of the qinghai tibetan plateau fig 5 a b shows the relationships of estimated n2o fluxes with temperature and precipitation the response of the estimated n2o fluxes to precipitation and temperature over the qinghai tibetan plateau shows pronounced spatial variability in the southwestern region of the qinghai tibetan plateau mainly in h3 and h2ab1 precipitation accounts for more than 40 of the total variation in n2o fluxes r2 0 4 which is higher than that of temperature r2 0 2 0 4 for some scattered areas located in the nujiang lancangjiang and jinsajiang red river drainage areas in the h2ab1 region precipitation accounts for 80 of the total variation in the estimated n2o fluxes in the northeastern region of the qinghai tibetan plateau mainly h2d1 h2c1 h1c1 and h1d1 the estimated n2o fluxes were more strongly correlated with temperature than with precipitation table s1 the estimated n2o fluxes from most areas 64 in the plateau sub frigid region i e h1 are primarily regulated by temperature compared with the plateau temperate region and the subtropical broadleaf evergreen forest region i e h2 and h3 the estimated n2o fluxes from most areas in the arid or semi arid regions i e c and d are primarily regulated by temperature compared with the humid or semi humid regions i e a b table s1 in addition the estimated n2o fluxes in most areas on the qinghai tibetan plateau are significantly positively related to temperature fig 5c d p 0 05 although the n2o fluxes in most areas on the qinghai tibetan plateau are significantly negative for precipitation most of the relationships between precipitation and n2o fluxes are weak r2 0 2 areas in which n2o fluxes are more sensitive to precipitation are mainly distributed in the western h2c2 region slope 4 µg n m 2 h 1 mm areas in which n2o fluxes are more sensitive to temperature are mainly distributed in h3 h2d3 and h2c2 slope 2 µg n m 2 h 1 mm these findings coupled with the result of the modelled n2o flux spatial patterns fig 2c indicate the greater n2o emissions in h2d1 h1c2 h1b1 and h2d1 likely stem from their strong positive correlation with temperature which is the dominant controlling factor for the estimated n2o emissions in high altitude areas 3 4 n2o emissions under the future scenario of 1 5 c warming and 10 wetting under the future warmer and wetter climate change scenario the estimated n2o emissions across the entire region of the qinghai tibetan plateau are larger than those in the 2010s reaching 0 335 tg n yr 1 fig 6 that is the increase in future estimated n2o emissions in the qinghai tibetan plateau associated exclusively with the warmer and wetter climate i e regardless of the effects of anthropogenic activities atmospheric nitrogen deposition and other factors is approximately 6 13 moreover the increase in estimated n2o emissions differ among subregions h2c1 exhibits the largest relative increase 11 7 and the h2c2 exhibits the smallest relative increase 1 83 indicating that the highest and lowest relative mean n2o flux increases occur in these areas respectively the estimated relative mean n2o flux increases on the qinghai tibetan plateau under future climate change for regions divided by temperature were highest for h1 6 84 followed by h2 5 67 and h3 2 19 the estimated relative mean n2o flux increases on the qinghai tibetan plateau under future climate change for regions divided by precipitation were highest for c 6 88 followed by a b 6 13 and d 5 24 table 3 4 discussion our study demonstrated that the triplex ghg simulated annual n2o fluxes from the qinghai tibetan plateau using triplex ghg showed moderate agreement with the observed data with regard to the amount however overestimated was observed at some sites with low emissions the model could be used to estimate annual n2o fluxes on the qinghai tibetan plateau based on all model performance evaluation indicators some experiments pei et al 2003 kato et al 2011 du et al 2016 hu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 and our simulations have shown that forests steppes and meadows on the plateau are currently weak n2o sources with relatively low n2o fluxes compared with low altitude areas zhang et al 2019 2020 compared with the spatial pattern of n2o fluxes on the qinghai tibetan plateau estimated by the dyn lpj xu ri prentice 2008 model from simulation results of china xu ri et al 2019 the n2o fluxes in this study were within a reasonable range 0 35 µg n m 2 h 1 precipitation and soil moisture have been commonly accepted as important factors controlling n2o production thus changes of precipitation have been sought to explain modelled variations in n2o fluxes in some studies butterbach bahl et al 2000 cai 2012 the study by davidson et al 2009 revealed that n2o emissions with a water filled pore space wfps in the range of 70 80 were most suitable for n2o emissions when the soil wfps increased beyond this range the denitrification process was more complete and the main final product was n2 davidson et al 2009 because upland soils rarely meet or even exceed the optimal moisture conditions for n2o emissions butterbach bahl et al 2013 a strong positive correlation between soil moisture and n2o emissions has been widely observed in field experiments li et al 2020 however a meta analysis revealed a weak negative correlation between mean annual precipitation and background n2o emissions from soils that received no nitrogen n fertilizer and soil management from global pastures kim et al 2013 similarly modeling conducted by du et al 2016 showed that increase in precipitation increases in alpine meadows of 10 and 20 could reduce the annual release of n2o they suggested that nitrification or the reaction of nitrifiers may have a dominant effect on the increase in n2o emissions and its temperature sensitivity and contribute more than 60 to the formation of n2o on the qinghai tibetan plateau du et al 2016 which explain the negative relationship between modelled n2o fluxes and precipitation in this study the modelled n2o fluxes in most areas on the qinghai tibetan plateau were significantly negatively related to precipitation however most of the relationships between n2o fluxes and precipitation were weak such weak negative linear correlations between precipitation and modelled n2o emissions might be related to the reduction of n2o to n2 in the last step of denitrification which in certain cases can result in the consumption of n2o under low oxygen conditions in the triplex ghg model denitrification is considered a chain reaction process norman et al 2008 the relative growth rate of denitrifiers during each step is not only determined by the concentration of mineral n but also depends on the doc concentration chapin iii et al 2011 hence a double substrate based doc and mineral n michaelis menten equation was adopted in the model zhang et al 2017 further reduction of n2o the last step of denitrification can occur when doc concentrations are sufficiently high li 2016 according to the soil carbon dataset that was used for model initialization wei et al 2013 the soil carbon content in most areas on the qinghai tibetan plateau was relatively high which probably provides sufficient conditions for the final step of denitrification and leads to a reduction in n2o emissions in addition the weak negative relationships between precipitation and modelled n2o emissions were probably affected by temperature the results revealed that the modelled n2o fluxes in most areas on the qinghai tibetan plateau were mainly regulated by temperature indicating that temperature appear to be more important than precipitation in regulating spatial patterns of n2o emissions on the qinghai tibetan plateau which is consistent with the result of field studies for example qiu et al 2018 and wang et al 2014 showed that due to the extremely cold environment of the qinghai tibetan plateau temperature is an important factor limiting n2o emissions through its effect on the activity of soil microorganisms however the effect of precipitation on n2o emissions is not pronounced furthermore the result of liu et al 2017 indicated that an increase in temperature would dramatically enhance n mineralization in areas with relatively low temperatures soils in colder mountainous areas have been found to have higher nitrifier activity than soils in warmer coastal plains anderson et al 1971 increases in soil temperature would accelerate the decomposition of soil organic matter activate the respiration of soil microorganisms and promote the formation of an anaerobic soil environment szukics et al 2010 butterbach bahl et al 2013 thus providing sufficient substances for nitrification and denitrification and promoting the release of soil n2o audsley and wikinson 2012 overall the effect of temperature on biological processes alone is an important factor affecting the solubility of oxygen misra et al 1974 oxygen diffusion li 2016 and n2o production and consumption butterbach bahl et al 2013 these findings were considered in the development of our model in the triplex ghg model the effect of frost on the oxygen diffusion rate was used to adjust the oxygen partial pressure which in turn affects the volumetric fraction of anaerobic microorganisms and directly determines the allocation of substrates to denitrification and nitrification zhang et al 2017 furthermore the exponential response functions expressing the effect of soil temperature on the denitrification and nitrification rate the mineralization rate and the gas diffusion rate were incorporated into this model using the q10 method zhang et al 2017 when modeling the denitrification rate the effect of temperature on denitrification were described as an exponential or variation of an arrhenius type response li et al 2000 farquharson and baldock 2007 for example the denitrification rate increases exponentially as the range of soil temperatures 10 35 c increase with an approximate q10 value of 2 and production during denitrification is set to be detectable above 0 c the effect of soil moisture on nitrifier and denitrifier activities is reflected in the form of a piecewise linear function based on li et al 2000 therefore modelled n2o fluxes may become insensitive to or negatively correlated with soil moisture at relatively low soil temperatures if the climate continues to become warmer and wetter as projected by the future scenario in the present study the qinghai tibetan plateau will emit slightly more 6 13 n2o which is much smaller than the emissions from other regions abdalla et al 2009 griffis et al 2017 for example griffis et al 2017 found that in us corn belt one of the most intensive agricultural regions of the world the climate sensitivity of n2o emissions accounts for about 8 to 25 of the long term trend such differences between studies are probably caused by the differences in modeling approaches and future scenarios consistently n2o emissions were observed to be enhanced under the warmer and wetter future model scenarios in kesik et al 2006 they found that n2o emissions only increased when the average annual soil moisture remained unchanged or slightly decreased and mean annual soil temperature increased by more than 2 0 c the main reason for the simulated decrease in n2o emissions stems from a shift in the relative proportions of n2o versus n2 emitted from the soils under future climate conditions kesik et al 2006 in addition there were differences in studies with regard to the temperature sensitivity of n2o emission an average temperature increase of 1 5 c resulted in an increase in annual n2o emissions from irish agriculture by almost 65 abdalla et al 2009 moreover n2o fluxes have increased substantially in all biomes due to global warming with upland crops having the largest increment eckard and cullen 2011 in contrast dndc modeling gave opposite results as our simulation with a reduction in annual n2o emissions for an alpine meadow when soil temperature increased lin et al 2009 hu et al 2010 du et al 2011 du et al 2011 suggests that in the dndc model warming stimulated plant uptake of soil nitrate and soil water leading to reduction of their contents in soil and denitrification rate therefore such differences between studies are likely caused by differences in the modeling scale as well as the model performance of plant uptake of soil minerals sensitivities to soil temperature this study provides the latest estimates of long term natural annual n2o emissions from terrestrial ecosystems on the qinghai tibetan plateau several uncertainties require consideration to improve our estimates first the historical driving force of the model may introduce some uncertainty for example with the support of the dem the anusplin program was used to interpolate original station based meteorological data at a regional scale at a resolution of 10 km however there are fewer meteorological stations in the central and western regions of the qinghai tibetan plateau and data from these regions are necessary to improve the accuracy of our model driving data in the future second this model can describe the basic processes related to n2o production and consumption i e nitrification and denitrification however it still a large degree of uncertainty in estimates n2o emissions because the various simple empirical response functions of environmental factors are at work in the model and do not consider complex and subsidiary processes e g alienated nitrate reduction and anammox processes in addition many of the biogeographic and geochemical processes involved in the response of the ecosystems on the qinghai tibetan plateau to climate change are largely unknown this also creates difficulties in precisely modeling n2o emissions by ecosystem process based models third the qinghai tibetan plateau is a highly human dominated ecosystem that requires spatially explicit time series data on livestock grazing practices for accurately estimating the n2o budget a hierarchical meta analysis revealed that grazing significantly reduces the total biomass soil organic carbon and total nitrogen which would probably greatly influence the production of n2o yan et al 2020 in addition we need to address the uncertainties associated with nitrogen deposition drainage land use change etc deng et al 2019 rousset et al 2020 fourth the cryosphere is mainly distributed at high latitudes in polar regions but it is also widespread on plateaus and in high mountains at middle and low latitudes especially on the qinghai tibetan plateau the ability of models to account for such regions is limited given the difficulty of describing the freeze thaw process as well as snow movement and accumulation which are of great importance in terms of n2o production yang et al 2019 fifth the evaluation in this study was based largely on very limited field measurements the uncertainties inherent in these measurements are difficult to assess there is thus an urgent need to obtain more robust measurements of n2o emission rates on the qinghai tibetan plateau and soil dynamics doltra et al 2015 5 conclusions in sum the triplex ghg model was validated using 14 sites across the qinghai tibetan plateau considering all model performance evaluation indicators the performance of the model for simulating annual n2o fluxes was moderate which demonstrates that it could be used to estimate the spatial and temporal patterns of n2o emissions from the qinghai tibetan plateau the model simulation results indicate that there was a slight increasing trend in total natural n2o emissions on the qinghai tibetan plateau from 1970 to 2017 regions with relatively high temperatures released more n2o which indicates that temperature is a dominant factor affecting n2o emissions in high altitude regions on the qinghai tibetan plateau n2o fluxes were positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with precipitation in most areas however most of the relationships between n2o fluxes and precipitation were weak if the climate continues to become warmer and wetter the natural n2o emissions on the qinghai tibetan plateau will increase by approximately 6 13 these simulation results provide information that could aid the management of alpine ecosystems and the estimation of ghg inventories under climate change on the qinghai tibetan plateau credit authorship contribution statement kerou zhang

24483,fluctuations in natural nitrous oxide emissions n2o are not fully understood especially on the qinghai tibetan plateau in order to characterize the differences in historical n2o variations among different regions of the qinghai tibetan plateau and investigate how a warmer and wetter climate change would affect the n2o fluxes over the qinghai tibetan plateau a process based model triplex ghg has been validated using 14 sites with annual n2o emission fluxes and is used to estimate the spatiotemporal patterns of natural n2o fluxes and predict its future trend for the qinghai tibetan plateau the temperature increasing by 1 5 c and the precipitation increasing by 10 considering the model performance evaluation indicators r2 0 83 rrmse 44 6 pbias 7 18 the performance of the model for simulating annual n2o fluxes is moderate the estimated average total natural n2o emissions of the qinghai tibetan plateau from 1970 to 2017 were 0 313 tg n yr 1 ranging from 0 305 tg n yr 1 1983 to 0 325 tg n yr 1 2006 the estimated total natural n2o emissions of the qinghai tibetan plateau slightly increased from 1970 to 2017 with a mean increase of 0 0002 tg n yr 1 between the 1970s and 2010s most increases in n2o flux were observed in the northern and southeastern regions of the qinghai tibetan plateau the area in which the rate of n2o released was greater than 15 µg n m 2 h 1 was mainly found in plateau temperate regions regions with relatively high temperatures released more n2o which indicates that temperature is a dominant factor for n2o emissions in high altitude regions natural n2o emissions of the qinghai tibetan plateau will increase up to 0 335 tg n yr 1 by approximately 6 13 by 2050 if the climate continues to become warmer and wetter keywords nitrous oxide emission qinghai tibetan plateau spatiotemporal pattern climate change model simulation future prediction 1 introduction since the industrial revolution atmospheric n2o concentrations have increased continuously and reached approximately 333 6 ppb in 2021 data from the noaa esrl global monitoring division n2o is a long lived 120 year greenhouse gas ghg with a stable molecular structure and relative global warming potential that is 298 times that of co2 ciais et al 2013 n2o can induce photochemical reactions through solar ultraviolet radiation in the upper stratosphere participate in the decomposition of the ozone layer increase ultraviolet radiation to the surface and endanger human health ravishankara et al 2009 nitrification and denitrification are the main biochemical processes regulating the formation and consumption of soil n2o both processes are affected not only by microbial activities in various soil microenvironments e g soil temperature moisture and aeration clay content ph and carbon c and nitrogen n availability but also by both natural disturbances and human management practices e g synthetic n fertilizer use manure n application irrigation and tillage these result in great spatial heterogeneity in n2o fluxes under different environmental conditions mørkved et al 2007 cuhel et al 2010 kato et al 2011 yue et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 however our understanding of the processes and mechanisms underlying terrestrial n2o emissions as well as our ability to quantify these emissions is limited and this contributes to the large degree of uncertainty in estimates of both historical and future n2o emissions the qinghai tibet plateau has a substantial effect on the regional and global climate systems and the ecological economy it is also a sensitive indicator of climate change chen et al 2013 due to the harsh climate of the qinghai tibetan plateau there is an obvious lack of in situ measurements aimed at understanding the n2o flux that varies along the spatial gradient of environmental changes on a plot region or larger scale kato et al 2011 in addition the lack of in situ n2o measurements compromises our ability to extrapolate n2o emissions from the plot to the regional scale previous studies in the qinghai tibet plateau have focused mainly on characterizing temporal changes in n2o fluxes in several plots using various modeling frameworks including a mechanistic model based on michaelis menten kinetics müller et al 1997 an empirical model related to soil properties conen et al 2001 and a process based model water and nitrogen management model wnmm nswdpi du et al 2016 however the spatial pattern of n2o emissions from the qinghai tibetan plateau has not yet been estimated using these methods although recent progress has been made in quantifying n2o budgets and estimating the spatial variation of global terrestrial n2o fluxes by the n2o model inter comparison project nmip tian et al 2018 2019 high resolution estimates of the spatial variation in n2o fluxes across the qinghai tibetan plateau are still lacking the timing and magnitude of the increase in temperature in the qinghai tibetan plateau have been earlier and more extensively compared with the rest of the northern hemisphere and global averages respectively liu and chen 2000 xu et al 2008 over the past several decades 1961 2012 the temperature of the qinghai tibetan plateau has increased 0 3 0 4 c decade 1 yan and liu 2014 you et al 2016 which is far more rapid than the average global temperature increase 0 06 c decade 1 during 1880 2012 ipcc 2013 in addition precipitation on the qinghai tibetan plateau has slightly increased since 1960 xu et al 2008 chen et al 2013 most studies have focused on estimating recent changes in n2o emissions tian et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 by contrast few studies have evaluated the effects of a warmer and wetter climate change on n2o fluxes griffis et al 2017 kesik et al 2006 although griffis et al 2017 showed that warmer and wetter conditions will result in increases in soil n2o emissions worldwide how n2o emissions might change under the warmer and wetter climate on the qinghai tibetan plateau remains unclear this knowledge gap impedes our ability to predict the ecological consequences of climate change in the qinghai tibetan plateau and take appropriate countermeasures currently there is a lack of spatial quantification of n2o emissions and more accurate model simulations and predictions are urgently needed to infer n2o fluxes on the qinghai tibet plateau hu et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 du et al 2016 based on the biogeochemical cycling of c and n we developed a process oriented model triplex ghg that describes c and n dynamics and ghg emissions zhu et al 2015a zhang et al 2017 the model was calibrated at a global scale using daily data and was found to perform reasonably well in estimating annual n2o emissions based on the validation results in our previous study zhang et al 2017 this study is a supplementary validation and a new application of this model on the qinghai tibetan plateau knowledge of the natural n2o emissions on the qinghai tibetan plateau can enhance our understanding of how the third pole environment responds to climate change which in turn would help policy makers make more informed decisions on issues related to management laws and regulations of ghgs in order to characterize the spatiotemporal variation in historical n2o emissions among different regions of the qinghai tibetan plateau and investigate how a warmer and wetter climate change would affect the n2o fluxes over the qinghai tibetan plateau we use the triplex ghg model to 1 estimate the spatiotemporal variations of n2o emission and 2 predict variation in n2o emissions on the qinghai tibetan plateau under a warmer and wetter future scenario 2 material and methods 2 1 model description the process based triplex ghg model consists of six basic submodules a land surface submodule a vegetation dynamic submodule a plant phenology submodule a soil biogeochemical submodule a methane ch4 submodule zhu et al 2014 2015a and an n2o submodule zhang et al 2017 the basic framework of land surface processes carbon balance and vegetation dynamic processes was mainly adopted from the ibis model foley et al 1996 kucharik et al 2000 and the soil n cycle and its limitation on vegetation productivity were coupled into the model by liu et al 2005 the land surface submodule is mainly used to simulate the exchange of energy water and co2 among the atmosphere vegetation canopy and ground surface using the lsx land surface transfer scheme surface process model pollard and thompson 1995 the plant phenology submodule is mainly used to simulate plant phenology and photosynthesis foley et al 1996 the soil biogeochemical submodule describes the soil c and n processes and considers their coupling the feedback of n on c assimilation in the n2o submodule the major biochemical processes that regulate n2o formation include nitrification and denitrification zhang et al 2017 and the major theoretical foundations for these processes was mainly adopted from the denitrification decomposition dndc model li et al 2000 li 2016 soil organic carbon soc and soil mineral nitrogen mn are mainly produced through the decomposition of different residue types leaves wood or roots which are regulated by the c n ratios of these pools and they can subsequently provide substrates e g doc nh4 and no3 for nitrification and denitrification during proportional allocations because nitrification and denitrification occur simultaneously in the soil the model adopts the concept of an anaerobic balloon li et al 2000 the soil anaerobic state i e the anaerobic balloon volume fraction is used to allocate the concentration of substrates for example doc nh4 and no3 inside for denitrification and outside for nitrification the balloon in the nitrification process nh4 and doc which are closely linked to nitrifier activity fang and moncrieff 2005 are both considered based on the michaelis menten equation michaelis and menten 1913 with the effect of moisture and ph the activity of nitrifiers alters the rates of soil respiration and n assimilation and thus the concentrations of nutrients such as doc nh4 and no3 in the soil zhang et al 2017 n2o emissions produced by nitrification in the model is set as part of the soil nitrification rate 0 02 0 09 mørkved et al 2007 and this ratio is also affected by soil temperature and soil moisture williams and fehsenfeld 1991 ingwersen et al 1999 each step of denitrification can be regarded as an independent reaction but competition for doc is formed between these reactions leffelaar and wessel 1988 the model is set to an hourly step for denitrification and the relative growth rate of denitrifiers in each step depends not only on the doc concentration but also on the mineral n concentration chapin iii et al 2011 therefore the michaelis menten equation based on doc and mineral n was used to simulate the relative growth rate of denitrifiers to account for the competition between different reactions for doc and the production and consumption of nitrogen containing compounds li 2016 in addition the pirt equation pirt 1965 regulated by temperature and moisture was used to calculate the consumption rates of no3 no2 no and n2o in each denitrification stage and this method considers changes in n containing compounds that microorganisms need to maintain their survival and growth a more detailed description and information are provided by zhang et al 2017 2 2 model forcing data in this study we applied a series of spatiotemporal datasets to represent environmental changes at a spatial resolution of 10 km 10 km from 1970 to 2017 these data included daily climate conditions such as the minimum average and maximum temperature values precipitation specific humidity air pressure and wind speed the driven climate data in the qinghai tibetan plateau regions were generated based on the interpolation of original daily station based meteorological data 91 stations in the qinghai tibetan plateau regions from 1970 to 2017 at a national scale with a resolution of 10 km using the program anusplin anusplin is a package of program modules developed for fitting surfaces of noisy data as functions of independent spline variables and parametric linear sub models which are referred to as covariates hutchinson 1984 hutchinson and gessler 1994 2004 the method can be viewed as a generalization of standard multivariate linear regression hutchinson 2004 anusplin has been used in many studies from regional to global scales price et al 2000 hijmans et al 2005 macdonald et al 2020 to improve the accuracy of the interpolation we included the digital elevation model dem data as a covariate in anusplin dem data were obtained from the 90 m srtm shuttle radar topography mission and were resampled to 10 km for this study for the model initialization the soil dataset was derived from the 1 1000 000 china soil dataset shi et al 2004 wei et al 2013 which includes soil texture soil clay sand and silt fraction soil ph soil carbon and soil carbon to nitrogen ratio data the vegetation cover dataset was derived from the vegetation map of china 1 4000 000 hou 1979 the in situ data sampled from the atmosphere at the mauna loa observatory keeling et al 2005 in hawaii were utilized as the atmospheric co2 concentration data used during the period of 1970 2017 all datasets were transformed and re projected to the same projection system and resolution 10 km 10 km 2 3 model validation and simulations the model was calibrated at a global scale using multi year daily n2o flux data in our previous study zhang et al 2017 specifically we selected 23 parameters to conduct the sensitivity analysis and found that the maximum nitrification rate coefficient coenr was the most sensitive one we adjusted the coenr for n2o emissions to fit the best performing model through parameter fitting for 29 calibration sites which includes various biome types tropical forests temperate forests boreal forests and grasslands for each biome type the average parameter values for all data collection sites in the corresponding biome were used as the default values of coenr the model was previously validated using annual observation at 52 sites globally zhang et al 2017 however no sites from the qinghai tibetan plateau were used to validate this model in this study due to a lack of daily n2o flux data on the qinghai tibetan plateau across multiple years we used the default value of this parameter to conduct the model validation we compiled measured annual n2o flux data from the published literature for 14 sites on the qinghai tibetan plateau that have been largely free of anthropogenic disturbances for model validation table 1 provides detailed information on the validation sites including the geographic location latitude longitude and specific site vegetation type mean annual air temperature mean total precipitation altitude experimental year soc content soil ph and references to clarity the effect of climate variability on natural n2o fluxes the potential effects of atmospheric deposition and land management practices were excluded from model simulations the model historical simulation went through an initial 300 year spin up procedure the initial 300 year spin up was driven with multiyear between 1970 and 1990 averaged historical meteorological data to achieve a relative equilibrium state in the carbon pools before analysis to reach soil carbon equilibrium the model has an internal speed up process during the soil spin up period the vegetation distribution remained unchanged during the period of 1970 2017 the qinghai tibetan temperature is anticipated to increase by 1 5 c and models project an increase in precipitation of approximately 10 by 2050 chen et al 2013 which was used as a warmmer and wetter future scenario in this study on this basis we increased the temperature data of 2010s by 1 5 c and the precipitation data by 10 as the future scenario of 2050 to predict the variations of n2o fluxes these data served as the meteorological input data for the future scenario simulation future co2 concentration data was change over the time of model simulation while the other driven data remained unchanged 2 4 statistical analysis five statistics were used to evaluate model performance relative root mean square error rrmse model efficiency nash sutcliffe

the number of data points and x is the mean of the measured data zonal statistics were conducted for 11 regions based on the framework of china s geo ecological regional system proposed by zheng 1996 this division considers the variation characteristics of precipitation and temperature at the same time the qinghai tibetan plateau was divided into 11 natural regions fig s1 including three temperature zones and four arid humid regions the guoluo nagqu alpine shrub meadow zone h1b1 the south qinghai alpine steppe zone h1c1 the qutang alpine steppe zone h1c2 the kunlun mountains alpine desert zone h1d1 the west sichuan alpine coniferous forest h2ab1 the east tibet qilian alpine coniferous steppe h2c1 the south tibet alpine shrub steppe zone h2c2 the qaidam basin desert zone h2d1 the kunlun mountains north desert zone h2d2 the nagri mountain desert zone h2d3 and the subtropical broadleaf evergreen forest region h3 analysis of variance was used to assess differences in n2o emissions among different regions or periods followed by multiple comparisons using the lsd least significant difference method all analyses were performed using r version 3 6 2 r 2019 the threshold for statistical significance was p 0 05 for all statistical analyses 3 results 3 1 model validation fig 1 shows the simulated means of annual n2o emissions versus the measured means of annual n2o emissions for all sites in the study area during validation simulated and measured n2o emissions are close to the 1 1 line over a wide range of annual n2o emission rates between 0 47 and 19 0 µg n m 2 h 1 and the annual observed and simulated n2o emission data are highly correlated r2 0 83 p 0 01 the ef d and pbias are 0 733 0 894 and 7 18 respectively table 2 indicating good performance for estimating n2o fluxes however the model has an rrmse value of 44 6 indicating poor agreement with the observed n2o flux data table 2 the high rrmse value likely stems from the fact that the model greatly underestimates the n2o flux values of some sites with higher annual n2o emission rates for example the simulated annual n2o flux of the site located in the zoige meadow 11 36 µg n m 2 h 1 is approximately half of the measured value 19 0 µg n m 2 h 1 considering model performance evaluation indicators we conclude that the performance of the model for simulating annual n2o fluxes is moderate which indicates that the triplex ghg model could be used to model the annual n2o emissions on the qinghai tibetan plateau 3 2 historical spatiotemporal patterns of estimated natural n2o emissions in the qinghai tibetan plateau from 1970 to 2017 the estimated total n2o emissions on the qinghai tibetan plateau is 0 313 0 005 tg n yr 1 ranging from 0 305 tg n yr 1 the lowest value occurs in 1983 to 0 325 tg n yr 1 the highest value occurs in 2006 fig 2 a the estimated natural n2o emissions show slight increasing trends with a mean increase of 0 202 gg n yr 1 over the study period fig 2a however there is a significant decrease in the estimated total n2o emissions on the qinghai tibetan plateau during the 1990s 0 7 gg n yr 1 especially during the 2nd half of the 1990s the largest growth rate of the modelled n2o emissions per decade is observed in the 2000s with an increase of 0 37 gg n yr 1 and the largest increase of the modelled n2o emissions occur between 1988 and 1989 10 80 gg n the order of the contribution percentage of each region to total n2o emissions on the qinghai tibetan plateau in the 2010s is as follows h1c2 18 39 h2ab1 16 34 h1b1 11 57 h2d1 11 41 h2c2 9 89 h1d1 8 55 h2c1 7 86 h1c1 6 75 h2d2 4 60 h2d3 2 77 h3 1 87 fig 2b the estimated n2o fluxes range from 0 to 35 µg n m 2 h 1 fig 2c low n2o flux levels 3 µg n m 2 h 1 are observed for some high altitude areas grid cells distributed along the gangdise and kunlun mountains the estimated total n2o budget of the plateau sub frigid e g h1c2 h1b1 and h1d1 region is high however this is caused by its larger area compared with other regions in the qinghai tibetan plateau fig 2c the estimated n2o fluxes from the plateau sub frigid region i e h1 are significantly lower compared with those from the plateau temperate region and the subtropical broadleaf evergreen forest region i e h2 and h3 respectively fig 3 the estimated n2o fluxes from the arid region i e d 11 39 0 24 µg n m 2 h 1 are significantly lower than those from the humid semi humid region i e a b 11 59 0 26 µg n m 2 h 1 and the semi arid region i e c 11 67 0 20 µg n m 2 h 1 among ecoclimate zones h2c2 has the highest and h1c1 has the lowest estimated n2o fluxes 15 80 0 10 µg n m 2 h 1 and 9 75 0 42 µg n m 2 h 1 respectively compared with other regions fig 3 fig 4 shows the spatial distributions of the estimated natural n2o flux increases the average value during the 2010s minus that during the 1970s on the qinghai tibetan plateau and the temporal patterns from the 1970s to the 2010s of the natural n2o emissions from different regions between the 1970s and 2010s the most of the estimated n2o flux increases occur in the northern and southeastern parts of the qinghai tibetan plateau some areas that have experienced decrease between the 1970s and 2010s are mainly distributed in the southwestern and northeastern regions of the qinghai tibetan plateau e g h1c2 and h2d3 in addition some areas scattered in the southeastern regions of the qinghai tibetan plateau show pronounced decreases in n2o fluxes e g h1b1 and h2ab1 the estimated natural n2o emissions of the h1c1 and h3 regions which are located in the central and southeastern parts of the qinghai tibet plateau are relatively stable from the 1970s to 2010s whereas the estimated n2o emissions in other regions increase fig 4 in particular the estimated n2o emissions of h2d2 increased from 10 05 gg n in the 1970s to 14 51 gg n in the 2010s although the estimated increase in n2o flux for many grid cells is large in h2ab1 the total estimated n2o emissions show a slight downward trend albeit not significantly from the 1990s to 2010s fig 4 overall an increasing trend in the estimated n2o emissions is observed in arid or semiarid regions on the qinghai tibetan plateau during the study period whereas a relatively stable trend is observed in humid or semi humid regions 3 3 effect of climate precipitation and temperature change on the estimated natural n2o fluxes of the qinghai tibetan plateau fig 5 a b shows the relationships of estimated n2o fluxes with temperature and precipitation the response of the estimated n2o fluxes to precipitation and temperature over the qinghai tibetan plateau shows pronounced spatial variability in the southwestern region of the qinghai tibetan plateau mainly in h3 and h2ab1 precipitation accounts for more than 40 of the total variation in n2o fluxes r2 0 4 which is higher than that of temperature r2 0 2 0 4 for some scattered areas located in the nujiang lancangjiang and jinsajiang red river drainage areas in the h2ab1 region precipitation accounts for 80 of the total variation in the estimated n2o fluxes in the northeastern region of the qinghai tibetan plateau mainly h2d1 h2c1 h1c1 and h1d1 the estimated n2o fluxes were more strongly correlated with temperature than with precipitation table s1 the estimated n2o fluxes from most areas 64 in the plateau sub frigid region i e h1 are primarily regulated by temperature compared with the plateau temperate region and the subtropical broadleaf evergreen forest region i e h2 and h3 the estimated n2o fluxes from most areas in the arid or semi arid regions i e c and d are primarily regulated by temperature compared with the humid or semi humid regions i e a b table s1 in addition the estimated n2o fluxes in most areas on the qinghai tibetan plateau are significantly positively related to temperature fig 5c d p 0 05 although the n2o fluxes in most areas on the qinghai tibetan plateau are significantly negative for precipitation most of the relationships between precipitation and n2o fluxes are weak r2 0 2 areas in which n2o fluxes are more sensitive to precipitation are mainly distributed in the western h2c2 region slope 4 µg n m 2 h 1 mm areas in which n2o fluxes are more sensitive to temperature are mainly distributed in h3 h2d3 and h2c2 slope 2 µg n m 2 h 1 mm these findings coupled with the result of the modelled n2o flux spatial patterns fig 2c indicate the greater n2o emissions in h2d1 h1c2 h1b1 and h2d1 likely stem from their strong positive correlation with temperature which is the dominant controlling factor for the estimated n2o emissions in high altitude areas 3 4 n2o emissions under the future scenario of 1 5 c warming and 10 wetting under the future warmer and wetter climate change scenario the estimated n2o emissions across the entire region of the qinghai tibetan plateau are larger than those in the 2010s reaching 0 335 tg n yr 1 fig 6 that is the increase in future estimated n2o emissions in the qinghai tibetan plateau associated exclusively with the warmer and wetter climate i e regardless of the effects of anthropogenic activities atmospheric nitrogen deposition and other factors is approximately 6 13 moreover the increase in estimated n2o emissions differ among subregions h2c1 exhibits the largest relative increase 11 7 and the h2c2 exhibits the smallest relative increase 1 83 indicating that the highest and lowest relative mean n2o flux increases occur in these areas respectively the estimated relative mean n2o flux increases on the qinghai tibetan plateau under future climate change for regions divided by temperature were highest for h1 6 84 followed by h2 5 67 and h3 2 19 the estimated relative mean n2o flux increases on the qinghai tibetan plateau under future climate change for regions divided by precipitation were highest for c 6 88 followed by a b 6 13 and d 5 24 table 3 4 discussion our study demonstrated that the triplex ghg simulated annual n2o fluxes from the qinghai tibetan plateau using triplex ghg showed moderate agreement with the observed data with regard to the amount however overestimated was observed at some sites with low emissions the model could be used to estimate annual n2o fluxes on the qinghai tibetan plateau based on all model performance evaluation indicators some experiments pei et al 2003 kato et al 2011 du et al 2016 hu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 and our simulations have shown that forests steppes and meadows on the plateau are currently weak n2o sources with relatively low n2o fluxes compared with low altitude areas zhang et al 2019 2020 compared with the spatial pattern of n2o fluxes on the qinghai tibetan plateau estimated by the dyn lpj xu ri prentice 2008 model from simulation results of china xu ri et al 2019 the n2o fluxes in this study were within a reasonable range 0 35 µg n m 2 h 1 precipitation and soil moisture have been commonly accepted as important factors controlling n2o production thus changes of precipitation have been sought to explain modelled variations in n2o fluxes in some studies butterbach bahl et al 2000 cai 2012 the study by davidson et al 2009 revealed that n2o emissions with a water filled pore space wfps in the range of 70 80 were most suitable for n2o emissions when the soil wfps increased beyond this range the denitrification process was more complete and the main final product was n2 davidson et al 2009 because upland soils rarely meet or even exceed the optimal moisture conditions for n2o emissions butterbach bahl et al 2013 a strong positive correlation between soil moisture and n2o emissions has been widely observed in field experiments li et al 2020 however a meta analysis revealed a weak negative correlation between mean annual precipitation and background n2o emissions from soils that received no nitrogen n fertilizer and soil management from global pastures kim et al 2013 similarly modeling conducted by du et al 2016 showed that increase in precipitation increases in alpine meadows of 10 and 20 could reduce the annual release of n2o they suggested that nitrification or the reaction of nitrifiers may have a dominant effect on the increase in n2o emissions and its temperature sensitivity and contribute more than 60 to the formation of n2o on the qinghai tibetan plateau du et al 2016 which explain the negative relationship between modelled n2o fluxes and precipitation in this study the modelled n2o fluxes in most areas on the qinghai tibetan plateau were significantly negatively related to precipitation however most of the relationships between n2o fluxes and precipitation were weak such weak negative linear correlations between precipitation and modelled n2o emissions might be related to the reduction of n2o to n2 in the last step of denitrification which in certain cases can result in the consumption of n2o under low oxygen conditions in the triplex ghg model denitrification is considered a chain reaction process norman et al 2008 the relative growth rate of denitrifiers during each step is not only determined by the concentration of mineral n but also depends on the doc concentration chapin iii et al 2011 hence a double substrate based doc and mineral n michaelis menten equation was adopted in the model zhang et al 2017 further reduction of n2o the last step of denitrification can occur when doc concentrations are sufficiently high li 2016 according to the soil carbon dataset that was used for model initialization wei et al 2013 the soil carbon content in most areas on the qinghai tibetan plateau was relatively high which probably provides sufficient conditions for the final step of denitrification and leads to a reduction in n2o emissions in addition the weak negative relationships between precipitation and modelled n2o emissions were probably affected by temperature the results revealed that the modelled n2o fluxes in most areas on the qinghai tibetan plateau were mainly regulated by temperature indicating that temperature appear to be more important than precipitation in regulating spatial patterns of n2o emissions on the qinghai tibetan plateau which is consistent with the result of field studies for example qiu et al 2018 and wang et al 2014 showed that due to the extremely cold environment of the qinghai tibetan plateau temperature is an important factor limiting n2o emissions through its effect on the activity of soil microorganisms however the effect of precipitation on n2o emissions is not pronounced furthermore the result of liu et al 2017 indicated that an increase in temperature would dramatically enhance n mineralization in areas with relatively low temperatures soils in colder mountainous areas have been found to have higher nitrifier activity than soils in warmer coastal plains anderson et al 1971 increases in soil temperature would accelerate the decomposition of soil organic matter activate the respiration of soil microorganisms and promote the formation of an anaerobic soil environment szukics et al 2010 butterbach bahl et al 2013 thus providing sufficient substances for nitrification and denitrification and promoting the release of soil n2o audsley and wikinson 2012 overall the effect of temperature on biological processes alone is an important factor affecting the solubility of oxygen misra et al 1974 oxygen diffusion li 2016 and n2o production and consumption butterbach bahl et al 2013 these findings were considered in the development of our model in the triplex ghg model the effect of frost on the oxygen diffusion rate was used to adjust the oxygen partial pressure which in turn affects the volumetric fraction of anaerobic microorganisms and directly determines the allocation of substrates to denitrification and nitrification zhang et al 2017 furthermore the exponential response functions expressing the effect of soil temperature on the denitrification and nitrification rate the mineralization rate and the gas diffusion rate were incorporated into this model using the q10 method zhang et al 2017 when modeling the denitrification rate the effect of temperature on denitrification were described as an exponential or variation of an arrhenius type response li et al 2000 farquharson and baldock 2007 for example the denitrification rate increases exponentially as the range of soil temperatures 10 35 c increase with an approximate q10 value of 2 and production during denitrification is set to be detectable above 0 c the effect of soil moisture on nitrifier and denitrifier activities is reflected in the form of a piecewise linear function based on li et al 2000 therefore modelled n2o fluxes may become insensitive to or negatively correlated with soil moisture at relatively low soil temperatures if the climate continues to become warmer and wetter as projected by the future scenario in the present study the qinghai tibetan plateau will emit slightly more 6 13 n2o which is much smaller than the emissions from other regions abdalla et al 2009 griffis et al 2017 for example griffis et al 2017 found that in us corn belt one of the most intensive agricultural regions of the world the climate sensitivity of n2o emissions accounts for about 8 to 25 of the long term trend such differences between studies are probably caused by the differences in modeling approaches and future scenarios consistently n2o emissions were observed to be enhanced under the warmer and wetter future model scenarios in kesik et al 2006 they found that n2o emissions only increased when the average annual soil moisture remained unchanged or slightly decreased and mean annual soil temperature increased by more than 2 0 c the main reason for the simulated decrease in n2o emissions stems from a shift in the relative proportions of n2o versus n2 emitted from the soils under future climate conditions kesik et al 2006 in addition there were differences in studies with regard to the temperature sensitivity of n2o emission an average temperature increase of 1 5 c resulted in an increase in annual n2o emissions from irish agriculture by almost 65 abdalla et al 2009 moreover n2o fluxes have increased substantially in all biomes due to global warming with upland crops having the largest increment eckard and cullen 2011 in contrast dndc modeling gave opposite results as our simulation with a reduction in annual n2o emissions for an alpine meadow when soil temperature increased lin et al 2009 hu et al 2010 du et al 2011 du et al 2011 suggests that in the dndc model warming stimulated plant uptake of soil nitrate and soil water leading to reduction of their contents in soil and denitrification rate therefore such differences between studies are likely caused by differences in the modeling scale as well as the model performance of plant uptake of soil minerals sensitivities to soil temperature this study provides the latest estimates of long term natural annual n2o emissions from terrestrial ecosystems on the qinghai tibetan plateau several uncertainties require consideration to improve our estimates first the historical driving force of the model may introduce some uncertainty for example with the support of the dem the anusplin program was used to interpolate original station based meteorological data at a regional scale at a resolution of 10 km however there are fewer meteorological stations in the central and western regions of the qinghai tibetan plateau and data from these regions are necessary to improve the accuracy of our model driving data in the future second this model can describe the basic processes related to n2o production and consumption i e nitrification and denitrification however it still a large degree of uncertainty in estimates n2o emissions because the various simple empirical response functions of environmental factors are at work in the model and do not consider complex and subsidiary processes e g alienated nitrate reduction and anammox processes in addition many of the biogeographic and geochemical processes involved in the response of the ecosystems on the qinghai tibetan plateau to climate change are largely unknown this also creates difficulties in precisely modeling n2o emissions by ecosystem process based models third the qinghai tibetan plateau is a highly human dominated ecosystem that requires spatially explicit time series data on livestock grazing practices for accurately estimating the n2o budget a hierarchical meta analysis revealed that grazing significantly reduces the total biomass soil organic carbon and total nitrogen which would probably greatly influence the production of n2o yan et al 2020 in addition we need to address the uncertainties associated with nitrogen deposition drainage land use change etc deng et al 2019 rousset et al 2020 fourth the cryosphere is mainly distributed at high latitudes in polar regions but it is also widespread on plateaus and in high mountains at middle and low latitudes especially on the qinghai tibetan plateau the ability of models to account for such regions is limited given the difficulty of describing the freeze thaw process as well as snow movement and accumulation which are of great importance in terms of n2o production yang et al 2019 fifth the evaluation in this study was based largely on very limited field measurements the uncertainties inherent in these measurements are difficult to assess there is thus an urgent need to obtain more robust measurements of n2o emission rates on the qinghai tibetan plateau and soil dynamics doltra et al 2015 5 conclusions in sum the triplex ghg model was validated using 14 sites across the qinghai tibetan plateau considering all model performance evaluation indicators the performance of the model for simulating annual n2o fluxes was moderate which demonstrates that it could be used to estimate the spatial and temporal patterns of n2o emissions from the qinghai tibetan plateau the model simulation results indicate that there was a slight increasing trend in total natural n2o emissions on the qinghai tibetan plateau from 1970 to 2017 regions with relatively high temperatures released more n2o which indicates that temperature is a dominant factor affecting n2o emissions in high altitude regions on the qinghai tibetan plateau n2o fluxes were positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with precipitation in most areas however most of the relationships between n2o fluxes and precipitation were weak if the climate continues to become warmer and wetter the natural n2o emissions on the qinghai tibetan plateau will increase by approximately 6 13 these simulation results provide information that could aid the management of alpine ecosystems and the estimation of ghg inventories under climate change on the qinghai tibetan plateau credit authorship contribution statement kerou zhang

24484,herbivorous insects play important roles in agriculture as pests or as weed biological control agents predicting the timing of herbivore insect population development can thus be of paramount importance for agricultural planning and sustainable land management numerical simulation models driven by temperature are often used to predict insect pest population build up in agriculture such simulation models intend to use station derived temperatures to drive the development of the target insect although this temperature may differ substantially from that experienced by the insect on the plant to improve the estimations it has been suggested to replace air temperature in the model by land surface temperature lst data here we use a numerical simulation model of insect population dynamics driven by either air temperature combined with atmospheric temperature soundings or land surface temperature derived from satellites to predict the population trends of the leaf beetle ophraella communa a potential biological control agent of ambrosia artemisiifolia in europe for this we conducted an extensive field experiment that included caged o communa populations at five sites along an altitudinal gradient 125 1250 m a s l in northern italy during 2015 and 2016 we compared our model predictions using air or land surface temperature with observed beetle population build up model predictions with both air and land surface temperatures predicted a similar phenology to observed populations but overestimated the abundance of the observed populations when taking into consideration the error of the two measurement methods the predictions of the model were in overlapping timeframes therefore the current model driven by lst can be used as a proxy for herbivore impact which is a novel tool for weed biocontrol keywords biological control ophraella communa ambrosia artemisiifolia insect population model modis 1 introduction insect herbivores are considered to be fundamental for ecosystem structure and functioning due to their impact on vegetation composition and productivity crawley 1983 the impact is particularly significant in the case of agricultural pests or when applied as biological control agents of weeds insect herbivores can cause vast crop losses in agriculture and insects like the colorado potato beetle leptinotarsa decemlineata say cotton bollworm helicoverpa armigera hübner or fall armyworm spodoptera frugiperda j e smith attract global awareness as serious crop pests liu et al 2012 kriticos et al 2015 kumar et al 2018 classical biological control of invasive plant species refers to the deliberate release of specialist herbivore insects collected in the invasive plant s native range in order to reduce its abundance and or further spread into new geographic areas müller schärer and schaffner 2008 these classical biological control agents are selected on being either monophagous or attacking few closely related plant species this reduces non target impacts on local crops and vegetation müller schärer and schaffner 2008 currently less than 1 of all intentional releases of classical weed biological control agents are estimated to have a potential to lead to negative effects at the population level of nontarget species hinz et al 2019 insects such as the saltcedar leaf beetle diorhabda elongata brullé the mottled water hyacinth weevil neochetina eichhorniae warner or the cochineal dactylopius opuntiae cockerell are examples of successful biological control agents used to manage weeds schwarzländer et al 2018 hoffmann et al 2020 the insect s impact on plant performance usually increases with the density of insect herbivores myers and sarfraz 2017 therefore being able to predict insect herbivore population dynamics can be critical for making sound management decisions harms et al 2020 in agricultural systems pest predictive models are used to adjust timing for management decisions such as the timing of application of insecticides magarey et al 2015 johnson et al 2016 similarly modeling the demography of biological control agents could be used to predict biocontrol impact and inform whether additional management is needed to control a target weed mvandaba et al 2019 augustinus et al 2020a b furthermore predicting climate dependent phenology of potential biological control agents could prevent release of organisms in a novel range if there is a phenological mismatch harms et al 2020 demographic models of insects are in general driven by temperature measurements for local predictions of population dynamics or interpolated datasets of air temperature to make predictions for larger areas damos and savopoulou soultani 2012 a challenge with air temperatures however is to obtain reliable high quality spatially continuous data air temperatures are generally provided by local weather stations which can be located at long distance from another making interpolated estimations inaccurate an alternative to the utilization of interpolated air temperature estimates for modeling ecological phenomena is the use of satellite information and products lensky and dayan 2011 blum et al 2013 lensky et al 2018 land surface temperatures lst derived from satellite measurements may be used to drive insect population models providing spatially continuous assessments of population dynamics blum et al 2015 2018 these data are easily available globally and free of charge with high spatial resolution shiff et al 2021 in general differences between surface lst and air i e measured at 2 m above the surface temperatures are related to vegetation cover and atmospheric circulation lensky et al 2018 the difference between the two measures is usually larger at day time lst daily mean temperature is expected to record higher temperatures than the observed air temperature when local temperature differences can be estimated they can be used to adapt the satellite derived lst as

lst derived temperature vs on site collected temperature as drivers of the beetle s population dynamics models 2 material and methods 2 1 study species ambrosia artemisiifolia is a north american annual weed that has invaded ranges on all continents except antarctica in europe it is considered a noxious weed since the 1920s csontos et al 2010 besides being a costly weed in spring sown crops a artemisiifolia has attracted particular attention because of its highly allergenic pollen resulting in high medical costs and decrease in human well being in the sensitized population mouttet et al 2018 müller schärer et al 2018 schaffner et al 2020 the leaf beetle o communa which is native to north america was accidentally introduced in china in 2001 meng and li 2005 where it is now used as a biological control agent of a artemisiifolia zhou et al 2017 in europe the leaf beetle was found for the first time in 2013 in northern italy and southern switzerland müller schärer et al 2014 and it has expanded its range to the balkan region augustinus et al 2015 lommen et al 2017 zadravec et al 2019 horváth and lukátsi 2020 while the use of o communa as a biological control agent was initially ruled out because it can conclude its life cycle on sunflower no non target attacks have been reported in its native and imported range on sunflowers zhou et al 2011 or native european plants augustinus et al 2020c ophraella communa overwinters at the adult stage and can complete up to seven generations per season depending on temperature zhou et al 2010 in europe eggs are laid in batches as soon as the adults encounter seedlings of the annual host plant in spring egg deposition continues until mid august augustinus et al 2020a with cessation of oviposition probably cued by a shorter photoperiod and decreasing temperature as has been shown for o communa populations in china zhu et al 2012 all larval stages and adults feed on the green parts of the host plant in europe the majority of leaf damage is observed in late august when o communa abundance peaks augustinus et al 2020a since the first observations of high population densities of o communa in northern italy aerial ragweed pollen concentrations have decreased by 80 which cannot be explained by changes in climate or land use bonini et al 2015a b while ecological suitability analyses combined with temperature and humidity driven vital rates suggest that o communa can reach population densities as observed in northern italy also in other parts of europe augustinus et al 2020b no demographic model that may help predicting population densities of this beetle in a given year or region has been published so far 2 2 field experiment in the summer of 2015 and 2016 we conducted field cage experiments to assess the temperature and relative humidity rh dependent developmental rate of o communa on a artemisiifolia the experiments were conducted at five sun exposed sites in northern italy with similar inclines 20 50 km from milan lombardy fig 1 appendix a in order to create a climatic gradient we selected the sites along an altitudinal gradient from 125 to 1250 m a s l magenta mag at 125 m communita montana cm at 250 m fogliaro fog at 550 m eremo ere at 770 m and piani d erna pde2 at 1250 m the experiments were conducted within 1 2 1 m l x w x h cages consisting of aluminum frames and a zipper equipped gauze diatex sa france ambrosia artemisiifolia plants were grown in 2014 and 2015 from seeds collected in busto arsizio lombardy in the previous season all plants were grown in the greenhouse of parco monte barro centro flora autoctona in galbiate 359 m a s l seedlings were transferred from seed trays to 9 cm square pots filled with standard garden soil and transferred to the soil within the field experimental cages when they had 12 15 leaves we planted 12 plants per cage in early july 2015 and 2016 we released 20 freshly hatched o communa adults 10 10 per cage two cages per site the beetles were individually marked with nail polish dots on the elytra color coded for sex and patterns for individuals in each site we set up two experimental cages replicates that were monitored for two years once a week we visited all the experimental cages and counted fertile eggs excluding black desiccated or hatched eggs pupae and marked initially released and unmarked offspring adults 2 3 temperature data we downloaded the 1 km land surface temperature lst product myd11a1 from nasa s modis via google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 the lst product was downloaded for day and night 1 30am pm when temperature data were missing due to cloud cover we estimated the missing values by taking the average temperature of the past 18 years for the given julian date lensky and dayan 2011 lst was downloaded for all pixels where experimental cages were located except for three sites in the experimental site of communita montana cm at 245 m a s l which included a nearby water body we used an adjacent pixel instead to prevent overestimations of lst at night and underestimation at day since water bodies are known to alter lst measurements gunawardena et al 2017 the sites fog 550 m a s l and ere 770 m a s l were on the lower and upper edge of the same pixel fig 1c since these sites are likely to experience different temperatures from each other we downloaded the temperature measurements of adjacent pixels with the same altitudes and inclines as the sites and averaged the temperature values of the pixel with the experimental site with the temperatures of the adjacent pixels temperature measurement error per day and site was taken from the product lst error flag daily average air temperature for all the different experimental sites was obtained from two weather stations which were 10 km away from the experimental sites arconate smr and galbiate dw6022 we used a temperature measurement error of 0 4 c we then downloaded the atmospheric temperature sounding for the corresponding dates of 1608 liml weather station in linate to adjust for temperature differences along the altitudinal gradient per day in cage local temperature measurements were also obtained with data loggers elv tfd128 but were disregarded since they showed a high variability due to improper shielding from solar radiation 2 4 numerical simulation model of insect pest population dynamics we used the stage structured continuous time age population model driven by temperature described in blum et al 2018 to simulate the population dynamics of the leaf beetle o communa this insect population model is based on a population density function described by a series of differential equations 1 d n i t dt k del n i 1 t n i t μ i t n i t where each life stage i e egg larva pupa pre oviposition and adults is composed by k age cohorts i 1 2 3 k and calculated by a differential equation in a sequential order μi t in eq 1 is the cohort i attrition at time t del is the average developmental time per life stage and ni t is the cohort i population density time and age are measured in degree days dd 0 5 tmax tmin tcritical which is calculated using the rectangular method arnold 1959 the equation is solved in the model numerically using the euler method the population flux ri t from one age cohort to another is described as 2 r i t k n i t del thus eqn 1 becomes 3 d r i t d t k d e l r i 1 t 1 μ i t d e l k r i t in order to calculate the critical temperature tcritical and the developmental time of each life stage del the model assumes a linear relationship between developmental rate and temperature 4 r t b t a where b is the slope and a is the intercept of such relationship then the critical temperature tcritical and the stage developmental time del are calculated from eqs 5 6 damos and savopoulou sultani 2012 5 t crit ical b a 6 d e l 1 b the observed variance var of the physiological time in day degrees dd derived from experimental settings is used to calculate the number of age cohorts k within each life stage vansickle 1977 7 k de l 2 var mortality and egg production rates were calculated as a function of temperature following data from zhou et al 2010 pre and post oviposition adult mortality rates were assumed to be independent of temperature tcritical del k and μ used in the model are provided in appendix 1 2 5 analysis to compare and validate model output driven by the two different sources of temperatures lst and met with the experimental data we calculated the mean square of the prediction error mspe per life stage site and year m s p e σ p o 2 eqn 8 where p is the number predicted by the model and o is the number observed in the experiment at the same date we then divided this value by the average of the mspe for the lst and the met model to obtain the relative mean square prediction error rmspe weather data were adapted for analysis in r using the packages readxl wickham and bryan 2016 reshape 2 wickham 2007 and plyr wickham and wickham 2016 for data transformation and inference graphical representation of data was conducted in ggplot2 wickham 2009 ggmap kahle and wickham 2013 and gridextra auguie et al 2017 the insect population model was run in idl interactive data language harris geospatial solutions 3 results the model simulations estimated shorter developmental time both using lst data and air temperatures derived from meteorological stations when considering the errors of both temperature measurement methods the developmental time ranges overlapped in all but one case indicating that the developmental time estimates were similar fig 2 models driven with either air temperatures or lst produced a bi modal pattern of egg numbers fig 3 the second peak of forecasted egg population coincides with the emergence of the f1 adults produced by adults at the start of the experimental populations though noted in the observed data the bi modal pattern was much more pronounced in model predictions with the second simulated egg crest being higher than the first simulated crest see e g model predictions for the four lowest sites in fig 2a the model simulations estimated higher population abundances than observed in the experiments the estimates using lst data predicted higher populations than the simulation using air temperatures derived from meteorological stations fig 3 predicted population increase was much higher than observations across life stages sites and years except for the predicted number of eggs at piani d erna pde at 1250 m a s l in 2016 when using air temperature as a driver of the model fig 3 abundance increased earlier in the lst driven model particularly for the pupal stage but also for other life stages fig 3 as a result the mspe was almost always lower for the model driven by the air temperature table 1 4 discussion the model simulation was able to closely approximate the phenology of o communa both when driven with lst and air temperatures however the models generally overpredicted the number of beetles below we discuss these results from a technical biological and practical perspective 4 1 technical perspective predictions of the model driven by lst resulted in a shorter developmental time and in higher population densities compared to the model driven by air temperature i e from meteorological stations and interpolations this is not surprising since lst estimates are in general higher than the air temperature measurements especially during the daytime trigo et al 2008 and lst were not corrected for these deviations see for example blum et al 2015 the higher lst therefore might have resulted in a faster accumulation of dd and a shorter developmental time of the beetles the earlier the adults emerge and start laying eggs the longer they can keep producing offspring before the photoperiod induced cessation of egg deposition for example in the eremo site 770 m a second increase in the number of eggs is forecasted earlier in the model driven by lst which results in a second increase in the pupae and adult populations second offspring generation in mid august of 2015 which was not observed in the model driven by air temperatures in this case phenology is out of phase and more generations than actually observed can be predicted a correction of the lst would probably improve the model fit to the validation data but requires local knowledge for further upscaling on a larger geographic area in earlier work on predicting biocontrol agent impact in its potential range the focus of predicting density dependent impact on the target plant was by using phenology as an indicator for herbivore population densities for instance mouttet et al 2018 and schaffner et al 2020 predicted that a decrease of 80 of aerial pollen of a artemisiifolia was depending of o communa reaching at least 3 generations before the onset of flowering hence similar impact in europe was estimated to be as large only in locations where o communa could conclude at least 3 generations per year both air temperature and lst driven models overpredicted population densities while phenology was described rather well therefore lst driven models could be used in the same way as models driven by data derived from meteorological stations and interpolations as in mouttet et al 2018 and schaffner et al 2020 4 2 biological perspective the model predictions at the coldest site which is most likely at the edge of the climatic niche of o communa better approximated the observed trends of the beetle populations the data used to parametrize the model appendix a were obtained from studies conducted in constant temperature laboratory experiments zhou et al 2010 see appendix 2 our observations on the other hand were collected under ambient temperature conditions in an open field experiment this might have affected the ability of the model to properly simulate beetle development and growth because of beetle behavior and general patterns in developmental times of insect populations at lower temperature thresholds eigenbrode et al 2015 showed that insects in field environments can use basking behavior to increase body temperature and therefore metabolisms compared to the air temperature since the data used to parametrize our model were collected in incubators our model does not consider this mechanism this implies that model predictions in a colder environment should be closer to observations from a varying temperature environment which is the case in the predictions of our model the overpredictions of the model could also be explained by the general trends of insect population developments at the edge of their physiological range when comparing developmental rates of 29 species of terrestrial insects paaijmans et al 2013 found that temperature fluctuation around low mean temperatures increased fitness while fluctuation around high mean temperatures decreased fitness compared to the use of parameters derived under constant high temperature conditions temperature fluctuations around high temperatures result in the need of energy expenditure on production and breakdown of heat shock proteins thus decreasing insect fitness chen et al 2018 2019 an additional factor affecting forecasting may have been related to the fact that we have not considered humidity related parameters in the model we did not consider mortality related to relative humidity in this model which could have affected model predictions over predicting abundance since temperature and relative humidity are intercorrelated by nature relative humidity at high temperatures will be lower if absolute humidity stays the same low relative humidity has been shown to have a negative effect on population growth of several insect species simelane 2007 lu and wu 2011 augustinus sun et al 2020 and it is expected that insects will encounter lower relative humidity levels at the upper edge of their thermal range 4 3 practical perspective the inclusion of density dependent factors or humidity driven mortality could help improve the model forecasting abilities however estimating insect abundance for single species over a larger area in absolute numbers is a very challenging endeavor for example in pest monitoring most integrated pest management procedures use pest traps to estimate optimal timing but normally they use an experience based threshold and not a trap based estimation of absolute abundance of pest insects adams et al 2017 these kinds of datasets are not available for o communa populations partially because studies of overwinter survival and therefore estimates for population densities have focused on physiological or evolutionary changes zhou et al 2013 tanaka and murata 2016 or host plant utilization watanabe and hirai 2004 but have not given any estimates for overwinter survival furthermore studies on impact of o communa on individual a artemisiifolia plants and populations which included measurements of o communa abundance did not show clear correlation between beetle abundance and level of damage to the plant in field experiments augustinus et al 2020a lommen et al 2018 without dependable methods to estimate o communa density in the field and without a clear measurement of per capita impact on a artemisiifolia in a heterogeneous environment we do not think including density dependence or humidity driven mortality would make the model any more accurate while phenology has been identified as a predictor for impact mouttet et al 2018 augustinus et al 2020b schaffner et al 2020 therefore the presented model can still be used to compare potential o communa population build up in suitable ranges in europe to its current range in northern italy where the beetle is present the aerial pollen concentrations have decreased by 80 bonini et al 2015a b this strong decrease is explained by the timing of the 3rd generation of o communa the exponential increase of o communa results in high impact on male flower maturation and pollen release augustinus et al 2020b mouttet et al 2018 schaffner et al 2020 while o communa phenology is highly influenced by temperature a artemisiifolia flowering onset is influenced by photoperiod leiblein wild and tackenberg 2014 a model for the plant based on photoperiod combined with this model to refine predictions on where in europe o communa will be able to conclude its 3rd generation before the plant starts flowering would be useful to predict impact both in the long term and in real time therefore this numerical simulation model can be used as a novel method to predict the impact of o communa on a artemisiifolia in europe both driven with lst and air temperature driven models and

24484,herbivorous insects play important roles in agriculture as pests or as weed biological control agents predicting the timing of herbivore insect population development can thus be of paramount importance for agricultural planning and sustainable land management numerical simulation models driven by temperature are often used to predict insect pest population build up in agriculture such simulation models intend to use station derived temperatures to drive the development of the target insect although this temperature may differ substantially from that experienced by the insect on the plant to improve the estimations it has been suggested to replace air temperature in the model by land surface temperature lst data here we use a numerical simulation model of insect population dynamics driven by either air temperature combined with atmospheric temperature soundings or land surface temperature derived from satellites to predict the population trends of the leaf beetle ophraella communa a potential biological control agent of ambrosia artemisiifolia in europe for this we conducted an extensive field experiment that included caged o communa populations at five sites along an altitudinal gradient 125 1250 m a s l in northern italy during 2015 and 2016 we compared our model predictions using air or land surface temperature with observed beetle population build up model predictions with both air and land surface temperatures predicted a similar phenology to observed populations but overestimated the abundance of the observed populations when taking into consideration the error of the two measurement methods the predictions of the model were in overlapping timeframes therefore the current model driven by lst can be used as a proxy for herbivore impact which is a novel tool for weed biocontrol keywords biological control ophraella communa ambrosia artemisiifolia insect population model modis 1 introduction insect herbivores are considered to be fundamental for ecosystem structure and functioning due to their impact on vegetation composition and productivity crawley 1983 the impact is particularly significant in the case of agricultural pests or when applied as biological control agents of weeds insect herbivores can cause vast crop losses in agriculture and insects like the colorado potato beetle leptinotarsa decemlineata say cotton bollworm helicoverpa armigera hübner or fall armyworm spodoptera frugiperda j e smith attract global awareness as serious crop pests liu et al 2012 kriticos et al 2015 kumar et al 2018 classical biological control of invasive plant species refers to the deliberate release of specialist herbivore insects collected in the invasive plant s native range in order to reduce its abundance and or further spread into new geographic areas müller schärer and schaffner 2008 these classical biological control agents are selected on being either monophagous or attacking few closely related plant species this reduces non target impacts on local crops and vegetation müller schärer and schaffner 2008 currently less than 1 of all intentional releases of classical weed biological control agents are estimated to have a potential to lead to negative effects at the population level of nontarget species hinz et al 2019 insects such as the saltcedar leaf beetle diorhabda elongata brullé the mottled water hyacinth weevil neochetina eichhorniae warner or the cochineal dactylopius opuntiae cockerell are examples of successful biological control agents used to manage weeds schwarzländer et al 2018 hoffmann et al 2020 the insect s impact on plant performance usually increases with the density of insect herbivores myers and sarfraz 2017 therefore being able to predict insect herbivore population dynamics can be critical for making sound management decisions harms et al 2020 in agricultural systems pest predictive models are used to adjust timing for management decisions such as the timing of application of insecticides magarey et al 2015 johnson et al 2016 similarly modeling the demography of biological control agents could be used to predict biocontrol impact and inform whether additional management is needed to control a target weed mvandaba et al 2019 augustinus et al 2020a b furthermore predicting climate dependent phenology of potential biological control agents could prevent release of organisms in a novel range if there is a phenological mismatch harms et al 2020 demographic models of insects are in general driven by temperature measurements for local predictions of population dynamics or interpolated datasets of air temperature to make predictions for larger areas damos and savopoulou soultani 2012 a challenge with air temperatures however is to obtain reliable high quality spatially continuous data air temperatures are generally provided by local weather stations which can be located at long distance from another making interpolated estimations inaccurate an alternative to the utilization of interpolated air temperature estimates for modeling ecological phenomena is the use of satellite information and products lensky and dayan 2011 blum et al 2013 lensky et al 2018 land surface temperatures lst derived from satellite measurements may be used to drive insect population models providing spatially continuous assessments of population dynamics blum et al 2015 2018 these data are easily available globally and free of charge with high spatial resolution shiff et al 2021 in general differences between surface lst and air i e measured at 2 m above the surface temperatures are related to vegetation cover and atmospheric circulation lensky et al 2018 the difference between the two measures is usually larger at day time lst daily mean temperature is expected to record higher temperatures than the observed air temperature when local temperature differences can be estimated they can be used to adapt the satellite derived lst as inputs in the model resulting in more accurate model predictions for insect herbivore dynamics blum et al 2015 suggitt et al 2011 recent agricultural and ecological studies used thermal infrared or

corresponding dates of 1608 liml weather station in linate to adjust for temperature differences along the altitudinal gradient per day in cage local temperature measurements were also obtained with data loggers elv tfd128 but were disregarded since they showed a high variability due to improper shielding from solar radiation 2 4 numerical simulation model of insect pest population dynamics we used the stage structured continuous time age population model driven by temperature described in blum et al 2018 to simulate the population dynamics of the leaf beetle o communa this insect population model is based on a population density function described by a series of differential equations 1 d n i t dt k del n i 1 t n i t μ i t n i t where each life stage i e egg larva pupa pre oviposition and adults is composed by k age cohorts i 1 2 3 k and calculated by a differential equation in a sequential order μi t in eq 1 is the cohort i attrition at time t del is the average developmental time per life stage and ni t is the cohort i population density time and age are measured in degree days dd 0 5 tmax tmin tcritical which is calculated using the rectangular method arnold 1959 the equation is solved in the model numerically using the euler method the population flux ri t from one age cohort to another is described as 2 r i t k n i t del thus eqn 1 becomes 3 d r i t d t k d e l r i 1 t 1 μ i t d e l k r i t in order to calculate the critical temperature tcritical and the developmental time of each life stage del the model assumes a linear relationship between developmental rate and temperature 4 r t b t a where b is the slope and a is the intercept of such relationship then the critical temperature tcritical and the stage developmental time del are calculated from eqs 5 6 damos and savopoulou sultani 2012 5 t crit ical b a 6 d e l 1 b the observed variance var of the physiological time in day degrees dd derived from experimental settings is used

et al 2010 pre and post oviposition adult mortality rates were assumed to be independent of temperature tcritical del k and μ used in the model are provided in appendix 1 2 5 analysis to compare and validate model output driven by the two different sources of temperatures lst and met with the experimental data we calculated the mean square of the prediction error mspe per life stage site and year m s p e σ p o 2 eqn 8 where p is the number predicted by the model and o is the number observed in the experiment at the same date we then divided this value by the average of the mspe for the lst and the met model to obtain the relative mean square prediction error rmspe weather data were adapted for analysis in r using the packages readxl wickham and bryan 2016 reshape 2 wickham 2007 and plyr wickham and wickham 2016 for data transformation and inference graphical representation of data was conducted in ggplot2 wickham 2009 ggmap kahle and wickham 2013 and gridextra auguie et al 2017 the insect population model was run in idl interactive data language harris geospatial solutions 3 results the model simulations estimated shorter developmental time both using lst data and air temperatures derived from meteorological stations when considering the errors of both temperature measurement methods the developmental time ranges overlapped in all but one case indicating that the developmental time estimates were similar fig 2 models driven with either air temperatures or lst produced a bi modal pattern of egg numbers fig 3 the second peak of forecasted egg population coincides with the emergence of the f1 adults produced by adults at the start of the experimental populations though noted in the observed data the bi modal pattern was much more pronounced in model predictions with the second simulated egg crest being higher than the first simulated crest see e g model predictions for the four lowest sites in fig 2a the model simulations estimated higher population abundances than observed in the experiments the estimates using lst data predicted higher populations than the simulation using air temperatures derived from meteorological stations fig 3 predicted population increase was much higher than observations across life stages sites and years except for the predicted number of eggs at piani d erna pde at 1250 m a s l in 2016 when using air temperature as a driver of the model fig 3 abundance increased earlier in the lst driven model particularly for the pupal stage but also for other life stages fig 3 as a result the mspe was almost always lower for the model driven by the air temperature table 1 4 discussion the model simulation was able to closely approximate the phenology of o communa both when driven with lst and air temperatures however the models generally overpredicted the number of beetles below we discuss these results from a technical biological and practical perspective 4 1 technical perspective predictions of the model driven by lst resulted in a shorter developmental time and in higher population densities compared to the model driven by air temperature i e from meteorological stations and interpolations this is not surprising since lst estimates are in general higher than the air temperature measurements especially during the daytime trigo et al 2008 and lst were not corrected for these deviations see for example blum et al 2015 the higher lst therefore might have resulted in a faster accumulation of dd and a shorter developmental time of the beetles the earlier the adults emerge and start laying eggs the longer they can keep producing offspring before the photoperiod induced cessation of egg deposition for example in the eremo site 770 m a second increase in the number of eggs is forecasted earlier in the model driven by lst which results in a second increase in the pupae and adult populations second offspring generation in mid august of 2015 which was not observed in the model driven by air temperatures in this case phenology is out of phase and more generations than actually observed can be predicted a correction of the lst would probably improve the model fit to the validation data but requires local knowledge for further upscaling on a larger geographic area in earlier work on predicting biocontrol agent impact in its potential range the focus of predicting density dependent impact on the target plant was by using phenology as an indicator for herbivore population densities for instance mouttet et al 2018 and schaffner et al 2020 predicted that a decrease of 80 of aerial pollen of a artemisiifolia was depending of o communa reaching at least 3 generations before the onset of flowering hence similar impact in europe was estimated to be as large only in locations where o communa could conclude at least 3 generations per year both air temperature and lst driven models overpredicted population densities while phenology was described rather well therefore lst driven models could be used in the same way as models driven by data derived from meteorological stations and interpolations as in mouttet et al 2018 and schaffner et al 2020 4 2 biological perspective the model predictions at the coldest site which is most likely at the edge of the climatic niche of o communa better approximated the observed trends of the beetle populations the data used to parametrize the model appendix a were obtained from studies conducted in constant temperature laboratory experiments zhou et al 2010 see appendix 2 our observations on the other hand were collected under ambient temperature conditions in an open field experiment this might have affected the ability of the model to properly simulate beetle development and growth because of beetle behavior and general patterns in developmental times of insect populations at lower temperature thresholds eigenbrode et al 2015 showed that insects in field environments can use basking behavior to increase body temperature and therefore metabolisms compared to the air temperature since the data used to parametrize our model were collected in incubators our model does not consider this mechanism this implies that model predictions in a colder environment should be closer to observations from a varying temperature environment which is the case in the predictions of our model the overpredictions of the model could also be explained by the general trends of insect population developments at the edge of their physiological range when comparing developmental rates of 29 species of terrestrial insects paaijmans et al 2013 found that temperature fluctuation around low mean temperatures increased fitness while fluctuation around high mean temperatures decreased fitness compared to the use of parameters derived under constant high temperature conditions temperature fluctuations around high temperatures result in the need of energy expenditure on production and breakdown of heat shock proteins thus decreasing insect fitness chen et al 2018 2019 an additional factor affecting forecasting may have been related to the fact that we have not considered humidity related parameters in the model we did not consider mortality related to relative humidity in this model which could have affected model predictions over predicting abundance since temperature and relative humidity are intercorrelated by nature relative humidity at high temperatures will be lower if absolute humidity stays the same low relative humidity has been shown to have a negative effect on population growth of several insect species simelane 2007 lu and wu 2011 augustinus sun et al 2020 and it is expected that insects will encounter lower relative humidity levels at the upper edge of their thermal range 4 3 practical perspective the inclusion of density dependent factors or humidity driven mortality could help improve the model forecasting abilities however estimating insect abundance for single species over a larger area in absolute numbers is a very challenging endeavor for example in pest monitoring most integrated pest management procedures use pest traps to estimate optimal timing but normally they use an experience based threshold and not a trap based estimation of absolute abundance of pest insects adams et al 2017 these kinds of datasets are not available for o communa populations partially because studies of overwinter survival and therefore estimates for population densities have focused on physiological or evolutionary changes zhou et al 2013 tanaka and murata 2016 or host plant utilization watanabe and hirai 2004 but have not given any estimates for overwinter survival furthermore studies on impact of o communa on individual a artemisiifolia plants and populations which included measurements of o communa abundance did not show clear correlation between beetle abundance and level of damage to the plant in field experiments augustinus et al 2020a lommen et al 2018 without dependable methods to estimate o communa density in the field and without a clear measurement of per capita impact on a artemisiifolia in a heterogeneous environment we do not think including density dependence or humidity driven mortality would make the model any more accurate while phenology has been identified as a predictor for impact mouttet et al 2018 augustinus et al 2020b schaffner et al 2020 therefore the presented model can still be used to compare potential o communa population build up in suitable ranges in europe to its current range in northern italy where the beetle is present the aerial pollen concentrations have decreased by 80 bonini et al 2015a b this strong decrease is explained by the timing of the 3rd generation of o communa the exponential increase of o communa results in high impact on male flower maturation and pollen release augustinus et al 2020b mouttet et al 2018 schaffner et al 2020 while o communa phenology is highly influenced by temperature a artemisiifolia flowering onset is influenced by photoperiod leiblein wild and tackenberg 2014 a model for the plant based on photoperiod combined with this model to refine predictions on where in europe o communa will be able to conclude its 3rd generation before the plant starts flowering would be useful to predict impact both in the long term and in real time therefore this numerical simulation model can be used as a novel method to predict the impact of o communa on a artemisiifolia in europe both driven with lst and air temperature driven models and could also be used for different weed biocontrol agents credit author statement benno a augustinus conceptualization investigation writing original draft visualization funding acquisition moshe blum
