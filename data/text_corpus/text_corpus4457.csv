floating platform experiments in still water and in irregular waves without wind are compared to corresponding fast simulations in order to assess the effectiveness of the proposed hil methodology and to highlight the main sources of uncertainty tests are repeated under three wind conditions corresponding to different wind turbine operating points to evaluate the effect of the aerodynamic force field on the overall system response experimental results are compared to the output of fast simulations to investigate its prediction capability with respect to the influence of unsteady aerodynamic loads on the fowt dynamics keywords floating offshore wind turbine wind tunnel testing hardware in the loop testing hybrid testing model validation hydrodynamics 1 introduction floating offshore wind turbines fowts are identified as the key technology to install multi megawatt wind turbines in deep waters where the adoption of traditional bottom fixed solutions is impractical servo aero hydro elastic simulation codes were recently developed to support the design and certification of fowts and experimental data are of great importance for calibration and validation of these tools even if some limitations are present the use of scale models allows to perform tests under closely controlled environmental conditions reducing uncertainties and requiring lower costs with respect to full scale experimentation these limitations are mainly related to the impossibility of perfectly matching all the relevant physics at reduced scale bottasso et al 2014 especially in the case of coupled aerodynamic and hydrodynamic problems that usually require different scaling strategies i e reynolds and froude scaling respectively most of the scale model experiments on fowts performed so far have been following a traditional approach the complete floating system is scaled according to froude similitude and it is tested in an ocean basin with physical generation of wind and waves an example is the first test campaign performed within the deepcwind consortium which aim was to compare the experimentally measured response of a tension leg platform stewart et al goupee koo et al 1115a a spar browning et al 2014 and a semi submersible koo et al 1115b with the output of fast jonkman and buhl simulations a geometrically scaled rotor was used and results were biased by the poor aerodynamic performance of the wind turbine scale model a second experimental campaign was carried out with a performance scaled rotor i e the blade shape was modified to match the performance of the full scale machine goupee et al 1115 kimball et al 1115 but also in that case it resulted difficult to reproduce the expected aerodynamic loads at the low reynolds numbers resulting from froude scaling robertson et al 1115 hardware in the loop hil and software in the loop sil testing techniques were recently proposed for solving the froude reynolds conflict improving the accuracy of scale model tests making simpler the study of global fowt dynamics both in ocean basin as well in wind tunnels in case of hil sil ocean basin tests the scale model wind turbine rotor is replaced by a system able to generate equivalent aerodynamic loads a numerical model of the wind turbine rotor takes as input the measured platform displacements and it is integrated in real time to determine rotor loads that are then applied to the physical model force control motion feedback by means of tendons sauder et al 1115 bachynski et al 1115 a winch system gueydon et al 2018 a ducted fan azcona et al 2014 vittori et al 1115 or multifans battistella et al 1319 a complementary testing technique was recently developed at politecnico di milano polimi bayati et al 2018 bayati et al giberti in order to investigate global fowt dynamics taking advantage of the atmospheric boundary layer abl test section of gvpm galleria del vento polite a wind turbine physical scale model is used to generate proper aerodynamic rotor loads forces measured at tower base are combined to numerically computed hydrodynamic loads and are treated as the input of a numerical model of the floating platform and mooring lines bayati et al 1319 that is integrated in real time the resulting platform rigid body displacements are imposed to the wind turbine model motion control force feedback the polimi hil testing methodology is presented in bayati et al 1115 with particular attention to the measurement of aerodynamic loads and how these are used for real time integration of the platform model in that work the stand alone numerical model of the floating platform was verified against the fast v8 16 model of the deepcwind semi submersible for no wind cases only to identify differences in the platform response due to the approach used for the modeling of platform hydrodynamics the same set of tests was then repeated on a 2 dofs hil setup to assess the robustness of the system to real measurements and non ideal actuation in bayati et al 1319 the 2 dofs platform model at the base of the hil numerical subsystem was extended to 6 dofs and a code to code assessment versus an equivalent fast model was performed discussing the effects of modeling choices imposed by computational constraints the deepcwind 2 dofs hil system is also considered in this work as already mentioned the numerical model at the base of the hil system was assessed against fast v8 16 in bayati et al 1115 the comparison pointed out that the deviations between the two hydrodynamic models introduce negligible differences in the platform response for still air conditions it is then reasonable to ascribe any significative discrepancy between numerical simulations and hil experiments to the hil setup itself and in particular to the adopted measurement and actuation chains in order to identify and quantify their effects on the reproduction of platform dynamics no wind verification tests were repeated extending the test matrix already presented in bayati et al 1115 free decay tests were performed for a larger number of initial conditions and two additional sea states were considered for wave only load cases still air experimental results were systematically compared to the outputs of fast simulations in equivalent environmental conditions once the impact of methodological uncertainties was assessed tests were repeated for three constant wind speeds and the effect of the aerodynamic loads on the fowt global response was evaluated the blade pitch controller has a strong impact of the global motion of the floating platform jonkman larsen and hanson 2007 and its implementation is a complex challenge for floating wind energy in the present test campaign it was however preferred to exclude its action and perform tests fixing the blade pitch angle to limit the complexity of the experiment simulations equivalent to hil tests were run in order to assess the prediction capability of fast aerodyn 14 with respect to the influence of unsteady aerodynamic loads on the floating platform surge and pitch response 2 hil experimental approach the hil experimental approach allows to study global fowt dynamics through wind tunnel tests by dividing the floating system into a physical and a numerical substructures a general scheme of the hil methodology developed at polimi to perform wind tunnel tests is shown in fig 1 the physical substructure is represented by the wind turbine scale model which is designed so as to reproduce realistic rotor related loads and control actions the floating structure response hydrodynamic loads and mooring lines dynamics are simulated by the numerical substructure rotor loads are measured at the model tower base and they represent the input of the numerical model the latter is integrated in real time to compute the wind turbine rigid body motion that is in turn imposed to the scale model by the hil actuation system the complete analytical formulation at the base of the hil methodology can be found in bayati et al 1115 however basic equations are recalled here for the sake of clarity the dynamic response of platform degrees of freedom dofs q is expressed by equation 1 the measured aerodynamic loads f a e r o are combined with numerically computed hydrodynamic loads mooring line forces inertial and gravitational loads for real time integration of the floating system rigid body equations of motion computed platform displacements along surge and pitch dofs represent the set point signals given to the respective hydraulic actuators that move accordingly the wind turbine scale model see fig 2 1 m s a q r s q k s q f h y d r o f a e r o vector q x Î¸ t collects the response of surge and pitch coordinates f h y d r o is the vector of

results of the first test campaign performed with the hil system described above more details about the methodological approach can be found in bayati et al 1115 ambrosini et al belloli 3 physical and numerical models experimental hil tests presented in this paper are about the deepcwind floating wind turbine as defined in phase ii of oc4 project the system is composed of the deepcwind platform and the nrel 5 mw baseline wind turbine jonkman et al scott 3 1 fast model a fast model of the floating system was created to be used as benchmark for no wind hil tests the model reproduces at full scale the 1 50 deepcwind floating platform scale model used at marin for ocean basin experiments robertson et al dagher combined to polimi wind turbine model the fast model was calibrated within oc5 phase ii to match the outputs of experiments for no wind conditions robertson et al 2017 in this way it was possible to ensure that the hydrodynamic loads and rigid body dynamics reproduced by the fast model were consistent with ocean basin measurements 3 2 hil numerical model a second numerical model of the floating system was developed at polimi in mathworks simulink to be used for real time integration during hil tests the model simulates the hydrodynamic loads due to incoming waves mooring lines forces and the rigid body dynamics of the floating system rotor loads and aerodynamic forces are not modeled here since in hil experiments their reproduction is demanded to the physical wind turbine scale model the stand alone version of the hil model i e numerical model with numerical inputs was tuned to match the output of the deepcwind fast model for no wind conditions 3 3 hil physical model as shown in fig 2 the hil setup is composed of two hydraulics actuators that move a scaled wind turbine model along the surge and pitch dofs according to the outputs of the hil numerical model the wind turbine mounted on the hil mechanism is a 1 75 scale model of the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine rwt bak et al nataraja designed and realized by the authors within lifes50 project bayati et al 1049 bayati et al 1088 the dtu 10 mw was designed starting from a direct upscale of the nrel 5 mw with the rotor diameter increased of a factor 2 in order to gather doubled power this means that it is possible to consider to polimi wtm a 2 75 1 53 scale model of the nrel 5 mw the polimi wind turbine model rotor was specifically designed to operate at the low reynolds conditions met during wind tunnel tests bayati et al 2017 through an ad hoc optimization procedure the tower first fore aft mode is at a frequency of 0 36 hz at full scale above the wind and wave excitation range rigid tower multiple instruments were mounted on the wind turbine model used for hil experiments and data about rotor position angular speed instantaneous torque effective platform motion accelerations at multiple tower locations were collected together with tower top and tower base forces measured by dynamometric cells 4 free decay tests the natural frequency and damping of the platform rigid body motion modes were assessed through free decay tests experiments were performed by imposing to a single platform dof either platform surge or platform pitch a perturbation with respect to the static equilibrium position and allowing the system to move freely simulations corresponding to experiments were run in fast experimental and numerical data were then processed with the same procedure for each run only the response of the directly excited platform dof was analyzed disregarding the response induced by coupling on the other platform dof considered to be negligible the natural frequency f n of the selected platform rigid body motion mode was detected from the fft of the platform dof response whereas the linear damping coefficient h for the generic platform dof was derived from the decrease of motion amplitude of the first ten positive peaks in the analyzed decay response 4 1 still air free decay tests in still air were performed imposing different initial conditions to the two platform dofs and repeating the same test with a rotor collective blade pitch angle of 0 and 90 the platform surge and platform pitch free decay response in still air are reported in fig 3 for an imposed initial translation of 5 3 m with respect to the surge static equilibrium position and a rotor collective blade pitch angle of 90 as visible an overall good agreement is obtained between the measured surge response and the target simulation with the fast output slightly more damped than the corresponding experiment a greater difference is seen for the platform pitch response oscillations at the pitch natural frequency are more damped in hil experiments than in the corresponding numerical simulations the platform surge dynamic properties in still air resulting from decay tests performed from different initial conditions are summarized in table 1 the platform surge and platform pitch free decay response in still air are analyzed in fig 4 for an imposed initial platform pitch rotation of 8 with respect to the static equilibrium position and a rotor collective blade pitch angle of 90 the experimental platform pitch response matches the output of the corresponding fast simulation quite well especially in the first cycles some differences are seen for the response of the not directly excited dof platform surge where oscillations at the pitch natural frequency are more damped than in the corresponding simulation the platform pitch dynamic properties in still air are compared to the output of corresponding fast simulations in table 2 as shown in tables 1 and 2 the natural frequency of the surge and pitch modes is correctly predicted by the hil system regardless of the selected initial condition ic and rotor pitch angle more evident differences are instead present in the floating system damping the damping for the platform surge mode is lower in hil tests than in the corresponding fast simulations the slight lack of damping could be attributed to a different reproduction of the aerodynamic drag developed by rotor blades when moved in still air the platform pitch mode damping resulting from hil experiments is higher than in numerical simulations this is partially related to the non negligible dynamics of hydraulic actuators being the platform pitch actuation less prompt moreover errors in the identification of the wind turbine scale model inertial parameters may result in additional unphysical inertial and gravitational loads on the floating system as discussed in bayati et al 1115 ambrosini et al belloli 1 1 for the sake of conciseness these errors are considered as included in measurement chains uncertainties the combination of a non compensated gravitational component in the pitch moment measured at tower base and delays in the measurement and actuation may affect the platform pitch mode linear damping as discussed in 3 differences between experimental and numerical results are more evident for small initial conditions and this could be attributed to non linearities introduced by the hil setup 4 2 laminar wind free decay tests were also performed for three different laminar wind conditions and the corresponding wind turbine operating points any active control logics was used with rotor speed and pitch angle fixed to the values reported in table 3 that were chosen to reach the target steady state thrust force of the nrel 5 mw jonkman et al scott the platform modes were alternatively excited imposing an initial surge displacement of 5 3 m and a pitch rotation of 8 and the effect of the aerodynamic force field on the floating system dynamic properties was assessed from the decay response natural frequency and linear damping of the considered platform modes were extracted from experimental time records with the same approach as for tests in still air experimental results are shown in fig 5 where are also compared to the output of the corresponding tests in still air reported in the figure as no wind simulations equivalent to experimental hil tests were performed in fast v8 evaluating the natural frequency and damping of the platform surge and pitch dof from the resulting decay motions results for the three wind conditions of table 3 and still air are reported in fig 6 the natural frequency of the surge and pitch platform modes affected by the positional component of the aerodynamic force field is almost unchanged by presence of wind small differences are seen in hil experiments for the pitch mode frequency but these are not present in fast simulations the platform modes damping is affected by the aerodynamic force field component proportional to the platform motion rate significative variations are highlighted by hil experiments for both the surge and pitch modes a damping increment is also predicted by fast but this is less evident than in hil experiments the surge damping is almost constant for increasing wind speeds whereas the pitch mode damping has a significative increment only for the above rated wind condition 5 irregular waves tests three irregular wave conditions were considered in order to examine the floating wind turbine response to stochastic hydrodynamic loads the operational wave already part of oc5 phase ii load cases robertson et al 2017 was complemented with fos wave representative of moderate sea conditions oceanographic and meteoro and dnv wave for a mild environment simulation environmental conditions parameters of the jonswap spectrum for the above mentioned wave conditions are resumed in table 4 5 1 methodology for any hil tests a wave elevation time series was generated from the jonswap spectrum for the assigned significant wave height h s and peak period t p and additional energy was introduced in the difference frequency band to model second order wave kinematics memory constraints of the real time controller that run the hil model imposed to compute wave loads from wave elevation time series shorter than the test duration this required to assume wave elevation data periodic for times longer than wave time history referring to fig 7 in a typical hil test wave elevation data are available from time t 3 when acquisition starts before t 3 wind and wave loads are separately applied to the floating system and in between a wait time interval is used to let the system reach steady state conditions in particular at t 0 wind and rotor rotation are applied to the wind turbine and forces measured at tower base start to be integrated by the hil model at t 1 when the aerodynamics is assumed to be at regime wave excitation forces are applied to the platform and at t 2 when the numerical model is again at regime hil actuators are enabled and the wind turbine model is moved according to platform displacements calculated in real time acquisition starts when the system is at regime again in order to compare experimental and numerical results it was necessary to reproduce wave loads in fast consistently with hil tests the fast hydrodyn module allows to use externally generated wave elevation time series from which wave kinematics are derived jonkman et al hayman time series must have a length at least equal to the total simulation time the imported wave elevation time series are assumed to be of first order and long crested when second order terms are required these are calculated from the provided wave elevation data adding extra energy at the difference frequencies frequency range from 0 to 0 05 hz according to the extended stokes theory wave elevation time histories acquired in hil tests before being imported in fast were low pass filtered zeroing harmonic components in the difference frequency range between 0 and 0 05 hz to have first order only wave elevation data in fast aerodynamic forces and wave loads are simultaneously applied to the floating wind turbine and all the model outputs are available from the beginning of the simulation see fig 5 the first part of output time histories corresponding to a pre simulation time t 3 t 2 is discarded and analyses are performed on effective time series of length t e n d t 3 periodicity in the wave elevation time series from hil tests was identified from autocorrelation analysis the fundamental wave time history that was repeated during hil tests was extracted and replicated for the number of periods required to cover the pre simulation time t 3 t 2 and for one period after t e n d to ensure a wave elevation time history longer than the total simulation time the psd of second order waves from hil tests and fast simulations are compared in fig 8 5 2 wave only tests wave only tests were performed to assess the capability of the hil system to reproduce the dynamic response of the floating system due to stochastic hydrodynamic loads the three wave conditions of table 4 were considered to excite the floating system in the frequency range of interest with variable amplitude wave loads low frequency second order wave kinematics were included as well as second order platform forces fast simulations were run reproducing wave loads resulting from hil tests according to the procedure described in 6 the hydraulic actuators used in the experimental setup are featured by a maximum allowed excursion of 250 mm corresponding to 13 25 m at full scale which limits the reproduction of the platform surge when the floater is to a static displacement for this reason only the dynamic component was reproduced discarding the surge static displacement similarly the mean value was subtracted from fast time series of the surge dof response time histories of the experimentally measured surge and pitch response are compared to those resulting from the corresponding fast simulations in fig 9 matching between experimental data and numerical computations is very good even if some differences are present the platform dofs response to dnv and fos waves is dominated by harmonic components at frequencies close to the surge mode whereas in operational conditions the contribution of the pitch mode is the most significative the largest response amplitude is recorded for both the considered dofs in operational conditions being the wave peak closer to platform rigid body modes see fig 8 the minimum motion amplitude is instead reached for the dnv sea state that is characterized by low amplitude waves in the frequency range of platform modes the amplitude of the low frequency response recorded in hil tests is larger than the numerical prediction this could be related to the lack of damping already described analyzing decay tests see fig 3 and table 1 a delay is present in any case between the pitch response recorded in hil tests and the output of fast simulations being wave loads the same for experiments and simulations the response delay can be related only to the hil system measurement and actuation chain the probability density functions pdf estimated from time series of the platform dofs response are shown in fig 10 pdfs are useful to understand the distribution of instantaneous values in the platform dofs response to irregular waves as well as to evaluate the prediction capability of the hil system with respect to peak displacements as visible in fig 10 a good correspondence is obtained between numerical and experimental pdfs for any wave condition the pdfs for the platform pitch dof resulting from the experiments are in good agreement with those obtained from fast simulations for any of the wave conditions considered here a good matching is achieved also in the tails of the pdf meaning that the probability of having large displacements in hil experiments and fast simulations is very close a lower correspondence is obtained between the experimental and numerical pdfs for the platform surge dof in this case the pdf is narrower with larger tails in hil tests than in the corresponding simulations and this is particularly evident for fos waves this behavior can be mainly ascribed to the damping of the platform surge mode that is lower in hil tests than in fast simulations see table 1 the psd of the time series presented in fig 9 are shown in fig 11 in a frequency range up to 0 3 hz the experimental response matches numerical computations for most of the investigated frequencies the most significative discrepancies are found in the low frequency range in correspondence to the platform natural frequencies where the hil response is higher than the target it is worth noticing the pitch response at the pitch mode frequency shows a lower damping in hil tests than in fast simulations contrarily to what was seen in free decay experiments this inverse behavior is caused by the additional damping introduced by the non perfect force correction that is different when the system undergoes a force or free motion being wave loads the same for the experiment and numerical model the mismatch between the hil response and fast predictions could be also related to additional forcing terms not modeled in fast as reported in 3 in fig 12 the 1st order and 2nd order diffraction forces associated with a wave spectrum of significant wave height h s of 1 86 m and peak period t p of 7 2 s dnv waves are compared to the hil residual forces these are responsible of an additional excitation source whose effect is more evident in correspondence of the platform natural frequencies where energy introduced by waves is lower some differences are also shown by the pitch dof in the linear wave excitation range above 0 07 hz where the experimental response is lower than target fast simulations fig 13 shows the platform response to dnv waves the effective surge and pitch motion measured by linear velocity displacement transducers lvdts during hil experiments is compared to the output of the hil real time model hil set point and the platform response computed with fast for equivalent environmental conditions from the psd it can be noticed how the set point given to the hil pitch actuator matches fast calculations better than the effective pitch displacement measured by lvdt the different response in the wave excitation range could be then related to the actuation system dynamics that introduces a non negligible deamplifaction and phase loss in the platform position set point calculated from integration of the platform model it is worth recalling that the observed discrepancies are ascribable to the actuation and measurement chains of the setup since negligible differences are shown by the comparison between the pure numerical model i e the one adopted for real time calculations and fast model see 1 and bayati et al 1115 5 3 wind and waves tests the effect of wind turbine loads on the platform response is investigated for operational waves and the three wind conditions of table 3 as already mentioned the rotor speed and the rotor collective blade pitch angle were fixed to the values of table 3 2 2 the mean percent standard deviation of rotor speed was 0 40 for dnv waves 0 43 for fos waves and 0 65 for operational waves tests operational waves were chosen among the sea states of table 4 for the significative excitation of the platform modes that makes possible to study the effect of the aerodynamic force field on the fowt motion the psd of the surge and pitch dofs response measured in hil tests for operational waves and different wind conditions is shown in fig 14 whereas the output of the corresponding fast simulations is reported in fig 15 the platform motion is analyzed making a distinction between wave frequency range 0 05 0 15 hz where the response is governed by linear wave loads and low frequency range 0 0 05 hz where difference frequency second order wave forces are predominant in the wave frequency range the fowt response is almost unaffected by the presence of wind and there are no significant differences between the three considered wind turbine operating conditions a more marked influence of aerodynamic loads on the fowt response is instead visible in the low frequency range in particular in correspondence of the platform pitch mode the pitch frequency is almost constant for any operating conditions whereas the response amplitude is greatly decreased by the presence of wind this effect is in agreement with the output of free decay tests that shows a large increment of the pitch mode linear damping for increasing wind speeds the irregular wave tests confirm that the aerodynamic loads do not affect the platform natural frequencies but lead to an increase of the associated damping similar findings are reported also in gueydon 2016 where the deepcwind motion in surge pitch and heave to irregular waves including the effect of second order loads was studied for a steady wind of 13 m s the same behavior is observed both in hil experiments and fast simulation results that show similar predicted response amplitude in presence of wind however a larger damping increment is seen in hil tests than in fast simulations when passing from a no wind condition to an operating wind turbine the cross spectrum density csd of the aerodynamic surge force with the surge motion and the csd of the aerodynamic pitch moment and pitch motion are computed from hil data to understand how aerodynamic loads correlates to the platform response in the frequency bands of interest the csd relative to the surge dof is shown in the first row of fig 16 a narrow peak is found at the surge natural frequency where the system is excited in resonance while a broad band peak is seen in correspondence of the linear wave excitation range where the floating platform experiences the largest loads a similar trend is visible in the csd of pitch which is shown in the second row of fig 16 the interaction with wind is the strongest when the motion of the system is large and significantly affects the effective rotor speed the effect of aerodynamic loads is however evident only in correspondence of the floating system natural frequencies where the response amplitude is strongly modified by the aerodynamic damping and negligible in the wave frequency range where hydrodynamic loads are prevailing the csd relative to both the platform dofs is sensitive to the operating condition only in low frequency range the different correlation between loads and platform motion is at the base of the different aerodynamic damping experienced by the system 6 conclusions hybrid hil tests of a semi submersible floating wind turbine were carried out at the polimi wind tunnel no wind tests were performed to extensively compare the fowt behavior as reproduced by the hil system to the one predicted by equivalent fast simulations the main differences are found in the damping of the platform modes and are introduced by the actuation system and the measurement chain then the same tests were carried out in still air and under different wind conditions to discuss how the forces developed by the wind turbine rotor affect the floating system global response it is found that the platform surge and pitch response to irregular waves is different when the turbine is operating or not and the response changes when different operating points are considered the most significant differences are observable in the low frequency range in correspondence of platform modes on account of the damping introduced by the aerodynamic loads the difference in the platform response can be attributed to the loads developed by the wind turbine and this is demonstrated by the csds of 5 3 a variable correlation between loads and platform motion is seen at the platform resonant frequencies for different wind turbine operating conditions and this translates into a variable damping fast analyses were carried out to assess the numerical simulation tool capability of predicting the influence of aerodynamic loads on the floating platform response the same trends seen in experimental tests are captured by fast with more marked differences in the reproduction of the aerodynamic damping introduced by wind turbine loads on the platform pitch mode wind tunnel tests of the current campaign were carried out at constant rotor speed and rotor collective blade pitch angle excluding the wind turbine control system in order to avoid further uncertainties related to the controller settings however recent tests including the action of the wind turbine controller are being carried out to directly investigate how traditional pitch to feather control strategies affects the fowt response fontanella et al 2018a b acknowledgements this project

model of the floating platform was verified against the fast v8 16 model of the deepcwind semi submersible for no wind cases only to identify differences in the platform response due to the approach used for the modeling of platform hydrodynamics the same set of tests was then repeated on a 2 dofs hil setup to assess the robustness of the system to real measurements and non ideal actuation in bayati et al 1319 the 2 dofs platform model at the base of the hil numerical subsystem was extended to 6 dofs and a code to code assessment versus an equivalent fast model was performed discussing the effects of modeling choices imposed by computational constraints the deepcwind 2 dofs hil system is also considered in this work as already mentioned the numerical model at the base of the hil system was assessed against fast v8 16 in bayati et al 1115 the comparison pointed out that the deviations between the two hydrodynamic models introduce negligible differences in the platform response for still air conditions it is then reasonable to ascribe any significative discrepancy between numerical simulations and hil experiments to the hil setup itself and in particular to the adopted measurement and actuation chains in order to identify and quantify their effects on the reproduction of platform dynamics no wind verification tests were repeated extending the test matrix already presented in bayati et al 1115 free decay tests were performed for a larger number of initial conditions and two additional sea states were considered for wave only load cases still air experimental results were systematically compared to the outputs of fast simulations in equivalent environmental conditions once the impact of methodological uncertainties was assessed tests were repeated for three constant wind speeds and the effect of the aerodynamic loads on the fowt global response was evaluated the blade pitch controller has a strong impact of the global motion of the floating platform jonkman larsen and hanson 2007 and its implementation is a complex challenge for floating wind energy in the present test campaign it was however preferred to exclude its action and perform tests fixing the blade pitch angle to limit the complexity of the experiment simulations equivalent to hil tests were run in order to assess the prediction capability of fast aerodyn 14 with respect to the influence of unsteady aerodynamic loads on the floating platform surge and pitch response 2 hil experimental approach the hil experimental approach allows to study global fowt dynamics through wind tunnel tests by dividing the floating system into a physical and a numerical substructures a general scheme of the hil methodology developed at polimi to perform wind tunnel tests is shown in fig 1 the physical substructure is represented by the wind turbine scale model which is designed so as to reproduce realistic rotor related loads and control actions the floating structure response hydrodynamic loads and mooring lines dynamics are simulated by the numerical substructure rotor loads are measured at the model tower base and they represent the input of the numerical model the latter is integrated in real time to compute the wind turbine rigid body motion that is in turn imposed to the scale model by the hil actuation system the complete analytical formulation at the base of the hil methodology can be found in bayati et al 1115 however basic equations are recalled here for the sake of clarity the dynamic response of platform degrees of freedom dofs q is expressed by equation 1 the measured aerodynamic loads f a e r o are combined with numerically computed hydrodynamic loads mooring line forces inertial and gravitational loads for real time integration of the floating system rigid body equations of motion computed platform displacements along surge and pitch dofs represent the set point signals given to the respective hydraulic actuators that move

results of the first test campaign performed with the hil system described above more details about the methodological approach can be found in bayati et al 1115 ambrosini et al belloli 3 physical and numerical models experimental hil tests presented in this paper are about the deepcwind floating wind turbine as defined in phase ii of oc4 project the system is composed of the deepcwind platform and the nrel 5 mw baseline wind turbine jonkman et al scott 3 1 fast model a fast model of the floating system was created to be used as benchmark for no wind hil tests the model reproduces at full scale the 1 50 deepcwind floating platform scale model used at marin for ocean basin experiments robertson et al dagher combined to polimi wind turbine model the fast model was calibrated within oc5 phase ii to match the outputs of experiments for no wind conditions robertson et al 2017 in this way it was possible to ensure that the hydrodynamic loads and rigid body dynamics reproduced by the fast model were consistent with ocean basin measurements 3 2 hil numerical model a second numerical model of the floating system was developed at polimi in mathworks simulink to be used for real time integration during hil tests the model simulates the hydrodynamic loads due to incoming waves mooring lines forces and the rigid body dynamics of the floating system rotor loads and aerodynamic forces are not modeled here since in hil experiments their reproduction is demanded to the physical wind turbine scale model the stand alone version of the hil model i e numerical model with numerical inputs was tuned to match the output of the deepcwind fast model for no wind conditions 3 3 hil physical model as shown in fig 2 the hil setup is composed of two hydraulics actuators that move a scaled wind turbine model along the surge and pitch dofs according to the outputs of the hil numerical model the wind turbine mounted on the hil mechanism is a 1 75 scale model of the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine rwt bak et al nataraja designed and realized by the authors within lifes50 project bayati et al 1049 bayati et al 1088 the dtu 10 mw was designed starting from a direct upscale of the nrel 5 mw with the rotor diameter increased of a factor 2 in order to gather doubled power this means that it is possible to consider to polimi wtm a 2 75 1 53 scale model of the nrel 5 mw the polimi wind turbine model rotor was specifically designed to operate at the low reynolds conditions met during wind tunnel tests bayati et al 2017 through an ad hoc optimization procedure the tower first fore aft mode is at a frequency of 0 36 hz at full scale above the wind and wave excitation range rigid tower multiple instruments were mounted on the wind turbine model used for hil experiments and data about rotor position angular speed instantaneous torque effective platform motion accelerations at multiple tower locations were collected together with tower top and tower base forces measured by dynamometric cells 4 free decay tests the natural frequency and damping of the platform rigid body motion modes were assessed through free decay tests experiments were performed by imposing to a single platform dof either platform surge or platform pitch a perturbation with respect to the static equilibrium position and allowing the system to move freely simulations corresponding to experiments were run in fast experimental and numerical data were then processed with the same procedure for each run only the response of the directly excited platform dof was analyzed disregarding the response induced by coupling on the other platform dof considered to be negligible the natural frequency f n of the selected platform rigid body motion mode was detected from the fft of the platform dof response whereas the linear damping coefficient h for the generic platform dof was derived from the decrease of motion amplitude of the first ten positive peaks in the analyzed decay response 4 1 still air free decay tests in still air were performed imposing different initial conditions to the two platform dofs and repeating the same test with a rotor collective blade pitch angle of 0 and 90 the platform surge and platform pitch free decay response in still air are reported in fig 3 for an imposed initial translation of 5 3 m with respect to the surge static equilibrium position and a rotor collective blade pitch angle of 90 as visible an overall good agreement is obtained between the measured surge response and the target simulation with the fast output slightly more damped than the corresponding experiment a greater difference is seen for the platform pitch response oscillations at the pitch natural frequency are more damped in hil experiments than in the corresponding numerical simulations the platform surge dynamic properties in still air resulting from decay tests performed from different initial conditions are summarized in table 1 the platform surge and platform pitch free decay response in still air are analyzed in fig 4 for an imposed initial platform pitch rotation of 8 with respect to the static equilibrium position and a rotor collective blade pitch angle of 90 the experimental platform pitch response matches the output of the corresponding fast simulation quite well especially in the first cycles some differences are seen for the response of the not directly excited dof platform surge where oscillations at the pitch natural frequency are more damped than in the corresponding simulation the platform pitch dynamic properties in still air are compared to the output of corresponding fast simulations in table 2 as shown in tables 1 and 2 the natural frequency of the surge and pitch modes is correctly predicted by the hil system regardless of the selected initial condition ic and rotor pitch angle more evident differences are instead present in the floating system damping the damping for the platform surge mode is lower in hil tests than in the corresponding fast simulations the slight lack of damping could be attributed to a different reproduction of the aerodynamic drag developed by rotor blades when moved in still air the platform pitch mode damping resulting from hil experiments is higher than in numerical simulations this is partially related to the non negligible dynamics of hydraulic actuators being the platform pitch actuation less prompt moreover errors in the identification of the wind turbine scale model inertial parameters may result in additional unphysical inertial and gravitational loads on the floating system as discussed in bayati et al 1115 ambrosini et al belloli 1 1 for the sake of conciseness these errors are considered as included in measurement chains uncertainties the combination of a non compensated gravitational component in the pitch moment measured at tower base and delays in the measurement and actuation may affect the platform pitch mode linear damping as discussed in 3 differences between experimental and numerical results are more evident for small initial conditions and this could be attributed to non linearities introduced by the hil setup 4 2 laminar wind free decay tests were also performed for three different laminar wind conditions and the corresponding wind turbine operating points any active control logics was used with rotor speed and pitch angle fixed to the values reported in table 3 that were chosen to reach the target steady state thrust force of the nrel 5 mw jonkman et al scott the platform modes were alternatively excited imposing an initial surge displacement of 5 3 m and a pitch rotation of 8 and the effect of the aerodynamic force field on the floating system dynamic properties was assessed from the decay response natural frequency and linear damping of the considered platform modes were extracted from experimental time records with the same approach as for tests in still air experimental results are shown in fig 5 where are also compared to the output of the corresponding tests in still air reported in the figure as no wind simulations equivalent to experimental hil tests were performed in fast v8 evaluating the natural frequency and damping of the platform surge and pitch dof from the resulting decay motions results for the three wind conditions of table 3 and still air are reported in fig 6 the natural frequency of the surge and pitch platform modes affected by the positional component of the aerodynamic force field is almost unchanged by presence of wind small differences are seen in hil experiments for the pitch mode frequency but these are not present in fast simulations the platform modes damping is affected by the aerodynamic force field component proportional to the platform motion rate significative variations are highlighted by hil experiments for both the surge and pitch modes a damping increment is also predicted by fast but this is less evident than in hil experiments the surge damping is almost constant for increasing wind speeds whereas the pitch mode damping has a significative increment only for the above rated wind condition 5 irregular waves tests three irregular wave conditions were considered in order to examine the floating wind turbine response to stochastic hydrodynamic loads the operational wave already part of oc5 phase ii load cases robertson et al 2017 was complemented with fos wave representative of moderate sea conditions oceanographic and meteoro and dnv wave for a mild environment simulation environmental conditions parameters of the jonswap spectrum for the above mentioned wave conditions are resumed in table 4 5 1 methodology for any hil tests a wave elevation time series was generated from the jonswap spectrum for the assigned significant wave height h s and peak period t p and additional energy was introduced in the difference frequency band to model second order wave kinematics memory constraints of the real time controller that run the hil model imposed to compute wave loads from wave elevation time series shorter than the test duration this required to assume wave elevation data periodic for times longer than wave time history referring to fig 7 in a typical hil test wave elevation data are available from time t 3 when acquisition starts before t 3 wind and wave loads are separately applied to the floating system and in between a wait time interval is used to let the system reach steady state conditions in particular at t 0 wind and rotor rotation are applied to the wind turbine and forces measured at tower base start to be integrated by the hil model at t 1 when the aerodynamics is assumed to be at regime wave excitation forces are applied to the platform and at t 2 when the numerical model is again at regime hil actuators are enabled and the wind turbine model is moved according to platform displacements calculated in real time acquisition starts when the system is at regime again in order to compare experimental and numerical results it was necessary to reproduce wave loads in fast consistently with hil tests the fast hydrodyn module allows to use externally generated wave elevation time series from which wave kinematics are derived jonkman et al hayman time series must have a length at least equal to the total simulation time the imported wave elevation time series are assumed to be of first order and long crested when second order terms are required these are calculated from the provided wave elevation data adding extra energy at the difference frequencies frequency range from 0 to 0 05 hz according to the extended stokes theory wave elevation time histories acquired in hil tests before being imported in fast were low pass filtered zeroing harmonic components in the difference frequency range between 0 and 0 05 hz to have first order only wave elevation data in fast aerodynamic forces and wave loads are simultaneously applied to the floating wind turbine and all the model outputs are available from the beginning of the simulation see fig 5 the first part of output time histories corresponding to a pre simulation time t 3 t 2 is discarded and analyses are performed on effective time series of length t e n d t 3 periodicity in the wave elevation time series from hil tests was identified from autocorrelation analysis the fundamental wave time history that was repeated during hil tests was extracted and replicated for the number of periods required to cover the pre simulation time t 3 t 2 and for one period after t e n d to ensure a wave elevation time history longer than the total simulation time the psd of second order waves from hil tests and fast simulations are compared in fig 8 5 2 wave only tests wave only tests were performed to assess the capability of the hil system to reproduce the dynamic response of the floating system due to stochastic hydrodynamic loads the three wave conditions of table 4 were considered to excite the floating system in the frequency range of interest with variable amplitude wave loads low frequency second order wave kinematics were included as well as second order platform forces fast simulations were run reproducing wave loads resulting from hil tests according to the procedure described in 6 the hydraulic actuators used in the experimental setup are featured by a maximum allowed excursion of 250 mm corresponding to 13 25 m at full scale which limits the reproduction of the platform surge when the floater is to a static displacement for this reason only the dynamic component was reproduced discarding the surge static displacement similarly the mean value was subtracted from fast time series of the surge dof response time histories of the experimentally measured surge and pitch response are compared to those resulting from the corresponding fast simulations in fig 9 matching between experimental data and numerical computations is very good even if some differences are present the platform dofs response to dnv and fos waves is dominated by harmonic components at frequencies close to the surge mode whereas in operational conditions the contribution of the pitch mode is the most significative the largest response amplitude is recorded for both the considered dofs in operational conditions being the wave peak closer to platform rigid body modes see fig 8 the minimum motion amplitude is instead reached for the dnv sea state that is characterized by low amplitude waves in the frequency range of platform modes the amplitude of the low frequency response recorded in hil tests is larger than the numerical prediction this could be related to the lack of damping already described analyzing decay tests see fig 3 and table 1 a delay is present in any case between the pitch response recorded in hil tests and the output of fast simulations being wave loads the same for experiments and simulations the response delay can be related only to the hil system measurement and actuation chain the probability density functions pdf estimated from time series of the platform dofs response are shown in fig 10 pdfs are useful to understand the distribution of instantaneous values in the platform dofs response to irregular waves as well as to evaluate the prediction capability of the hil system with respect to peak displacements as visible in fig 10 a good correspondence is obtained between numerical and experimental pdfs for any wave condition the pdfs for the platform pitch dof resulting from the experiments are in good agreement with those obtained from fast simulations for any of the wave conditions considered here a good matching is achieved also in the tails of the pdf meaning that the probability of having large displacements in hil experiments and fast simulations is very close a lower correspondence is obtained between the experimental and numerical pdfs for the platform surge dof in this case the pdf is narrower with larger tails in hil tests than in the corresponding simulations and this is particularly evident for fos waves this behavior can be mainly ascribed to the damping of the platform surge mode that is lower in hil tests than in fast simulations see table 1 the psd of the time series presented in fig 9 are shown in fig 11 in a frequency range up to 0 3 hz the experimental response matches numerical computations for most of the investigated frequencies the most significative discrepancies are found in the low frequency range in correspondence to the platform natural frequencies where the hil response is higher than the target it is worth noticing the pitch response at the pitch mode frequency shows a lower damping in hil tests than in fast simulations contrarily to what was seen in free decay experiments this inverse behavior is caused by the additional damping introduced by the non perfect force correction that is different when the system undergoes a force or free motion being wave loads the same for the experiment and numerical model the mismatch between the hil response and fast predictions could be also related to additional forcing terms not modeled in fast as reported in 3 in fig 12 the 1st order and 2nd order diffraction forces associated with a wave spectrum of significant wave height h s of 1 86 m and peak period t p of 7 2 s dnv waves are compared to the hil residual forces these are responsible of an additional excitation source whose effect is more evident in correspondence of the platform natural frequencies where energy introduced by waves is lower some differences are also shown by the pitch dof in the linear wave excitation range above 0 07 hz where the experimental response is lower than target fast simulations fig 13 shows the platform response to dnv waves the effective surge and pitch motion measured by linear velocity displacement transducers lvdts during hil experiments is compared to the output of the hil real time model hil set point and the platform response computed with fast for equivalent environmental conditions from the psd it can be noticed how the set point given to the hil pitch actuator matches fast calculations better than the effective pitch displacement measured by lvdt the different response in the wave excitation range could be then related to the actuation system dynamics that introduces a non negligible deamplifaction and phase loss in the platform position set point calculated from integration of the platform model it is worth recalling that the observed discrepancies are ascribable to the actuation and measurement chains of the setup since negligible differences are shown by the comparison between the pure numerical model i e the one adopted for real time calculations and fast model see 1 and bayati et al 1115 5 3 wind and waves tests the effect of wind turbine loads on the platform response is investigated for operational waves and the three wind conditions of table 3 as already mentioned the rotor speed and the rotor collective blade pitch angle were fixed to the values of table 3 2 2 the mean percent standard deviation of rotor speed was 0 40 for dnv waves 0 43 for fos waves and 0 65 for operational waves tests operational waves were chosen among the sea states of table 4 for the significative excitation of the platform modes that makes possible to study the effect of the aerodynamic force field on the fowt motion the psd of the surge and pitch dofs response measured in hil tests for operational waves and different wind conditions is shown in fig 14 whereas the output of the corresponding fast simulations is reported in fig 15 the platform motion is analyzed making a distinction between wave frequency range 0 05 0 15 hz where the response is governed by linear wave loads and low frequency range 0 0 05 hz where difference frequency second order wave forces are predominant in the wave frequency range the fowt response is almost unaffected by the presence of wind and there are no significant differences between the three considered wind turbine operating conditions a more marked influence of aerodynamic loads on the fowt response is instead visible in the low frequency range in particular in correspondence of the platform pitch mode the pitch frequency is almost constant for any operating conditions whereas the response amplitude is greatly decreased by the presence of wind this effect is in agreement with the output of free decay tests that shows a large increment of the pitch mode linear damping for increasing wind speeds the irregular wave tests confirm that the aerodynamic loads do not affect the platform natural frequencies but lead to an increase of the associated damping similar findings are reported also in gueydon 2016 where the deepcwind motion in surge pitch and heave to irregular waves including the effect of second order loads was studied for a steady wind of 13 m s the same behavior is observed both in hil experiments and fast simulation results that show similar predicted response amplitude in presence of wind however a larger damping increment is seen in hil tests than in fast simulations when passing from a no wind condition to an operating wind turbine the cross spectrum density csd of the aerodynamic surge force with the surge motion and the csd of the aerodynamic pitch moment and pitch motion are computed from hil data to understand how aerodynamic loads correlates to the platform response in the frequency bands of interest the csd relative to the surge dof is shown in the first row of fig 16 a narrow peak is found at the surge natural frequency where the system is excited in resonance while a broad band peak is seen in correspondence of the linear wave excitation range where the floating platform experiences the largest loads a similar trend is visible in the csd of pitch which is shown in the second row of fig 16 the interaction with wind is the strongest when the motion of the system is large and significantly affects the effective rotor speed the effect of aerodynamic loads is however evident only in correspondence of the floating system natural frequencies where the response amplitude is strongly modified by the aerodynamic damping and negligible in the wave frequency range where hydrodynamic loads are prevailing the csd relative to both the platform dofs is sensitive to the operating condition only in low frequency range the different correlation between loads and platform motion is at the base of the different aerodynamic damping experienced by the system 6 conclusions hybrid hil tests of a semi submersible floating wind turbine were carried out at the polimi wind tunnel no wind tests were performed to extensively compare the fowt behavior as reproduced by the hil system to the one predicted by equivalent fast simulations the main differences are found in the damping of the platform modes and are introduced by the actuation system and the measurement chain then the same tests were carried out in still air and under different wind conditions to discuss how the forces developed by the wind turbine rotor affect the floating system global response it is found that the platform surge and pitch response to irregular waves is different when the turbine is operating or not and the response changes when different operating points are considered the most significant differences are observable in the low frequency range in correspondence of platform modes on account of the damping introduced by the aerodynamic loads the difference in the platform response can be attributed to the loads developed by the wind turbine and this is demonstrated by the csds of 5 3 a variable correlation between loads and platform motion is seen at the platform resonant frequencies for different wind turbine operating conditions and this translates into a variable damping fast analyses were carried out to assess the numerical simulation tool capability of predicting the influence of aerodynamic loads on the floating platform response the same trends seen in experimental tests are captured by fast with more marked differences in the reproduction of the aerodynamic damping introduced by wind turbine loads on the platform pitch mode wind tunnel tests of the current campaign were carried out at constant rotor speed and rotor collective blade pitch angle excluding the wind turbine control system in order to avoid further uncertainties related to the controller settings however recent tests including the action of the wind turbine controller are being carried out to directly investigate how traditional pitch to feather control strategies affects the fowt response fontanella et al 2018a b acknowledgements this project

22286,this paper aims to assess the uncertainty on the extreme responses of a semi submersible wind turbine using two environmental contour approaches the approaches are based on the inverse first order reliability method and the direct monte carlo simulation with different sample sizes the long term sea states are described by a 3 parameters weibull distribution for the significant wave height and a conditional log normal distribution for the zero up crossing period two extreme sea states are extracted from each environmental contour which are associated with the maximum significant wave height and maximum zero upcrossing period a 3 h time domain simulation for each sea state is conducted by adopting a validated numerical model the root mean square for all the response spectra are estimated and compared to each other it is observed that despite the small deviation between the significant wave heights resulting from adopting different environmental contour approaches the deviation between the resulting responses is much more significant the gumbel and the generalized extreme value distributions are fitted to the maximum extreme response values for each sea state and unified fitted parameter are obtained keywords wind turbine semi submersible environmental contour uncertainty extreme response 1 introduction the assessment of the extreme response for a given return period is of crucial importance in the preliminary design stage of any floating structure the traditional full long term analysis flta is the most accurate approach to estimate the long term extreme response as it accounts for all sea states e g guedes soares and moan 1991 the approach consists of integrating the product of the probability of occurrence of each sea state by the cumulative short term probability distribution of the extreme response however this method is considered not efficient due to the large number of simulations needed to be performed for such analysis while a huge percentage from these simulations are not contributing in the extreme response according to this concern videiro and moan 1999 presented a simplified long term analysis and achieved a good accuracy as long as the effective environmental conditions are included in an attempt for a more efficient way to predict the extreme response for a given return period an alternative method called the environmental contour method is based on the inverse first order reliability method iform was developed by winterstein et al 1993 thereafter many studies have been conducted regarding this method e g haver and winterstein 2009 from several decades the first order reliability method form has been widely used to solve the reliability problems related to ships and offshore structures for instance teixeira and guedes soares 2005 assessed the partial safety factor that is used in the probability based design rules for designing the tankers using the form thereafter teixeira and guedes soares 2009 performed a reliability analysis of a tanker subjected to combined sea states adopting form as well and gaspar et al 2016 considered the effect of nonlinear wave induced bending moments on the reliability of tankers moreover among the reliability methods used in ships and offshore structural design summarized and reviewed by guedes soares et al 2010 form was highlighted the idea behind the environmental contour ec method based on the iform is to identify the contour in the normal space of the environmental variables u space and then transform it to the physical space x space by using rosenblatt transformation one of the main advantages of the ec method is the smaller number of extreme sea states for a given return period resulting compared to flta which are independent of the structural response conversely flta depends on performing a full hydrodynamic analysis of the structure to identify the extreme scenarios many recent studies have implemented the ec in the prediction of the long term extreme response of wind turbines as well as of hybrid concepts that combine wind and wave energy devices e g karimirad and moan 2011 karmakar et al 2016 raed et al 2018 and li et al 2019 however saranyasoontorn and manuel 2004 agarwal and manuel 2009 li et al 2013 and li et al 2016 showed that the ec method under predicts the long term extreme response of the wind turbines compared to those obtained by the flta to overcome the aforementioned deficiency li et al 2017 presented a modified environmental contour method that takes into account an active survival strategy in order to reduce the system response in extreme conditions despite the time and results efficiency of the ec method using the iform huseby et al 2013 avoided to use the rosenblatt transformation by generating the environmental contour directly in the physical space by adopting the direct monte carlo simulation mcs in order to perform such a long term response analysis the long term description of the sea state shall be explored many researchers have conducted work related to the joint distribution for different environmental parameters for instance haver 1987 guedes soares et al 1988 mathisen and bitner gregersen 1990 guedes soares and scotto 2001 ferreira and guedes soares 2002 dong et al 2013 and lucas and guedes soares 2015 most of the aforementioned studies concentrated on the significant wave height h s and the zero up crossing period parameters t z and they ended up by using the 3 parameters weibull distribution for h s and the conditional log normal distribution for t z especially in the northern north sea area this study is concerned with a semi submersible wind turbine that is assumed to be operated in the northern north sea area this type of platform is probably the one that has been most studied among the various existing concepts of floating wind turbines uzunoglu et al 2016 coulling et al 2013 conducted experiments on a 1 50th scale model for the deepcwind semi submersible supporting a horizontal axis nrel 5 mw reference wind turbine introduced previously by jonkman et al 2007 in order to validate the numerical model using fast jonkman and buhl 2005 the code fast has been incorporated in a system that allows multiple runs of the code to be performed automatically within an interactive process of designing semisubmersible platforms uzunoglu and guedes soares 2019 following the work of coulling et al 2013 many complimentary studies and benchmarks were conducted adopting different numerical models with different loading conditions e g robertson et al 2014 more details about the time domain analysis and the determination of the coefficients and impulse functions are found in e g ogilive 1964 and journÃ©e and massie 2001 raed and guedes soares 2018 have studied the uncertainty of the prediction of the wave loads in cylinders representative of the columns of semi submersibles this paper studies the uncertainty associated with the prediction of extreme responses for the deepcwind semi submersible by using the inverse first order reliability method and the direct monte carlo simulation approach to estimate the environmental contour for 1 25 and 50 year return periods the later approach is examined using 1 million 1m 3 million 3m and 5 million 5m samples for each return period considered in this study to do so the extreme long term sea state in the northern north sea is described in this study by the marginal 3 parameters weibull distribution for the significant wave height h s and a conditional log normal distribution for the zero up crossing period t z as suggested by the det norske veritas dnv 2010 a total of 24 design points dp are extracted from the environmental contours and are classified into two groups group 1 refers to the extreme sea states corresponding to the maximum significant wave height in the ec while group 2 refers to the extreme sea states corresponding to the maximum zero up crossing period in the ec afterwards hydrodynamic analyses for each extreme sea state are performed using aqwa the root mean square rms for each response power spectrum psd is calculated and compared to each other s in order to identify the effect of using the different environmental contour approaches adopted in this study the numerical model of the deepcwind semi submersible is validated with the results published by coulling et al 2013 thereafter the long term extreme response for the heave surge pitch and cables tension are extracted from each 3 h time domain simulation the maximum response values for each design point are fitted to theoretical gumbel and generalized extreme value gev distributions 2 long term variability of the sea state to estimate the long term probability of occurrence of the sea state it is of vital importance to have a continuous sample of data and to fit it with an appropriate probabilistic model typically the joint distribution model of h s and t z is given by 1 f h s t z h s t z f h s h s f t z h s t z h s the marginal distribution of the significant wave height h s is described by a 3 parameters weibull distribution with cumulative distribution function cdf given by see also dnv 2010 and huseby et al 2013 2 f h s h s 1 exp h s Î³ Î» Î± where Î± is the shape parameter Î» is the scale parameter and É£ is the location parameter on the other hand the conditional distribution of the zero up crossing periods t z is well represented by a log normal distribution which has a cdf in the form 3 f t z h s t z h s Ï ln t z Î¼ Ï where Î¼ and Ï are the parameters of the distribution given by 4 Î¼ t h a 1 a 2 h a 3 5 Ï t h b 1 b 2 e b 3 h the fitted parameters for the 3 parameters weibull and the log normal distributions used in this study are shown in table 1 3 environmental contour the main advantage of the environmental contour is its capability to identify the critical environmental loads independently of the structural response reducing the time needed to predict the long term results compared to the full long term analysis flta method in this research two environmental contour methods are investigated based on 1 the traditional inverse first order reliability method iform and 2 the direct monte carlo simulations mcs 3 1 inverse first order reliability method iform the reliability r of any structure is defined as the probability of the performance function g x being greater than zero so it is expressed by 6 r p g x 0 g x 0 f x 1 x 2 d x 1 p f where f x 1 x 2 is the joint probability density function of the environmental variables considered p f is the probability of failure and g x is the performance function however due to the nonlinearity of g x in most cases it is not easy to solve the integration in eq 6 also the complexity of f x 1 x 2 especially when more than two random variables are taken into consideration makes the integration more difficult to solve the first order reliability method form overcomes these two obstacles by 1 linearizing the performance function by using the first order taylor expansion and 2 simplifying the joint distribution function by transforming the random variables from physical space x space to normal space u space using the rosenblatt transformation rosenblatt 1952 the transformed variables are normally distributed with zero mean Î¼ and unit standard deviation Ï independent and uncorrelated the interest in this study is directed to the inverse first order reliability method iform the approach generates the environmental random variables directly in the u space that are transformed into the x space using the inverse rosenblatt transformation as illustrated in fig 1 in the u space a set Å© forming a circle with a radius equal to the reliability index Î² can be defined fig 1a which is expressed by fig 1a 7 1 p f Ï Î² where p f is the probability of failure Î² is the reliability index and Ñ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function in order to obtain Î² the probability of failure is estimated in this study by 8 p f t s s 365 24 t r where t ss is the sea state duration in hours t r is the return period in years and the 365 24 factor is to convert the number of years to hours afterwards let Å© 0 be a point located on the failure boundary with an arbitrary angle Î¸ Îµ 0o 360 as shown in fig 1 the coordinates of this point which represent the random variables in the u space are given by 9 u 1 Î² cos Î¸ 10 u 2 Î² sin Î¸ in fig 1 a Ï denotes the hyperplane that is tangent to the point Å© 0 Ï is the half space bounded by that line and not containing Å© where p uÏµ Ï is equal to the p f and Ï denotes the other half space that contains the set Å© thereafter the standard normal variables are transformed to the x space giving the intended environmental contour by adopting the inverse rosenblatt transformation as shown in fig 1 b in fig 1 according to rosenblatt transformation the relation between the physical space and the normal space is given by Ï u 1 f h s h s Ï u 2 u 1 f t p h s t p h s where Ñ is the standard normal cumulative probability and h s and t p are the contour points of the marginal significant wave height and conditional peak period respectively accordingly for a given marginal distribution for the variable h s and a conditional distribution for t z the rosenblatt transformation is given by 11 h s f h s 1 Ï u 1 t p h s f t p h s 1 Ï u 2 u 1 where f hs is the cumulative distribution function cdf of the marginal significant wave height f tp hs is the cdf of the conditional peak period u 1 and u 2 are the two random variables in the u space corresponds to the h s and t p respectively among the deficiencies of adopting the rosenblatt transformation is the difficulty to obtain a full characteristic of the transformed set because it is strongly dependent on the joint distribution of the environmental variables also it is not guaranteed to obtain the same probability of failure p f in both space after transformation because the nonlinearity of the transformation itself consequently there is a tendency to over or under prediction in the desired environmental contour 3 2 monte carlo simulation mcs an alternative approach to construct the environmental contour directly in the x space using monte carlo simulation mcs was first introduced by huseby et al 2013 such approach does not need to perform the inverse rosenblatt transformation thus the desired properties of the estimated set u previously described is directly achieved accordingly the errors that arise from using the iform are prevented three different methods to construct the environmental contour using mcs were established by huseby et al 2015 and one of them is adopted in this study generally the idea behind this approach is to explore the set u and use its boundary as the desired contour so the procedure of generating the environmental contour using mcs adopted in this work is summarized as follow according to huseby et al 2015 1 use monte carlo simulation to generate a suitable number of sample points for the joint model adopted in this study a 3 parameter weibull distribution is used for h s and a log normal distribution for t z 12 t 1 h 2 t n h n where t and h are the generated sample points of t z and h s respectively while n is the number of the points 2 for an arbitrary angle Î¸ Îµ 0 360 a unit vector cos Î¸ sin Î¸ that divide the sample points into two half spaces is defined the projection length of each point on the vector is given by 13 y i Î¸ t i cos Î¸ h i sin Î¸ i 1 2 n where Î¸ is the arbitrary angle and y is the projection length of each point on the unit vector 3 afterwards these projections are sorted in ascending order each projection length y Î¸ corresponds to a certain sample point t i h i 4 estimate the number of points in such that 14 p f n k n k n 1 p f where n is the total number of sample points and k is the number of the reliable points 5 afterwards a function called c Î¸ is used to identify the boundary of set u the unbiased estimation of c Î¸ is given by 15 c Î¸ y k Î¸ the estimation of c Î¸ is then used to determine the unbiased estimation of the hyperplane Ð¿ Î¸ and the two half spaces Ð¿ Î¸ and Ð¿ Î¸ 6 those steps excluding step 1 are repeated for a number of chosen angles with a constant interval Î´ forming a number of hyperplanes the intersection points of the half space bounded by those hyperplanes are then connected by straight lines forming the desired environmental contour those intersection points are denoted by t j h j t n h n and they are given by 16 t j sin Î¸ j 1 c Î¸ j sin Î¸ j c Î¸ j 1 sin Î´ 17 h j cos Î¸ j 1 c Î¸ j cos Î¸ j c Î¸ j 1 sin Î´ where Î´ Î¸ j 1 Î¸ and the last t n h n and the first t 1 h 1 intersection points are identical in order to obtain a closed contour the resulting contour is always convex according to the propositions of the method itself for more details about the approach and methods refer to huseby et al 2013 and huseby et al 2015 further some irregularities could be found in the desired contour due to the presence of some hyperplanes which are not supporting Ã» however the sampling error is among the causes that could influence those irregularities 4 hydrodynamic analysis in case of anchoring for example the system becomes no more linear and the frequency domain analysis is no more applicable and hence the time domain is a better choice the system in the time domain has a form of memory function once the extreme sea states are identified time domain simulations are run it is recommended a duration of the simulation of 3 h in order to reach the statistical stability of higher order moments like skewness and kurtosis 4 1 cummins equation cummins 1962 described a classical formulation to be used in the determination of hydro mechanical forces and moments the linear time domain equation of motion cummins equation of the floating support structure in case of zero forward speed is expressed as follows 18 m a x t b x t k x t 0 t r t Ï x Ï d Ï f t where m is mass of the structure a is the fluid added mass matrix at infinite frequency b is the damping

the equation to be as follows 19 m a x t c x t k x t 0 t a t Ï x Ï d Ï f t where the acceleration impulse function a t is given by 20 a t 2 Ï 0 b Ï sin Ï t Ï d Ï 2 Ï 0 a Ï a cos Ï t d Ï 4 2 numerical model the deepcwind semi submersible 5 mw wind turbine fig 2 is considered in this study the system is divided into four main parts 1 the floating platform 2 the tower 3 the tower top part which include the rotor nacelle and the hub and 4 the mooring lines the specifications of the main characteristics of the system are shown in table 2 the mooring configuration and the sign convention adopted in this study are shown in fig 3 which are identical to those used by coulling et al 2013 this is a typical mooring arrangement for renewable energy devices xu et al 2019 as shown in figs 2 and 3 the floating platform consists of three offset columns fixed on three base columns with a larger diameter and one main column in the middle mounted by the wind turbine the columns are connected to each other by bracings forming a truss but for the assessment of the wave induced loads the representation of the bracings is not essential uzunoglu and guedes soares 2015 aqwa ansys inc 2013 is used to perform the hydrodynamic analysis of the deepcwind semi submersible 4 3 validation the numerical model is validated by comparing its results to those already published by coulling et al 2013 the validation process is divided into three steps 1 free decay of the system including mooring lines 2 regular wave in no wind condition and 3 irregular wave in no wind condition the eigen modes of the system are extracted from the free decay simulations and compared to the published results table 3 shows a comparison between the natural periods obtained by the experiments the validation performed by coulling et al 2013 using fast software and the one obtained by aqwa a maximum element size of 2 m is chosen based on convergence analysis fig 4 shows the mesh of the geometry used in the study fig 5 shows the free decay test simulations for the deepcwind semi submersible system for the six degrees of freedom the natural frequency and the linear damping ratio dr are extracted from each test the results show an excellent agreement between aqwa and the reference results in all modes of motion in order to achieve the desired surge natural frequency an additional linear stiffness equal to 7 39 kn m was added to capture the cables bundles effect attached to the models during the experiments in the surge motion direction thereafter the response of heave surge pitch and mooring lines tension in regular wave were compared in seven load cases which are identical to those adopted by coulling et al 2013 table 4 summarizes the wave amplitude a and wave period t of each load case according to coulling et al 2013 the results of the tension in both mooring lines were underestimated using fast due to the hypothesis that fast use a quasi static solver for the mooring system therefore the cable dynamics is considered in the presented validation process and the results with and without cable dynamics are presented in fig 6 and fig 7 it is observed that accounting for cable dynamics increases the tension in the cables but still does not agree with the experiments which could be due to the method itself that is used in the analysis regarding the translational motions the cable dynamics does not influence the results obtained whereas it lead to increase the pitch rao especially in the higher wave heights in order to achieve these agreements between the numerical model and the experiments the quadratic damping shown in table 5 which was used by coulling et al 2013 are implemented in aqwa in order to add the viscous damping effect after validating the numerical model with aqwa in regular waves irregular waves with no wind are tested fig 8 shows the spectrum used in the validation process it is a broad band white noise spectrum with a wave height 11 3 m identical to the one used by coulling et al 2013 they have chosen the 11 3 m to be in excess to that corresponding to the 100 year return period in the gulf of maine fig 9 shows the rao in irregular waves in a wave period range between 7s 25s obtained from aqwa and compared to the test data and fast results that were published in coulling et al 2013 the raos agree well with the fast results and a similar behaviour is achieved in heave pitch surge motions however aqwa results in a higher heave motion there near the heave natural frequency as shown in plot a in fig 9 5 results and discussion sea states corresponding to the 1 25 and 50 year return periods are estimated by the environmental contour ec method based on two different approaches 1 the inverse first order reliability method iform 2 the direct monte carlo simulation mcs in order to apply the iform the probability of failure p f and the reliability index Î² corresponding to each return period under consideration are calculated using eqs 7 and 8 and are shown in table 6 regarding the later approach three different sample sizes are adopted as mentioned previously 1 3 and 5 million m sample are used to estimate the ec corresponding to each return period although the 5m sample size increases the simulation time it is included in this study to assess the influence of the sample size on the deepcwind responses 5 1 response evaluation the ec approach provides the sea states corresponding to a given return period however the largest responses are always resulting from the extreme sea states the ec based on iform for a 50 year return period presented in fig 10 is used to identify the extreme sea states giving the extreme response the responses of the deepcwind semi submersible resulting from each sea state on the ec based on the iform are simulated using aqwa the global maximum response from each 3 h time record is extracted and presented in fig 11 the x axis of fig 11 stands for the sea state significant wave height h s and peak period t p the relation between the peak period t p and the zero upcrossing period is t p 1 31t z for jonswap spectrum the results emphasises that the global maximum surge heave and pitch responses of the deepcwind semi submersible occur in the sea states associated with the maximum h s and the maximum t p extreme sea states therefore the extreme responses are always obtained by considering the two sea states in each contour 5 2 extreme responses in this section the influences of using two approaches and varying sample sizes are presented fig 12 presents a comparison between the environmental contours constructed by using the iform and the ones constructed using the direct mcs with 1m 3m and 5m samples plot a b and c in fig 12 corresponds to the environmental contours for 1 25 and 50 year return period respectively in case of the 1 year return period shown in plot a all the estimated contours are similar to each other especially on the upper right area extreme values which is the focus of this study however it is observed that the 1m sample results in some irregularities in the area of interest which could be negligible these irregularities are getting more obvious by increasing the return periods to 25 and 50 years as shown in plot b and c in fig 12 respectively it is remarkable that the contours constructed by adopting mcs using 1m and 3m sample points results in many irregularities in different parts of the contour compared to the one constructed using the 5m sample points further in plot b which present the 50 year return period the deviation between the contour lines is more notable compared to the 25 year return period and using 5m sample points results in the lower contour line in general it is observed that increasing the number of samples results in a smoother contour regardless the return period considered the contour estimated by using the iform is always overestimating the extreme values in the higher return periods however the contour is well agreed with the one resulting from using 3m samples in plot b and c fig 13 shows the comparison between the upper right area of the contours constructed adopting mcs with 1m sample points and the iform the 1m points generated directly in the x space using the joint environmental model are presented together with the contours as mentioned before it is expected that the contour constructed using the direct mcs approach has the desired p f so it is observed that the iform contour always overpredict the extreme values and includes some more points from the failure region in that particular case furthermore the deviation between both contours are high in case of 1m sample points this deviation is getting smaller when using higher sample points fig 14 shows only the environmental contour estimated by the direct mcs approach the figure consists of three plots representing the three sample sizes taken into consideration 1 25 and 50 year return period plot a b and c present the environmental contours constructed using 1m 3m and 5m sample points respectively it is observed that increasing the sample size for the same return period results in a visually smoother contour the irregularities are more notable in case of the1m sample size this is because of the presence of some empty half spaces in the estimated hyperplanes Ð¿ Î¸ this problem could be reduced by either increasing the sample points or by adopting alternative method to construct the contour using the same approach e g see huseby et al 2015 the design points dps corresponding to the extreme sea states are extracted from the ecs shown in fig 12 from the upper right area however the maximum significant wave height h s resulting from the ec may not necessarily be associated with the maximum zero up crossing period t z therefore the extreme sea states are classified into two groups the first group group 1 includes the design points corresponding to the maximum h s while the second group group 2 consists of the design points corresponding to the maximum t z these values are presented in fig 15 for the 1 25 and 50 year return periods plot a and b in fig 15 show the design points dps selected from the ecs according to the maximum h s and t z respectively plot a shows the convergence in the design points corresponding to the 1 year return period compared to the 25 and 50 year return periods also it is observed that adopting mcs in case of the 1 and 25 year return periods results in a higher h s values compared to the iform whereas in case of 50 year return period the minimum h s is reported when adopting mcs using 5m samples which results in 0 4 lower h s compared to the iform in case of 1 year return period mcs results in 2 1 3 and 0 4 higher h s compared to the iform for the 1m 3m and 5m cases respectively while in case of 25 year return period the percentage increase to 6 7 3 and 1 34 regarding the 50 year return period the differences become 3 4 3 4 and 0 4 respectively regarding plot b in fig 15 the design points corresponding to the maximum t z are presented and numbered from dp13 to dp24 group 2 conversely the deviation between the design points is more observed in the 1 year return period results similarly implementing the mcs using 1m 3m and 5m samples results in 6 3 higher and 0 3 lower h s compared to the iform by taking a closer look to the values of h s in both groups and comparing the results with those obtained by iform using the mcs with 5m samples leads to the minimum deviation in the h s results in both groups compared to the iform the maximum deviation among the 5m samples is recorded at the 25 year return period thereafter a hydrodynamic analysis using aqwa is carried out for each design point dp reported in fig 15 a 3 h time domain simulation are performed adopting the joint north sea wave project jonswap spectrum to estimate the wave surface elevation wse fig 16 shows a sample of 4000 s simulation for the sea state h s t z that corresponds to dp1 13 59 m 12 54s the figure consists of wse surge motion Î· 11 heave motion Î· 33 pitch motion Î· 55 tension in cable 1 t 1 and tension in cable 2 t 2 respectively afterwards the power spectrum psd for each individual time record is estimated by using the fast fourier transform fft as shown in fig 17 all responses psd are investigated for each of the 24 design points considered and the root mean square rms for each psd is estimated by 21 r m s m 0 where m o is the zero moment under the spectrum fig 17 shows the power density spectra psd of the of the pitch and surge motions in plot a heave psd in plot b and the cable tensions in plot c it is observed that the maximum resonant peak occur at 0 009 hz 0 036 hz and 0 053 hz for the surge pitch and heave motions respectively these frequencies are quite identical to the semi submersible natural frequencies for those degrees of freedoms the surge pitch coupling is reported as most of the combination resonances are synchronized between both responses as shown in plot a furthermore one of the common peaks between all the responses is the incident wave peak frequency f p which corresponds to 0 061 hz the iform is the widely used approach to construct the ec and it results in sea states close to the ones results from adopting mcs approach as shown in fig 15 however those small deviation percentages between the sea states are not guaranteed to be kept in the responses corresponds to them so the influence of adopting both approaches on the semi submersible responses are highlighted and presented from fig 18 to fig 21 in terms of rms regarding group 1 that considers the sea sates corresponding to the maximum h s and its associated t z quite similar responses rms are obtained in case of 1 year return period as shown in figs 18 and 19 so far this agreement was expected from the comparison performed in plot a at fig 12 that generate identical contours moreover it is expected that the mcs approach results in an advantageous contour that avoid any imprecise prediction of the p f gives directly the exact characteristics of the joint model adopted as well as has less regularities with higher sample size it is observed that the deviation between the responses rms becomes remarkable on the 25 and 50 year return period which is also appropriate with the contour result as shown previously in plot b at fig 12 table 7 summarizes the deviation between the responses rms result from adopting the iform and the mcs using different sample sizes for each return period considered for the dps of group 1 it is notable that the iform under predict most of the 1 year return period responses compared to those obtained by the mcs regardless the sample size used however these deviations could be considered negligible to some extent due to the minor percentages obtained that are less than 2 in most of the cases and reach 0 13 in the heave motion this trend was already expected from the contour results one could anticipate that the contour constructed using the 5m sample points results in the most accurate sea states that satisfy the p f required hence the responses that result from the 5m sample contour are considered to be the most accurate in this study it is also observed that the maximum deviation that reaches 5 79 results in the heave and pitch responses at 25 and 50 year return periods further it is observed that adopting the iform in the 25 year overpredicts these responses while underpredicts them in case of 50 year on the other hand the maximum deviations are reported to be 14 62 and 14 39 in the pitch and the tension in cable 2 respectively these deviations result in case of 25 year return period while using 3m and 1m sample points respectively the deviations in the response are much higher than the small deviations in the sea states therefore choosing the adequate method is of crucial importance in estimating the extreme response especially for the heave and pitch also from another perspective the high deviation in the 1m and 3m sample size could be a result of the high level of irregularity in the contour itself regarding group 2 that considers the t z as the reference parameter for selecting the sea state resulting the extreme response the responses rms are shown in fig 20 and fig 21 the surge heave and pitch responses rms are shown in plot a b and c in fig 20 respectively while the tension in cable 1 and cable 2 are shown in plots a and b in fig 21 respectively table 8 summarizes the deviation between the responses rms result from adopting the iform and the mcs using different sample sizes for each return period considered for the dps in group 2 in a like manner as group 1 the iform results in the lower responses in case of the 1 year return period when compared to those obtained by the 3m and 5m sample points however this behavior is inversed when compared to the 1m sample as it reports the maximum deviation among this sample size comparing the iform with the mcs using 5m sample for 1 year return period the deviation could be also negligible since it does not exceed 1 68 in t1 response but it is observed that the overall deviation between the results shown in table 8 could reach eight times that obtained in table 7 for instance the deviation reaches 16 15 in group 2 in t2 while it was 2 3 in group 1 the reason of that could be choosing t z as the reference parameters in group 2 by taking a closer look into fig 12 it is observed that the irregular lines are more shifted to the right rather than upwards which means higher t z deviation consequently the deviation in the responses for group 2 becomes more observed and influential also it is notable that in case of group 2 the iform strongly underpredicts all the responses value except for the 1 year return period when compared to the 5m sample afterwards the maximum extreme response values are extracted from each time record each 3 h response time record is divided into 40 equally segments 270s each and the resulting global extreme value in each individual segment is extracted the empirical distribution of the maximum extreme values extracted is compared with the gumbel distribution and the generalized extreme value distribution gev fig 22 shows the results of fitting both distribution for dp1 the kolmogorov smirnov k s test is applied to assess the goodness of fit it is observed that the gev distribution has an excellent agreement with the empirical distribution as well as all the tests considered accept the null hypothesis that the sample comes from the hypothesized distribution at the 5 significance level the average fitted parameters k Ï Î¼ corresponding to each return period is presented in table 9 the shape k scale Ï and location Î¼ parameters of the gev distribution corresponding to each return period is calculated by averaging the parameters of all the design points corresponding to that return period regardless the ec approach used for instance the fitted parameters of the 1 year return period are based on the dps 1 4 7 10 13 16 19 and 22 the probability of exceedance of the maximum extreme responses surge heave pitch and tension in cables 1 and 2 corresponding to the 1 25 and 50 year return periods are presented in fig 23 thereafter the results are compared to the gev distribution estimated using the aforementioned average fitted parameters shown in table 9 the results show a good agreement between the gev distribution and the maximum extreme values extracted from the simulation results this agreement is because of the flexibility of the gev distribution as it consists of three parameters therefore the parameters estimated represent well the maximum extreme distribution for the deepcwind semi submersible located in the northern north sea for the 1 25 and 50 year return periods 6 conclusion the sea states corresponding to 1 25 and 50 year return periods using environmental contour methods were estimated the iform and the direct mcs approaches were adopted to estimate the environmental contours in case of the later approach 1m 3m and 5m sample sizes were adopted and their influence on the responses was studied the extreme response was found to be associated with the sea states corresponding to the maximum h s and maximum t p ansys aqwa which is based on a 3d panel method was used to simulate those extreme responses of the deepcwind semi submersible in case of no wind and considering a wave propagating in the x direction this study focused on the surge heave pitch and the tension in the mooring cables afterwards the maximum extreme response values were extracted from 3 h time domain simulation and fitted to the gumbel distribution and the generalized extreme value distribution gev in the validation process the numerical model captured well the natural frequencies of the system for the 6 degrees of freedom moreover the effect of cable dynamics was included and compared to the measured data published by coulling et al 2013 it was observed that including the cable dynamics in the hydrodynamic analysis has almost no effect on the translational responses while increases the pitch responses of the semi submersible despite enhancing the cables tension results by adding the effect of the cable dynamics a remarkable deviation between the numerical and experimental tension results still exists regarding the effect of the sample size in the estimation of the ec using mcs it was observed that increasing the number of samples results in a smoother ec especially for 25 and 50 year return periods however increasing the sample size has almost no effect on the 1 year return period ec it is observed that the heave and pitch are the most affected responses by the ec approach used furthermore using the maximum zero up crossing period to select the extreme sea states group 2 results in much higher deviations compared to those obtained in group 1 due to the irregular lines in the ec constructed using mcs approach also it is concluded that the small deviations between the sea states resulting from adopting different ec approaches led to significant deviations between the deepcwind semi submersible extreme responses also the generalized extreme value distribution gev was fitted to all the results and a probabilistic model was developed for each response considered in this study acknowledgment this study was performed within the project arcwind adaptation and implementation of floating

22286,this paper aims to assess the uncertainty on the extreme responses of a semi submersible wind turbine using two environmental contour approaches the approaches are based on the inverse first order reliability method and the direct monte carlo simulation with different sample sizes the long term sea states are described by a 3 parameters weibull distribution for the significant wave height and a conditional log normal distribution for the zero up crossing period two extreme sea states are extracted from each environmental contour which are associated with the maximum significant wave height and maximum zero upcrossing period a 3 h time domain simulation for each sea state is conducted by adopting a validated numerical model the root mean square for all the response spectra are estimated and compared to each other it is observed that despite the small deviation between the significant wave heights resulting from adopting different environmental contour approaches the deviation between the resulting responses is much more significant the gumbel and the generalized extreme value distributions are fitted to the maximum extreme response values for each sea state and unified fitted parameter are obtained keywords wind turbine semi submersible environmental contour uncertainty extreme response 1 introduction the assessment of the extreme response for a given return period is of crucial importance in the preliminary design stage of any floating structure the traditional full long term analysis flta is the most accurate approach to estimate the long term extreme response as it accounts for all sea states e g guedes soares and moan 1991 the approach consists of integrating the product of the probability of occurrence of each sea state by the cumulative short term probability distribution of the extreme response however this method is considered not efficient due to the large number of simulations needed to be performed for such analysis while a huge percentage from these simulations are not contributing in the extreme response according to this concern videiro and moan 1999 presented a simplified long term analysis and achieved a good accuracy as long as the effective environmental conditions are included in an attempt for a more efficient way to predict the extreme response for a given return period an alternative method called the environmental contour method is based on the inverse first order reliability method iform was developed by winterstein et al 1993 thereafter many studies have been conducted regarding this method e g haver and winterstein 2009 from several decades the first order reliability method form has been widely used to solve the reliability problems related to ships and offshore structures for instance teixeira and guedes soares 2005 assessed the partial safety factor that is used in the probability based design rules for designing the tankers using the form thereafter teixeira and guedes soares 2009 performed a reliability analysis of a tanker subjected to combined sea states adopting form as well and gaspar et al 2016 considered the effect of nonlinear wave induced bending moments on the reliability of tankers moreover among the reliability methods used in ships and offshore structural design summarized and reviewed by guedes soares et al 2010 form was highlighted the idea behind the environmental contour ec method based on the iform is to identify the contour in the normal space of the environmental variables u space and then transform it to the physical space x space by using rosenblatt transformation one of the main advantages of the ec method is the smaller number of extreme sea states for a given return period resulting compared to flta which are independent of the structural response conversely flta depends on performing a full hydrodynamic analysis of the structure to identify the extreme scenarios many recent studies have implemented the ec in the prediction of the long term extreme response of wind turbines as well as of hybrid concepts that combine wind and wave energy devices e g karimirad and moan 2011 karmakar et al 2016 raed et al 2018 and li et al 2019 however saranyasoontorn and manuel 2004 agarwal and manuel 2009 li et al 2013 and li et al 2016 showed that the ec method under predicts the long term extreme response of the wind turbines compared to those obtained by the flta to overcome the aforementioned deficiency li et al 2017 presented a modified environmental contour method that takes into account an active survival strategy in order to reduce the system response in extreme conditions despite the time and results efficiency of the ec method using the iform huseby et al 2013 avoided to use the rosenblatt transformation by generating the environmental contour directly in the physical space by adopting the direct monte carlo simulation mcs in order to perform such a long term response analysis the long term description of the sea state shall be explored many researchers have conducted work related to the joint distribution for different environmental parameters for instance haver 1987 guedes soares et al 1988 mathisen and bitner gregersen 1990 guedes soares and scotto 2001 ferreira and guedes soares 2002 dong et al 2013 and lucas and guedes soares 2015 most of the aforementioned studies concentrated on the significant wave height h s and the zero up crossing period parameters t z and they ended up by using the 3 parameters weibull distribution for h s and the conditional log normal distribution for t z especially in the northern north sea area this study is concerned with a semi submersible wind turbine that is assumed to be operated in the northern north sea area this type of platform is probably the one that has been most studied among the various existing concepts of floating wind turbines uzunoglu et al 2016 coulling et al 2013 conducted experiments on a 1 50th scale model for the deepcwind semi submersible supporting a horizontal axis nrel 5 mw reference wind turbine introduced previously by jonkman et al 2007 in order to validate the numerical model using fast jonkman and buhl 2005 the code fast has been incorporated in a system that allows multiple runs of the code to be performed automatically within an interactive process of designing semisubmersible platforms uzunoglu and guedes soares 2019 following the work of coulling et al 2013 many complimentary studies and benchmarks were conducted adopting different numerical models with different loading conditions e g robertson et al 2014 more details about the time domain analysis and the determination of the coefficients and impulse functions are found in e g ogilive 1964 and journÃ©e and massie 2001 raed and guedes soares 2018 have studied the uncertainty of the prediction of the wave loads in cylinders representative of the columns of semi submersibles this paper studies the uncertainty associated with the prediction of extreme responses for the deepcwind semi submersible by using the inverse first order reliability method and the direct monte carlo simulation approach to estimate the environmental contour for 1 25 and 50 year return periods the later approach is examined using 1 million 1m 3 million 3m and 5 million 5m samples for each return period considered in this study to do so the extreme long term sea state in the northern north sea is described in this study by the marginal 3 parameters weibull distribution for the significant wave height h s and a conditional log normal distribution for the zero up crossing period t z as suggested by the det norske veritas dnv 2010 a total of 24 design points dp are extracted from the environmental contours and are classified into two groups group 1 refers to the extreme sea states corresponding to the maximum significant wave height in the ec while group 2 refers to the extreme sea states corresponding to the maximum zero up crossing period in the ec afterwards hydrodynamic analyses for each extreme sea state are performed using aqwa the root mean square rms for each response power spectrum psd is calculated and compared to each other s in order to identify the effect of using the different environmental contour approaches adopted in this study the numerical model of the deepcwind semi submersible is validated with the results published by coulling et al 2013 thereafter the long term extreme response for the heave surge pitch and cables tension are extracted from each 3 h time domain simulation the maximum response values for each design point are fitted to theoretical gumbel and generalized extreme value gev distributions 2 long term variability of the sea state to estimate the long term probability of occurrence of the sea state it is of vital importance to have a continuous sample of data and to fit it with an appropriate probabilistic model typically the joint distribution model of h s and t z is given by 1 f h s t z h s t z f h s h s f t z h s t z h s the marginal distribution of the significant wave height h s is described by a 3 parameters weibull distribution with cumulative distribution function cdf given by see also dnv 2010 and huseby et al 2013 2 f h s h s 1 exp h s Î³ Î» Î± where Î± is the shape parameter Î» is the scale parameter and É£ is the location parameter on the other hand the conditional distribution of the zero up crossing periods t z is well represented by a log normal distribution which has a cdf in the form 3 f t z h s t z h s Ï ln t z Î¼ Ï where Î¼ and Ï are the parameters of the distribution given by 4 Î¼ t h a 1 a 2 h a 3 5 Ï t h b 1 b 2 e b 3 h the fitted parameters for the 3 parameters weibull and the log normal distributions used in this study are shown in table 1 3 environmental contour the main advantage of the environmental contour is its capability to identify the critical environmental loads independently of the structural response reducing the time needed to predict the long term results compared to the full long term analysis flta method in this research two environmental contour methods are investigated based on 1 the traditional inverse first order reliability method iform and 2 the direct monte carlo simulations mcs 3 1 inverse first order reliability method iform the reliability r of any structure is defined as the probability of the performance function g x being greater than zero so it is expressed by 6 r p g x 0 g x 0 f x 1 x 2 d x 1 p f where f x 1 x 2 is the joint probability density function of the environmental variables considered p f is the probability of failure and g x is the performance function however due to the nonlinearity of g x in most cases it is not easy to solve the integration in eq 6 also the complexity of f x 1 x 2 especially when more than two random variables are taken into consideration makes the integration more difficult to solve the first order reliability method form overcomes these two obstacles by 1 linearizing the performance function by using the first order taylor expansion and 2 simplifying the joint distribution function by transforming the random variables from physical space x space to normal space u space using the rosenblatt transformation rosenblatt 1952 the transformed variables are normally distributed with zero mean Î¼ and unit standard deviation Ï independent and uncorrelated the interest in this study is directed to the inverse first order reliability method iform the approach generates the environmental random variables directly in the u space that are transformed into the x space using the inverse rosenblatt transformation as illustrated in fig 1 in the u space a set Å© forming a circle with a radius equal to the reliability index Î² can be defined fig 1a which is expressed by fig 1a 7 1 p f Ï Î² where p f is the probability of failure Î² is the reliability index and Ñ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function in order to obtain Î² the probability of failure is estimated in this study by 8 p f t s s 365 24 t r where t ss is the sea state duration in hours t r is the return period in years and the 365 24 factor is to convert the number of years to hours afterwards let Å© 0 be a point located on the failure boundary with an arbitrary angle Î¸ Îµ 0o 360 as shown in fig 1 the coordinates of this point which represent the random variables in the u space are given by 9 u 1 Î² cos Î¸ 10 u 2 Î² sin Î¸ in fig 1 a Ï denotes the hyperplane that is tangent to the point Å© 0 Ï is the half space bounded by that line and not containing Å© where p uÏµ Ï is equal to the p f and Ï denotes the other half space that contains the set Å© thereafter the standard normal variables are transformed to the x space giving the intended environmental contour by adopting the inverse rosenblatt transformation as shown in fig 1 b in fig 1 according to rosenblatt transformation the relation between the physical space and the normal space is given by Ï u 1 f h s h s Ï u 2 u 1 f t p h s t p h s where Ñ is the standard normal cumulative probability and h s and t p are the contour points of the marginal significant wave height and conditional peak period respectively accordingly for a given marginal distribution for the variable h s and a conditional distribution for t z the rosenblatt transformation is given by 11 h s f h s 1 Ï u 1 t p h s f t p h s 1 Ï u 2 u 1 where f hs is the cumulative distribution function cdf of the marginal significant wave height f tp hs is the cdf of the conditional peak period u 1 and u 2 are the two random variables in the u space corresponds to the h s and t p respectively among the deficiencies of adopting the rosenblatt transformation is the difficulty to obtain a full characteristic of the transformed set because it is strongly dependent on the joint distribution of the environmental variables also it is not guaranteed to obtain the same probability of failure p f in both space after transformation because the nonlinearity of the transformation itself consequently there is a tendency to over or under prediction in the desired environmental contour 3 2 monte carlo simulation mcs an alternative approach to construct the environmental contour directly in the x space using monte carlo simulation mcs was first introduced by huseby et al 2013 such approach does not need to perform the inverse rosenblatt transformation thus the desired properties of the estimated set u previously described is directly achieved accordingly the errors that arise from using the iform are prevented three different methods to construct the environmental contour using mcs were established by huseby et al 2015 and one of them is adopted in this study generally the idea behind this approach is to explore the set u and use its boundary as the desired contour so the procedure of generating the environmental contour using mcs adopted in this work is summarized as follow according to huseby et al 2015 1 use monte carlo simulation to generate a suitable number of sample points for the joint model adopted in this study a 3 parameter weibull distribution is used for h s and a log normal distribution for t z 12 t 1 h 2 t n h n where t and h are the generated sample points of t z and h s respectively while n is the number of the points 2 for an arbitrary angle Î¸ Îµ 0 360 a unit vector cos Î¸ sin Î¸ that divide the sample points into two half spaces is defined the projection length of each point on the vector is given by 13 y i Î¸ t i cos Î¸ h i sin Î¸ i 1 2 n where Î¸ is the arbitrary angle and y is the projection length of each point on the unit vector 3 afterwards these projections are sorted in ascending order each projection length y Î¸ corresponds to a certain sample point t i h i 4 estimate the number of points in such that 14 p f n k n k n 1 p f where n is the total number of sample points and k is the number of the reliable points 5 afterwards a function called c Î¸ is used to identify the boundary of set u the unbiased estimation of c Î¸ is given by 15 c Î¸ y k Î¸ the estimation of c Î¸ is then used to determine the unbiased estimation of the hyperplane Ð¿ Î¸ and the two half spaces Ð¿ Î¸ and Ð¿ Î¸ 6 those steps excluding step 1 are repeated for a number of chosen angles with a constant interval Î´ forming a number of hyperplanes the intersection points of the half space bounded by those hyperplanes are then connected by straight lines forming the desired environmental contour those intersection points are denoted by t j h j t n h n and they are given by 16 t j sin Î¸ j 1 c Î¸ j sin Î¸ j c Î¸ j 1 sin Î´ 17 h j cos Î¸ j 1 c Î¸ j cos Î¸ j c Î¸ j 1 sin Î´ where Î´ Î¸ j 1 Î¸ and the last t n h n and the first t 1 h 1 intersection points are identical in order to obtain a closed contour the resulting contour is always convex according to the propositions of the method itself for more details about the approach and methods refer to huseby et al 2013 and huseby et al 2015 further some irregularities could be found in the desired contour due to the presence of some hyperplanes which are not supporting Ã» however the sampling error is among the causes that could influence those irregularities 4 hydrodynamic analysis in case of anchoring for example the system becomes no more linear and the frequency domain analysis is no more applicable and hence the time domain is a better choice the system in the time domain has a form of memory function once the extreme sea states are identified time domain simulations are run it is recommended a duration of the simulation of 3 h in order to reach the statistical stability of higher order moments like skewness and kurtosis 4 1 cummins equation cummins 1962 described a classical formulation to be used in the determination of hydro mechanical forces and moments the linear time domain equation of motion cummins equation of the floating support structure in case of zero forward speed is expressed as follows 18 m a x t b x t k x t 0 t r t Ï x Ï d Ï f t where m is mass of the structure a is the fluid added mass matrix at infinite frequency b is the damping matrix including the linear radiation damping effect r is the total velocity impulse function matrix and k is the stiffness matrix alternatively the acceleration impulse function could be employed in the equation to be as follows 19 m a x t c x t k x t 0 t a t Ï x Ï d Ï f t where the acceleration impulse function a t is given by 20 a t 2 Ï 0 b Ï sin Ï t Ï d Ï 2 Ï 0 a Ï a cos Ï t d Ï 4 2 numerical model the deepcwind semi submersible 5 mw wind turbine fig 2 is considered in this study the system is divided into four main parts 1 the floating platform 2 the tower 3 the tower top part which include the rotor nacelle and the hub and 4 the mooring lines the specifications of the main characteristics of the system are shown in table 2 the mooring configuration and the sign convention adopted in this study are shown in fig 3 which are identical to those used by coulling et al 2013 this is a typical mooring arrangement for renewable energy devices xu et al 2019 as shown in figs 2 and 3 the floating platform consists of three offset columns fixed on three base columns with a larger diameter and one main column in the middle mounted by the wind turbine the columns are connected to each other by bracings forming a truss but for the assessment of the wave induced loads the representation of the bracings is not essential uzunoglu and guedes soares 2015 aqwa ansys inc 2013 is used to perform the hydrodynamic analysis of the deepcwind semi submersible 4 3 validation the numerical model is validated by comparing its results to those already published by coulling et al 2013 the validation process is divided into three steps 1 free decay of the system including mooring lines 2 regular wave in no wind condition and 3 irregular wave in no wind condition the eigen modes of the system are extracted from the free decay simulations and compared to the published results table 3 shows a comparison between the natural periods obtained by the experiments the validation performed by coulling et al 2013 using fast software and the one obtained by aqwa a maximum element size of 2 m is chosen based on convergence analysis fig 4 shows the mesh of the geometry used in the study fig 5 shows the free decay test simulations for the deepcwind semi submersible system for the six degrees of freedom the natural frequency and the linear damping ratio dr are extracted from each test the results show an excellent agreement between aqwa and the reference results in all modes of motion in order to achieve the desired surge natural frequency an additional linear stiffness equal to 7 39 kn m was added to capture the cables bundles effect attached to the models during the experiments in the surge motion direction thereafter the response of heave surge pitch and mooring lines tension in regular wave were compared in seven load cases which are identical to those adopted by coulling et al 2013 table 4 summarizes the wave amplitude a and wave period t of each load case according to coulling et al 2013 the results of the tension in both mooring lines were underestimated using fast due to the hypothesis that fast use a quasi static solver for the mooring system therefore the cable dynamics is considered in the presented validation process and the results with and without cable dynamics are presented in fig 6 and fig 7 it is observed that accounting for cable dynamics increases the tension in the cables but still does not agree with the experiments which could be due to the method itself that is used in the analysis regarding the translational motions the cable dynamics does not influence the results obtained whereas it lead to increase the pitch rao especially in the higher wave heights in order to achieve these agreements between the numerical model and the experiments the quadratic damping shown in table 5 which was used by coulling et al 2013 are implemented in aqwa in order to add the viscous damping effect after validating the numerical model with aqwa in regular waves irregular waves with no wind are tested fig 8 shows the spectrum used in the validation process it is a broad band white noise spectrum with a wave height 11 3 m identical to the one used by coulling et al 2013 they have chosen the 11 3 m to be in excess to that corresponding to the 100 year return period in the gulf of maine fig 9 shows the rao in irregular waves in a wave period range between 7s 25s obtained from aqwa and compared to the test data and fast results that were published in coulling et al 2013 the raos agree well with the fast results and a similar behaviour is achieved in heave pitch surge motions however aqwa results in a higher heave motion there near the heave natural frequency as shown in plot a in fig 9 5 results and discussion sea states corresponding to the 1 25 and 50 year return periods are estimated by the environmental contour ec method based on two different approaches 1 the inverse first order reliability method iform 2 the direct monte carlo simulation mcs in order to apply the iform the probability of failure p f and the reliability index Î² corresponding to each return period under consideration are calculated using eqs 7 and 8 and are shown in table 6 regarding the later approach three different sample sizes are adopted as mentioned previously 1 3 and 5 million m sample are used to estimate the ec corresponding to each return period although the 5m sample size increases the simulation time it is included in this study to assess the influence of the sample size on the deepcwind responses 5 1 response evaluation the ec approach provides the sea states corresponding to a given return period however the largest responses are always resulting from the extreme sea states the ec based on iform for a 50 year return period presented in fig 10 is used to identify the extreme sea states giving the extreme response the responses of the deepcwind semi submersible resulting from each sea state on the ec based on the iform are simulated using aqwa the global maximum response from each 3 h time record is extracted and presented in fig 11 the x axis of fig 11 stands for the sea state significant wave height h s and peak period t p the relation between the peak period t p and the zero upcrossing period is t p 1 31t z for jonswap spectrum the results emphasises that the global maximum surge heave and pitch responses of the deepcwind semi submersible occur in the sea states associated with the maximum h s and the maximum t p extreme sea states therefore the extreme responses are always obtained by considering the two sea states in each contour 5 2 extreme responses in this section the influences of using two approaches and varying sample sizes are presented fig 12 presents a comparison between the environmental contours constructed by using the iform and the ones constructed using the direct mcs with 1m 3m and 5m samples plot a b and c in fig 12 corresponds to the environmental contours for 1 25 and 50 year return period respectively in case of the 1 year return period shown in plot a all the estimated contours are similar to each other especially on the upper right area extreme values which is the focus of this study however it is observed that the 1m sample results in some irregularities in the area of interest which could be negligible these irregularities are getting more obvious by increasing the return periods to 25 and 50 years as shown in plot b and c in fig 12 respectively it is remarkable that the contours constructed by adopting mcs using 1m and 3m sample points results in many irregularities in different parts of the contour compared to the one constructed using the 5m sample points further in plot b which present the 50 year return period the deviation between the contour lines is more notable compared to the 25 year return period and using 5m sample points results in the lower contour line in general it is observed that increasing the number of samples results in a smoother contour regardless the return period considered the contour estimated by using the iform is always overestimating the extreme values in the higher return periods however the contour is well agreed with the one resulting from using 3m samples in plot b and c fig 13 shows the comparison between the upper right area of the contours constructed adopting mcs with 1m sample points and the iform the 1m points generated directly in the x space using the joint environmental model are presented together with the contours as mentioned before it is expected that the contour constructed using the direct mcs approach has the desired p f so it is observed that the iform contour always overpredict the extreme values and includes some more points from the failure region in that particular case furthermore the deviation between both contours are high in case of 1m sample points this deviation is getting smaller when using higher sample points fig 14 shows only the environmental contour estimated by the direct mcs approach the figure consists of three plots representing the three sample sizes taken into consideration 1 25 and 50 year return period plot a b and c present the environmental contours constructed using 1m 3m and 5m sample points respectively it is observed that increasing the sample size for the same return period results in a visually smoother contour the irregularities are more notable in case of the1m sample size this is because of the presence of some empty half spaces in the estimated hyperplanes Ð¿ Î¸ this problem could be reduced by either increasing the sample points or by adopting alternative method to construct the contour using the same approach e g see huseby et al 2015 the design points dps corresponding to the extreme sea states are extracted from the ecs shown in fig 12 from the upper right area however the maximum significant wave height h s resulting from the ec may not necessarily be associated with the maximum zero up crossing period t z therefore the extreme sea states are classified into two groups the first group group 1 includes the design points corresponding to the maximum h s while the second group group 2 consists of the design points corresponding to the maximum t z these values are presented in fig 15 for the 1 25 and 50 year return periods plot a and b in fig 15 show the design points dps selected from the ecs according to the maximum h s and t z respectively plot a shows the convergence in the design points corresponding to the 1 year return period compared to the 25 and 50 year return periods also it is observed that adopting mcs in case of the 1 and 25 year return periods results in a higher h s values compared to the iform whereas in case of 50 year return period the minimum h s is reported when adopting mcs using 5m samples which results in 0 4 lower h s compared to the iform in case of 1 year return period mcs results in 2 1 3 and 0 4 higher h s compared to the iform for the 1m 3m and 5m cases respectively while in case of 25 year return period the percentage increase to 6 7 3 and 1 34 regarding the 50 year return period the differences become 3 4 3 4 and 0 4 respectively regarding plot b in fig 15 the design points corresponding to the maximum t z are presented and numbered from dp13 to dp24 group 2 conversely the deviation between the design points is more observed in the 1 year return period results similarly implementing the mcs using 1m 3m and 5m samples results in 6 3 higher and 0 3 lower h s compared to the iform by taking a closer look to the values of h s in both groups and comparing the results with those obtained by iform using the mcs with 5m samples leads to the minimum deviation in the h s results in both groups compared to the iform the maximum deviation among the 5m samples is recorded at the 25 year return period thereafter a hydrodynamic analysis using aqwa is carried out for each design point dp reported in fig 15 a 3 h time domain simulation are performed adopting the joint north sea wave project jonswap spectrum to estimate the wave surface elevation wse fig 16 shows a sample of 4000 s simulation for the sea state h s t z that corresponds to dp1 13 59 m 12 54s the figure consists of wse surge motion Î· 11 heave motion Î· 33 pitch motion Î· 55 tension in cable 1 t 1 and tension in cable 2 t 2 respectively afterwards the power spectrum psd for each individual time record is estimated by using the fast fourier transform fft as shown in fig 17 all responses psd are investigated for each of the 24 design points considered and the root mean square rms for each psd is estimated by 21 r m s m 0 where m o is the zero moment under the spectrum fig 17 shows the power density spectra psd of the of the pitch and surge motions in plot a heave psd in plot b and the cable tensions in plot c it is observed that the maximum resonant peak occur at 0 009 hz 0 036 hz and 0 053 hz for the surge pitch and heave motions respectively these frequencies are quite identical to the semi submersible natural frequencies for those degrees of freedoms the surge pitch coupling is reported as most of the combination resonances are synchronized between both responses as shown in plot a furthermore one of the common peaks between all the responses is the incident wave peak frequency f p which corresponds to 0 061 hz the iform is the widely used approach to construct the ec and it results in sea states close to the ones results from adopting mcs approach as shown in fig 15 however those small deviation percentages between the sea states are not guaranteed to be kept in the responses corresponds to them so the influence of adopting both approaches on the semi submersible responses are highlighted and presented from fig 18 to fig 21 in terms of rms regarding group 1 that considers the sea sates corresponding to the maximum h s and its associated t z quite similar responses rms are obtained in case of 1 year return period as shown in figs 18 and 19 so far this agreement was expected from the comparison performed in plot a at fig 12 that generate identical contours moreover it is expected that the mcs approach results in an advantageous contour that avoid any imprecise prediction of the p f gives directly the exact characteristics of the joint model adopted as well as has less regularities with higher sample size it is observed that the deviation between the responses rms becomes remarkable on the 25 and 50 year return period which is also appropriate with the contour result as shown previously in plot b at fig 12 table 7 summarizes the deviation between the responses rms result from adopting the iform and the mcs using different sample sizes for each return period considered for the dps of group 1 it is notable that the iform under predict most of the 1 year return period responses compared to those obtained by the mcs regardless the sample size used however these deviations could be considered negligible to some extent due to the minor percentages obtained that are less than 2 in most of the cases and reach 0 13 in the heave motion this trend was already expected from the contour results one could anticipate that the contour constructed using the 5m sample points results in the most accurate sea states that satisfy the p f required hence the responses that result from the 5m sample contour are considered to be the most accurate in this study it is also observed that the maximum deviation that reaches 5 79 results in the heave and pitch responses at 25 and 50 year return periods further it is observed that adopting the iform in the 25 year overpredicts these responses while underpredicts them in case of 50 year on the other hand the maximum deviations are reported to be 14 62 and 14 39 in the pitch and the tension in cable 2 respectively these deviations result in case of 25 year return period while using 3m and 1m sample points respectively the deviations in the response are much higher than the small deviations in the sea states therefore choosing the adequate method is of crucial importance in estimating the extreme response especially for the heave and pitch also from another perspective the high deviation in the 1m and 3m sample size could be a result of the high level of irregularity in the contour itself regarding group 2 that considers the t z as the reference parameter for selecting the sea state resulting the extreme response the responses rms are shown in fig 20 and fig 21 the surge heave and pitch responses rms are shown in plot a b and c in fig 20 respectively while the tension in cable 1 and cable 2 are shown in plots a and b in fig 21 respectively table 8 summarizes the deviation between the responses rms result from adopting the iform and the mcs using different sample sizes for each return period considered for the dps in group 2 in a like manner as group 1 the iform results in the lower responses in case of the 1 year return period when compared to those obtained by the 3m and 5m sample points however this behavior is inversed when compared to the 1m sample as it reports the maximum deviation among this sample size comparing the iform with the mcs using 5m sample for 1 year return period the deviation could be also negligible since it does not exceed 1 68 in t1 response but it is observed that the overall deviation between the results shown in table 8 could reach eight times that obtained in table 7 for instance the deviation reaches 16 15 in group 2 in t2 while it was 2 3 in group 1 the reason of that could be choosing t z as the reference parameters in group 2 by taking a closer look into fig 12 it is observed that the irregular lines are more shifted to the right rather than upwards which means higher t z deviation consequently the deviation in the responses for group 2 becomes more observed and influential also it is notable that in case of group 2 the iform strongly underpredicts all the responses value except for the 1 year return period when compared to the 5m sample afterwards the maximum extreme response values are extracted from each time record each 3 h response time record is divided into 40 equally segments 270s each and the resulting global extreme value in each individual segment is extracted the empirical distribution of the maximum extreme values extracted is compared with the gumbel distribution and the generalized extreme value distribution gev fig 22 shows the results of fitting both distribution for dp1 the kolmogorov smirnov k s test is applied to assess the goodness of fit it is observed that the gev distribution has an excellent agreement with the empirical distribution as well as all the tests considered accept the null hypothesis that the sample comes from the hypothesized distribution at the 5 significance level the average fitted parameters k Ï Î¼ corresponding to each return period is presented in table 9 the shape k scale Ï and location Î¼ parameters of the gev distribution corresponding to each return period is calculated by averaging the parameters of all the design points corresponding to that return period regardless the ec approach used for instance the fitted parameters of the 1 year return period are based on the dps 1 4 7 10 13 16 19 and 22 the probability of exceedance of the maximum extreme responses surge heave pitch and tension in cables 1 and 2 corresponding to the 1 25 and 50 year return periods are presented in fig 23 thereafter the results are compared to the gev distribution estimated using the aforementioned average fitted parameters shown in table 9 the results show a good agreement between the gev distribution and the maximum extreme values extracted from the simulation results this agreement is because of the flexibility of the gev distribution as it consists of three parameters therefore the parameters estimated represent well the maximum extreme distribution for the deepcwind semi submersible located in the northern north sea for the 1 25 and 50 year return periods 6 conclusion the sea states corresponding to 1 25 and 50 year return periods using environmental contour methods were estimated the iform and the direct mcs approaches were adopted to estimate the environmental contours in case of the later approach 1m 3m and 5m sample sizes were adopted and their influence on the responses was studied the extreme response was found to be associated with the sea states corresponding to the maximum h s and maximum t p ansys aqwa which is based on a 3d panel method was used to simulate those extreme responses of the deepcwind semi submersible in case of no wind and considering a wave propagating in the x direction this study focused on the surge heave pitch and the tension in the mooring cables afterwards the maximum extreme response values were extracted from 3 h time domain simulation and fitted to the gumbel distribution and the generalized extreme value distribution gev in the validation process the numerical model captured well the natural frequencies of the system for the 6 degrees of freedom moreover the effect of cable dynamics was included and compared to the measured data published by coulling et al 2013 it was observed that including the cable dynamics in the hydrodynamic analysis has almost no effect on the translational responses while increases the pitch responses of the semi submersible despite enhancing the cables tension results by adding the effect of the cable dynamics a remarkable deviation between the numerical and experimental tension results still exists regarding the effect of the sample size in the estimation of the ec using mcs it was observed that increasing the number of samples results in a smoother ec especially for 25 and 50 year return periods however increasing the sample size has almost no effect on the 1 year return period ec it is observed that the heave and pitch are the most affected responses by the ec approach used furthermore using the maximum zero up crossing period to select the extreme sea states group 2 results in much higher deviations compared to those obtained in group 1 due to the irregular lines in the ec constructed using mcs approach also it is concluded that the small deviations between the sea states resulting from adopting different ec approaches led to significant deviations between the deepcwind semi submersible extreme responses also the generalized extreme value distribution gev was fitted to all the results and a probabilistic model was developed for each response considered in this study acknowledgment this study was performed within the project arcwind adaptation and implementation of floating

22287,an adaptive fuzzy finite time path following control design is presented for the underactuated marine surface vessel msv under the condition of the time varying ocean currents and time varying large sideslip angle in this paper the proposed failos guidance law can not only calculate the desired heading angle but also estimate time varying ocean currents and time varying large sideslip angle simultaneously it is the first time that the fuzzy logic system is introduced into the guidance system of msv s path following control problem then the adaptive fuzzy finite time path following controllers are established via backstepping technique and the unknown lumped disturbances are estimated by the adaptive fuzzy logic system the new saturation compensators are adopted to handle the input saturation problem and meet with finite time convergence requirement of the whole control system it has been demonstrated that the proposed adaptive fuzzy finite time path following controllers can drive the vessel to follow the predefined path and tracking error can converge to a small neighborhood around origin in finite time simulation studies and comparisons are carried out to demonstrate the validity of the proposed control approach keywords underactuated msv path following failos guidance law fuzzy logic system finite time 1 introduction practical engineering problems in complex marine environments such as sea patrol exploring underwater topography and hydrological data collection etc are required marine vessel perform path following operation the path following control problem of the marine surface vessel msv has become one of the research hotspots in the last several years zhu et al 2014 zhang and zhang 2014 xiang et al 2015a xiang et al 2015b zhao et al 2016 miao et al 2017 the path following control problem is defined as that designing controller such that the vessel reach and follow prescribed path independent of time fossen 2011 a pivotal factor of the path following control problem is the guidance law which attempts to obtain reference signal by addressing path information in order to design successive controller there are three kinds of typical guidance approaches line of sight los guidance pure pursuit pp guidance and constant bearing cb guidance fossen 2011 to be specific the los guidance method is a valid guidance algorithm and has been extensively applied in marine vessels to solve practical path following problem due to its simplicity and intuitiveness it mimics the experienced sailor to drive the vehicle approaching a point lying at constant distance ahead of the vessel along the prescribed path at the early stage fossen et al 2003 puts forward the traditional los guidance algorithm for the purpose of minimizing the cross track error between the marine craft and the predefined path the proportional los plos guidance method was put forward to follow the straight line path in pettersen and lefeber 2001 and fossen and pettersen 2014 in fossen and pettersen 2014 a sort of plos guidance law was used to demonstrate the uniform semiglobal exponential stability of vehicle s path following control in spite of the simplicity and effectiveness of the los guidance method it still has shortcoming when the vehicle suffers external environmental disturbances subsequently the integral action was brought into the los guidance method thus resulting in the integral line of sight ilos guidance law which was supposed to counter the drifting effect caused by the environment disturbances in bÃ¸rhaug et al 2008 and caharija et al 2016 and it was also used for straight line path following of the autonomous underwater vehicles caharija et al 2012a and caharija et al 2012b in lekkas and fossen 2014 the ilos guidance law encompassing time varying lookahead distance and sideslip angle was designed where this algorithm had ability of counteracting the effects of constant environment disturbances however the ocean currents as kinematic disturbances were regarded as constants and irrotational currents in previous works then the adaptive integral line of sight ailos guidance approach based direct and indirect nonlinear path following controllers were presented and the impactful compensation for time varying ocean currents was exhibited in fossen and lekkas 2017 similarly to fossen and lekkas 2017 the ailos guidance law was proposed for unmanned msv under the condition of uncertainties and input saturation in zheng and sun 2016 where the proposed guidance algorithm could compensate the time varying ocean currents it is worth noting that the guidance methods presented in bÃ¸rhaug et al 2008 caharija et al 2016 caharija et al 2012a caharija et al 2012b lekkas and fossen 2014 fossen and lekkas 2017 and zheng and sun 2016 had an effect on compensation for constant ocean currents or time varying ocean currents however these works come to the conclusion by assuming that the sideslip angle is known or measured nevertheless because of the expensive measurement device and sensor noises the sideslip angle is not easy obtained in reality therefore the estimation methods of sideslip angle were developed the literature fossen et al 2015 designed an adaptive controller with integral guidance law and the unknown sideslip angle was compensated by the adaptive law yet the sideslip angle was regarded as unknown constant nevertheless the sideslip angle is time varying due to time varying external environment disturbance in view of this problem the los guidance method based on the predictor was proposed for underactuated msv s path following in liu et al 2016a where the predictor was used to compensate the time varying sideslip angle the reduced order extended state observer eso based los guidance method was employed to identify the time varying sideslip angle in liu et al 2016b and liu et al 2017 and the time varying sideslip angle was also estimated by the finite time sideslip observer in wang et al 2017 and wang et al 2018 but the influence of time varying ocean currents on the kinematic model was not considered in fossen et al 2015 liu et al 2016a liu et al 2016b liu et al 2017 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 another critical factor of the path following is the controller design and there are vast literatures regarding the path following controller all kinds of control approaches have been put into use such as pid control method calvo et al 2008 sliding mode control method fossen and lekkas 2017 backstepping control method fossen et al 2015 and neural network control method liu et al 2016c fuzzy logic system has been received more and more attentions due to its strong approximate capacity the adaptive fuzzy controller was designed for nonlinear systems in tong et al 2016 and tong and li 2017 where the fuzzy logic systems are employed to approximate the unknown nonlinear term the literature wang and meng 2016 proposed a novel direct adaptive fuzzy tracking control strategy with unknown parametric and uncertainties was presented for msv where the integrated nonlinearity function was estimated online by an adaptive fuzzy approximator in wang and sun 2019a the surge guidance law is created to guide surge and heading thereby adapting to path following errors to enhance robustness and flexibility the successive waypoints tracking of underactuated surface vehicle is solved by a novel model free guidance control integrated framework where the completely unknown dynamics and environment forces are estimated by finite time unknown observer wang and hamid 2019b and the yaw guided trajectory tracking control is designed for asymmetric underactuated surface vehicle in wang et al 2019c where the transformed uncertainties are also estimated by the finite time uncertainty observers in the aforementioned literatures the globally asymptotically stabilization of path tracking errors is achieved furthermore the surge heading guidance based finite time path following control scheme is created for the underactuated marine vehicle with complex unknowns achieving entire finite time path following performance with strong robustness wang et al 2019d however it should be noted that the effect of ocean currents on the kinematic model and the input saturation is not considered in the above works motivated by the above considerations this paper is devoted to design a new path following control scheme that can not only derive the desired heading angle but also deal with the unknown time varying ocean currents and unknown time varying large sideslip angle to solve the path following control problem for underactuated msv in the presence of model uncertainties external environment disturbances and input saturation in finite time firstly the fuzzy adaptive integral line of sight failos guidance method is established which can compensate the time varying ocean currents and estimate the time varying large sideslip angle simultaneously secondly the adaptive fuzzy finite time path following controllers are designed via backstepping technique finally the unknown lumped disturbances caused by the dynamic model uncertainties and the unknown environment disturbances are approximated by the adaptive fuzzy logic system in the control law the main contributions of the paper are summarized as follows 1 the fuzzy logic system and virtual control input are embedded simultaneously into the guidance law of the underactuated msv s path following control problem for the first time the proposed failos guidance law can not only calculate the desired heading angle but also compensate the time varying ocean currents and estimate time varying large sideslip angle 2 the proposed adaptive fuzzy finite time path following controllers can steer the vessel to follow the predefined path and ensure that path following errors can converge to a small neighborhood around origin in finite time and the closed loop control system are semi global practical finite time stable sgpfs to the best of authors knowledge so far nearly all the existing adaptive fuzzy control scheme cannot ensure the tracking error entering a small neighborhood around origin in finite time 3 the novel simple compensators are introduced into the adaptive fuzzy path following controllers which can not only handle the input saturation problem but also satisfy the finite time convergence requirement the rest of the paper is organized as follows the preliminary and the problem formation are introduced in section 2 section 3 derives the path following error dynamic of msv and section 4 formulates the failos guidance law of msv the adaptive fuzzy finite time path following controller design and stability

illustrates the path following control problem from the relative velocity profiles according to caharija 2012 the kinematic model of underactuated msv can be formulated on the basis of the relative surge and sway velocities as follows 9 x u r cos Ï v r sin Ï v x y u r sin Ï v r cos Ï v y Ï r where x y Ï denote surge position sway position and yaw angle of msv with respect to inertial frame u r v r r represent the relative surge velocity sway velocity and yaw angle velocity of msv with respect to water velocity and defined in the body fixed frame v x v y represent the time varying ocean current velocity about x y components expressed in inertial frame the ocean current velocity u c v c expressed in body frame satisfies the following relationship 10 u c v c t r t Ï v x v y t where r Ï cos Ï sin Ï sin Ï cos Ï is the rotation matrix from body frame to inertial frame and u r u u c v r v v c then taking into consideration the internal model uncertainties and external environmental disturbances the dynamic model of the underactuated msv can be modified as follows 11 u r f u r v r r d 11 m 11 u r Ï u d u v r x u r r y u r v r d v r f r u r v r r Ï r d r where f u

practice the control force and moment are limited to saturation nonlinearities due to the physical limitations of thrusters and can be described as follows 12 Ï i Ï i max i f Ï c i Ï i max Ï i c

ships by design caharija and pettersen 2012 3 path following error dynamic of msv the path following problem is depicted in fig 1 as follows the underactuated msv follows a predefined geometric curved path s p f Î¸ is the moving point on the given path with path parameter Î¸ to be followed and p is the center of mass of the msv associate with p f the corresponding serret frenet sf frame can be built 4 the origin of the sf frame is an arbitrary point p f Î¸ on the desired path i e virtual moving target the axes of which are tangent and normal to the desired path let x e y e denote the position coordinate of p in sf frame where the along track error x e denotes the distance from vessel to the desired position of the virtual target along the x axis of sf frame and the cross track error y e denotes the distance from vessel to the desired position of the virtual target along the y axis of sf frame the x axis of sf frame is rotated with an angle Ï f relative to the inertial frame given by Ï f atan 2 y f x f with f Î¸ Ï f is called the path course angle let the position of the msv denoted by p x y in inertial frame as illustrated in fig 1 and let the position and heading of the moving virtual target on the path denoted by p f x f y f in inertial frame the path following error vector p e f x e y e built in the sf frame can be written as 13 x e y e cos Ï f sin Ï f sin Ï f cos Ï f x x f y y f the position tracking error dynamic model in the sf frame is obtained as follows 14 x e y e u r cos Ï Ï f v r sin Ï Ï f Ï f y e Î¸ x f 2 y f 2 u c cos Î² c Ï f u r sin Ï Ï f v r cos Ï Ï f Ï f x e u c sin Î² c Ï f where Î² r a tan 2 v r u r is the relative sideslip angle Ï w Ï Î² r is the vehicle s course angle u c v x 2 v y 2 and Î² c a tan 2 v y v x in addition u r u r 2 v r 2 is the total velocity of the vehicle assumption 3 for the ocean currents affecting the kinematic model of msv there exists u max 0 such that v x and v y satisfy u c v x 2 v y 2 u max i e the time varying ocean currents are bounded it is necessary to mention that the relative sideslip angle Î² r is usually unknown in practice since the underactuated msv does not provide the sway control equipment the derivation between the heading and the course angle can contribute to the large tracking error under the influence of large sideslip angle fossen et al 2015 under such circumstance it is very vital to compensate for the large sideslip angle to gain the accurate path following performance based on the above considerations the path following control objective of this paper can be formulated as follows consider the underactuated msv model depicted by 9 and 11 with unknown lumped disturbances time varying large sideslip angle and time varying ocean currents the control objective is to design the guidance law for the desired yaw angle Ï d and the feedback control law for the force Ï u and the moment Ï r such that the vessel follow a predefined horizontal planar path and maintain a desired constant surge relative velocity u r d u min 0 while all the signals are guaranteed uniformly ultimately bounded in the closed loop control system 4 failos guidance law design as previously stated it is important to get good estimates of time varying ocean currents and the large sideslip angle for the sake of achieving accurate path following control in the presence of external disturbances and model uncertainties in this section the failos guidance law is designed and it can not only calculates the desired yaw angle but also estimates the time varying large sideslip angle as well as the time varying ocean currents the fuzzy system is first drawn into the guidance system to solve the underactuated msv path following control problem define the error vector Îµ e x e y e t and define the unknown time varying currents parameters to be estimated as Ï Ï x Ï y t where Ï x u c cos Î² c Ï f Ï y u c sin Î² c Ï f Ï is assumed to vary slowly that is to say there exists a positive constant c Ï such that Ï c Ï define Ï Ë Ï Ë x Ï Ë y t as the estimate of Ï and Ï Ï Ï Ë as the estimation error introducing the fuzzy logic system and virtual control input into the adaptive integral los guidance law the time varying large sideslip angle and time varying ocean currents are estimated simultaneously specifically the desired heading guidance law is designed as 15 Ï d Ï f arctan y e Î± e k e Î² r where k e 0 is called the look ahead distance in the guidance method Î± e is a virtual control input which can be designed to obtain integral action the virtual control input is not a physical control input but only a design variable used to shape the closed loop dynamic of the system and to add integral action for compensation of the time varying ocean currents disturbances since the time varying large sideslip angle is unknown the heading guidance law 15 is not available hence the fuzzy logic system is used to approximate the unknown time varying large sideslip angle i e 16 Î² r Î¸ 1 t Î¾ x e 1 x where Î¾ x is the fuzzy basis function with x x y Ï u r v r r t r 6 and e 1 x is the minimum approximation error Î¸ 1 is

high precision the norms Î¸ Ë 1 Î¸ Ë 2 Î¸ Ë 3 of fuzzy adaptive update law shown in fig 10 can converge to zero which indicates that the fuzzy adaptive update law is bounded therefore from the simulation results it is seen that the failos guidance law can estimate the time varying ocean currents and time varying large sideslip angle simultaneously and the adaptive fuzzy finite time path following controller can guarantee the vessel s tracking error converge the zero in finite time under the condition of input saturation moreover the proposed controller has ability of good robustness against unknown disturbance and model uncertainties 8 conclusion in this paper the adaptive fuzzy finite time path following controller based on the failos guidance law has been designed for msv exposed to the time varying ocean currents and time varying large sideslip angle the fuzzy logic system is introduced into the guidance law for the first time leading to failos guidance which can compensate the unknown time varying ocean currents and unknown time varying large sideslip angle simultaneously the attitude tracking controller and velocity tracking controller have been designed via the backstepping technique the unknown lumped disturbances are compensated by the fuzzy logic system it has been certified that the proposed adaptive fuzzy path following controller can maintain the vessel track the desired path at a desired constant surge relative velocity and tracking errors can converge to an arbitrarily small neighborhood around origin in finite time furthermore it has been proved that all signals in the closed loop control system are sgpfs by lyapunov function eventually simulation studies and comparisons have indicated the availability of the proposed control approach

2016 miao et al 2017 the path following control problem is defined as that designing controller such that the vessel reach and follow prescribed path independent of time fossen 2011 a pivotal factor of the path following control problem is the guidance law which attempts to obtain reference signal by addressing path information in order to design successive controller there are three kinds of typical guidance approaches line of sight los guidance pure pursuit pp guidance and constant bearing cb guidance fossen 2011 to be specific the los guidance method is a valid guidance algorithm and has been extensively applied in marine vessels to solve practical path following problem due to its simplicity and intuitiveness it mimics the experienced sailor to drive the vehicle approaching a point lying at constant distance ahead of the vessel along the prescribed path at the early stage fossen et al 2003 puts forward the traditional los guidance algorithm for the purpose of minimizing the cross track error between the marine craft and the predefined path the proportional los plos guidance method was put forward to follow the straight line path in pettersen and lefeber 2001 and fossen and pettersen 2014 in fossen and pettersen 2014 a sort of plos guidance law was used to demonstrate the uniform semiglobal exponential stability of vehicle s path following control in spite of the simplicity and effectiveness of the los guidance method it still has shortcoming when the vehicle suffers external environmental disturbances subsequently the integral action was brought into the los guidance method thus resulting in the integral line of sight ilos guidance law which was supposed to counter the drifting effect caused by the environment disturbances in bÃ¸rhaug et al 2008 and caharija et al 2016 and it was also used for straight line path following of the autonomous underwater vehicles caharija et al 2012a and caharija et al 2012b in lekkas and fossen 2014 the ilos guidance law encompassing time varying lookahead distance and sideslip angle was designed where this algorithm had ability of counteracting the effects of constant environment disturbances however the ocean currents as kinematic disturbances were regarded as constants and irrotational currents in previous works then the adaptive integral line of sight ailos guidance approach based direct and indirect nonlinear path following controllers were presented and the impactful compensation for time varying ocean currents was exhibited in fossen and lekkas 2017 similarly to fossen and lekkas 2017 the ailos guidance law was proposed for unmanned msv under the condition of uncertainties and input saturation in zheng and sun 2016 where the proposed guidance algorithm could compensate the time varying ocean currents it is worth noting that the guidance methods presented in bÃ¸rhaug et al 2008 caharija et al 2016 caharija et al 2012a caharija et al 2012b lekkas and fossen 2014 fossen and lekkas 2017 and zheng and sun 2016 had an effect on compensation for constant ocean currents or time varying ocean currents however these works come to the conclusion by assuming that the sideslip angle is known or measured nevertheless because of the expensive measurement device and sensor noises the sideslip angle is not easy obtained in reality therefore the estimation methods of sideslip angle were developed the literature fossen et al 2015 designed an adaptive controller with integral guidance law and the unknown sideslip angle was compensated by the adaptive law yet the sideslip angle was regarded as unknown constant nevertheless the sideslip angle is time varying due to time varying external environment disturbance in view of this problem the los guidance method based on the predictor was proposed for underactuated msv s path following in liu et al 2016a where the predictor was used to compensate the time varying sideslip angle the reduced order extended state observer eso based los guidance method was employed to identify the time varying sideslip angle in liu et al 2016b and liu et al 2017 and the time varying sideslip angle was also estimated by the finite time sideslip observer in wang et al 2017 and wang et al 2018 but the influence of time varying ocean currents on the kinematic model was not considered in fossen et al 2015 liu et al 2016a liu et al 2016b liu et al 2017 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 another critical factor of the path following is the controller design and there are vast literatures regarding the path following controller all kinds of control approaches have been put into use such as pid control method calvo et al 2008 sliding mode control method fossen and lekkas 2017 backstepping control method fossen et al 2015 and neural network control method liu et al 2016c fuzzy logic system has been received more and more attentions due to its strong approximate capacity the adaptive fuzzy controller was designed for nonlinear systems in tong et al 2016 and tong and li 2017 where the fuzzy logic systems are employed to approximate the unknown nonlinear term the literature wang and meng 2016 proposed a novel direct adaptive fuzzy tracking control strategy with unknown parametric and uncertainties was presented for msv where the integrated nonlinearity function was estimated online by an adaptive fuzzy approximator in wang and sun 2019a the surge guidance law is created to guide surge and heading thereby adapting to path following errors to enhance robustness and flexibility the successive waypoints tracking of underactuated surface vehicle is solved by a novel model free guidance control integrated framework where the completely unknown dynamics and environment forces are estimated by finite time unknown observer wang and hamid 2019b and the yaw guided trajectory tracking control is designed for asymmetric underactuated surface vehicle in wang et al 2019c where the transformed uncertainties are also estimated by the finite time uncertainty observers in the aforementioned literatures the globally asymptotically stabilization of path tracking errors is achieved furthermore the surge heading guidance based finite time path following control scheme is created for the underactuated marine vehicle with complex unknowns achieving entire finite time path following performance with strong robustness wang et al 2019d however it should be noted that the effect of ocean currents on the kinematic model and the input saturation is not considered in the above works motivated by the above considerations this paper is devoted to design a new path following control scheme that can not only derive the desired heading angle but also deal with the unknown time varying ocean currents and unknown time varying large sideslip angle to solve the path following control problem for underactuated msv in the presence of model uncertainties external environment disturbances and input saturation in finite time firstly the fuzzy adaptive integral line of sight failos guidance method is established which can compensate the time varying ocean currents and estimate the time varying large sideslip angle simultaneously secondly the adaptive fuzzy finite time path following controllers are designed via backstepping technique finally the unknown lumped disturbances caused by the dynamic model uncertainties and the unknown environment disturbances are approximated by the adaptive fuzzy logic system in the control law the main contributions of the paper are summarized as follows 1 the fuzzy logic system and virtual control input are embedded simultaneously into the guidance law of the underactuated msv s path following control problem for the first time the proposed failos guidance law can not only calculate the desired heading angle but also compensate the time varying ocean currents and estimate time varying large sideslip angle 2 the proposed adaptive fuzzy finite time path following controllers can steer the vessel to follow the predefined path and ensure that path following errors can converge to a small neighborhood around origin in finite time and the closed loop control system are semi global practical finite time stable sgpfs to the best of authors knowledge so far nearly all the existing adaptive fuzzy control scheme cannot ensure the tracking error entering a small neighborhood around origin in finite time 3 the novel simple compensators are introduced into the adaptive fuzzy path following controllers which can not only handle the input saturation problem but also satisfy the finite time convergence requirement the rest of the paper is organized as follows the preliminary and the problem formation are introduced in section 2 section 3 derives the path following error dynamic of msv and section 4 formulates the failos guidance law of msv the adaptive fuzzy finite time path following controller design and stability analysis are put forward for msv in section 5 and section 6 section 7 gives the simulation studies and comparisons to explain the effective of the proposed control method at last section 8 draws the

illustrates the path following control problem from the relative velocity profiles according to caharija 2012 the kinematic model of underactuated msv can be formulated on the basis of the relative surge and sway velocities as follows 9 x u r cos Ï v r sin Ï v x y u r sin Ï v r cos Ï v y Ï r where x y Ï denote surge position sway position and yaw angle of msv with respect to inertial frame u r v r r represent the relative surge velocity sway velocity and yaw angle velocity of msv with respect to water velocity and defined in the body fixed frame v x v y represent the time varying ocean current velocity about x y components expressed in inertial frame the ocean current velocity u c v c expressed in body frame satisfies the following relationship 10 u c v c t r t Ï v x v y t where r Ï cos Ï sin Ï sin Ï cos Ï is the rotation matrix from body frame to inertial frame and u r u u c v r v v c then taking into consideration the internal model uncertainties and external environmental disturbances the dynamic model of the underactuated msv can be modified as follows 11 u r f u r v r r d 11 m 11 u r Ï u d u v r x u r r y u r v r d v r f r u r v r r Ï r d r where f u

uncertainties and external environment disturbances which satisfies the following assumption Ï u Ï r represent the surge control force and yaw control moment by propeller and thruster system in practice the control force and moment are limited to saturation nonlinearities due to the physical limitations of thrusters and can be described as follows 12 Ï i Ï i max i f Ï c i Ï i max Ï i c i f Ï i min Ï i c Ï i max i u r Ï i min i f Ï c i Ï i min Ï u c and Ï r c are the commanded control force and moment assumption 1 for the unknown time varying lumped disturbances d j j u v r there exist positive constants d u d v d r such that d u d v and d r satisfy the following conditions d u d u d v d v d r d r i e the lumped disturbances are bounded assumption 2 the function y u r

ships by design caharija and pettersen 2012 3 path following error dynamic of msv the path following problem is depicted in fig 1 as follows the underactuated msv follows a predefined geometric curved path s p f Î¸ is the moving point on the given path with path parameter Î¸ to be followed and p is the center of mass of the msv associate with p f the corresponding serret frenet sf frame can be built 4 the origin of the sf frame is an arbitrary point p f Î¸ on the desired path i e virtual moving target the axes of which are tangent and normal to the desired path let x e y e denote the position coordinate of p in sf frame where the along track error x e denotes the distance from vessel to the desired position of the virtual target along the x axis of sf frame and the cross track error y e denotes the distance from vessel to the desired position of the virtual target along the y axis of sf frame the x axis of sf frame is rotated with an angle Ï f relative to the inertial frame given by Ï f atan 2 y f x f with f Î¸ Ï f is called the path course angle let the position of the msv denoted by p x y in inertial frame as illustrated in fig 1 and let the position and heading of the moving virtual target on the path denoted by p f x f y f in inertial frame the path following error vector p e f x e y e built in the sf frame can be written as 13 x e y e cos Ï f sin Ï f sin Ï f cos Ï f x x f y y f the position tracking error dynamic model in the sf frame is obtained as follows 14 x e y e u r cos Ï Ï f v r sin Ï Ï f Ï f y e Î¸ x f 2 y f 2 u c cos Î² c Ï f u r sin Ï Ï f v r cos Ï Ï f Ï f x e u c sin Î² c Ï f where Î² r a tan 2 v r u r is the relative sideslip angle Ï w Ï Î² r is the vehicle s course angle u c v x 2 v y 2 and Î² c a tan 2 v y v x in addition u r u r 2 v r 2 is the total velocity of the vehicle assumption 3 for the ocean currents affecting the kinematic model of msv there exists u max 0 such that v x and v y satisfy u c v x 2 v y 2 u max i e the time varying ocean currents are bounded it is necessary to mention that the relative sideslip angle Î² r is usually unknown in practice since the underactuated msv does not provide the sway control equipment the derivation between the heading and the course angle can contribute to the large tracking error under the influence of large sideslip angle fossen et al 2015 under such circumstance it is very vital to compensate for the large sideslip angle to gain the accurate path following performance based on the above considerations the path following control objective of this paper can be formulated as follows consider the underactuated msv model depicted by 9 and 11 with unknown lumped disturbances time varying large sideslip angle and time varying ocean currents the control objective is to design the guidance law for the desired yaw angle Ï d and the feedback control law for the force Ï u and the moment Ï r such that the vessel follow a predefined horizontal planar path and maintain a desired constant surge relative velocity u r d u min 0 while all the signals are guaranteed uniformly ultimately bounded in the closed loop control system 4 failos guidance law design as previously stated it is important to get good estimates of time varying ocean currents and the large sideslip angle for the sake of achieving accurate path following control in the presence of external disturbances and model uncertainties in this section the failos guidance law is designed and it can not only calculates the desired yaw angle but also estimates the time varying large sideslip angle as well as the time varying ocean currents the fuzzy system is first drawn into the guidance system to solve the underactuated msv path following control problem define the error vector Îµ e x e y e t and define the unknown time varying currents parameters to be estimated as Ï Ï x Ï y t where Ï x u c cos Î² c Ï f Ï y u c sin Î² c Ï f Ï is assumed to vary slowly that is to say there exists a positive constant c Ï such that Ï c Ï define Ï Ë Ï Ë x Ï Ë y t as the estimate of Ï and Ï Ï Ï Ë as the estimation error introducing the fuzzy logic system and virtual control input into the adaptive integral los guidance law the time varying large sideslip angle and time varying ocean currents are estimated simultaneously specifically the desired heading guidance law is designed as 15 Ï d Ï f arctan y e Î± e k e Î² r where k e 0 is called the look ahead distance in the guidance method Î± e is a virtual control input which can be designed to obtain integral action the virtual control input is not a physical control input but only a design variable used to shape the closed loop dynamic of the system and to add integral action for compensation of the time varying ocean currents disturbances since the time varying large sideslip angle is unknown the heading guidance law 15 is not available hence the fuzzy logic system is used to approximate the unknown time varying large sideslip angle i e 16 Î² r Î¸ 1 t Î¾ x e 1 x where Î¾ x is the fuzzy basis function with x x y Ï u r v r r t r 6 and e 1 x is the minimum approximation error Î¸ 1 is

figs 3 10 it is shown that all three guidance laws can drive the vehicle to reach the desired path yet the failos guidance law works well than other two guidance laws in fig 3 the along track error and cross track error can converge to zero by failos guidance law shown in fig 4 and the convergence effectiveness is better than ailos and slos guidance laws the cross track error converges to zero in about 60 s by ailos and sflos while the cross track error converges to zero in about 12 s by the proposed failos guidance law and oscillation is weaker it indicates that failos guidance law can deal with the time varying ocean currents and time varying sideslip angle simultaneously yet the other guidance laws can estimate either the time varying ocean currents or the time varying sideslip angle fig 5 and fig 6 demonstrate the performance of heading angle and velocities of msv and the actual surge velocity and heading angle can track corresponding reference signals produced by the failos guidance law the adaptive fuzzy finite time path following controllers Ï u Ï r based on failos guidance law do not exceed the saturation limited requirement shown in fig 7 and compared with the asymptotically convergent controllers based on the other two guidance laws the proposed controllers can converge in finite time it is shown from fig 8 that failos guidance law as the same as ailos guidance law can estimate the time varying ocean currents fig 9 shows the comparison of sideslip angle which demonstrates failos guidance law can estimate the time varying large sideslip angle with high precision the norms Î¸ Ë 1 Î¸ Ë 2 Î¸ Ë 3 of fuzzy adaptive update law shown in fig 10 can converge to zero which indicates that the fuzzy adaptive update law is bounded therefore from the simulation results it is seen that the failos guidance law can estimate the time varying ocean currents and time varying large sideslip angle simultaneously and the adaptive fuzzy finite time path following controller can guarantee the vessel s tracking error converge the zero in finite time under the condition of input saturation moreover the proposed controller has ability of good robustness against unknown disturbance and model uncertainties 8 conclusion in this paper the adaptive fuzzy finite time path following controller based on the failos guidance law has been designed for msv exposed to the time varying ocean currents and time varying large sideslip angle the fuzzy logic system is introduced into the guidance law for the first time leading to failos guidance which can compensate the unknown time varying ocean currents and unknown time varying large sideslip angle simultaneously the attitude tracking controller and velocity tracking controller have been designed via

an accelerometer was used to monitor the changes in the dynamic properties of an offshore wind turbine structure including natural frequency damping ratio and mode shape devriendt et al 2014 in addition wireless sensor networks with accelerometers were introduced to construct an shm system for monopile offshore wind turbines in order to identify the modal properties of the structure zhou et

purpose of the present study is to develop a multisensor data fusion based damage detection method using wireless smart sensors to identify structural damage occurring near the bottom of monopile offshore wind turbine structures a damage index is proposed using the power spectral density obtained from the combined use of accelerometers and gyroscopes a numerical model of a monopile offshore wind turbine structure is constructed to identify the relationship between the proposed damage index and the level of damage severity and to validate the index in addition this study develops a wireless system based on the imote2 sensor platform which embeds the damage detection algorithm and implements the multisensor data fusion method finally a laboratory scale experiment is conducted to validate the proposed system 2 multisensor data fusion based damage detection method this study considered structural damage occurring near the bottom of the monopile for following reasons 1 this part is vulnerable because it experiences the largest bending moment in the entire structure and 2 adverse changes in the foundation such as scouring erosion can be problematic devriendt et al 2014 the damage detection algorithm was developed by employing multisensor data fusion using two different measurements acceleration and angular velocity although acceleration has been widely used in shm to extract the structural modal properties the angular velocity measured with a gyroscope has not been commonly utilized in the field of shm owing to the relatively high equipment cost and low sensitivity however recent advances in mems technology have enabled the development low cost high sensitivity gyroscopes allowing viable access to angular velocity responses to assess the structural damage of a monopile structure this study developed a multisensor data fusion based damage index that is independent from external loading such as wind and wave forces when a beam type structure incurs damage at the bottom that affects the boundary condition the damage has different effects on dynamic responses in the horizontal and rotational directions thus an index defined by comparing the responses in both directions can reflect the occurrence of the near bottom damage the euler bernoulli cantilever beam with external forces shown in fig 1 includes parameters of stiffness ei length l tip mass m t rotational inertia i t and rotational stiffness k t the near bottom damage to the structure is assumed to be equivalent to that of a rotational spring model with a rotational stiffness k

velocity change under the damage at the bottom which changes the boundary conditions because the mode shapes of a structure represent the amplitudes of the structural responses the damage index also can be obtained in the frequency domain by using the power spectral densities of the angular velocity and the measured acceleration at the ith mode as defined in equation 15 15 Î± i x s g Ï i x s a Ï i x where Ï i is the ith natural frequency and s g and s a are the power spectral densities of angular velocity and acceleration respectively the normalized accumulated damage index Î³ is

structure 3 numerical simulation 3 1 simulation setup this study constructed a numerical model for a monopile offshore wind tower structure with lateral loadings from wind and waves based on the design specifications of the 5 mw wind turbine provided by the national renewable energy laboratory nrel in the united states fig 2 a detailed specification is shown in table 1 jonkman et al 2009 the 5 mw nrel wind turbine which has been widely used in analytical studies of offshore wind turbines katsanos et al 2017 is composed mainly of a monopile foundation tower rotor nacelle and shaft as well as blades katsanos et al 2017 the rotor nacelle assembly at the top was modeled with a concentrated tip mass of 251 2 tons 2 51 105 kg the monopile was modeled using 20 euler bernoulli beam elements in matlab and the structural damage was simulated by reducing the cross sectional area of the bottommost element down to 20 of the original value with a 5 interval this study assumes that wind force is acting on the tip mass at a height of 90 m and that wave loading has an influence on 15 beam elements of the numerical model from the bottom to the 67 5 m in height 3 2 simulation of lateral forces for the simulation of the thrust force acting upon the tip mass this study generates dynamic wind data using a turbulent wind simulator turbsim by nrel with a mean velocity of 20 m s in a 150 m 150 m plane considering both spatial and temporal turbulence effects jonkman et al 2009 acting on the tip mass of the wind turbine model the simulated wind data induces the thrust force shown in fig 3 using a dynamic response simulator fast jonkman et al 2009 to generate the dynamic wave force acting upon the monopile structure this study assumed that the ocean waves are propagating to the structure in a lateral direction the generalized wave load corresponding to the first mode shape of the target model is shown in equation 17 walton 1992 li et al 2003 zhang et al 2016 17 f w a v e t 0 h f x t Ï x d

research li et al 2003 zhang et al 2016 under external wind and wave loading the data fusion approach was used to implement damage detection using acceleration and angular velocity at three points of 30 60 and 90 m from the foundation fig 2 to consider the system randomness and uncertainty in the ocean environment 5 of root mean square rms noise was added to each response data set according to that reported in previous research park et al 2015b the typical time history responses from the accelerometer and the gyroscope at 90 m l3 are presented in fig 4 3 3 numerical results for damage index to validate the proposed damage index the normalized accumulated damage index Î³ was calculated on the basis of the simulated acceleration and angular velocity responses using equation 14 the mean values of Î³ obtained from 100 repeated simulations are plotted in fig 5 with respect to the damage severities i e from intact case to the 80 reduction in the sectional area of the monopile foundation this decrease in sectional area corresponds to the damage increment in the foundation and the increase in damage corresponds to an increase in Î³ the numerical results illustrated in fig 5 show that Î³ tended to increase monotonically with the increased damage in the foundation thus validating Î³ as a damage index for monopile offshore wind turbine structures 3 4 wireless smart sensor system with damage detection the wireless smart sensor system with on board data processing is composed of hardware for data acquisition from the multisensors in addition to embedded software for calculating the damage index this section introduces the hardware platform for wireless smart sensors and the embedded software for damage detection of monopile offshore wind turbine structures regarding bolt loosening problems 3 5 hardware platform memsic imote2 was selected as a hardware platform to develop the wireless smart sensor network incorporated with the developed damage detection index this platform has a enough computing performance large memory and reliable hardware and software fig 6 sim et al 2013 the mems gyroscopes and accelerometers were implemented in the wireless smart sensors to provide a cost effective multisensor platform for shm to measure the acceleration of the offshore wind turbine structure we selected an ism400 acceleration sensor board that consists of a three axis analog mems accelerometer lis344alh stmicroelectronics and an analog to digital converter adc with 16 bits and 4 channels qf4a512 quickfilter technologies fig 7 a the lis344alh accelerometer has an operating voltage of 2 4 v 3 6 v and a measurement range of 2 g with low power consumption the angular velocity of the wind powered structure was measured by using a gyroscope adxrs646 analog devices fig 7 b as an angular rate sensor the adxrs646 gyroscope can measure the z axis response with a measurement range of 250 s and low bias drift of 12 h 3 6 embedded software for damage detection the developed damage detection algorithm was embedded in the wireless smart sensor by using the illinois structural health monitoring project ishmp services toolsuite which is an open source software package based on imote2 sim et al 2013 the developed wireless smart sensor system consists of a base station a gateway node and leaf nodes the base station sends user input to the gateway node and receives the final processed data after all processing is completed the gateway node is connected to the base station and controls the sensor networks in the leaf nodes the leaf nodes imote2 with acceleration board and gyroscope contain functions for measuring the structural responses acceleration and angular velocity calculating the power spectral density psd and assessing the structural damage based on the developed damage index an operational flowchart of the developed wireless smart sensor system is presented in fig 8 when the initial user input is given to the gateway node the entire sensor network begins network wide time synchronization and subsequently conducts multisensor data acquisition when the synchronized data become available the leaf nodes begin to calculate the psd from the structural responses of these input parameters before calculating the damage index Î± which was previously defined in section 2 finally the gateway node receives the damage index calculated by each sensor through wireless communication 4 experimental validation 4 1 experimental setup a laboratory scale experiment was conducted to validate the proposed data fusion based damage detection method for monopile offshore wind turbine structures using a wireless smart sensor system the configurations of the test structure and sensor deployment are shown in fig 9 the test structure is a small scale steel monopile with a thickness of 20 mm height of 1 m and tip mass of 10 kg at 10 10 12 cm two wireless smart sensor nodes were installed on the tower at heights of 0 6 m and 0 9 m from the bottom respectively to assess the structural conditions against the external wind force the external wind load was generated in this study by using a fan the foundation of the offshore structure was secured fixed to the laboratory bench top using bolts fig 9 a considering that bolt loosening in segment joints causes damage in monopile wind turbine towers park et al 2015a nguyen et al 2019 the damage to the foundation was artificially inflicted in the present study by loosening the bolts the four damage cases of bolt loosening that most strongly affect the response to an external wind load are shown in fig 10 in the figure case 1 shows no damage and cases 2 to 4 show loosening of two four and six of the eight bolts respectively more loosening of the fixed bolts resulted in a greater degree of damage in the foundation of the offshore structure 4 2 finite element model of monopile structure in this study a finite element fe model of the monopile structure having the same dimensions as those of the laboratory scale structure shown in fig 9 was built by using abaqus to identify the effects of bolt loosening on the dynamic properties of the structure fig 11 the fe model was fixed to the bottom of the foundation by using eight bolts this study simulated the four damage cases of bolt loosening shown in fig 10 to examine the effects of different damage degrees on the structural modal properties because the largest amount of energy occurs in the immediate vicinity of the first natural frequency this study utilized the first mode to apply the proposed damage index to the structure the first natural frequency of the fe model was compared among four damage cases the structure with no damage at the bottom had a first natural frequency of 2 887 hz which decreased to 2 874 hz and 2 695 hz when two and six bolts were loosened respectively 4 3 damage detection of monopile structure to identify the modal properties prior to bolt loosening in the foundation this study conducted system identification of the test structure the first natural frequency of the structure was 2 881 hz fig 12 a which indicates 0 22 error compared with the fe model result its mode shape is represented in fig 12 b a series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the structural conditions using the proposed damage index under the incoming force caused by the fan the wireless smart sensor system measured the structural responses and calculated the damage index for each damage case five tests with the same experimental conditions were conducted to identify the structural damage the results are shown in fig 13 with regard to the average damage index Î± and the corresponding standard error from the five indices the value of Î± from both sensors gradually decreased with an increase in the damage severity when the boundary of the monopile structure experienced severe damage in the case of six loosened bolts the damage index showed a decline of approximately 14 0 from sensor 1 from 1 to 0 8599 and 8 7 from sensor 2 from 1 to 0 9133 although both sensors identified the damage in the structural foundation the responses of sensor 1 were more sensitive to the damage severity than those of sensor 2 because sensor 2 is located close to the heavy tip mass the response variation from this sensor was relatively less affected by the damage severity from the monopile foundation than that in the case of sensor 1 the natural frequency was lowered as the damage increased in severity the first natural frequencies in the cases of no damage two loose bolts and six loose bolts were 2 881 hz 2 832 hz and 2 686 hz respectively indicating respective differences of 0 22 1 49 and 0 32 compared with those of the fe model the results for the normalized accumulated damage index Î³ are indicated in fig 14 for each damage case as the mean index value from the five tests and corresponding standard error the Î³ value tended to increase according to the number of loose bolts with relatively small variation that in case 1 with no loosened bolts was a nonzero value owing to the uncertainties in the measurements caused by sensor noise as such the proposed damage index showed sufficient sensitivity to damage in the foundation of the monopole structure 5 conclusion and discussion the objective of this study was to present a multisensory data fusion based damage detection method using wireless smart sensors for shm of monopile offshore wind turbine structures the damage index was developed using multisensor data fusion of each power spectral density measured by an accelerometer and a gyroscope the developed damage index effectively identified the damage severity when the proposed damage detection method was applied to a numerical example of a 5 mw monopile wind turbine model provided by the nrel jonkman et al 2009 finally the multisensor data fusion based damage index was applied to a laboratory scale monopile wind turbine structure to assess the structural damage condition depending on different degrees of damage severity according to the results of numerical simulation and a laboratory scale experiment this study demonstrated that the first natural frequency of the monopile wind turbine structure was lowered as the foundation experienced increasing degrees of damage such as scouring erosion these results agreed well with those reported in a previous study zaaijer 2002 furthermore the damage index predicted by the multisensor data fusion based damage detection algorithm was negatively correlated with the actual level of damage severity which indicates that the proposed damage index is a valid indicator of the damage level in monopile offshore structures thus the proposed damage detection method using multisensor data fusion of acceleration and angular velocity can be considered an effective and practical method for detecting damage in monopile offshore wind structures although the findings of this study have important implications for maintaining offshore wind turbine structures the current investigation is limited because the validation was demonstrated only by numerical simulation and on lab scale monopile structures further studies with greater focus on the validation in real world offshore wind turbine structures are suggested to improve the multisensor data fusion based damage

purpose of the present study is to develop a multisensor data fusion based damage detection method using wireless smart sensors to identify structural damage occurring near the bottom of monopile offshore wind turbine structures a damage index is proposed using the power spectral density obtained from the combined use of accelerometers and gyroscopes a numerical model of a monopile offshore wind turbine structure is constructed to identify the relationship between the proposed damage index and the level of damage severity and to validate the index in addition this study develops a wireless system based on the imote2 sensor platform which embeds the damage detection algorithm and implements the multisensor data fusion method finally a laboratory scale experiment is conducted to validate the proposed system 2 multisensor data fusion based damage detection method this study considered structural damage occurring near the bottom of the monopile for following reasons 1 this part is vulnerable because it experiences the largest bending moment in the entire structure and 2 adverse changes in the foundation such as scouring erosion can be problematic devriendt et al 2014 the damage detection algorithm was developed by employing multisensor data fusion using two different measurements acceleration and angular velocity although acceleration has been widely used in shm to extract the structural modal properties the angular velocity measured with a gyroscope has not been commonly utilized in the field of shm owing to the relatively high equipment cost and low sensitivity however recent advances in mems technology have enabled the development low cost high sensitivity gyroscopes allowing viable access to angular velocity responses to assess the structural damage of a monopile structure this study developed a multisensor data fusion based damage index that is independent from external loading such as wind and wave forces when a beam type structure incurs damage at the bottom that affects the boundary condition the damage has different effects on dynamic responses in the horizontal and rotational directions thus an index defined by comparing the responses in both directions can reflect the occurrence of the near bottom damage the euler bernoulli cantilever beam with external forces shown in fig 1 includes parameters of stiffness ei length l tip mass m t rotational inertia i t and rotational stiffness k t the near bottom damage to the structure is assumed to be equivalent to that of a rotational spring model with a rotational stiffness k

structure 3 numerical simulation 3 1 simulation setup this study constructed a numerical model for a monopile offshore wind tower structure with lateral loadings from wind and waves based on the design specifications of the 5 mw wind turbine provided by the national renewable energy laboratory nrel in the united states fig 2 a detailed specification is shown in table 1 jonkman et al 2009 the 5 mw nrel wind turbine which has been widely used in analytical studies of offshore wind turbines katsanos et al 2017 is composed mainly of a monopile foundation tower rotor nacelle and shaft as well as blades katsanos et al 2017 the rotor nacelle assembly at the top was modeled with a concentrated tip mass of 251 2 tons 2 51 105 kg the monopile was modeled using 20 euler bernoulli beam elements in matlab and the structural damage was simulated by reducing the cross sectional area of the bottommost element down to 20 of the original value with a 5 interval this study assumes that wind force is acting on the tip mass at a height of 90 m and that wave loading has an influence on 15 beam elements of the numerical model from the bottom to the 67 5 m in height 3 2 simulation of lateral forces for the simulation of the thrust force acting upon the tip mass this study generates dynamic wind data using a turbulent wind simulator turbsim by nrel with a mean velocity of 20 m s in a 150 m 150 m plane considering both spatial and temporal turbulence effects jonkman et al 2009 acting on the tip mass of the wind turbine model the simulated wind data induces the thrust force shown in fig 3 using a dynamic response simulator fast jonkman et al 2009 to generate the dynamic wave force acting upon the monopile structure this study assumed that the ocean waves are propagating to the structure in a lateral direction the generalized wave load corresponding to the first mode shape of the target model is shown in equation 17 walton 1992 li et al 2003 zhang et al 2016 17 f w a v e t 0 h f x t Ï x d

research li et al 2003 zhang et al 2016 under external wind and wave loading the data fusion approach was used to implement damage detection using acceleration and angular velocity at three points of 30 60 and 90 m from the foundation fig 2 to consider the system randomness and uncertainty in the ocean environment 5 of root mean square rms noise was added to each response data set according to that reported in previous research park et al 2015b the typical time history responses from the accelerometer and the gyroscope at 90 m l3 are presented in fig 4 3 3 numerical results for damage index to validate the proposed damage index the normalized accumulated damage index Î³ was calculated on the basis of the simulated acceleration and angular velocity responses using equation 14 the mean values of Î³ obtained from 100 repeated simulations are plotted in fig 5 with respect to the damage severities i e from intact case to the 80 reduction in the sectional area of the monopile foundation this decrease in sectional area corresponds to the damage increment in the foundation and the increase in damage corresponds to an increase in Î³ the numerical results illustrated in fig 5 show that Î³ tended to increase monotonically with the increased damage in the foundation thus validating Î³ as a damage index for monopile offshore wind turbine structures 3 4 wireless smart sensor system with damage detection the wireless smart sensor system with on board data processing is composed of hardware for data acquisition from the multisensors in addition to embedded software for calculating the damage index this section introduces the hardware platform for wireless smart sensors and the embedded software for damage detection of monopile offshore wind turbine structures regarding bolt loosening problems 3 5 hardware platform memsic imote2 was selected as a hardware platform to develop the wireless smart sensor network incorporated with the developed damage detection index this platform has a enough computing performance large memory and reliable hardware and software fig 6 sim et al 2013 the mems gyroscopes and accelerometers were implemented in the wireless smart sensors to provide a cost effective multisensor platform for shm to measure the acceleration of the offshore wind turbine structure we selected an ism400 acceleration sensor board that consists of a three axis analog mems accelerometer lis344alh stmicroelectronics and an analog to digital converter adc with 16 bits and 4 channels qf4a512 quickfilter technologies fig 7 a the lis344alh accelerometer has an operating voltage of 2 4 v 3 6 v and a measurement range of 2 g with low power consumption the angular velocity of the wind powered structure was measured by using a gyroscope adxrs646 analog devices fig 7 b as an angular rate sensor the adxrs646 gyroscope can measure the z axis response with a measurement range of 250 s and low bias drift of 12 h 3 6 embedded software for damage detection the developed damage detection algorithm was embedded in the wireless smart sensor by using the illinois structural health monitoring project ishmp services toolsuite which is an open source software package based on imote2 sim et al 2013 the developed wireless smart sensor system consists of a base station a gateway node and leaf nodes the base station sends user input to the gateway node and receives the final processed data after all processing is completed the gateway node is connected to the base station and controls the sensor networks in the leaf nodes the leaf nodes imote2 with acceleration board and gyroscope contain functions for measuring the structural responses acceleration and angular velocity calculating the power spectral density psd and assessing the structural damage based on the developed damage index an operational flowchart of the developed wireless smart sensor system is presented in fig 8 when the initial user input is given to the gateway node the entire sensor network begins network wide time synchronization and subsequently conducts multisensor data acquisition when the synchronized data become available the leaf nodes begin to calculate the psd from the structural responses of these input parameters before calculating the damage index Î± which was previously defined in section 2 finally the gateway node receives the damage index calculated by each sensor through wireless communication 4 experimental validation 4 1 experimental setup a laboratory scale experiment was conducted to validate the proposed data fusion based damage detection method for monopile offshore wind turbine structures using a wireless smart sensor system the configurations of the test structure and sensor deployment are shown in fig 9 the test structure is a small scale steel monopile with a thickness of 20 mm height of 1 m and tip mass of 10 kg at 10 10 12 cm two wireless smart sensor nodes were installed on the tower at heights of 0 6 m and 0 9 m from the bottom respectively to assess the structural conditions against the external wind force the external wind load was generated in this study by using a fan the foundation of the offshore structure was secured fixed to the laboratory bench top using bolts fig 9 a considering that bolt loosening in segment joints causes damage in monopile wind turbine towers park et al 2015a nguyen et al 2019 the damage to the foundation was artificially inflicted in the present study by loosening the bolts the four damage cases of bolt loosening that most strongly affect the response to an external wind load are shown in fig 10 in the figure case 1 shows no damage and cases 2 to 4 show loosening of two four and six of the eight bolts respectively more loosening of the fixed bolts resulted in a greater degree of damage in the foundation of the offshore structure 4 2 finite element model of monopile structure in this study a finite element fe model of the monopile structure having the same dimensions as those of the laboratory scale structure shown in fig 9 was built by using abaqus to identify the effects of bolt loosening on the dynamic properties of the structure fig 11 the fe model was fixed to the bottom of the foundation by using eight bolts this study simulated the four damage cases of bolt loosening shown in fig 10 to examine the effects of different damage degrees on the structural modal properties because the largest amount of energy occurs in the immediate vicinity of the first natural frequency this study utilized the first mode to apply the proposed damage index to the structure the first natural frequency of the fe model was compared among four damage cases the structure with no damage at the bottom had a first natural frequency of 2 887 hz which decreased to 2 874 hz and 2 695 hz when two and six bolts were loosened respectively 4 3 damage detection of monopile structure to identify the modal properties prior to bolt loosening in the foundation this study conducted system identification of the test structure the first natural frequency of the structure was 2 881 hz fig 12 a which indicates 0 22 error compared with the fe model result its mode shape is represented in fig 12 b a series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the structural conditions using the proposed damage index under the incoming force caused by the fan the wireless smart sensor system measured the structural responses and calculated the damage index for each damage case five tests with the same experimental conditions were conducted to identify the structural damage the results are shown in fig 13 with regard to the average damage index Î± and the corresponding standard error from the five indices the value of Î± from both sensors gradually decreased with an increase in the damage severity when the boundary of the monopile structure experienced severe damage in the case of six loosened bolts the damage index showed a decline of approximately 14 0 from sensor 1 from 1 to 0 8599 and 8 7 from sensor 2 from 1 to 0 9133 although both sensors identified the damage in the structural foundation the responses of sensor 1 were more sensitive to the damage severity than those of sensor 2 because sensor 2 is located close to the heavy tip mass the response variation from this sensor was relatively less affected by the damage severity from the monopile foundation than that in the case of sensor 1 the natural frequency was lowered as the damage increased in severity the first natural frequencies in the cases of no damage two loose bolts and six loose bolts were 2 881 hz 2 832 hz and 2 686 hz respectively indicating respective differences of 0 22 1 49 and 0 32 compared with those of the fe model the results for the normalized accumulated damage index Î³ are indicated in fig 14 for each damage case as the mean index value from the five tests and corresponding standard error the Î³ value tended to increase according to the number of loose bolts with relatively small variation that in case 1 with no loosened bolts was a nonzero value owing to the uncertainties in the measurements caused by sensor noise as such the proposed damage index showed sufficient sensitivity to damage in the foundation of the monopole structure 5 conclusion and discussion the objective of this study was to present a multisensory data fusion based damage detection method using wireless smart sensors for shm of monopile offshore wind turbine structures the damage index was developed using multisensor data fusion of each power spectral density measured by an accelerometer and a gyroscope the developed damage index effectively identified the damage severity when the proposed damage detection method was applied to a numerical example of a 5 mw monopile wind turbine model provided by the nrel jonkman et al 2009 finally the multisensor data fusion based damage index was applied to a laboratory scale monopile wind turbine structure to assess the structural damage condition depending on different degrees of damage severity according to the results of numerical simulation and a laboratory scale experiment this study demonstrated that the first natural frequency of the monopile wind turbine structure was lowered as the foundation experienced increasing degrees of damage such as scouring erosion these results agreed well with those reported in a previous study zaaijer 2002 furthermore the damage index predicted by the multisensor data fusion based damage detection algorithm was negatively correlated with the actual level of damage severity which indicates that the proposed damage index is a valid indicator of the damage level in monopile offshore structures thus the proposed damage detection method using multisensor data fusion of acceleration and angular velocity can be considered an effective and practical method for detecting damage in monopile offshore wind structures although the findings of this study have important implications for maintaining offshore wind turbine structures the current investigation is limited because the validation was demonstrated only by numerical simulation and on lab scale monopile structures further studies with greater focus on the validation in real world offshore wind turbine structures are suggested to improve the multisensor data fusion based damage

22289,the present study describes an experimental and numerical investigation on the horizontal and vertical hydrodynamic forces given by solitary waves on horizontal circular cylinders placed near a rigid horizontal bed the experimental campaign was conducted in the wave channel of the university of calabria in which twelve pressure sensors were installed along the external surface of a cylinder located at gap to diameter ratios equal to 0 25 and 0 1 the numerical modeling was carried out using the open source olaflow model based on the openfoam solver in order to simulate the wave forces also extending the range of experiments the resulting force field was defined by the dominance of the horizontal inertia force along the flow direction and by the lift force along the transversal one the values of the hydrodynamic forces and the free stream kinematics were adopted to calibrate the hydrodynamic coefficients drag lift and horizontal and vertical inertia involved in the morison formula and in a proposed version of the transverse equation through the use of the weighted least square approach for practical aims semi analytical relationships to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients as a function of wave amplitude and water depth are presented keywords tsunami like solitary waves horizontal circular cylinders wave loads experimental campaign olaflow morison and modified transverse schemes 1 introduction tsunamis are very long waves that are principally generated by earthquakes landslides or volcanic eruptions and propagate with high celerity across the ocean for long distances tsunami waves have an enormous energy indeed they can penetrate inland for a long distance erode sediments from the seafloor cause loss of life and produce damages to coastal infrastructures e g imamura et al 2006 di risio et al 2009 mori et al 2011 with reference to the important occurrences in the indian ocean and east japan the shape of tsunami like waves was observed to be different from the solitary one e g schimmels et al 2016 qu et al 2017 however the magnitude and the shape of tsunamis prove to be dependent on the local conditions of the seismic event as a result it is difficult to furnish a general modeling of tsunami waves due to its suitable and easy approach the solitary wave theory is still used today as a reference for the studying of tsunami properties and their interaction with coasts e g monaghan and kos 1999 liang et al 2013 and structures e g lynett et al 2000 huang and dong 2001 hsiao and lin 2010 from numerical and experimental viewpoints horizontal circular cylinders are marine structures widely adopted for the transportation of water oil gas and cables they are also used for the submarine passage of vehicles and trains owing to their diffusion in the world the knowledge of the horizontal and vertical hydrodynamic forces for stability aims is fundamental the approach to calculate the hydrodynamic loads is different as a function of the size of the cylindrical structure indeed if the structure is small compared to the wave length the morison equation morison et al 1950 is applicable for the calculation of horizontal force in which the total force is given by inertia and drag components and the transverse equation see e g cheong et al 1989 is usually suitable for the vertical one and given by the superimposition of inertia and lift components whereas if the size of the structure is comparable to the wave length the wave loads on the structure are usually calculated by the diffraction theory e g boccotti 2000 to better understand the features of the force components the mentioned distinction can be also viewed in terms of keulegan carpenter number k c indeed for low k c the wave forces are inertial while for large k c drag and lift components contribute to model the resulting horizontal and vertical loads see e g sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 sumer and fredsoe 2006 in the latter regime several works on the knowledge of hydrodynamic loads on horizontal cylinders induced by wind waves and or currents at various water depths were performed e g sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 chaplin and subbiah 1997 sumer and fredsoe 2006 aristodemo et al 2011 alfonsi et al 2012 aristodemo et al 2013 studies related to the interaction between solitary waves and these kinds of structures are scarce and have shown some limitations specifically sibley et al 1982 experimentally generated a tsunami like solitary wave by a manual structure moved horizontally in the flume with a result of a large scattering of the hydrodynamic force coefficients chian and ertekin 1992 analyzed by a boundary element method the hydrodynamic loads in just one case paying particular attention to the free surface profiles and the particle velocities near the cylinder moreover the above researches limited the attention to only horizontal forces and the positions of the cylinder were far from the bottom where instead the lift force plays a significant role in the modeling of vertical forces through extensive experimental investigations and the use of numerical approaches aristodemo et al 2017 and tripepi et al 2018 have recently modeled this physical process for horizontal cylinders placed respectively at half water depth and at the bottom considering both horizontal and vertical hydrodynamic forces in the above studies the horizontal force field was characterized by the inertia contribution and the vertical one by the inertia component in the case of half water depth and by the lift component in the case of bottom mounted cylinder hydrodynamic coefficients vs non dimensional wave amplitude have been furnished to be inserted in practical formulas morison et al 1950 cheong et al 1989 for engineering applications here a novel two dimensional laboratory and numerical modeling are presented for submerged horizontal cylinders placed near a rigid horizontal bed and addressed to analyze the features of the solitary wave induced horizontal and vertical hydrodynamic forces attention is focused on the time series of the wave forces on the force peaks and on fast tools based on the application of semi empirical formulas to evaluate the wave forces in the present research we consider for the first time horizontal cylinders located near the bed in particular the structures were placed at e d 0 25 and 0 1 where e is the gap between the cylinder and the bed and d is the diameter of the cylinder the present study is defined by non dimensional wave amplitudes a d ranging from approximately 0 05 to 0 25 reynolds numbers r e ranging from 1 74 104 to 3 64 104 and k c ranging from 4 35 to 7 95 where a is the wave amplitude and d is the water depth the resulting force field was characterized by the dominance of the inertia contribution in the in line direction and of the lift force in the transverse direction experimental tests were conducted in the wave channel of the gmi laboratory at the university of calabria a battery of pressure sensors was mounted at the external surface of the fixed cylinder in order to calculate the hydrodynamic loads and a wave gauge was placed at the vertical section of the cylinder to measure the free surface elevation and determine the undisturbed kinematic field at the transversal axis of the cylinder owing to its easy and practical use the open source olaflow numerical model higuera et al 2015 based on the well known openfoam solver and applied to analyze ocean and coastal engineering problems e g higuera et al 2018 stagonas et al 2018 was used to simulate the wave forces the application of this eulerian solver was also due to the reasonable computational time to perform simulations if compared to other numerical approaches such as the lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph model adopted in a previous work by aristodemo et al 2017 in particular the mean cpu time cost needed to run olaflow is about 1 10 of the time iteration cost using sph the numerical results given by the olaflow solver were validated through the experimental data in terms of surface elevation free stream kinematic field and wave loads and adopted to calibrate the hydrodynamic coefficients i e drag lift and horizontal and vertical inertia in the morison scheme morison et al 1950 and in a modified version of the transverse scheme in order to provide a practical engineering tool for the stability of horizontal cylinders placed near the sea bed in zones subjected to a seismic risk the modified transverse scheme was carried out to accurately assess the observed phase shifts and the peaks in the time series of the vertical wave loads in this context ordinary and weighted least square techniques e g wolfram and naghipour 1999 were applied to minimize the discrepancies between laboratory and numerical hydrodynamic forces and those linked to the application of the above semi empirical schemes the article is organized as follows the used solitary wave theory is recalled in section 2 the laboratory tests in a wave channel to determine the solitary wave induced forces at cylinders near the bottom are described in section 3 afterwards the olaflow model is recalled in section 4 the morison and the modified transverse equations are illustrated in section 5 the experimental and numerical results on the characteristics of the wave forces as well as the calculation of the force coefficients and the application of the semi empirical formulas to discover the single features of the drag inertia and lift force components are described in section 6 2 solitary wave theory the solitary wave can be taken as the leading wave of a tsunami occurrence this wave is represented as a single elevation of water above the undisturbed water level which propagates without changing its shape in a plane channel boussinesq 1871 and rayleigh 1876 showed that the surface elevation Î· is equal to 1 Î· t a s e c h 2 Î³ c t 2 where Î³ represents the outskirts decay coefficient and c is the wave celerity following the widely adopted rayleigh s formulation rayleigh 1876 the Î³ coefficient is evaluated as 2 Î³ 2 3 a 4 d 2 a d while the celerity is equal to 3 c g a d moreover the Î³ coefficient is related to the wave number k through the following relationship 4 Î³ 2 k the length of a solitary wave is theoretically infinite so it is necessary to define an apparent wave length l 2Ï k the above length is here defined as the distance between the points at which the surface elevation is at 1 of its peak above the still water level e g dingemans 1997 in this context an apparent wave period is then given by t l c the first studies where the solitary wave was generated using a piston type wavemaker were performed by goring 1978 from the mathematical viewpoint the relationship between the paddle velocity and the mean horizontal velocity of the wave is expressed as 5 d x d t u x t where x is the paddle displacement and u is the average velocity over the depth rearranging eq 5 after a change of variables from x t to Î¸ c t x t the result is 6 d x d Î¸ u Î¸ x c u Î¸ x according to the boussinesq 1871 and rayleigh 1876 solitary wave theory the depth averaged horizontal velocity has the form 7 u Î¸ c Î· Î¸ d Î· Î¸ integrating eq 6 with eqs 1 and 7 the horizontal movement of the piston type wavemaker to develop a solitary wave in a flume follows the implicit expression guizien and barthÃ©lemy 2002 8 x t 2 a Î² d t a n h Î³ c t x t 2 following the adopted rayleigh s approach the horizontal movement of the wavemaker can be also solved in an explicit form even if limited to small displacements e g guizien and barthÃ©lemy 2002 the free stream kinematic field i e horizontal velocity and horizontal and vertical acceleration at the transversal axis of the cylinder is useful to calculate the wave forces using semi empirical equations following lee et al 1982 the variations of horizontal u and vertical v velocity along the water depth induced by a solitary wave take the form 9 u t c a d 3 a d 2 1 6 1 2 z d 2 Î· t a a d 2 7 4 9 4 z d 2 Î· t a 2 v t c 3 a d z d Î· t a t a n h 3 a 4 d c t d 1 a 2 d 1 7 Î· t a z d 2 1 3 Î· t a where z represents the vertical coordinate considered starting from the bottom the second order solution furnished by equation 9 yields a small variation of u and v along the depth as noticed by the present experimental tests and numerical simulations the resulting relative water depth d l refers to intermediate waters close to shallow ones 3 laboratory experiments an extensive experimental campaign was carried out in the wave flume of the gmi laboratory at the department of civil engineering of the university of calabria the channel measures 41 m in length 1 m in width and 1 2 m in depth and is provided with a piston type wavemaker in fig 1 the longitudinal profile of the experimental apparatus is sketched in order to measure the instantaneous water surface elevation a resistant type wave gauge was located in correspondence of the vertical axis of the cylinder and another one 0 2 m before this section the physical model of the horizontal circular cylinder with diameter d 0 127 m was fixed at about 9 m from the wavemaker special supports were used at the edges of the cylinder to ensure there was no movement a number of 12 pressure sensors pdcr1830 model by druck were mounted on the surface of the cylinder at 30 intervals the sensors were staggered along the longitudinal axis in the central part of the cylinder this placement of the transducers was possible because these experiments are characterized by a 2d physical process a front and side view of the horizontal structure in the two gap to diameter ratios considered and the position of the pressure sensors at the cylinder is highlighted in fig 2 the values of the dynamic pressures Î´ p were determined through the pressure records and assumed constant along the influence areas in order to determine the laboratory load components consequently the horizontal f h and vertical f v hydrodynamic forces were calculated as a function of the position of the

piston tripepi et al 2017 the water depth d is constant for all the tests and was fixed at 0 4 m the tests were carried out with two depths of the cylinder so that the gap to diameter ratio assumed the values of e d 0 25 and 0 1 a set of 57 different experimental tests at increasing wave amplitude was carried out by changing the horizontal motion law of the piston type wavemaker in the possible

velocity in correspondence of the cylinder centre and Î½ is the kinematic viscosity the related depth is linked to intermediate water depth conditions allowing the use of eq 9 to represent the free stream kinematic field at the cylinder the value of a d as carried out in different works in literature e g filianoti and di risio 2012 seiffert et al 2014 sun et al 2015 will be taken as characteristic quantity to assess the characteristics of the wave loads and the hydrodynamic coefficients if compared to r e and k c in particular the k c number widely used to describe the flow field near the cylinder under regular and irregular waves sumer and fredsoe 2006 depends here on the arbitrary finite value of t and for this reason the authors preferred to consider the dimensionless wave amplitude it can be noticed that the range of the involved physical quantities refers to small scale experiments with approximate froude scale of 1 40 this leads to real conditions characterized by leading waves of tsunamis with amplitudes up to about 3 m and periods up to 27 s propagating on a water depth of 16 m and acting a circular cylinder with a diameter of about 5 m its size is comparable with an underwater tunnel which however can be here classified as small body since k c 4 and d l 0 2 see e g sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 4 olaflow model olaflow is a free and open source numerical model which uses the latest advances in the simulation of wave dynamics to the openfoam and foam extend communities the model allows the generation and absorbtion of water waves and the simulation of their interaction with coastal structures olaflow is the development of the two previous versions ihfoam and olafoam see e g higuera et al 2013 this project is a continuation of work by higuera et al 2014 and has overcome limitations and errors in the original openfoam code the authors in this new version added new functionalities increasing the performance of the solver such as the generation of waves and currents simultaneously and the reproduction of multi paddle piston or flap type wave generators including the active wave absorption in the present paper the adopted new functionality in olaflow refers to the generation of the solitary wave indeed the solitary wave is generated by moving the left solid boundary of the numerical flume using the horizontal displacement given by eq 8 as performed experimentally 4 1 navier stokes equations the olaflow cfd suite solves the three dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans these equations are solved using a volume of fluid vof technique through a finite volume discretization under the assumption of incompressible fluid the evolution of the flow field is described by the continuity and momentum conservation equations that are written in the following form higuera et al 2015 12 u 0 13 u t Ï u u Î¼ e f f u p g x Ï u Î¼ e f f Ï Îº Î± where u is the velocity vector Ï is the density g is the gravity acceleration x is the position vector p is the pseudodynamic pressure and Î¼ e f f is the efficient dynamic viscosity which takes into account the dynamic viscosity Î¼ and the turbulence effects as follows 14 Î¼ e f f Î¼ Ï Î½ t where Î½ t is the turbulent kinetic viscosity evaluated as 15 Î½ t c Î¼ k 2 Îµ where c Î¼ is a coefficient set equal to 0 09 k is the turbulent kinetic energy and Îµ is the turbulent dissipation rate see for more details launder and spalding 1974 the last term of the equation represents the effect of surface tension where Ï is the surface tension coefficient and set equal to 0 07 n m Îº is the curvature of the interface and Î± is the indicator function defined as the quantity of water per unit of volume at each cell the last parameter Î± is considered equal to 1 in this work since one phase flow i e water is involved to study the present physical process the eqs 12 and 13 are solved with a two step method predictor corrector scheme the turbulence effects are accounted in the equations as an additional eddy viscosity olaflow permits the use of different turbulence models in this study the simulations were performed using a k Îµ model which is one of the most widely used in cfd e g higuera et al 2013 xiao et al 2013 5 semi empirical equations 5 1 morison equation the morison equation morison et al 1950 is a widely adopted semi analytical method for calculating the horizontal force induced by any type of external oscillatory flows on cylinders the horizontal force f h is calculated considering two components the former one refers to a drag force f d given by the resistance of an object to the external flow motion the latter one is due to an inertia component f h i related to the occurrence of a time variation of the ambient horizontal velocity at the cylinder the horizontal force is then equal to 16 f h t f d t f h i t 1 2 Ï d c d u t u t Ï 4 d 2 Ï c m h a h t being c d and c m h the drag and the horizontal inertia coefficient while u and a h are the free stream horizontal velocity and acceleration at the cylinder respectively 5 2 transverse equation the estimate of the vertical load f v similarly to the morison equation can be carried out by the transverse scheme e g cheong et al 1989 this semi empirical approach permits for determining f v as the linear combination of a lift force f l generated by an asymmetric pressure field on the external surface of the cylinder and an inertia force f v i depending on the time variation of the ambient vertical velocity at the cylinder in its general form the transverse scheme is given by 17 f v t f l t f v i t 1 2 Ï d c l u t 2 Ï 4 d 2 Ï c m v a v t being c l and c m v the lift and the vertical inertia coefficient while a v is the ambient vertical acceleration at the cylinder historically the transverse forces are more strongly affected than the horizontal ones by the formation and shedding of vortices close to a cylindrical structure e g verley 1982 bearman et al 1984 in particular the original form of the lift component did not model the forward phase shift and the peak in the observed experimental and numerical time series of the vertical loads in this context a new form of the lift force is proposed which takes the following form 18 f l t 1 2 Ï d c l u t t s 2 where t s is a time interval between the occurrence of the wave crest and that related to the peak of the observed vertical force this time shift is defined by the expression 19 t s t Ï 2 Ï where the phase angle Ï depends on the wave amplitude and water depth and on the calibration of empirical parameters as successively shown in section 6 3 it can be noticed that the ambient kinematic field in the semi analytical formulas has been deduced from system 9 as a function of the numerical and experimental values of Î· 6 results the hydrodynamic loads on the circular cylinder at two gap to diameter ratios will be assessed on the basis of the experimental and olaflow results afterwards the validated numerical values of the free stream velocity and acceleration at the transversal axis of the cylinder in conjunction with the hydrodynamic forces will be used to determine the force coefficients in the morison and the modified transverse equation the length of the numerical flume is set to 12 m in order to avoid the occurrence of unwanted reflected wave at the cylinder the longitudinal spatial resolution Î´ x changes as a function of the distance with respect to the cylinder position at the ends of the mesh grid this value is equal to 2 cm while near the cylinder it is 2 mm regarding the vertical spatial resolution the value of Î´ z is always 2 mm the refinement of the mesh grid near the cylinder was necessary to obtain an accurate solution of the incident flow field and the hydrodynamic forces the change of the spatial resolution is step by step in the transition zones the numerical convergence of the model was checked by changing the spatial resolution and the above values of Î´ x and Î´ z gave satisfactory results in comparison with the experimental ones a sketch of mesh grid using olaflow with all the distances and the spatial resolutions is shown in fig 3 for a total time of 10 s the olaflow simulations take a cpu time of about 6 h through a 3 7 ghz intel r xeon r e5 1620 core v2 with 8 gb ram 6 1 incoming flow field the accuracy of the incoming flow field is first inspected with regard to the free surface elevation at the vertical axis of the cylinder fig 4 displays for the representative laboratory test 28a see table 1 the comparison between the analytical solution given by eq 1 and the experimental and numerical values of Î· the notable agreement between the different approaches is clear the trailing waves always present in the propagation of the solitary waves in the channel see e g aristodemo et al 2017 are very low and fall within the critical value i e 5 of the maximum surface elevation as indicated by guizien and barthÃ©lemy 2002 for the same experimental test 28a fig 5 highlights the comparison between the analytical solution laboratory tests and olaflow referred to the time evolution of the ambient horizontal velocity and horizontal and vertical acceleration at the cylinder centre on the basis of the variation of Î· see fig 4 and the vertical position of the cylinder z the values of u are evaluated by the application of eq 9 whilst the ambient acceleration field i e a h and a v is deduced from u and v the time history of these physical quantities is highlighted to understand the resulting characteristics of the experimental and numerical hydrodynamic forces and how u a h and a v affect the different force components by the use of the semi analytical formulas the good accordance among the different approaches on the incoming flow field allows the use of the undisturbed kinematic field to determine the force coefficients in the morison and the modified transverse equations 6 2 hydrodynamic forces in this section the experimental and numerical wave forces will be compared and assessed in particular the comparison between experiments and olaflow in the cases of e d 0 25 and 0 1 will be presented firstly the time evolutions of the hydrodynamic forces at the horizontal cylinder from the experimental and numerical results in the case where e d 0 25 are illustrated a comparison between the experimental and olaflow forces is shown in fig 6 for two representative test cases see table 1 tests 7a and 28a the difference between laboratory tests and olaflow is very small on the maximum values of f h and f v and the associated phase shifts some differences appear for the lower negative peaks of the wave forces particularly for the vertical ones the maximum value of f h is higher than that related to f v although in the greater wave attack this difference is less evident see fig 6c and d the time instant of the solitary wave crest at the cylinder section highlighted in fig 6 by a vertical dashed black line occurs after the maximum value of f h this depends on the coupled contribution of the inertia force component proportional to the horizontal acceleration and the drag one proportional to the horizontal velocity at the same time the shape of f v resembles that related to the lift force and then to the horizontal velocity the above aspects will be accurately investigated in section 6 3 where the contribution of the single force components will be illustrated it can be also noticed that the maximum vertical load is forward shifted with respect to the passage of the wave crest at the vertical section of the cylinder the comparisons between the time evolutions of f h and f v at the horizontal cylinder from the laboratory experiments and olaflow numerical simulations in the case where e d 0 1 are plotted in fig 7 for the representative tests 6b and 29b in general the correspondence between the experimental and numerical values is satisfactory the horizontal force changes its magnitude in a similar way to the previous case with e d 0 25 indeed the largest positive peak is back shifted with respect to the occurrence of the wave crest at the cylinder the maximum peak of the vertical force is slightly forward shifted with respect to the maximum surface elevation and this effect is less pronounced than the case with e d 0 25 for test 6b the maximum horizontal peak is higher than the vertical one see fig 7a and b while for test 29b i e the higher wave attack an inverse condition appears see fig 7c and d if compared to the case with e d 0 25 the negative peak of f h is higher in magnitude and the two negative peaks of f v are lower in magnitude concerning the comparison with other ratios adopted in previous papers aristodemo et al 2017 tripepi et al 2018 it can be observed as in the present two ratios that the resulting horizontal force was strongly influenced by the inertia component both for e d 1 and 0 with reference to the vertical force for e d 1 and 0 different features can be observed if compared to e d 0 25 and 0 1 because of the relevant contribution of the vertical inertia force a double positive peak and a higher negative one was observed for e d 1 while a unique positive peak was noticed for e d 0 due to the significant weight of the lift load moreover the weight of the vertical force compared to the horizontal one was weak for e d 1 and significant when e d 0 the comparisons for the whole dataset linked to e d 0 25 and 0 1 in terms of highest positive and negative horizontal forces f h m a x p and f h m a x n and vertical ones f v m a x p and f v m a x n vs a d are respectively illustrated in figs 8 and 9 the force peaks are divided by the maximum peak of the horizontal force f h m a x figs 8a and 9a and the maximum peak of the vertical force f v m a x considering the overall dataset figs 8b and 9b in figs 8 and 9 a general correspondence between experiments and olaflow can be highlighted in particular a small difference can be noticed for the negative peaks of the horizontal load regarding the vertical peaks the differences between experiments and simulations are less evident if compared to the horizontal ones for the involved two depths of the cylinder the horizontal and vertical force peaks increase with the increasing of the wave amplitude in particular this effect is more evident for higher wave amplitudes in the studied range of a d the value of f h m a x p shows for e d 0 25 a general growth of 63 and f h m a x n of 62 while f v m a x p and f v m a x n also increase of about 77 and 73 respectively the weight of f v m a x p in respect of f h m a x p as shown in fig 8c ranges between 40 and 100 i e f h m a x p about equal to f v m a x p for the greater wave attacks for e d 0 1 the value of f h m a x p shows an increase of 61 and f h m a x n of 51 whilst f v m a x p and f v m a x n also growth of about 71 and 57 respectively fig 9c highlights the contribution of the horizontal force in relation to the vertical one for this specific depth it can be observed that the maximum vertical forces are greater than the horizontal ones for the higher wave amplitudes a d 0 125 while they are lower for a d 0 125 as noticeable in fig 8a and b and in fig 9a and b the vertical force peaks increase proportionally more than those related to the horizontal ones the reason that causes this increasing trend as a function of a d can be explained through the analysis of the single force components described successively in section 6 4 indeed the horizontal inertia force tends to decrease more quickly than the lift one when a d increases the above two force components are dominant in the calculation of the horizontal and vertical force respectively 6 3 morison and transverse hydrodynamic coefficients the correct application of morison and transverse semi empirical schemes requires the determination of the hydrodynamic coefficients i e drag and horizontal inertia for the morison scheme and lift and vertical inertia for the transverse one these parameters are descriptive of the specific near flow field appearing at the cylinder by the knowledge of the undisturbed kinematic field at the transversal axis of the cylinder and the wave forces given by experiments and simulations the ordinary and weighted least square approaches e g wolfram and naghipour 1999 have been used to calculate c d c m h c l and c m v with the aim to reduce the discrepancies between laboratory and olaflow loads and those determined by morison and transverse semi empirical models through the use of the least square method the hydrodynamic coefficients are selected to minimize the sum of the squares of the difference between the experimental numerical and the semi empirical force at each measurement point using the above approach all measurement points have the same weight on the determination of the hydrodynamic coefficients to give more emphasis in the assessment of the force peaks in the weighted least square method the weights are linked to the magnitude of the wave forces indeed at each point of the time variations the difference between the experimental numerical and the semi empirical force is multiplied by f j being j a positive index wolfram and naghipour 1999 adopting the weighted least square approach the influence on the estimate of c d c m h c l and c m v is relevant if the magnitude of the load is large the horizontal hydrodynamic coefficients c d and c m h in the morison scheme are deduced as follows 20 c d i 1 n f h 2 j 1 u u i 1 n f h 2 j a h 2 i 1 n f h 2 j 1 a h i 1 n f h e 2 j u u a h k d i 1 n f h 2 j u 4 i 1 n f h 2 j a h i 1 n f h 2 j u u a h 2 c m h i 1 n f h 2 j 1 a h i 1 n f h 2 j u 4 i 1 n f h 2 j 1 u u i 1 n f h e 2 j a h u u k m h i 1 n f h 2 j a h 2 i 1 n f h 2 j u 4 i 1 n f h e 2 j a h u u 2 where k d 1 2 Ï d and k m h 1 4 Ï d 2 Ï the value of n is the total number of force and kinematic values in the apparent wave period and depends on the experimental or numerical time step in the above method the equations to determine the force coefficients c l and c m v in the transverse formula yield 21 c l i 1 n f v 2 j 1 u 2 i 1 n f v 2 j a v 2 i 1 n f v 2 j 1 a v i 1 n f v 2 j u 2 a v k l i 1 n f v 2 j u 4 i 1 n f v 2 j a v i 1 n f v 2 j u 2 a v 2 c m v i 1 n f v 2 j 1 a v i 1 n f v 2 j u 4 i 1 n f v 2 j 1 u 2 i 1 n f v 2 j u 2 a v k m v i 1 n f v 2 j a v 2 i 1 n f v 2 j u 4 i 1 n f v 2 j u 2 a v 2 where k l k d and k m v k m h the velocity and acceleration field i e u a h and a v at the transversal axis of the cylinder was calculated analytically starting from the experimental numerical values of the surface elevation evaluated at the vertical axis of the cylinder it is worth noting that eqs 20 and 21 recover the ordinary least square method if j 0 with the aim to find the best method to determine the force coefficients the mean square error percent msep was calculated by comparing the involved semi empirical equations calculated adopting the hydrodynamic coefficients evaluated using the weighted least square approach with different values of the index j and the laboratory numerical hydrodynamic loads as follows 22 m s e p 1 n i 1 n f i r f i s f i r 2 where f s is the ith semi analytical load and f r is the ith laboratory or olaflow force paying attention to the stability of the involved cylinders the current investigation is addressed to evaluate the maximum value of the in line and transverse hydrodynamic forces and the related phase shifts Ï 2 Ï t m a x t where t m a x is the appearing time of the maximum value of the force figs 10 and 11 show respectively for e d 0 25 and 0 1 the average values of msep for all the laboratory and olaflow tests determined by the ordinary least square ols with j 0 and the weighted least square adopting j 1 wls1 j 2 wls2 j 3 wls3 and j 4 wls4 owing to their relevance deduced by the analysis performed in section 6 2 the msep is calculated considering the positive and negative maximum in line force and the positive maximum of the transverse force considering all the methods for e d 0 25 the mean msep of the positive horizontal peak except for the ols method is of the order of 3 both through the experiments and the numerical simulations the mean error of the vertical peak is more than approximately 4 furthermore the mean error related to the phase shifts of the in line and transverse forces is low for all the approaches conversely the mean msep of the horizontal negative peaks are greater especially for j 1 for e d 0 1 low values of the mean error for all the approaches are observed except for the experimental msep of the maximum negative value of the in line force 17 and the msep of the maximum positive value of the transverse force calculated with the ols method 10 the analysis of the results of the msep for the involved depths of the cylinder shows that wls1 provides the lowest error as a result the linked force coefficients are used in the morison and transverse schemes indeed the msep of the maximum in line and transverse force presents the highest value of the msep for the ols method and tends to reduce to the increasing of j conversely the msep of the f h m a x n tends to grow as j increases the wls1 represents the best compromise and moreover allows a better estimate on the time evolution of the transverse force as shown in section 6 4 as mentioned in section 5 for the involved values of e d the canonical lift component does not model the forward phase shift in the observed laboratory nor the olaflow time evolution of the transverse loads this is due to the fact that the lift force in the transverse scheme see eq 17 is proportional to the horizontal velocity and then to the maximum surface elevation of the solitary wave at the vertical section of the cylinder eqs 18 and 19 show respectively the new lift force formulation and the time interval between the occurrence of the wave crest and that related to the peak of the observed lift force as a result the lift hydrodynamic coefficient c l was then calculated considering this modified formulation the relationship between the time shift t s and different physical quantities of the laboratory and olaflow tests i e a t and d are shown in fig 12 and for e d 0 25 and e d 0 1 respectively the resulting fitting curve shows a good agreement between experimental and olaflow simulations and particularly for e d 0 25 leading to a very small time shift which occurs for the adopted two approaches i e experimental and numerical for e d 0 25 the value of the phase angle Ï is dependent on a and d and is modeled by a power law as follows 23 Ï 0 17 d a 0 61 where the empirical constants are evaluated numerically with a correlation coefficient r 2 0 976 for e d 0 1 the phase angle varies linearly and is given by 24 Ï 0 025 d a where the constant represents a coefficient evaluated by olaflow and the correlation coefficient r 2 0 933 the capabilities of olaflow in modeling the characteristics of the force coefficients using the wls1 is evaluated through the comparison of the olaflow and the laboratory values of c d c m h c l and c m v as highlighted in fig 13 the investigation is performed through the calculation of the msep between laboratory and olaflow tests as follows 25 m s e p 1 m i 1 m c i e c i n c i e 2 where c e and c n are respectively the laboratory and olaflow hydrodynamic coefficients and m is the number of the tests performed for each gap to diameter ratio for the adopted two values of e d it can be observed that msep is lower in the case of the numerical evaluation of the in line hydrodynamic coefficients i e c d and c m h compared to c l and c m v specifically the mean error is 2 8 for c d 0 4 for c m h 10 for c l and 32 3 for c m h as confirmed in the successive section 6 4 regarding the weights of the force components in morison and transverse schemes the obtained results can be considered suitable because of the high weight of the inertia component in modeling the horizontal load and of the lift component in reproducing the vertical load in particular the contribution of the vertical inertia is very low and potentially negligible in the assessing of the transverse load concerning the discrepancies between c l and c d it is possible to observe that the vertical force is more difficult to model with respect to the horizontal one since the lift component is strongly affected by the evolution of the vortices around the cylinder see e g sumer and fredsoe 2006 we also note that for low values of a d the differences between experiments and simulations on f v are sometimes higher if compared to f h and this influences the magnitude of the error between experiments and simulations related to c l and c m v in order to enlarge and refine the range of the involved physical process additional olaflow simulations were carried out for a more careful determination of c d c m h c l and c m h the involved gap to diameter ratio e d 0 25 was enlarged through the following values of the a d 0 062 0 072 0 186 0 199 0 212 0 223 0 235 and 0 245 in the case of e d 0 1 the additional numerical tests present the following values of a d 0 056 0 066 0 077 0 186 0 198 0 211 0 223 0 235 and 0 245 considering all two values of e d a total number of 74 numerical simulations were performed in the context of the adopted supplementary numerical simulations the lower limit was a d 0 05 in order to avoid the occurrence of solitary waves with a wavelength bigger than 15 m and the consequent use of a very long numerical flume at the same time the upper limit was a d 0 25 since eq 9 for a d 0 25 furnishes an unphysical double peak in the maximum values of a v that allows for an incorrect calculation of the vertical force coefficients and of the transverse semi empirical scheme however the present range of a d is similar to other experimental and numerical analyses related to the solitary wave induced forces on offshore and coastal structures e g filianoti and di risio 2012 seiffert et al 2014 through the whole dataset of the olaflow simulations for e d 0 25 fig 14 highlights the numerical coefficients c d c m h c l and c m v in the morison and the modified transverse semi analytical schemes vs a d it can be noticed that c d increases proportionally to a d and is in a range of approximately 1 and 2 the horizontal inertia coefficients tend to reduce with the increasing of a d the range of c m h varies about from 2 to 1 5 the lift coefficient increases to approximately a d 0 16 with a corresponding value of c l 2 followed by a small progressive reduction the values of c m v decrease with the increasing of a d negative values of the numerical c m v occur and this effect leads to the reversal of the shape of the vertical inertia force even if a scattering of c m v can be observed we remark that its contribution to model the vertical load is weak as successively highlighted in section 6 4 for this gap to diameter ratio the hydrodynamic coefficients c d c m h and c l are also analyzed as a function of k c for a comparison with literature results referred to regular waves as described in fig 15 the observed increasing trend of c d vs k c was noticed in the work performed by chevalier et al 2001 at the same gap to diameter ratio e d 0 25 and a ratio between the water depth and the diameter equal to 5 even if the values of c d related to chevalier et al 2001 are higher than the present numerical values the value of c d for oscillatory flow observed by jarno druax et al 1995 and inverno et al 2016 at k c 4 9 results higher than the present investigation 4 k c 8 the literature comparison with regular waves reveals that the values of c m h are very similar indeed jarno druax et al 1995 e d 0 25 and k c 4 9 and inverno et al 2016 e d 0 24 and k c 4 9 observed values respectively equal to 2 8 and 2 2 slightly higher than the current analysis the values of c m h proposed by chevalier et al 2001 result close to those shown in fig 15b as for the lift coefficient the values obtained in the present study result lower with respect to the case of regular wave where c l is equal to 5 7 according to jarno druax et al 1995 and 2 7 according to inverno et al 2016 for k c 4 9 for practical purposes empirical based formulas have been found to assess the force coefficients vs the dimensionless wave amplitude for e d 0 25 the fitting of the values of c d c m h c l and c m v is given by a dashed black curve see fig 14 the growing trend of c d and the decreasing trend of c m h can both be fitted by a linear law 26 c d 0 92 3 74 a d 27 c m h 2 10 2 58 a d where the correlation coefficient r 2 is equal to 0 915 and 0 964 respectively the values of c l can be fitted by the following gaussian law 28 c l 1 95 exp a d 0 17 0 16 2 where r 2 0 88 the non linear decreasing trend of c m v can be fitted by a power law 29 c m v 80 44 a d 2 18 1 43 where r 2 is equal to 0 83 fig 16 illustrates the numerical hydrodynamic coefficients when the gap to diameter ratio is equal to 0 1 the numerical values of c d tend to increase with the increasing of a d the horizontal inertia coefficients as well as for the case of e d 0 25 decrease with the growth of a d for the lower a d c m h presents the maximum value equal to 2 5 and a minimum value greater than 2 regarding the transverse coefficients figs 16c and d show an initial increasing of the value of the coefficients and for a d 0 12 a subsequent decreasing the values of c l oscillate between 2 and 3 5 while the values of c m v oscillate between 3 and 10 although the values of c m v are quite high the resulting vertical inertia component is weak since the contribution of the vertical acceleration is low similarities with the studies carried out for regular waves were also found for this gap to diameter ratio as presented in fig 17 as a function of k c the present values of c d appear lower than those for regular waves by several authors sarpkaya 1976 jarno druax et al 1995 zhao et al 2006 inverno et al 2016 the values of c m h are similar to the coefficients found by zhao et al 2006 and inverno et al 2016 while the experimental values found by sarpkaya 1976 and jarno druax et al 1995 result higher c m h 3 9 and 3 5 respectively all these works highlighted that c m h tends to decrease when the gap to diameter ratio increases from 0 1 to 0 25 as in the current research the value of c l in the involved k c range appears higher than the cases with regular waves sarpkaya 1976 jarno druax et al 1995 zhao et al 2006 inverno et al 2016 for k c 10 sumer et al 1991 found a value of 2 3 that is comparable with the present study note that no values of c m v were found in literature for e d 0 25 and 0 1 in general it is possible to remark that c d c m h and c l prove to be lower that those observed in literature for regular waves for e d 0 25 and 0 1 and in the present k c range as previously performed the force coefficients have been fitted for e d 0 1 to find simple semi analytical equation as a function of a d the in line coefficients are reproduced through the expressions 30 c d 2 21 a d 0 13 31 c m h 2 47 1 09 a d where the r 2 of the above power law and linear one is equal to 0 81 the transverse coefficients have been fitted by a gaussian law and a second order power one respectively 32 c l 3 10 exp a d 0 13 0 15 2 33 c m v 617 70 a d 2 13 7 16 where r 2 results equal to 0 82 and 0 87 respectively 6 4 application of morison and transverse schemes in order to highlight the specific contribution of each force component acting on the cylinder in in line and transverse direction examples of time evolution of the morison and transverse schemes are shown for e d 0 25 and 0 1 fig 18 a and b and fig 19 a and b describe the comparisons between the time evolution of the laboratory and olaflow horizontal force and that determined by the calibrated morison formula with the corresponding inertia and drag components for test cases no 28a and no 29b respectively for the same test cases fig 18c and d and 19c and d show respectively the comparisons between the time evolution of the laboratory and olaflow vertical force and that evaluated by the transverse scheme with the corresponding inertia and modified lift components it is worth noting that in figs 18 and 19 the symbols m and t refer to the morison and transverse equations as regards the horizontal force the morison model is able to well reproduce the time history of f h especially for the positive peak with reference to the horizontal negative peak a small overestimation of the morison scheme can be noticed the peak of the horizontal load is back shifted with respect to the wave crest t t 0 and this is due to the combined effect of the inertia component proportionally to the horizontal acceleration and the drag one proportionally to the horizontal velocity for test 28a characterized by a high wave attack the drag component is greater than the inertia one as highlighted in fig 20 for both depths of the cylinder the classical transverse model considering eq 17 does not correctly reproduce the time variation of the vertical force and in particular the time occurrence and the magnitude of the positive peak this limitation is particularly evident for e d 0 25 where the time evolution of the experimental and numerical vertical load differs significantly from the canonical transverse model for this reason as previously mentioned a new formulation of the lift force was proposed see eq 18 indeed observing fig 18c and d and fig 19c and d an overall good correspondence between the new semi empirical equation and the laboratory and olaflow variation of the vertical force can be noticed except for the negative peaks of the vertical force that however result low the comparison between the positive peaks of the vertical force is very satisfactory using the modified lift force calibrated through experiments and numerical simulations the appearing of the maximum vertical force is due to the dominance of the lift component which is forward shifted with respect to the passage of the solitary wave crest i e t t 0 indeed the resulting shape of the vertical force mainly depends on the modified lift component conversely the vertical inertia component is very weak and slightly modifies the overall feature of the vertical load considering all 36 simulations were been carried out by the olaflow model for e d 0 25 and all 38 simulations for e d 0 1 a comparison related to the contribution of the four force components i e f d f h i f l and f h i is respectively shown in figs 21 and 22 specifically the maximum force components are weighted with respect to the corresponding maximum value of the semi analytical in line and transverse load in order to illustrate their specific variation vs a d as shown in figs 21a and 22a the weight of f d m a x with respect to f h m a x tends to grow with the increasing of a d from 35 to 80 for e d 0 25 and from 40 to 70 for e d 0 1 instead the weight of f h i m a x with respect to f h m a x tends to decrease from 82 to 50 for e d 0 25 and from 80 to 65 for e d 0 1 this tendency is linked to the feature of the horizontal hydrodynamic coefficients see fig 14a and b and fig 16a and b with an increase of c d proportional to a d and an inverse trend for c m h for e d 0 25 the two force components reach the same magnitude for a value of a d about equal to 0 16 for a d 0 16 f d m a x f h i m a x for the other considered depth only for the highest values of a d does the drag component result as being slightly higher than the inertia one for low values of a d the dominance of the inertia force for both involved depths is evident as regards to the peaks of the vertical loads figs 21b and 22b the greatest weight is related to the maximum lift force f l m a x as also highlighted in the time history of the load contributions see fig 18c and d and fig 19c and d the lift component ranges from approximately 100 90 for e d 0 25 and from approximately 100 80 for e d 0 1 conversely the inertia component changes from 0 to 20 for both cases for high values of a d the lift peaks tend to decrease while the vertical inertia ones tend to increase and this effect is more pronounced when e d 0 1 7 conclusions a two dimensional experimental and numerical modeling of the horizontal and vertical hydrodynamic forces induced by tsunami like solitary waves on a horizontal circular cylinder placed at two different gap to diameter ratios i e e d 0 1 and 0 25 has been presented from a laboratory viewpoint experimental investigations have been carried out in a 2d wave channel equipped with a piston type wavemaker a eulerian numerical approach was used to reproduce the laboratory wave forces in a more extended range compared to the experimental one in the involved experimental and numerical flow regime the time evolution of horizontal and vertical wave loads has been influenced by different force components as a function of e d the resulting horizontal force has been strongly affected by the inertia component which is proportional to the horizontal acceleration even if a significant contribution of the drag force has been observed for high values of a d at the same time the vertical force has been characterized by a relevant contribution of the lift force moreover the weight of the vertical force compared to the horizontal one tends to grow when e d tends to reduce and for high values of a d the calibration of the different hydrodynamic coefficients has been possible on the basis of the satisfactory comparison between experimental tests and olaflow simulations both on the undisturbed kinematic field at the cylinder and the wave loads these parameters representative of the flow field around the cylinder are involved in the canonical morison scheme for horizontal forces and in a new semi empirical model for vertical forces i e the modified lift equation paying attention to the peaks of the wave loads and the related phase shifts the calibration of the morison and transverse formulas has been executed using the weighted least square method with j 1 furthermore simple analytical relationships have been introduced for a fast calculation of the force coefficients other experimental numerical investigations will be performed to test the capabilities of the morison and transverse semi empirical equations in a larger range of a d additional studies will be conducted in order to investigate the effect of solitary waves on square rectangular

22289,the present study describes an experimental and numerical investigation on the horizontal and vertical hydrodynamic forces given by solitary waves on horizontal circular cylinders placed near a rigid horizontal bed the experimental campaign was conducted in the wave channel of the university of calabria in which twelve pressure sensors were installed along the external surface of a cylinder located at gap to diameter ratios equal to 0 25 and 0 1 the numerical modeling was carried out using the open source olaflow model based on the openfoam solver in order to simulate the wave forces also extending the range of experiments the resulting force field was defined by the dominance of the horizontal inertia force along the flow direction and by the lift force along the transversal one the values of the hydrodynamic forces and the free stream kinematics were adopted to calibrate the hydrodynamic coefficients drag lift and horizontal and vertical inertia involved in the morison formula and in a proposed version of the transverse equation through the use of the weighted least square approach for practical aims semi analytical relationships to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients as a function of wave amplitude and water depth are presented keywords tsunami like solitary waves horizontal circular cylinders wave loads experimental campaign olaflow morison and modified transverse schemes 1 introduction tsunamis are very long waves that are principally generated by earthquakes landslides or volcanic eruptions and propagate with high celerity across the ocean for long distances tsunami waves have an enormous energy indeed they can penetrate inland for a long distance erode sediments from the seafloor cause loss of life and produce damages to coastal infrastructures e g imamura et al 2006 di risio et al 2009 mori et al 2011 with reference to the important occurrences in the indian ocean and east japan the shape of tsunami like waves was observed to be different from the solitary one e g schimmels et al 2016 qu et al 2017 however the magnitude and the shape of tsunamis prove to be dependent on the local conditions of the seismic event as a result it is difficult to furnish a general modeling of tsunami waves due to its suitable and easy approach the solitary wave theory is still used today as a reference for the studying of tsunami properties and their interaction with coasts e g monaghan and kos 1999 liang et al 2013 and structures e g lynett et al 2000 huang and dong 2001 hsiao and lin 2010 from numerical and experimental viewpoints horizontal circular cylinders are marine structures widely adopted for the transportation of water oil gas and cables they are also used for the submarine passage of vehicles and trains owing to their diffusion in the world the knowledge of the horizontal and vertical hydrodynamic forces for stability aims is fundamental the approach to calculate the hydrodynamic loads is different as a function of the size of the cylindrical structure indeed if the structure is small compared to the wave length the morison equation morison et al 1950 is applicable for the calculation of horizontal force in which the total force is given by inertia and drag components and the transverse equation see e g cheong et al 1989 is usually suitable for the vertical one and given by the superimposition of inertia and lift components whereas if the size of the structure is comparable to the wave length the wave loads on the structure are usually calculated by the diffraction theory e g boccotti 2000 to better understand the features of the force components the mentioned distinction can be also viewed in terms of keulegan carpenter number k c indeed for low k c the wave forces are inertial while for large k c drag and lift components contribute to model the resulting horizontal and vertical loads see e g sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 sumer and fredsoe 2006 in the latter regime several works on the knowledge of hydrodynamic loads on horizontal cylinders induced by wind waves and or currents at various water depths were performed e g sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 chaplin and subbiah 1997 sumer and fredsoe 2006 aristodemo et al 2011 alfonsi et al 2012 aristodemo et al 2013 studies related to the interaction between solitary waves and these kinds of structures are scarce and have shown some limitations specifically sibley et al 1982 experimentally generated a tsunami like solitary wave by a manual structure moved horizontally in the flume with a result of a large scattering of the hydrodynamic force coefficients chian and ertekin 1992 analyzed by a boundary element method the hydrodynamic loads in just one case paying particular attention to the free surface profiles and the particle velocities near the cylinder moreover the above researches limited the attention to only horizontal forces and the positions of the cylinder were far from the bottom where instead the lift force plays a significant role in the modeling of vertical forces through extensive experimental investigations and the use of numerical approaches aristodemo et al 2017 and tripepi et al 2018 have recently modeled this physical process for horizontal cylinders placed respectively at half water depth and at the bottom considering both horizontal and vertical hydrodynamic forces in the above studies the horizontal force field was characterized by the inertia contribution and the vertical one by the inertia component in the case of half water depth and by the lift component in the case of bottom mounted cylinder hydrodynamic coefficients vs non dimensional wave amplitude have been furnished to be inserted in practical formulas morison et al 1950 cheong et al 1989 for engineering applications here a novel two dimensional laboratory and numerical modeling are presented for submerged horizontal cylinders placed near a rigid horizontal bed and addressed to analyze the features of the solitary wave induced horizontal and vertical hydrodynamic forces attention is focused on the time series of the wave forces on the force peaks and on fast tools based on the application of semi empirical formulas to evaluate the wave forces in the present research we consider for the first time horizontal cylinders located near the bed in particular the structures were placed at e d 0 25 and 0 1 where e is the gap between the cylinder and the bed and d is the diameter of the cylinder the present study is defined by non dimensional wave amplitudes a d ranging from approximately 0 05 to 0 25 reynolds numbers r e ranging from 1 74 104 to 3 64 104 and k c ranging from 4 35 to 7 95 where a is the wave amplitude and d is the water depth the resulting force field was characterized by the dominance of the inertia contribution in the in line direction and of the lift force in the transverse direction experimental tests were conducted in the wave channel of the gmi laboratory at the university of calabria a battery of pressure sensors was mounted at the external surface of the fixed cylinder in order to calculate the hydrodynamic loads and a wave gauge was placed at the vertical section of the cylinder to measure the free surface elevation and determine the undisturbed kinematic field at the transversal axis of the cylinder owing to its easy and practical use the open source olaflow numerical model higuera et al 2015 based on the well known openfoam solver and applied to analyze ocean and coastal engineering problems e g higuera et al 2018 stagonas et al 2018 was used to simulate the wave forces the application of this eulerian solver was also due to the reasonable computational time to perform simulations if compared to other numerical approaches such as the lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph model adopted in a previous work by aristodemo et al 2017 in particular the mean cpu time cost needed to run olaflow is about 1 10 of the time iteration cost using sph the numerical results given by the olaflow solver were validated through the experimental data in terms of surface elevation free stream kinematic field and wave loads and adopted to calibrate the hydrodynamic coefficients i e drag lift and horizontal and vertical inertia in the morison scheme morison et al 1950 and in a modified version of the transverse scheme in order to provide a practical engineering tool for the stability of horizontal cylinders placed near the sea bed in zones subjected to a seismic risk the modified transverse scheme was carried out to accurately assess the observed phase shifts and the peaks in the time series of the vertical wave loads in this context ordinary and weighted least square techniques e g wolfram and naghipour 1999 were applied to minimize the discrepancies between laboratory and numerical hydrodynamic forces and those linked to the application of the above semi empirical schemes the article is organized as follows the used solitary wave theory is recalled in section 2 the laboratory tests in a wave channel to determine the solitary wave induced forces at cylinders near the bottom are described in section 3 afterwards the olaflow model is recalled in section 4 the morison and the modified transverse equations are illustrated in section 5 the experimental and numerical results on the characteristics of the wave forces as well as the calculation of the force coefficients and the application of the semi empirical formulas to discover the single features of the drag inertia and lift force components are described in section 6 2 solitary wave theory the solitary wave can be taken as the leading wave of a tsunami occurrence this wave is represented as a single elevation of water above the undisturbed water level which propagates without changing its shape in a plane channel boussinesq 1871 and rayleigh 1876 showed that the surface elevation Î· is equal to 1 Î· t a s e c h 2 Î³ c t 2 where Î³ represents the outskirts decay coefficient and c is the wave celerity following the widely adopted rayleigh s formulation rayleigh 1876 the Î³ coefficient is evaluated as 2 Î³ 2 3 a 4 d 2 a d while the celerity is equal to 3 c g a d moreover the Î³ coefficient is related to the wave number k through the following relationship 4 Î³ 2 k the length of a solitary wave is theoretically infinite so it is necessary to define an apparent wave length l 2Ï k the above length is here defined as the distance between the points at which the surface elevation is at 1 of its peak above the still water level e g dingemans 1997 in this context an apparent wave period is then given by t l c the first studies where the solitary wave was generated using a piston type wavemaker were performed by goring 1978 from the mathematical viewpoint the relationship between the paddle velocity and the mean horizontal velocity of the wave is expressed as 5 d x d t u x t where x is the paddle displacement and u is the average velocity over the depth rearranging eq 5 after a change of variables from x t to Î¸ c t x t the result is 6 d x d Î¸ u Î¸ x c u Î¸ x according to the boussinesq 1871 and rayleigh 1876 solitary wave theory the depth averaged horizontal velocity has the form 7 u Î¸ c Î· Î¸ d Î· Î¸ integrating eq 6 with eqs 1 and 7 the horizontal movement of the piston type wavemaker to develop a solitary wave in a flume follows the implicit expression guizien and barthÃ©lemy 2002 8 x t 2 a Î² d t a n h Î³ c t x t 2 following the adopted rayleigh s approach the horizontal movement of the wavemaker can be also solved in an explicit form even if limited to small displacements e g guizien and barthÃ©lemy 2002 the free stream kinematic field i e horizontal velocity and horizontal and vertical acceleration at the transversal axis of the cylinder is useful to calculate the wave forces using semi empirical equations following lee et al 1982 the variations of horizontal u and vertical v velocity along the water depth induced by a solitary wave take the form 9 u t c a d 3 a d 2 1 6 1 2 z d 2 Î· t a a d 2 7 4 9 4 z d 2 Î· t a 2 v t c 3 a d z d Î· t a t a n h 3 a 4 d c t d 1 a 2 d 1 7 Î· t a z d 2 1 3 Î· t a where z represents the vertical coordinate considered starting from the bottom the second order solution furnished by equation 9 yields a small variation of u and v along the depth as noticed by the present experimental tests and numerical simulations the resulting relative water depth d l refers to intermediate waters close to shallow ones 3 laboratory experiments an extensive experimental campaign was carried out in the wave flume of the gmi laboratory at the department of civil engineering of the university of calabria the channel measures 41 m in length 1 m in width and 1 2 m in depth and is provided with a piston type wavemaker in fig 1 the longitudinal profile of the experimental apparatus is sketched in order to measure the instantaneous water surface elevation a resistant type wave gauge was located in correspondence of the vertical axis of the cylinder and another one 0 2 m before this section the physical model of the horizontal circular cylinder with diameter d 0 127 m was fixed at about 9 m from the wavemaker special supports were used at the edges of the cylinder to ensure there was no movement a number of 12 pressure sensors pdcr1830 model by druck were mounted on the surface of the cylinder at 30 intervals the sensors were staggered along the longitudinal axis in the central part of the cylinder this placement of the transducers was possible because these experiments are characterized by a 2d physical process a front and side view of the horizontal structure in the two gap to diameter ratios considered and the position of the pressure sensors at the cylinder is highlighted in fig 2 the values of the dynamic pressures Î´ p were determined through the pressure records and assumed constant along the influence areas in order to determine the laboratory load components consequently the horizontal f h and vertical f v hydrodynamic forces were calculated as a function of the position of the pressure sensors see fig 2c as 10 f h a 1 Î´ p 1 Î´ p 6 Î´ p 7 Î´ p 12 a 2 Î´ p 2 Î´ p 5 Î´ p 8 Î´ p 11 a 3 Î´ p 3 Î´ p 4 Î´ p 9 Î´ p 10 f v a 1 Î´ p 3 Î´ p 10 Î´ p 4 Î´ p 9 a 2 Î´ p 2 Î´ p 11 Î´ p 5 Î´ p 8 a 3 Î´ p 1 Î´ p 12 Î´ p 6 Î´ p 7 where the influence areas a 1 a 2 and a 3 were evaluated as 11 a 1 Ï 3 Ï 2 d 2 c o s Î² d Î² a 2 Ï 6 Ï 3 d 2 c o s Î² d Î² a 3 0 Ï 6 d 2 c o s Î² d Î² the angle Î² was defined starting from the left side of the cylinder the enumeration of the pressure sensors followed the reference system and is shown in fig 2c the sampling rate f s of the pressure sensors and the resistance gauges was 1000 hz the correct generation of the solitary wave was verified measuring the horizontal movement of the wavemaker by an ultrasonic sensor placed behind the piston tripepi et al 2017 the water depth d is constant for all the tests and was fixed at 0 4 m the tests were carried out with two depths of the cylinder so that the gap to diameter ratio assumed the values of e d 0 25 and 0 1 a set of 57 different experimental tests at increasing wave amplitude was carried out by changing the horizontal motion law of the piston type wavemaker in the possible range of the laboratory stroke s for e d 0 25 and 0 1 tables 1 and 2 display respectively the laboratory characteristics of a t a d k c u m t d r e u m d Î½ and d l where u m is the maximum horizontal velocity in correspondence of the cylinder centre and Î½ is the kinematic viscosity the related depth is linked to intermediate water depth conditions allowing the use of eq 9 to represent the free stream kinematic field at the cylinder the value of a d as carried out in different works in literature e g filianoti and di risio 2012 seiffert et al 2014 sun et al 2015 will be taken as characteristic quantity to assess the characteristics of the wave loads and the hydrodynamic coefficients if compared to r e and k c in particular the k c number widely used to describe the flow field near the cylinder under regular and irregular waves sumer and fredsoe 2006 depends here on the arbitrary finite value of t and for this reason the authors preferred to consider the dimensionless wave amplitude it can be noticed that the range of the involved physical quantities refers to small scale experiments with approximate froude scale of 1 40 this leads to real conditions characterized by leading waves of tsunamis with amplitudes up to about 3 m and periods up to 27 s propagating on a water depth of 16 m and acting a circular cylinder with a diameter of about 5 m its size is comparable with an underwater tunnel which however can be here classified as small body since k c 4 and d l 0 2 see e g sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 4 olaflow model olaflow is a free and open source numerical model which uses the latest advances in the simulation of wave dynamics to the openfoam and foam extend communities the model allows the generation and absorbtion of water waves and the simulation of their interaction with coastal structures olaflow is the development of the two previous versions ihfoam and olafoam see e g higuera et al 2013 this project is a continuation of work by higuera et al 2014 and has overcome limitations and errors in the original openfoam code the authors in this new version added new functionalities increasing the performance of the solver such as the generation of waves and currents simultaneously and the reproduction of multi paddle piston or flap type wave generators including the active wave absorption in the present paper the adopted new functionality in olaflow refers to the generation of the solitary wave indeed the solitary wave is generated by moving the left solid boundary of the numerical flume using the horizontal displacement given by eq 8 as performed experimentally 4 1 navier stokes equations the olaflow cfd suite solves the three dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans these equations are solved using a volume of fluid vof technique through a finite volume discretization under the assumption of incompressible fluid the evolution of the flow field is described by the continuity and momentum conservation equations that are written in the following form higuera et al 2015 12 u 0 13 u t Ï u u Î¼ e f f u p g x Ï u Î¼ e f f Ï Îº Î± where u is the velocity vector Ï is the density g is the gravity acceleration x is the position vector p is the pseudodynamic pressure and Î¼ e f f is the efficient dynamic viscosity which takes into account the dynamic viscosity Î¼ and the turbulence effects as follows 14 Î¼ e f f Î¼ Ï Î½ t where Î½ t is the turbulent kinetic viscosity evaluated as 15 Î½ t c Î¼ k 2 Îµ where c Î¼ is a coefficient set equal to 0 09 k is the turbulent kinetic energy and Îµ is the turbulent dissipation rate see for more details launder and spalding 1974 the last term of the equation represents the effect of surface tension where Ï is the surface tension coefficient and set equal to 0 07 n m Îº is the curvature of the interface and Î± is the indicator function defined as the quantity of water per unit of volume at each cell the last parameter Î± is considered equal to 1 in this work since one phase flow i e water is involved to study the present physical process the eqs 12 and 13 are solved with a two step method predictor corrector scheme the turbulence effects are accounted in the equations as an additional eddy viscosity olaflow permits the use of different turbulence models in this study the simulations were performed using a k Îµ model which is one of the most widely used in cfd e g higuera et al 2013 xiao et al 2013 5 semi empirical equations 5 1 morison equation the morison equation morison et al 1950 is a widely adopted semi analytical method for calculating the horizontal force induced by any type of external oscillatory flows on cylinders the horizontal force f h is calculated considering two components the former one refers to a drag force f d given by the resistance of an object to the external flow motion the latter one is due to an inertia component f h i related to the occurrence of a time variation of the ambient horizontal velocity at the cylinder the horizontal force is then equal to 16 f h t f d t f h i t 1 2 Ï d c d u t u t Ï 4 d 2 Ï c m h a h t being c d and c m h the drag and the horizontal inertia coefficient while u and a h are the free stream horizontal velocity and acceleration at the cylinder respectively 5 2 transverse equation the estimate of the vertical load f v similarly to the morison equation can be carried out by the transverse scheme e g cheong et al 1989 this semi empirical approach permits for determining f v as the linear combination of a lift force f l generated by an asymmetric pressure field on the external surface of the cylinder and an inertia force f v i depending on the time variation of the ambient vertical velocity at the cylinder in its general form the transverse scheme is given by 17 f v t f l t f v i t 1 2 Ï d c l u t 2 Ï 4 d 2 Ï c m v a v t being c l and c m v the lift and the vertical inertia coefficient while a v is the ambient vertical acceleration at the cylinder historically the transverse forces are more strongly affected than the horizontal ones by the formation and shedding of vortices close to a cylindrical structure e g verley 1982 bearman et al 1984 in particular the original form of the lift component did not model the forward phase shift and the peak in the observed experimental and numerical time series of the vertical loads in this context a new form of the lift force is proposed which takes the following form 18 f l t 1 2 Ï d c l u t t s 2 where t s is a time interval between the occurrence of the wave crest and that related to the peak of the observed vertical force this time shift is defined by the expression 19 t s t Ï 2 Ï where the phase angle Ï depends on the wave amplitude and water depth and on the calibration of empirical parameters as successively shown in section 6 3 it can be noticed that the ambient kinematic field in the semi analytical formulas has been deduced from system 9 as a function of the numerical and experimental values of Î· 6 results the hydrodynamic loads on the circular cylinder at two gap to diameter ratios will be assessed on the basis of the experimental and olaflow results afterwards the validated numerical values of the free stream velocity and acceleration at the transversal axis of the cylinder in conjunction with the hydrodynamic forces will be used to determine the force coefficients in the morison and the modified transverse equation the length of the numerical flume is set to 12 m in order to avoid the occurrence of unwanted reflected wave at the cylinder the longitudinal spatial resolution Î´ x changes as a function of the distance with respect to the cylinder position at the ends of the mesh grid this value is equal to 2 cm while near the cylinder it is 2 mm regarding the vertical spatial resolution the value of Î´ z is always 2 mm the refinement of the mesh grid near the cylinder was necessary to obtain an accurate solution of the incident flow field and the hydrodynamic forces the change of the spatial resolution is step by step in the transition zones the numerical convergence of the model was checked by changing the spatial resolution and the above values of Î´ x and Î´ z gave satisfactory results in comparison with the experimental ones a sketch of mesh grid using olaflow with all the distances and the spatial resolutions is shown in fig 3 for a total time of 10 s the olaflow simulations take a cpu time of about 6 h through a 3 7 ghz intel r xeon r e5 1620 core v2 with 8 gb ram 6 1 incoming flow field the accuracy of the incoming flow field is first inspected with regard to the free surface elevation at the vertical axis of the cylinder fig 4 displays for the representative laboratory test 28a see table 1 the comparison between the analytical solution given by eq 1 and the experimental and numerical values of Î· the notable agreement between the different approaches is clear the trailing waves always present in the propagation of the solitary waves in the channel see e g aristodemo et al 2017 are very low and fall within the critical value i e 5 of the maximum surface elevation as indicated by guizien and barthÃ©lemy 2002 for the same experimental test 28a fig 5 highlights the comparison between the analytical solution laboratory tests and olaflow referred to the time evolution of the ambient horizontal velocity and horizontal and vertical acceleration at the cylinder centre on the basis of the variation of Î· see fig 4 and the vertical position of the cylinder z the values of u are evaluated by the application of eq 9 whilst the ambient acceleration field i e a h and a v is deduced from u and v the time history of these physical quantities is highlighted to understand the resulting characteristics of the experimental and numerical hydrodynamic forces and how u a h and a v affect the different force components by the use of the semi analytical formulas the good accordance among the different approaches on the incoming flow field allows the use of the undisturbed kinematic field to determine the force coefficients in the morison and the modified transverse equations 6 2 hydrodynamic forces in this section the experimental and numerical wave forces will be compared and assessed in particular the comparison between experiments and olaflow in the cases of e d 0 25 and 0 1 will be presented firstly the time evolutions of the hydrodynamic forces at the horizontal cylinder from the experimental and numerical results in the case where e d 0 25 are illustrated a comparison between the experimental and olaflow forces is shown in fig 6 for two representative test cases see table 1 tests 7a and 28a the difference between laboratory tests and olaflow is very small on the maximum values of f h and f v and the associated phase shifts some differences appear for the lower negative peaks of the wave forces particularly for the vertical ones the maximum value of f h is higher than that related to f v although in the greater wave attack this difference is less evident see fig 6c and d the time instant of the solitary wave crest at the cylinder section highlighted in fig 6 by a vertical dashed black line occurs after the maximum value of f h this depends on the coupled contribution of the inertia force component proportional to the horizontal acceleration and the drag one proportional to the horizontal velocity at the same time the shape of f v resembles that related to the lift force and then to the horizontal velocity the above aspects will be accurately investigated in section 6 3 where the contribution of the single force components will be illustrated it can be also noticed that the maximum vertical load is forward shifted with respect to the passage of the wave crest at the vertical section of the cylinder the comparisons between the time evolutions of f h and f v at the horizontal cylinder from the laboratory experiments and olaflow numerical simulations in the case where e d 0 1 are plotted in fig 7 for the representative tests 6b and 29b in general the correspondence between the experimental and numerical values is satisfactory the horizontal force changes its magnitude in a similar way to the previous case with e d 0 25 indeed the largest positive peak is back shifted with respect to the occurrence of the wave crest at the cylinder the maximum peak of the vertical force is slightly forward shifted with respect to the maximum surface elevation and this effect is less pronounced than the case with e d 0 25 for test 6b the maximum horizontal peak is higher than the vertical one see fig 7a and b while for test 29b i e the higher wave attack an inverse condition appears see fig 7c and d if compared to the case with e d 0 25 the negative peak of f h is higher in magnitude and the two negative peaks of f v are lower in magnitude concerning the comparison with other ratios adopted in previous papers aristodemo et al 2017 tripepi et al 2018 it can be observed as in the present two ratios that the resulting horizontal force was strongly influenced by the inertia component both for e d 1 and 0 with reference to the vertical force for e d 1 and 0 different features can be observed if compared to e d 0 25 and 0 1 because of the relevant contribution of the vertical inertia force a double positive peak and a higher negative one was observed for e d 1 while a unique positive peak was noticed for e d 0 due to the significant weight of the lift load moreover the weight of the vertical force compared to the horizontal one was weak for e d 1 and significant when e d 0 the comparisons for the whole dataset linked to e d 0 25 and 0 1 in terms of highest positive and negative horizontal forces f h m a x p and f h m a x n and vertical ones f v m a x p and f v m a x n vs a d are respectively illustrated in figs 8 and 9 the force peaks are divided by the maximum peak of the horizontal force f h m a x figs 8a and 9a and the maximum peak of the vertical force f v m a x considering the overall dataset figs 8b and 9b in figs 8 and 9 a general correspondence between experiments and olaflow can be highlighted in particular a small difference can be noticed for the negative peaks of the horizontal load regarding the vertical peaks the differences between experiments and simulations are less evident if compared to the horizontal ones for the involved two depths of the cylinder the horizontal and vertical force peaks increase with the increasing of the wave amplitude in particular this effect is more evident for higher wave amplitudes in the studied range of a d the value of f h m a x p shows for e d 0 25 a general growth of 63 and f h m a x n of 62 while f v m a x p and f v m a x n also increase of about 77 and 73 respectively the weight of f v m a x p in respect of f h m a x p as shown in fig 8c ranges between 40 and 100 i e f h m a x p about equal to f v m a x p for the greater wave attacks for e d 0 1 the value of f h m a x p shows an increase of 61 and f h m a x n of 51 whilst f v m a x p and f v m a x n also growth of about 71 and 57 respectively fig 9c highlights the contribution of the horizontal force in relation to the vertical one for this specific depth it can be observed that the maximum vertical forces are greater than the horizontal ones for the higher wave amplitudes a d 0 125 while they are lower for a d 0 125 as noticeable in fig 8a and b and in fig 9a and b the vertical force peaks increase proportionally more than those related to the horizontal ones the reason that causes this increasing trend as a function of a d can be explained through the analysis of the single force components described successively in section 6 4 indeed the horizontal inertia force tends to decrease more quickly than the lift one when a d increases the above two force components are dominant in the calculation of the horizontal and vertical force respectively 6 3 morison and transverse hydrodynamic coefficients the correct application of morison and transverse semi empirical schemes requires the determination of the hydrodynamic coefficients i e drag and horizontal inertia for the morison scheme and lift and vertical inertia for the transverse one these parameters are descriptive of the specific near flow field appearing at the cylinder by the knowledge of the undisturbed kinematic field at the transversal axis of the cylinder and the wave forces given by experiments and simulations the ordinary and weighted least square approaches e g wolfram and naghipour 1999 have been used to calculate c d c m h c l and c m v with the aim to reduce the discrepancies between laboratory and olaflow loads and those determined by morison and transverse semi empirical models through the use of the least square method the hydrodynamic coefficients are selected to minimize the sum of the squares of the difference between the experimental numerical and the semi empirical force at each measurement point using the above approach all measurement points have the same weight on the determination of the hydrodynamic coefficients to give more emphasis in the assessment of the force peaks in the weighted least square method the weights are linked to the magnitude of the wave forces indeed at each point of the time variations the difference between the experimental numerical and the semi empirical force is multiplied by f j being j a positive index wolfram and naghipour 1999 adopting the weighted least square approach the influence on the estimate of c d c m h c l and c m v is relevant if the magnitude of the load is large the horizontal hydrodynamic coefficients c d and c m h in the morison scheme are deduced as follows 20 c d i 1 n f h 2 j 1 u u i 1 n f h 2 j a h 2 i 1 n f h 2 j 1 a h i 1 n f h e 2 j u u a h k d i 1 n f h 2 j u 4 i 1 n f h 2 j a h i 1 n f h 2 j u u a h 2 c m h i 1 n f h 2 j 1 a h i 1 n f h 2

force and kinematic values in the apparent wave period and depends on the experimental or numerical time step in the above method the equations to determine the force coefficients c l and c m v in the transverse formula yield 21 c l i 1 n f v 2 j 1 u 2 i 1 n f v 2 j a v 2 i 1 n f v 2 j 1 a v i 1 n f v 2 j u 2 a v k l i 1 n f v 2 j u 4 i 1 n f v 2 j a v i 1 n f v 2 j u 2 a v 2 c m v i 1 n f v 2 j 1

e u a h and a v at the transversal axis of the cylinder was calculated analytically starting from the experimental numerical values of the surface elevation evaluated at the vertical axis of the cylinder it is worth noting that eqs 20 and 21 recover the ordinary least square method if j 0 with the aim to find the best method to determine the force coefficients the mean square error percent msep was calculated by comparing the involved semi empirical equations calculated adopting the hydrodynamic coefficients evaluated using the weighted least square approach with different values of the index j and the laboratory numerical hydrodynamic loads as follows 22 m s e p 1 n i 1 n f i r f i s f i r 2 where f s is the ith semi analytical load and f r is the ith laboratory or olaflow force paying attention to the stability of the involved cylinders the current investigation is addressed to evaluate the maximum value of the in line and transverse hydrodynamic forces and the related phase shifts Ï 2 Ï t m a x t where t m a x is the appearing time of the maximum value of the force figs 10 and 11 show respectively for e d 0 25 and 0 1 the average values of msep for all the laboratory and olaflow tests determined by the ordinary least square ols with j 0 and the weighted least square adopting j 1 wls1 j 2 wls2 j 3 wls3 and j 4 wls4 owing to their relevance deduced by the analysis performed in section 6 2 the msep is calculated considering the positive and negative maximum in line force and the positive maximum of the transverse force considering all the methods for e d 0 25 the mean msep of the positive horizontal peak except for the ols method is of the order of 3 both through the experiments and the numerical simulations the mean error of the vertical peak is more than approximately 4 furthermore the mean error related to the phase shifts of the in line and transverse forces is low for all the approaches conversely the mean msep of the horizontal negative peaks are greater especially for j 1 for e d 0 1 low values of the mean error for all the approaches are observed except for the experimental msep of the maximum negative value of the in line force 17 and the msep of the maximum positive value of the transverse force calculated with the ols method 10 the analysis of the results of the msep for the involved depths of the cylinder shows that wls1 provides the lowest error as a result the linked force coefficients are used in the morison and transverse schemes indeed the msep of the maximum in line and transverse force presents the highest value of the msep for the ols method and tends to reduce to the increasing of j conversely the msep of the f h m a x n tends to grow as j increases the wls1 represents the best compromise and moreover allows a better estimate on the time evolution of the transverse force as shown in section 6 4 as mentioned in section 5 for the involved values of e d the canonical lift component does not model the forward phase shift in the observed laboratory nor the olaflow time evolution of the transverse loads this is due to the fact that the lift force in the transverse scheme see eq 17 is proportional to the horizontal velocity and then to the maximum surface elevation of the solitary wave at the vertical section of the cylinder eqs 18 and 19 show respectively the new lift force formulation and the time interval between the occurrence of the wave crest and that related to the peak of the observed lift force as a result the lift hydrodynamic coefficient c l was then calculated considering this modified formulation the relationship between the time shift t s and different physical quantities of the laboratory and olaflow tests i e a t and d are shown in fig 12 and for e d 0 25 and e d 0 1 respectively the resulting fitting curve shows a good agreement between experimental and olaflow simulations and particularly for e d 0 25 leading to a very small time shift which occurs for the adopted two approaches i e experimental and numerical for e d 0 25 the value of the phase angle Ï is dependent on a and d and is modeled by a power law as follows 23 Ï 0 17 d a 0 61 where the empirical constants are evaluated numerically with a correlation coefficient r 2 0 976 for e d 0 1 the phase angle varies linearly and is given by 24 Ï 0 025 d a where the constant represents a coefficient evaluated by olaflow and the correlation coefficient r 2 0 933 the capabilities of olaflow in modeling the characteristics of the force coefficients using the wls1 is evaluated through the comparison of the olaflow and the laboratory values of c d c m h c l and c m v as highlighted in fig 13 the investigation is performed through the calculation of the msep between laboratory and olaflow tests as follows 25 m s e p 1 m i 1 m c i e c i n c i e 2 where c e and c n are respectively the laboratory and olaflow hydrodynamic coefficients and m is the number of the tests performed for each gap to diameter ratio for the adopted two values of e d it can be observed that msep is lower in the case of the numerical evaluation of the in line hydrodynamic coefficients i e c d and c m h compared to c l and c m v specifically the mean error is 2 8 for c d 0 4 for c m h 10 for c l and 32 3 for c m h as confirmed in the successive section 6 4 regarding the weights of the force components in morison and transverse schemes the obtained results can be considered suitable because of the high weight of the inertia component in modeling the horizontal load and of the lift component in reproducing the vertical load in particular the contribution of the vertical inertia is very low and potentially negligible in the assessing of the transverse load concerning the discrepancies between c l and c d it is possible to observe that the vertical force is more difficult to model with respect to the horizontal one since the lift component is strongly affected by the evolution of the vortices around the cylinder see e g sumer and fredsoe 2006 we also note that for low values of a d the differences between experiments and simulations on f v are sometimes higher if compared to f h and this influences the magnitude of the error between experiments and simulations related to c l and c m v in order to enlarge and refine the range of the involved physical process additional olaflow simulations were carried out for a more careful determination of c d c m h c l and c m h the involved gap to diameter ratio e d 0 25 was enlarged through the following values of the a d 0 062 0 072 0 186 0 199 0 212 0 223 0 235 and 0 245 in the case of e d 0 1 the additional numerical tests present the following values of a d 0 056 0 066 0 077 0 186 0 198 0 211 0 223 0 235 and 0 245 considering all two values of e d a total number of 74 numerical simulations were performed in the context of the adopted supplementary numerical simulations the lower limit was a d 0 05 in order to avoid the occurrence of solitary waves with a wavelength bigger than 15 m and the consequent use of a very long numerical flume at the same time the upper limit was a d 0 25 since eq 9 for a d 0 25 furnishes an unphysical double peak in the maximum values of a v that allows for an incorrect calculation of the vertical force coefficients and of the transverse semi empirical scheme however the present range of a d is similar to other experimental and numerical analyses related to the solitary wave induced forces on offshore and coastal structures e g filianoti and di risio 2012 seiffert et al 2014 through the whole dataset of the olaflow simulations for e d 0 25 fig 14 highlights the numerical coefficients c d c m h c l and c m v in the morison and the modified transverse semi analytical schemes vs a d it can be noticed that c d increases proportionally to a d and is in a range of approximately 1 and 2 the horizontal inertia coefficients tend to reduce with the increasing of a d the range of c m h varies about from 2 to 1 5 the lift coefficient increases to approximately a d 0 16 with a corresponding value of c l 2 followed by a small progressive reduction the values of c m v decrease with the increasing of a d negative values of the numerical c m v occur and this effect leads to the reversal of the shape of the vertical inertia force even if a scattering of c m v can be observed we remark that its contribution to model the vertical load is weak as successively highlighted in section 6 4 for this gap to diameter ratio the hydrodynamic coefficients c d c m h and c l are also analyzed as a function of k c for a comparison with literature results referred to regular waves as described in fig 15 the observed increasing trend of c d vs k c was noticed in the work performed by chevalier et al 2001 at the same gap to diameter ratio e d 0 25 and a ratio between the water depth and the diameter equal to 5 even if the values of c d related to chevalier et al 2001 are higher than the present numerical values the value of c d for oscillatory flow observed by jarno druax et al 1995 and inverno et al 2016 at k c 4 9 results higher than the present investigation 4 k c 8 the literature comparison with regular waves reveals that the values of c m h are very similar indeed jarno druax et al 1995 e d 0 25 and k c 4 9 and inverno et al 2016 e d 0 24 and k c 4 9 observed values respectively equal to 2 8 and 2 2 slightly higher than the current analysis the values of c m h proposed by chevalier et al 2001 result close to those shown in fig 15b as for the lift coefficient the values obtained in the present study result lower with respect to the case of regular wave where c l is equal to 5 7 according to jarno druax et al 1995 and 2 7 according to inverno et al 2016 for k c 4 9 for practical purposes empirical based formulas have been found to assess the force coefficients vs the dimensionless wave amplitude for e d 0 25 the fitting of the values of c d c m h c l and c m v is given by a dashed black curve see fig 14 the growing trend of c d and the decreasing trend of c m h can both be fitted by a linear law 26 c d 0 92 3 74 a d 27 c m h 2 10 2 58 a d where the correlation coefficient r 2 is equal to 0 915 and 0 964 respectively the values of c l can be fitted by the following gaussian law 28 c l 1 95 exp a d 0 17 0 16 2 where r 2 0 88 the non linear decreasing trend of c m v can be fitted by a power law 29 c m v 80 44 a d 2 18 1 43 where r 2 is equal to 0 83 fig 16 illustrates the numerical hydrodynamic coefficients when the gap to diameter ratio is equal to 0 1 the numerical values of c d tend to increase with the increasing of a d the horizontal inertia coefficients as well as for the case of e d 0 25 decrease with the growth of a d for the lower a d c m h presents the maximum value equal to 2 5 and a minimum value greater than 2 regarding the transverse coefficients figs 16c and d show an initial increasing of the value of the coefficients and for a d 0 12 a subsequent decreasing the values of c l oscillate between 2 and 3 5 while the values of c m v oscillate between 3 and 10 although the values of c m v are quite high the resulting vertical inertia component is weak since the contribution of the vertical acceleration is low similarities with the studies carried out for regular waves were also found for this gap to diameter ratio as presented in fig 17 as a function of k c the present values of c d appear lower than those for regular waves by several authors sarpkaya 1976 jarno druax et al 1995 zhao et al 2006 inverno et al 2016 the values of c m h are similar to the coefficients found by zhao et al 2006 and inverno et al 2016 while the experimental values found by sarpkaya 1976 and jarno druax et al 1995 result higher c m h 3 9 and 3 5 respectively all these works highlighted that c m h tends to decrease when the gap to diameter ratio increases from 0 1 to 0 25 as in the current research the value of c l in the involved k c range appears higher than the cases with regular waves sarpkaya 1976 jarno druax et al 1995 zhao et al 2006 inverno et al 2016 for k c 10 sumer et al 1991 found a value of 2 3 that is comparable with the present study note that no values of c m v were found in literature for e d 0 25 and 0 1 in general it is possible to remark that c d c m h and c l prove to be lower that those observed in literature for regular waves for e d 0 25 and 0 1 and in the present k c range as previously performed the force coefficients have been fitted for e d 0 1 to find simple semi analytical equation as a function of a d the in line coefficients are reproduced through the expressions 30 c d 2 21 a d 0 13 31 c m h 2 47 1 09 a d where the r 2 of the above power law and linear one is equal to 0 81 the transverse coefficients have been fitted by a gaussian law and a second order power one respectively 32 c l 3 10 exp a d 0 13 0 15 2 33 c m v 617 70 a d 2 13 7 16 where r 2 results equal to 0 82 and 0 87 respectively 6 4 application of morison and transverse schemes in order to highlight the specific contribution of each force component acting on the cylinder in in line and transverse direction examples of time evolution of the morison and transverse schemes are shown for e d 0 25 and 0 1 fig 18 a and b and fig 19 a and b describe the comparisons between the time evolution of the laboratory and olaflow horizontal force and that determined by the calibrated morison formula with the corresponding inertia and drag components for test cases no 28a and no 29b respectively for the same test cases fig 18c and d and 19c and d show respectively the comparisons between the time evolution of the laboratory and olaflow vertical force and that evaluated by the transverse scheme with the corresponding inertia and modified lift components it is worth noting that in figs 18 and 19 the symbols m and t refer to the morison and transverse equations as regards the horizontal force the morison model is able to well reproduce the time history of f h especially for the positive peak with reference to the horizontal negative peak a small overestimation of the morison scheme can be noticed the peak of the horizontal load is back shifted with respect to the wave crest t t 0 and this is due to the combined effect of the inertia component proportionally to the horizontal acceleration and the drag one proportionally to the horizontal velocity for test 28a characterized by a high wave attack the drag component is greater than the inertia one as highlighted in fig 20 for both depths of the cylinder the classical transverse model considering eq 17 does not correctly reproduce the time variation of the vertical force and in particular the time occurrence and the magnitude of the positive peak this limitation is particularly evident for e d 0 25 where the time evolution of the experimental and numerical vertical load differs significantly from the canonical transverse model for this reason as previously mentioned a new formulation of the lift force was proposed see eq 18 indeed observing fig 18c and d and fig 19c and d an overall good correspondence between the new semi empirical equation and the laboratory and olaflow variation of the vertical force can be noticed except for the negative peaks of the vertical force that however result low the comparison between the positive peaks of the vertical force is very satisfactory using the modified lift force calibrated through experiments and numerical simulations the appearing of the maximum vertical force is due to the dominance of the lift component which is forward shifted with respect to the passage of the solitary wave crest i e t t 0 indeed the resulting shape of the vertical force mainly depends on the modified lift component conversely the vertical inertia component is very weak and slightly modifies the overall feature of the vertical load considering all 36 simulations were been carried out by the olaflow model for e d 0 25 and all 38 simulations for e d 0 1 a comparison related to the contribution of the four force components i e f d f h i f l and f h i is respectively shown in figs 21 and 22 specifically the maximum force components are weighted with respect to the corresponding maximum value of the semi analytical in line and transverse load in order to illustrate their specific variation vs a d as shown in figs 21a and 22a the weight of f d m a x with respect to f h m a x tends to grow with the increasing of a d from 35 to 80 for e d 0 25 and from 40 to 70 for e d 0 1 instead the weight of f h i m a x with respect to f h m a x tends to decrease from 82 to 50 for e d 0 25 and from 80 to 65 for e d 0 1 this tendency is linked to the feature of the horizontal hydrodynamic coefficients see fig 14a and b and fig 16a and b with an increase of c d proportional to a d and an inverse trend for c m h for e d 0 25 the two force components reach the same magnitude for a value of a d about equal to 0 16 for a d 0 16 f d m a x f h i m a x for the other considered depth only for the highest values of a d does the drag component result as being slightly higher than the inertia one for low values of a d the dominance of the inertia force for both involved depths is evident as regards to the peaks of the vertical loads figs 21b and 22b the greatest weight is related to the maximum lift force f l m a x as also highlighted in the time history of the load contributions see fig 18c and d and fig 19c and d the lift component ranges from approximately 100 90 for e d 0 25 and from approximately 100 80 for e d 0 1 conversely the inertia component changes from 0 to 20 for both cases for high values of a d the lift peaks tend to decrease while the vertical inertia ones tend to increase and this effect is more pronounced when e d 0 1 7 conclusions a two dimensional experimental and numerical modeling of the horizontal and vertical hydrodynamic forces induced by tsunami like solitary waves on a horizontal circular cylinder placed at two different gap to diameter ratios i e e d 0 1 and 0 25 has been presented from a laboratory viewpoint experimental investigations have been carried out in a 2d wave channel equipped with a piston type wavemaker a eulerian numerical approach was used to reproduce the laboratory wave forces in a more extended range compared to the experimental one in the involved experimental and numerical flow regime the time evolution of horizontal and vertical wave loads has been influenced by different force components as a function of e d the resulting horizontal force has been strongly affected by the inertia component which is proportional to the horizontal acceleration even if a significant contribution of the drag force has been observed for high values of a d at the same time the vertical force has been characterized by a relevant contribution of the lift force moreover the weight of the vertical force compared to the horizontal one tends to grow when e d tends to reduce and for high values of a d the calibration of the different hydrodynamic coefficients has been possible on the basis of the satisfactory comparison between experimental tests and olaflow simulations both on the undisturbed kinematic field at the cylinder and the wave loads these parameters representative of the flow field around the cylinder are involved in the canonical morison scheme for horizontal forces and in a new semi empirical model for vertical forces i e the modified lift equation paying attention to the peaks of the wave loads and the related phase shifts the calibration of the morison and transverse formulas has been executed using the weighted least square method with j 1 furthermore simple analytical relationships have been introduced for a fast calculation of the force coefficients other experimental numerical investigations will be performed to test the capabilities of the morison and transverse semi empirical equations in a larger range of a d additional studies will be conducted in order to investigate the effect of solitary waves on square rectangular
