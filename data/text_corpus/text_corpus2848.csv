14240,this research demonstrates the solution combustion synthesis scs of silver nanoparticles combined with yttrium oxide ag y2o3 using urea as a fuel material the morphology composition and crystallinity of nanocomposite were conﬁrmed using standard techniques due to the doping of yttrium oxide the synthesized nanocomposites were found to be thermally stable asymmetrical and well distributed without any aggregation with an average particle size of 65 3 nm and surface area of 18 05 m2 g 1 the applicability of synthesized nanocomposite for multiple heavy metal removal from aqueous solutions was tested by performing batch experiments applicability of langmuir isotherm confirmed the monolayer adsorption of cu ii and cr vi on nanocomposite the maximum adsorption capacity of nanocomposite obtained using the langmuir isotherm was 815 mg g 1 and 867 85 mg g 1 for cu ii and cr vi adsorption respectively it s noteworthy that the observed maximum adsorption capacity is 300 higher as compared to other adsorbents reported in the literature the δh value confirmed the physical adsorption of both these metal ions on nanocomposite the synthesized nanocomposite also showed excellent ability for simultaneous removal of multiple metal ions from the synthetically prepared textile industry wastewater negligible reduction in the percent removal of cu ii 98 5 to 93 and cr vi 98 3 to 95 1 was observed in four subsequent adsorption desorption cycles finally the environmental toxicity of the synthesized nanocomposite was assessed by determining its antibacterial and antifungal activity against selected beneficial microbial species which indicated the risk free and safe disposal of the used nanocomposite keywords ag y2o3nanocomposite solution combustion synthesis scs multiple metal ion removal regeneration environmental toxicity test 1 introduction the effluent streams released to the environment by the industries contain significant amount of heavy metals which are quite toxic to the living system 1 5 these heavy metals accumulate in the environmental compartments due to their non biodegradability and considered as a potential threat it is well known that exposure to heavy metals beyond the safe limits can cause serious health problems 6 hence there is a great emphasis for the removal of heavy metals from effluent streams among various heavy metals cu ii and cr vi are most common contaminants in the effluent emanating from industries like textile tanning leather paper fertilizer etc 7 8 excess cu ii in the living system can cause organ damage and gastrointestinal upsets 9 10 cr vi is highly toxic as it causes several problems in the digestive system liver lungs kidneys and skin in addition cr vi has been reported to be mutagenic and carcinogenic 11 12 different methods are in use for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater such as electro chemical 13 15 solvent extraction 16 membrane filtration 17 18 electrolysis 19 20 adsorption 21 ion exchange 22 24 and chemical precipitation 25 each with its own advantages and disadvantages 26 29 out of all these methods adsorption is mostly preferred because of its simple operation low energy requirement higher efficiency higher catalytic activity higher dispersion and reusability of the adsorbent 30 35 in this perspective rather than conventional adsorbent nano sized metal oxides have recently gained significant attention for the removal of heavy metals as they offer many advantages like more favorable and rapid adsorption selective removal of adsorbate ease of adsorption process fewer or no secondary waste large surface area and regeneration of the nanoadsorbent 36 37 various studies reported the use of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles for the adsorption of heavy metals from aqueous solution wastewater 34 41 among these silver nanoparticles have shown promising results for the adsorption of heavy metal ions from wastewater different investigations carried out using silver nanoparticles as an adsorbent demonstrated their high adsorption capacity 700 mg g 1 for cadmium lead and mercury 42 43 however the major problem associated with the use of silver nanoparticles is their easy agglomeration which drastically decreases their adsorption potential 44 in our preliminary studies we synthesized silver particles using scs method fig s1 the obtained silver nanoparticles showed tendency to form aggregates during the synthesis which was quite evident from sem image fig s2 the average size of these particles was found to be 250 7 nm fig s3 hence silver nanoparticles need to be stabilized before their use as an adsorbent to remove heavy metals an alloy of silver nanoparticles with other metal oxides may result in stabilized nanoparticles silver and yttrium are present in second row horizontal transition metal series of periodic table and according to literature transition metal show significant similar chemical properties 45 yttrium has been reported to reduce the particle size of different metals and prevent their agglomeration 46 47 hence yttrium can play a vital role indirectly by keeping the size of silver nanoparticle in nano scale and at the same time prevent their agglomeration considering these facts in order to reduce the particle size and enhance the stability of particles in the present study a mixture of silver and yttrium oxide was utilized for the synthesis of nanocomposite ag y2o3 selection of fuel plays an important role in the synthesis of nanoparticles using scs method 48 different fuels such as citric acid urea and glycine are generally used in scs method which influences the surface properties and size of nanoparticles to the best of our knowledge urea has not been tested so far as fuel to synthesize metallic nanoparticles as a fuel urea may impart negative charge on the surface of nanocomposite due to the presence of no which can improve their adsorption efficacy hence in the present study urea was selected as a fuel in the scs process in recent years due to excessive use of nanomaterials in various commercial and industrial applications it is obvious that nanomaterials and their secondary products will find their way to the environment especially in soil this has raised serious concerns in the scientific community from the eco toxicological point of view as silver based nanomaterials are known to impact the microorganisms present in the soil environment 49 50 thus it is important to access the effect of synthesized nanocomposite on the beneficial microorganisms prior to their application in heavy metal removal in the current study silver nanoparticles combined with yttrium oxide ag y2o3 nanocomposite were synthesized by scs method using urea as a fuel for the removal of cu ii and cr vi from aqueous solution the developed nanocomposite was characterized by standard techniques such as x ray diffraction xrd transmission electron microscopy tem energy dispersive x ray fluorescence ed xrf thermogravimetric analysis tga fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and brunaur emmet and teller bet surface area analysis batch studies were performed to

phase of nanocomposite was identified by x ray diffractometer rigaku miniflex pdxl the diffraction pattern was recorded in the 2θ range between 20 and 80 the values of inter planar spacing and diffraction peaks were compared with the file nos 65 3178 and 04 0783 of joint committee on powder diffraction standards jcpds database the nanocomposite particle size was estimated from the obtained xrd data using debye scherer formula eq 2 2 d 0 9 λ β cos θ where d particle size λ wavelength of x ray radiation 1 5406 a β full width at half maximum fwhm of the peak in radians and 2θ bragg angle microscopy analysis was performed using sem instrument apres s fei to measure the size and morphology of the synthesized nanocomposite particles for sem analysis thin layer of nanocomposite samples was coated on carbon tape fixed on a grid surface and the sem micrograph was captured at 160 000 sample was prepared by dispersing 15 μg of nanocomposite in 2 ml solution and was further sonicated for two and half hours a small amount of the sonicated solution was drop coated on a copper coated carbon grid and the grid was vacuum dried overnight tem micrographs were taken at 150 000x resolution using tem instrument hitachi h 7500 ed xrf pan scientific epsilon 5 was utilized to analyze the elemental composition of synthesized nanocomposite the sample for ed xrf analysis was prepared by mixing nanocomposite and boric acid in a weight ratio of 1 4 the homogenized mixture was transformed into rounded pallets by applying 5 ton force 53 the ed xrf analysis was carried out before and after adsorption of heavy metals thermo gravimetric analyzer tga perkin elmer 4000 was utilized to check the thermal stability of the synthesized nanocomposite for this two milligram nanocomposite was taken in a platinum pan and placed in the furnace the temperature was kept in the range of 25 c 800 c in n2 atmosphere to find out the thermal stability of nanocomposite zeta potential of nanocomposite was measured using malvern zetasizer nano z compact scattering spectrometer by determining the electrophoretic mobility using 1 ml cuvette this analysis was carried out to find the surface charge and the isoelectric point of the synthesized nanocomposite before and after regeneration at phvalues of 2 4 6 8 and 10 all the samples were measured in triplicate at 25 1 c fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer frontier perkin elmer was used to record the ftir spectrum of nanocomposite before and after adsorption in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 nanocomposite were separated from the solution after adsorption by filtering through whatman anatop 10 syringe filters having pore size of 0 02 μm the samples were air dried before ftir analysis the surface area of nanocomposite was measured by adsorption and desorption of nitrogen at 77 k and 298 k respectively using smartsorb 92 93 analyzer the nanocomposite samples were degassed at 200 c for 1 h before analysis surface area was calculated using brunner emmet teller bet method 2 4 batch experiments separate batch experiments were performed using 25 ml of respective aqueous solutions of cu ii and cr vi in 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks to analyze the effect of different parameters such as contact time concentration of metal ions ph adsorbent dosage and temperature parameters used for the batch experiment studies are given in table 1 initial high concentration of metals 1000 ppm was selected to determine the maximum adsorption capacity of developed nanocomposites after adsorption the aliquot samples were collected and filtered whatman syringe filter 0 02 μm pore size was used to separate the nanocomposite from solution the obtained liquid was diluted accordingly and analyzed for the residual cu ii and cr vi concentration using atomic absorption spectrometer aas shimadzu aa 7000 all the experiments were performed in triplicate and controls were kept for all the experiments 2 4 1 multiple metal ion adsorptions most of the industrial effluent contains different heavy metals such as cu ii cr vi zn ii pb ii ni ii and cd ii etc hence the efficacy of developed nanocomposite was checked for the removal of multiple metal ions from the synthetically prepared textile industry effluent as reported in our previous studies 51 52 the other experimental conditions were maintained constant m 4 g l 1 t 720 min ph 6 5 and t 25 c during this study 2 4 2 regeneration of nanocomposite a series of test were carried out to check the regeneration ability of the developed nanocomposite batch studies revealed that adsorption of metals ions was greatly affected by ph of the solution 26 at a lower ph the adsorption reduced to a minimum value whereas maximum adsorption was obtained at ph 6 preliminary batch experiment was conducted to find out the solubility of nanocomposite in 1 m hydrochloric acid hcl solution for this 20 mg of nanocomposite was added in 20 ml of hcl and the flask was kept on shaker at 150 rpm for 720 min at room temperature later the nanocomposite was filtered using whatman anatop 10 syringe filters 0 02 μm pore size followed by drying overnight in hot air oven at 50 c no difference was observed in the dry weight of nanocomposite before and after hcl exposure which indicated that nanocomposite was insoluble in 1 m hcl solution hence the regeneration of nanocomposite was carried out in acidic medium by varying the hcl concentration from 0 01 m to 1 m based on the maximum recovery of metals from nanocomposite surface 1 m hcl was considered for the regeneration studies batch studies for adsorption desorption cycles were conducted for four consecutive times 2 4 3 adsorption isotherm and kinetics studies isotherms are utilized to relate the solid and liquid phase concentration of metal ions at equilibrium various isotherm models such as langmuir 54 55 freundlich 56 57 d r 58 59 and tempkin 10 60 are reported in the literature hence it is important to find the best describing isotherm model for the present adsorption system kinetic study is essential to predict the adsorption rate which is required to design the large scale adsorption operations various kinetic models were fitted with experimental kinetic data for cu ii and cr vi adsorption on nanocomposite the nonlinear forms of pseudo first order 61 pseudo second order 62 and elovich 11 kinetic models are utilized in the present work the experimental data obtained for cu ii and cr vi adsorption on nanocomposite were fitted with nonlinear form of isotherm and kinetic models using origin 6 0 software to estimate the isotherm parameters and constants 2 4 4 mechanism of adsorption adsorption of cu ii and cr vi may be limited by the mass transfer through liquid film boundary or through intra particular mass transfer or both 63 controlling mechanism for metal adsorption was determined by estimating the external mass transfer co efficient β l cm s 1 using eq 3 3 ln c t c 0 1 1 m k a ln m k

37 c after incubation 100 μl sample was spread on separate luria agar plates and further incubated for 12 h at 37 c in order to observe the effect of nanocomposite the bacterial growth was measured in terms of number of colonies using colony counter american optical co usa 65 kirby bauer disc diffusion susceptibility assay was performed to find out the antibacterial efficacy of synthesized nanocomposite for this 100 μl fresh cultures 107 cfu ml 1 of e coli and b subtillis were spread on luria agar plates whatman paper no 1 disc 9 mm dia soaked overnight in nanocomposite 0 4 mg ml 1 were aseptically placed on the petri plates tetracycline discs 10 mcg disc and whatman paper no 1 disc soaked overnight in distilled water were taken as positive and negative controls respectively the

control and negative control respectively these plates were incubated at 28 c for 48 h in order to determine the zone of inhibition 69 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization of nanocomposite the x ray diffraction pattern of nanocomposite fig 2 showed sharp reflections with respect to face centered cubic fcc peaks obtained from xrd analysis were indicative of smaller size of nanocomposite the assigned 2θ values for y2o3 with respect to 222 400 440 and 622 planes were 29 1 33 48 and 57 respectively and for ag with respect to 111 200 220 and 311 planes were 38 11 44 27 64 42 and 77 5 respectively the xrd patterns for y2o3 and ag were in good agreement with the data available in jcpds file no 65 3178 and jcdps file no 04 0783 respectively particle size of nanocomposite was estimated to be 67 nm by use of debye scherrer formula the sem image fig 3 depicted that synthesized nanocomposite were asymmetrical different shape and size and well distributed the particle size distribution histogram developed using sem image data given in fig 4 revealed that particle predominantly ranged between 21 90 nm with a mean particle diameter of 60 3 nm the particle size values obtained from sem and xrd analysis were found to be in good agreement the tem images of the synthesized nanocomposite was shown in fig 5 which indicates the asymmetrical different shape and size characteristic of developed nanocomposites the ed xrf analysis was carried out to analyze the chemical composition of nanocomposite before and after batch adsorption studies the wide scan of synthesized nanocomposite revealed the peaks of silver yttrium oxygen and carbon fig 6 a additional peaks of cu ii and cr vi were clearly visible as depicted in fig 6 b and fig 6 c respectively after adsorption careful analysis of obtained ed xrf spectra suggest that the prominent ag peak observed in high energy band present on the nanocomposite surface fig 6 a got diminished after the adsorption of cu ii fig 6 b and cr vi fig 6 c which confirm the adsorption of these heavy metals on the surface of nanocomposite as per the ed xrf analysis weight of cu ii and cr vi after adsorption on nanocomposite was found to be 8 476 and 7 237 respectively thermogravimetric analysis tga of nanocomposite showed only 3 35 weight loss with the increase in temperature from 25 c to 150 c in n2 atmosphere and later the weight loss was found to be negligible till 800 c fig 7 the calcination was carried out at 500 c for 60 min while synthesizing the nanocomposite after that a drying procedure was followed with 100 c for 5 h however tga analysis indicated a very small change in weight loss which may be due to the exposure of nanocomposite to the atmosphere and this resulted the adsorption of moisture on the surface of nanocomposite 70 71 hence it can be concluded that the developed nanocomposite during the present study was found to be thermally stable zeta potential of synthesized nanocomposite was measured to be 7 10 40 71 and 76 mv for the ph value of 2 4 6 8and 10 respectively it is well known that particles with zeta potential values between 25 and 25 mv are considered unstable 72 the nanocomposite was found to be unstable at ph 2 and 4 as the zeta potential values were obtained as 7 and 10 respectively the obtained results suggested that at ph 6 and higher ph the nanocomposite have higher stability for cu ii regenerated nanocomposite the zeta potential values obtained were 15 mv 5 mv 30 mv 62 mv and 71 mv for ph value of 2 4 6 8 and 10 respectively cu ii regenerated nanocomposite showed good stability in the operating ph 6 5 selected for the present study isoelectric point values indicate the surface charge of nanocomposites at given ph value which are helpful in determining the mechanism of heavy metal adsorption on nanocomposites the isoelectric point of fresh nanocomposite and regenerated nanocomposite was found out to be 2 3 and 2 8 respectively zeta potential of cu ii and cr vi loaded nanocomposite was measured as 27 mv and 32 mv respectivelyas compared to 60 mv of fresh nanocomposite it suggested that negative charge on the surface of nanocomposite adsorption of positively charged metal ions however it is important to note that it is not necessary that surface charge is always responsible in the adsorption process of all metal ions for some metal ions such as cr vi chelation phenomenon at lower ph in between nanocomposite surface and metal ions might play a significant role in adsorption 73 74 in this phenomena protonation of nanocomposite surface can occur which prevents cr vi from chelating with the negative groups present on the nanocomposite surface the ftir analysis of nanocomposite before and after adsorption of cu ii and cr vi ions was carried out to observe the changes in the vibration frequency in terms of the functional groups present on the nanocomposite s surface ftir analysis showed prominently distinct peaks in the wave range of 400 to 1800 cm 1 for fresh and metal adsorbed nanocomposite fig 8 the band around 1303 cm 1 can be attributed to no stretching due to the use of urea as fuel and nitrate salts as precursor used during the synthesis process of nanocomposite the peak at 1045 cm 1 represents cooc o stretching the band at 3474 cm 1 representing oh stretch suggested the presence of small amount of water molecule in nanocomposite fig 8 a a shift in peak from 1303 cm 1 to 1310 cm 1 due to no stretching and a additional peaks at 667 560 cm 1 and 506 cm 1 were also observed after cu ii adsorption on nanocomposite fig 8 b adsorption of cr vi on nanocomposite surface showed a significant shift in the peaks from 1303 to1546 cm 1 due to no stretching respectively fig 8 c however the peak at 1045 cm 1 was not observed which may be due to the adsorption cr vi fig 8 c in addition the new peaks observed at 787 752 570 and 520 cm 1 after cr vi adsorption may be due to the metal stretching 75 the possible mechanism for heavy metals adsorption on the nanocomposite surface is described by fig 7 d brunaur emmet and teller bet surface area was found to be 18 05 m2 g 1 from nitrogen adsorption and desorption process at 77 k and 298 k respectively the obtained surface area value for developed nanocomposite was comparable with many other nanoadsorbents reported in the literature table 2 higher surface area may be due to the calcination of developed nanocomposites at 500 ºc during calcination large number of gaseous products co2 n2 and h2o etc are released which results in the formation of porous structure due to the expansion in solid and decrease in process temperature at the end of synthesis 76 this porous structure resulted in more number of active sites which were favorable for the higher adsorption capacity of nanocomposite it suggested that the nanocomposite synthesized during the present study have a comparatively large surface area which may be favorable for the adsorption of heavy metals the characterization results and surface properties of nanocomposite confirm its applicability for heavy metal adsorption 3 2 batch studies adsorption efficiency of synthesized nanocomposite was analyzed for cu ii and cr vi by performing the batch experiments controls have been kept for all of the batch experiments the effect of contact time on the adsorption of cu ii and cr vi by nanocomposite was analyzed by collecting aliquot samples at regular intervals upto total duration of 720 min fig 9 a sharp increase in the adsorption capacity of nanocomposite with values from 107 mg g 1 to 520 mg g 1 for cu ii and from 131 mg g 1 to 615 mg g 1 for cr vi was observed up to 240 min thereafter a gradual increase in the adsorption capacity was observed up to 720 min for both the metal ions no further increase in the adsorption capacity was observed after 720 min data not shown hence the contact time of 720 min was choosen for adsorption of cu ii and cr vi on nanocomposite for the batch studies in control flasks no change in the liquid phase metal concentration was observed the diffusion of the solute particle on the nanocomposite takes place through two steps first step involves the diffusion of the metal ions through the liquid film on the surface of the nanocomposite and the second step involves the diffusion of metal ions in the pores present on nanocomposite 63 the faster removal of cu ii and cr vi in the initial time may be attributed to the high concentration difference between the liquid film and available active sites on the surface of nanocomposite in the later stage rate of transfer of metal ions on nanocomposite surface become slow due to the higher intraparticle resistances and availability of less number of active sites fig 10 represents the effect of ph on the adsorption of cu ii and cr vi by nanocomposite significant increase in the nanocomposite adsorption capacity was observed with increase in ph from 2 to 6 for both metal ions however further increase in ph showed negligible change in the nanocomposite adsorption capacity the adsorption capacity reached to a maximum value of 693 21 2 mg g 1 and 765 21 mg g 1 for cu ii and cr vi respectively at ph 6 5 hence ph 6 5 was taken as the optimum ph for further batch studies lesser adsorption capacity observed at low ph values of 2 and 4 might be due to the fact that under acidic conditions the presence of protons h on nanocomposite surface would have inhibited the adsorption of positively charged metal ions 37 80 in contrast at higher ph values 8 and 10 the precipitation of metals might be the major reason for the negligible change in the nanocomposite adsorption capacity it is well known that cr vi mainly exist as hcro4 and cro7 2 at low ph 81 hence the cr vi adsorption on nanocomposite is expected to increase with the decrease in ph however in the present study the decrease in adsorption of cr vi at lower ph may be due to the chelation phenomena between surface charges available at the nanocomposite surface and h which reduces the availability of active site for the cr vi adsorption 73 74 chelation phenomenon reduces with an increase in ph due to lesser availability of h and hence leads to higher adsorption of cr vi at higher ph as observed during the present study the change in solution ph with time due to the adsorption of cu ii and cr vi was also measured a decrease in ph value from 6 5 to 5 01 with time was observed after adsorption of cu ii which may be due to the displacement of h ions from nanocomposite surface by cu ii ions in contrast an increase in ph value from 6 5 to 6 9 with time was observed after cr vi adsorption it may be due to the interaction of cr2o7 2 negative form of cr vi at ph 6 7 with h ions present in the aqueous solution which leads to increase the concentration of oh and thereby increasing the solution ph metal ions concentration is an important parameter that can affect the adsorption capacity for cu ii and cr vi adsorption from aqueous solution fig 11 shows the effect of initial concentration of metal ions on equilibrium adsorption capacity of nanocomposite and the percent removal of cu ii and cr vi a significant increase in the nanocomposite adsorption capacity from 94 7 07 to 680 11 31 mg g 1 for cu ii and 93 9 15 to 720 16 97 mg g 1 for cr vi was observed with an increase in the initial metal ion concentration from 0 1 to 1 0 g l 1 respectively this may be due to the higher adsorption rate of metal ions on all the active sites of nanocomposite 82 the obtained data revealed a significant decrease in the percentage removal of both the metal ions with an increase in their initial concentration from 0 1 to 1 0 g l 1 which can be attributed to the fact that the active sites present on nanocomposite surface might got saturated after absorbing a certain concentration of metal ions 83 fig 12 represents the effect of nanocomposite amount on the adsorption capacity and percent removal of cu ii and cr vi ions the percentage removal increased from 30 2 to 100 and adsorption capacity decreased from 68 2 82 mg g 1 to 21 0 7 mg g 1 for cu ii with varying the nanocomposite dosage 0 2 to 4 g l 1 similarly for cr vi ions the percentage removal increased from 27 2 1 5 to 100 and the adsorption capacity decreased from 75 2 82 mg g 1 to 24 0 70 mg g 1with the varying nanocomposite dosage 0 2 g l 1 to 4 g l 1 the increased percentage removal observed for both cu ii and cr vi may be due to the availability of large amount of metal ions as the nanocomposite amount was increased while maintaining the constant metal ion concentration the amount of cu ii and cr vi adsorbed per unit mass of nanocomposite decreased significantly the availability of higher number of unutilized active sites on increased nanocomposite dosage would have resulted in this decreased adsorption capacity and hence adsorption capacity of nanocomposite decreases the optimum amount of nanocomposite for efficient cu ii and cr vi removal was found to be is obtained as 0 7 and 0 72 g l 1 respectively thermodynamic parameters are very significant to find out the spontaneity of adsorption process batch experiments were carried out for three different temperatures 298 308 and 328 k to calculate gibbs free energy δg entropy change δs and enthalpy change δh the adsorption capacity for nanocomposite increased from 680 21 to 788 11 31 mg g 1 for cu ii and 727 21 to 875 10 2 mg g 1 for cr vi with an increase in the temperature from 298 to 328 k respectively the observed increase in adsorption capacity may be due to the increased diffusion rate of metal ions on the boundary layer as well as inside pores of nanocomposite with the increase in temperature 84 the different thermodynamics parameters were estimated from the experimental results by fig 13 are listed in table 3 the negative value of δg depicts the spontaneity and feasibility of cu ii and cr vi adsorption on nanocomposite 54 the positive value of δh confirmed the endothermic process for the adsorption of cu ii and cr vi which also supported the increase in adsorption capacity of nanocomposite for cu ii and cr vi ions with increase in temperature 85 86 the positive and small value of δs confirmed the increase in randomness at the interface of nanocomposite and metal solution which suggested negligible change in the entropy change 84 heat evolved δh during physical and chemical adsorption were found to be are in the range of 2 1 20 9 kj mol 1 and 80 200 kj mol 1 respectively 87 the δh value observed was 16 59 and 15 25 kj mol 1 for cu ii and cr vi adsorption respectively which falls within the range of 2 1 20 9 kj mol 1 hence adsorption of both these metal ions on nanocomposite can be considered as physical adsorption this indicated the feasibility of regeneration of nanocomposite most of the industries utilize multiple metal ions during the manufacturing processes the effluent coming out from these industries contain a very high concentration of multiple metal ions the efficiency of nanocomposite was experimentally estimated for the removal of multiple metal ions the percentage removal of mn ii cu ii fe ii cr vi ni ii cd ii and zn ii was found to be 99 07 99 96 100 100 98 52 98 23 and 98 98 respectively which suggested the multifarious ability of nanocomposite for the treatment of industrial effluents at commercial level fig 14 ed xrf analysis of nanocomposite samples was carried out before and after adsorption of multiple metal ions after adsorption the weight percentage composition of mn ii cu ii fe ii cr vi ni ii and zn ii in nanocomposite was found to be 0 097 0 684 1 846 0 0121 0 0119 and 0 706 respectively the obtained results confirmed the presence of multiple metal ions on the surface of nanocomposite after adsorption it may be due to the fact that the negative functional groups no cooc o present on the surface of the nanocomposite contributed to the adsorption of positively charged metal ions the solid phase analysis showed highest adsorption of fe ii followed by cu ii and zn ii by nanocomposite 3 3 adsorption isotherm study adsorption isotherm study is required to understand the adsorption mechanism between metal ions and nanocomposite surface the best suited isotherm model for cu ii and cr vi adsorption on nanocomposite would be further helpful for designing the fixed bed adsorption column in the present study langmuir freundlich dubnin radushkevich and tempkin isotherm models were tested with experimentally obtained equilibrium data for cu ii and cr vi adsorption on nanocomposite and are shown in fig 15 a and b respectively the parameters of different isotherms along with the coefficient of determination values were estimated using non linear equation of different isotherm models with the help of origin 6 and represented in table 4 the obtained values of coefficient of determination r 2 for langmuir isotherm was found to be maximum 0 963 for cu ii and 0 937 for cr vi adsorption as compared to other isotherm models this confirms that the equilibrium data for cu ii and cr vi adsorption on nanocomposite can be suitably represented by the langmuir isotherm the maximum adsorption capacity of nanocomposite obtained using the langmuir isotherm was 815 mg g 1 and 867 85 mg g 1 for cu ii and cr vi adsorption respectively which is higher as compared to the adsorption capacity obtained from experimental results table 4 the dimensionless parameter r l remained in the range of 0 037 and 0 05 0 r l 1 which confirmed the favorable adsorption of cu ii and cr vi on nanocomposite surface langmuir isotherm assumes the uniform energy and complete coverage of the surface by the adsorbate 54 hence it confirms the monolayer adsorption of cu ii and cr vi on nanocomposite surface 3 4 adsorption kinetics to understand the kinetics of cu ii and cr vi removal using nanocomposite non linear form of pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were fitted with the experimental data fig 16 a and b the maximum adsorption capacity values were calculated as 678 45 and 766 58 mg g 1 for cu ii and cr vi adsorption respectively using pseudo first order kinetic model which are found to be approximately same with the values obtained from experimental results table 5 the values of first order rate constant k 1 was obtained as 0 00694 min 1 and 0 00697 min 1 for cu ii and cr vi adsorption respectively the r 2 values were obtained as 0 987 and 0 979 for cu ii and cr vi adsorption respectively the obtained q e values from first order model were found to be very close with the value obtained from experiments table 5 the values of second order rate constant were obtained as 0 0087 10 3 g mg 1 min 1 and 0 0079 10 3g mg 1 min 1 for cu ii and cr vi adsorption respectively table 5 the q e values were estimated as 836 mg g 1 and 939 mg g 1 for cu ii and cr vi adsorption respectively using the second order kinetic model although the q e values obtained from the second order kinetic model do not fit well with the experimental values table 5 the higher r 2 value 0 99 and 0 984 for cu ii and cr vi respectively suggests the applicability pseudo second order kinetic model the r 2 value of both pseudo first order and pseudo second order are higher than elovich kinetic model the β desorption constant value were found to be decreasing with increase in cu ii and cr vi concentration the lower value of β signifies the higher adsorption capacity of nanocomposite for cu ii and cr vi 3 5 mechanism of adsorption parameters for liquid film boundary layer and intra particular mass transfer were estimated using eq 3 and 4 and are reported in table 6 the r 2 values for intra particular diffusion model were found out to be 0 9614 for cu ii and 0 9611 for cr vi which were significantly higher than the values obtained for liquid film boundary layer model 0 6419 for cu ii and 0 6113 for cr vi the values of intercept i provide information about the thickness of the boundary layer i e the resistance to the external mass transfer 84 this confirms that the rate of adsorption of cu ii and cr vi on nanocomposite was controlled by intra particular diffusion the experimental results from effect of time studies also suggested the major role of intra particular diffusion the rate of adsorption of metals ions has significantly decreased after 30 min of adsorption time which may be due to the higher mass transfer resistance offered by intra particular diffusion 3 6 regeneration of nanoadsorbent the saturated adsorbent containing heavy metal ions is not safe for disposal due to environmental hazards hence it is important and appropriate to propose a method for the regeneration and reuse of nanocomposite the adsorption of cu ii and cr vi were highly ph dependent hence desorption of cu ii and cr vi were accomplished by decreasing the ph of the solution in the present study the saturated nanocomposite was treated with 0 01 0 1 0 5 and 1 m hcl data not shown out of all these acid concentrations 1 m hcl treated nanocomposite showed maximum desorption capacity for cu ii and cr vi adsorption hence 1 m hcl was considered for the regeneration of nanocomposite fig 17 clearly shows that the regenerated nanocomposite efficiently removes cu ii and cr vi ions up to 4 consecutive cycles negligible reduction in the percent removal of cu ii 98 5 93 and cr vi 98 3 95 1 was observed during these 4 cycles this may be due to the loss of active sites while repetitive regeneration of nanocomposite 40 these results shows the higher desorption efficiency of synthesized nanocomposite which could be reused for adsorption of metals in several cycles 3 7 comparison with other known nanoadsorbents in the present study nanocomposite was used as an adsorbent for cu ii and cr vi removal from aqueous solution the maximum adsorption capacity of nanocomposite obtained for cu ii and cr vi adsorption was 685 21 21 mg g 1 and 768 11 31 mg g 1 respectively table 7 compare the adsorbent capacity of nanocomposite with various nanoadsorbents reported in the literature and indicates the approximately 300 higher adsorption capacity of nanocomposite synthesized during the present study the metallic ion uptake on nanocomposite was mainly due to surface adsorption which depends on the contact time ph solute concentration adsorbent dosage temperature as well as available surface area 4 antimicrobial efficacy of synthesized nanocomposite the environmental toxicity of synthesized nanocomposite was checked by determining its antibacterial and antifungal activity against selected beneficial microbial species the bacterial cells 107 cfu ml 1 were exposed to nanocomposite at the efficient adsorbent dose concentration 0 4 mg ml 1 the obtained results showed that nanocomposite do not affect the bacterial growth the bacterial cell count for both the tested bacteria species are represented in table 8 similar results were obtained in the disc diffusion assay fig 18 which showed no zone of inhibition in case of the tested bacterial and fungal species the obtained results suggest that the risk free and safe use of nanocomposite at commercial and industrial levels as it do not show any harmful effect on the environment 98 5 conclusion the present study demonstrates the synthesis of silver nanoparticles combined with yttrium oxide ag y2o3 and their versatile application for the adsorption of multiple heavy metal ions with special reference to cu ii and cr vi the synthesized nanocomposite had a larger surface area 18 05 m2 g 1 suitable for the efficient adsorption of heavy metal ions the maximum adsorption capacity observed was 685 21 21 and 778 11 31 mg g 1 for cu ii and cr vi ions respectively which was found to be best at ph 6 5 the obtained adsorption capacity is approximately 300 more than the available reports in the literature the presence of negative functional groups on the nanocomposite surface was found to be helpful behind their excellent adsorption capacity for the positively charged metal ions the adsorption rate was found to be faster for the first 240 min and decreased at later time intervals in case of both cu ii and cr vi ions the equilibrium time of 720 min was obtained for cu ii and cr vi adsorption the thermodynamic parameters suggested the endothermic and spontaneous adsorption equilibrium data were best fitted with the langmuir isotherm model which confirmed the monolayer adsorption of cu ii and cr vi on nanocomposite the obtained results suggest the multifarious ability of nanocomposite for efficient removal of multiple metal ions from industrial effluent at commercial scale the synthesized nanocomposite was successfully regenerated several times through adsorption and desorption cycles the synthesized nanocomposite did not show any

14240,this research demonstrates the solution combustion synthesis scs of silver nanoparticles combined with yttrium oxide ag y2o3 using urea as a fuel material the morphology composition and crystallinity of nanocomposite were conﬁrmed using standard techniques due to the doping of yttrium oxide the synthesized nanocomposites were found to be thermally stable asymmetrical and well distributed without any aggregation with an average particle size of 65 3 nm and surface area of 18 05 m2 g 1 the applicability of synthesized nanocomposite for multiple heavy metal removal from aqueous solutions was tested by performing batch experiments applicability of langmuir isotherm confirmed the monolayer adsorption of cu ii and cr vi on nanocomposite the maximum adsorption capacity of nanocomposite obtained using the langmuir isotherm was 815 mg g 1 and 867 85 mg g 1 for cu ii and cr vi adsorption respectively it s noteworthy that the observed maximum adsorption capacity is 300 higher as compared to other adsorbents reported in the literature the δh value confirmed the physical adsorption of both these metal ions on nanocomposite the synthesized nanocomposite also showed excellent ability for simultaneous removal of multiple metal ions from the synthetically prepared textile industry wastewater negligible reduction in the percent removal of cu ii 98 5 to 93 and cr vi 98 3 to 95 1 was observed in four subsequent adsorption desorption cycles finally the environmental toxicity of the synthesized nanocomposite was assessed by determining its antibacterial and antifungal activity against selected beneficial microbial species which indicated the risk free and safe disposal of the used nanocomposite keywords ag y2o3nanocomposite solution combustion synthesis scs multiple metal ion removal regeneration environmental toxicity test 1 introduction the effluent streams released to the environment by the industries contain significant amount of heavy metals which are quite toxic to the living system 1 5 these heavy metals accumulate in the environmental compartments due to their non biodegradability and considered as a potential threat it is well known that exposure to heavy metals beyond the safe limits can cause serious health problems 6 hence there is a great emphasis for the removal of heavy metals from effluent streams among various heavy metals cu ii and cr vi are most common contaminants in the effluent emanating from industries like textile tanning leather paper fertilizer etc 7 8 excess cu ii in the living system can cause organ damage and gastrointestinal upsets 9 10 cr vi is highly toxic as it causes several problems in the digestive system liver lungs kidneys and skin in addition cr vi has been reported to be mutagenic and carcinogenic 11 12 different methods are in use for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater such as electro chemical 13 15 solvent extraction 16 membrane filtration 17 18 electrolysis 19 20 adsorption 21 ion exchange 22 24 and chemical precipitation 25 each with its own advantages and disadvantages 26 29 out of all these methods adsorption is mostly preferred because of its simple operation low energy requirement higher efficiency higher catalytic activity higher dispersion and reusability of the adsorbent 30 35 in this perspective rather than conventional adsorbent nano sized metal oxides have recently gained significant attention for the removal of heavy metals as they offer many advantages like more favorable and rapid adsorption selective removal of adsorbate ease of adsorption process fewer or no secondary waste large surface area and regeneration of the nanoadsorbent 36 37 various studies reported the use of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles for the adsorption of heavy metals from aqueous solution wastewater 34 41 among these silver nanoparticles have shown promising results for the adsorption of heavy metal ions from wastewater different investigations carried out using silver nanoparticles as an adsorbent demonstrated their high adsorption capacity 700 mg g 1 for cadmium lead and mercury 42 43 however the major problem associated with the use of silver nanoparticles is their easy agglomeration which drastically decreases their adsorption potential 44 in our preliminary studies we synthesized silver particles using scs method fig s1 the obtained silver nanoparticles showed tendency to form aggregates during the synthesis which was quite evident from sem image fig s2 the average size of these particles was found to be 250 7 nm fig s3 hence silver nanoparticles need to be stabilized before their use as an adsorbent to remove heavy metals an alloy of silver nanoparticles with other metal oxides may result in stabilized nanoparticles silver and yttrium are present in second row horizontal transition metal series of periodic table and according to literature transition metal show significant similar chemical properties 45 yttrium has been reported to reduce the particle size of different metals and prevent their agglomeration 46 47 hence yttrium can play a vital role indirectly by keeping the size of silver nanoparticle in nano scale and at the same time prevent their agglomeration considering these facts in order to reduce the particle size and enhance the stability of particles in the present study a mixture of silver and yttrium oxide was utilized for the synthesis of nanocomposite ag y2o3 selection of fuel plays an important role in the synthesis of nanoparticles using scs method 48 different fuels such as citric acid urea and glycine are generally used in scs method which influences the surface properties and size of nanoparticles to the best of our knowledge urea has not been tested so far as fuel to synthesize metallic nanoparticles as a fuel urea may impart negative charge on the surface of nanocomposite due to the presence of no which can improve their adsorption efficacy hence in the present study urea was selected as a fuel in the scs process in recent years due to excessive use of nanomaterials in various commercial and industrial applications it is obvious that nanomaterials and their secondary products will find their way to the environment especially in soil this has raised serious concerns in the scientific community from the eco toxicological point of view as silver based nanomaterials are known to impact the microorganisms present in the soil environment 49 50 thus it is important to access the effect of synthesized nanocomposite on the beneficial microorganisms prior to their application in heavy metal removal in the current study silver nanoparticles combined with yttrium oxide ag y2o3 nanocomposite were synthesized by scs method using urea as a fuel for the removal of cu ii and cr vi from aqueous solution the developed nanocomposite was characterized by standard techniques such as x ray diffraction xrd transmission electron microscopy tem energy dispersive x ray fluorescence ed xrf thermogravimetric analysis tga fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and brunaur emmet and teller bet surface area analysis batch studies were performed to

was coated on carbon tape fixed on a grid surface and the sem micrograph was captured at 160 000 sample was prepared by dispersing 15 μg of nanocomposite in 2 ml solution and was further sonicated for two and half hours a small amount of the sonicated solution was drop coated on a copper coated carbon grid and the grid was vacuum dried overnight tem micrographs were taken at 150 000x resolution using tem instrument hitachi h 7500 ed xrf pan scientific epsilon 5 was utilized to analyze the elemental composition of synthesized nanocomposite the sample for ed xrf analysis was prepared by mixing nanocomposite and boric acid in a weight ratio of 1 4 the homogenized mixture was transformed into rounded pallets by applying 5 ton force 53 the ed xrf analysis was carried out before and after adsorption of heavy metals thermo gravimetric analyzer tga perkin elmer 4000 was utilized to check the thermal stability of the synthesized nanocomposite for this two milligram nanocomposite was taken

measured using malvern zetasizer nano z compact scattering spectrometer by determining the electrophoretic mobility using 1 ml cuvette this analysis was carried out to find the surface charge and the isoelectric point of the synthesized nanocomposite before and after regeneration at phvalues of 2 4 6 8 and 10 all the samples were measured in triplicate at 25 1 c fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer frontier perkin elmer was used to record the ftir spectrum of nanocomposite before and after adsorption in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 nanocomposite were separated from the solution after adsorption by filtering through whatman anatop 10 syringe filters having pore size of 0 02 μm the samples were air dried before ftir analysis the surface area of nanocomposite was measured by adsorption and desorption of nitrogen at 77 k and 298 k respectively using smartsorb 92 93 analyzer the nanocomposite samples were degassed at 200 c for 1 h before analysis surface area was calculated using brunner emmet teller bet method 2 4 batch experiments separate batch experiments were performed using 25 ml of respective aqueous solutions of cu ii and cr vi in 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks to analyze the effect of different parameters such as contact time concentration of metal ions ph adsorbent dosage and temperature parameters used for the batch experiment studies are given in table 1 initial high concentration of metals 1000 ppm was selected to determine the maximum adsorption capacity of developed nanocomposites after adsorption the aliquot samples were collected and filtered

using atomic absorption spectrometer aas shimadzu aa 7000 all the experiments were performed in triplicate and controls were kept for all the experiments 2 4 1 multiple metal ion adsorptions most of the industrial effluent contains different heavy metals such as cu ii cr vi zn ii pb ii ni ii and cd ii etc hence the efficacy of developed nanocomposite was checked for the removal of multiple metal ions from the synthetically prepared textile industry effluent as reported in our previous studies 51 52 the other experimental conditions were maintained constant m 4 g l 1 t 720 min ph 6 5 and t 25 c during this study 2 4 2 regeneration of nanocomposite a series of test were carried out to check the regeneration ability of the developed nanocomposite batch studies revealed that adsorption of metals ions was greatly affected by ph of the solution 26 at a lower ph the adsorption reduced to a minimum value whereas maximum adsorption was obtained at ph 6 preliminary batch experiment was conducted to find out the solubility of nanocomposite in 1 m hydrochloric acid hcl solution for this 20 mg of nanocomposite was added in 20 ml of hcl and the flask was kept on shaker at 150 rpm for 720 min at room temperature later the nanocomposite was filtered using whatman anatop 10 syringe filters 0 02 μm pore size followed by drying overnight in hot air oven at 50 c no difference was observed in the dry weight of nanocomposite before and after hcl exposure which indicated that nanocomposite was insoluble in 1 m hcl solution hence the regeneration of nanocomposite was carried out in acidic medium by varying the hcl concentration from 0 01 m to 1 m based on the maximum recovery of metals from nanocomposite surface 1 m hcl was considered for the regeneration studies batch studies for adsorption desorption cycles were conducted for four consecutive times 2 4 3 adsorption isotherm and kinetics studies isotherms are utilized to relate the solid and liquid phase concentration of metal ions at equilibrium various isotherm models such as langmuir 54 55 freundlich 56 57 d r 58 59 and tempkin 10 60 are reported in the literature hence it is important to find the best describing isotherm model for the present adsorption system kinetic study is essential to predict the adsorption rate which is required to design the large scale adsorption operations various kinetic models were fitted with experimental kinetic data for cu ii and cr vi adsorption on nanocomposite the nonlinear forms of pseudo first order 61 pseudo second order 62 and elovich 11 kinetic models are utilized in the present work the experimental data obtained for cu ii and cr vi adsorption on nanocomposite were fitted with nonlinear form of isotherm and kinetic models using origin 6 0 software to estimate the isotherm parameters and constants 2 4 4 mechanism of adsorption adsorption of cu ii and cr vi may be limited by the mass transfer through liquid film boundary or through intra particular mass transfer or both 63 controlling mechanism for metal adsorption was determined by estimating the external mass transfer co efficient β l cm s 1 using eq 3 3 ln c t c 0 1 1 m k a ln m k

nanocomposite the x ray diffraction pattern of nanocomposite fig 2 showed sharp reflections with respect to face centered cubic fcc peaks obtained from xrd analysis were indicative of smaller size of nanocomposite the assigned 2θ values for y2o3 with respect to 222 400 440 and 622 planes were 29 1 33 48 and 57 respectively and for ag with respect to 111 200 220 and 311 planes were 38 11 44 27 64 42 and 77 5 respectively the xrd patterns for y2o3 and ag were in good agreement with the data available in jcpds file no 65 3178 and jcdps file no 04 0783 respectively particle size of nanocomposite was estimated to be 67 nm by use of debye scherrer formula the sem image fig 3 depicted that synthesized nanocomposite were asymmetrical different shape and size and well distributed the particle size distribution histogram developed using sem image data given in fig 4 revealed that particle predominantly ranged between 21 90 nm with a mean particle diameter of 60 3 nm the particle size values obtained from sem and xrd analysis were found to be in good agreement the tem images of the synthesized nanocomposite was shown in fig 5 which indicates the asymmetrical different shape and size characteristic of developed nanocomposites the ed xrf analysis was carried out to analyze the chemical composition of nanocomposite before and after batch adsorption studies the wide scan of synthesized nanocomposite revealed the peaks of silver yttrium oxygen and carbon fig 6 a additional peaks of cu ii and cr vi were clearly visible as depicted in fig 6 b and fig 6 c respectively after adsorption careful analysis of obtained ed xrf spectra suggest that the prominent ag peak observed in high energy band present on the nanocomposite surface fig 6 a got diminished after the adsorption of cu ii fig 6 b and cr vi fig 6 c which confirm the adsorption of these heavy metals on the surface of nanocomposite as per the ed xrf analysis weight of cu ii and cr vi after adsorption on nanocomposite was found to be 8 476 and 7 237 respectively thermogravimetric analysis tga of nanocomposite showed only 3 35 weight loss with the increase in temperature from 25 c to 150 c in n2 atmosphere and later the weight loss was found to be negligible till 800 c fig 7 the calcination was carried out at 500 c for 60 min while synthesizing the nanocomposite after that a drying procedure was followed with 100 c for 5 h however tga analysis indicated a very small change in weight loss which may be due to the exposure of nanocomposite to the atmosphere and this resulted the adsorption of moisture on the surface of nanocomposite 70 71 hence it can be concluded that the developed nanocomposite during the present study was found to be thermally stable zeta potential of synthesized nanocomposite was measured to be 7 10 40 71 and 76 mv for the ph value of 2 4 6 8and 10 respectively it is well known that particles with zeta potential values between 25 and 25 mv are considered unstable 72 the nanocomposite was found to be unstable at ph 2 and 4 as the zeta potential values were obtained as 7 and 10 respectively the obtained results suggested that at ph 6 and higher ph the nanocomposite have higher stability for cu ii regenerated nanocomposite the zeta potential values obtained were 15 mv 5 mv 30 mv 62 mv and 71 mv for ph value of 2 4 6 8 and 10 respectively cu ii regenerated nanocomposite showed good stability in the operating ph 6 5 selected for the present study isoelectric point values indicate the surface charge of nanocomposites at given ph value which are helpful in determining the mechanism of heavy metal adsorption on nanocomposites the isoelectric point of fresh nanocomposite and regenerated nanocomposite was found out to be 2 3 and 2 8 respectively zeta potential of cu ii and cr vi loaded nanocomposite was measured as 27 mv and 32 mv respectivelyas compared to 60 mv of fresh nanocomposite it suggested that negative charge on the surface of nanocomposite adsorption of positively charged metal ions however it is important to note that it is not necessary that surface charge is always responsible in the adsorption process of all metal ions for some metal ions such as cr vi chelation phenomenon at lower ph in between nanocomposite surface and metal ions might play a significant role in adsorption 73 74 in this phenomena protonation of nanocomposite surface can occur which prevents cr vi from chelating with the negative groups present on the nanocomposite surface the ftir analysis of nanocomposite before and after adsorption of cu ii and cr vi ions was carried out to observe the changes in the vibration frequency in terms of the functional groups present on the nanocomposite s surface ftir analysis showed prominently distinct peaks in the wave range of 400 to 1800 cm 1 for fresh and metal adsorbed nanocomposite fig 8 the band around 1303 cm 1 can be attributed to no stretching due to the use of urea as fuel and nitrate salts as precursor used during the synthesis process of nanocomposite the peak at 1045 cm 1 represents cooc o stretching the band at 3474 cm 1 representing oh stretch suggested the presence of small amount of water molecule in nanocomposite fig 8 a a shift in peak from 1303 cm 1 to 1310 cm 1 due to no stretching and a additional peaks at 667 560 cm 1 and 506 cm 1 were also observed after cu ii adsorption on nanocomposite fig 8 b adsorption of cr vi on nanocomposite surface showed a significant shift in the peaks from 1303 to1546 cm 1 due to no stretching respectively fig 8 c however the peak at 1045 cm 1 was not observed which may be due to the adsorption cr vi fig 8 c in addition the new peaks observed at 787 752 570 and 520 cm 1 after cr vi adsorption may be due to the metal stretching 75 the possible mechanism for heavy metals adsorption on the nanocomposite surface is described by fig 7 d brunaur emmet and teller bet surface area was found to be 18 05 m2 g 1 from nitrogen adsorption and desorption process at 77 k and 298 k respectively the obtained surface area value for developed nanocomposite was comparable with many other nanoadsorbents reported in the literature table 2 higher surface area may be due to the calcination of developed nanocomposites at 500 ºc during calcination large number of gaseous products co2 n2 and h2o etc are released which results in the formation of porous structure due to the expansion in solid and decrease in process temperature at the end of synthesis 76 this porous structure resulted in more number of active sites which were favorable for the higher adsorption capacity of nanocomposite it suggested that the nanocomposite synthesized during the present study have a comparatively large surface area which may be favorable for the adsorption of heavy metals the characterization results and surface properties of nanocomposite confirm its applicability for heavy metal adsorption 3 2 batch studies adsorption efficiency of synthesized nanocomposite was analyzed for cu ii and cr vi by performing the batch experiments controls have been kept for all of the batch experiments the effect of contact time on the adsorption of cu ii and cr vi by nanocomposite was analyzed by collecting aliquot samples at regular intervals upto total duration of 720 min fig 9 a sharp increase in the adsorption capacity of nanocomposite with values from 107 mg g 1 to 520 mg g 1 for cu ii and from 131 mg g 1 to 615 mg g 1 for cr vi was observed up to 240 min thereafter a gradual increase in the adsorption capacity was observed up to 720 min for both the metal ions no further increase in the adsorption capacity was observed after 720 min data not shown hence the contact time of 720 min was choosen for adsorption of cu ii and cr vi on nanocomposite for the batch studies in control flasks no change in the liquid phase metal concentration was observed the diffusion of the solute particle on the nanocomposite takes place through two steps first step involves the diffusion of the metal ions through the liquid film on the surface of the nanocomposite and the second step involves the diffusion of metal ions in the pores present on nanocomposite 63 the faster removal of cu ii and cr vi in the initial time may be attributed to the high concentration difference between the liquid film and available active sites on the surface of nanocomposite in the later stage rate of transfer of metal ions on nanocomposite surface become slow due to the higher intraparticle resistances and availability of less number of active sites fig 10 represents the effect of ph on the adsorption of cu ii and cr vi by nanocomposite significant increase in the nanocomposite adsorption capacity was observed with increase in ph from 2 to 6 for both metal ions however further increase in ph showed negligible change in the nanocomposite adsorption capacity the adsorption capacity reached to a maximum value of 693 21 2 mg g 1 and 765 21 mg g 1 for cu ii and cr vi respectively at ph 6 5 hence ph 6 5 was taken as the optimum ph for further batch studies lesser adsorption capacity observed at low ph values of 2 and 4 might be due to the fact that under acidic conditions the presence of protons h on nanocomposite surface would have inhibited the adsorption of positively charged metal ions 37 80 in contrast at higher ph values 8 and 10 the precipitation of metals might be the major reason for the negligible change in the nanocomposite adsorption capacity it is well known that cr vi mainly exist as hcro4 and cro7 2 at low ph 81 hence the cr vi adsorption on nanocomposite is expected to increase with the decrease in ph however in the present study the decrease in adsorption of cr vi at lower ph may be due to the chelation phenomena between surface charges available at the nanocomposite surface and h which reduces the availability of active site for the cr vi adsorption 73 74 chelation phenomenon reduces with an increase in ph due to lesser availability of h and hence leads to higher adsorption of cr vi at higher ph as observed during the present study the change in solution ph with time due to the adsorption of cu ii and cr vi was also measured a decrease in ph value from 6 5 to 5 01 with time was observed after adsorption of cu ii which may be due to the displacement of h ions from nanocomposite surface by cu ii ions in contrast an increase in ph value from 6 5 to 6 9 with time was observed after cr vi adsorption it may be due to the interaction of cr2o7 2 negative form of cr vi at ph 6 7 with h ions present in the aqueous solution which leads to increase the concentration of oh and thereby increasing the solution ph metal ions concentration is an important parameter that can affect the adsorption capacity for cu ii and cr vi adsorption from aqueous solution fig 11 shows the effect of initial concentration of metal ions on equilibrium adsorption capacity of nanocomposite and the percent removal of cu ii and cr vi a significant increase in the nanocomposite adsorption capacity from 94 7 07 to 680 11 31 mg g 1 for cu ii and 93 9 15 to 720 16 97 mg g 1 for cr vi was observed with an increase in the initial metal ion concentration from 0 1 to 1 0 g l 1 respectively this may be due to the higher adsorption rate of metal ions on all the active sites of nanocomposite 82 the obtained data revealed a significant decrease in the percentage removal of both the metal ions with an increase in their initial concentration from 0 1 to 1 0 g l 1 which can be attributed to the fact that the active sites present on nanocomposite surface might got saturated after absorbing a certain concentration of metal ions 83 fig 12 represents the effect of nanocomposite amount on the adsorption capacity and percent removal of cu ii and cr vi ions the percentage removal increased from 30 2 to 100 and adsorption capacity decreased from 68 2 82 mg g 1 to 21 0 7 mg g 1 for cu ii with varying the nanocomposite dosage 0 2 to 4 g l 1 similarly for cr vi ions the percentage removal increased from 27 2 1 5 to 100 and the adsorption capacity decreased from 75 2 82 mg g 1 to 24 0 70 mg g 1with the varying nanocomposite dosage 0 2 g l 1 to 4 g l 1 the increased percentage removal observed for both cu ii and cr vi may be due to the availability of large amount of metal ions as the nanocomposite amount was increased while maintaining the constant metal ion concentration the amount of cu ii and cr vi adsorbed per unit mass of nanocomposite decreased significantly the availability of higher number of unutilized active sites on increased nanocomposite dosage would have resulted in this decreased adsorption capacity and hence adsorption capacity of nanocomposite decreases the optimum amount of nanocomposite for efficient cu ii and cr vi removal was found to be is obtained as 0 7 and 0 72 g l 1 respectively thermodynamic parameters are very significant to find out the spontaneity of adsorption process batch experiments were carried out for three different temperatures 298 308 and 328 k to calculate gibbs free energy δg entropy change δs and enthalpy change δh the adsorption capacity for nanocomposite increased from 680 21 to 788 11 31 mg g 1 for cu ii and 727 21 to 875 10 2 mg g 1 for cr vi with an increase in the temperature from 298 to 328 k respectively the observed increase in adsorption capacity may be due to the increased diffusion rate of metal ions on the boundary layer as well as inside pores of nanocomposite with the increase in temperature 84 the different thermodynamics parameters were estimated from the experimental results by fig 13 are listed in table 3 the negative value of δg depicts the spontaneity and feasibility of cu ii and cr vi adsorption on nanocomposite 54 the positive value of δh confirmed the endothermic process for the adsorption of cu ii and cr vi which also supported the increase in adsorption capacity of nanocomposite for cu ii and cr vi ions with increase in temperature 85 86 the positive and small value of δs confirmed the increase in randomness at the interface of nanocomposite and metal solution which suggested negligible change in the entropy change 84 heat evolved δh during physical and chemical adsorption were found to be are in the range of 2 1 20 9 kj mol 1 and 80 200 kj mol 1 respectively 87 the δh value observed was 16 59 and 15 25 kj mol 1 for cu ii and cr vi adsorption respectively which falls within the range of 2 1 20 9 kj mol 1 hence adsorption of both these metal ions on nanocomposite can be considered as physical adsorption this indicated the feasibility of regeneration of nanocomposite most of the industries utilize multiple metal ions during the manufacturing processes the effluent coming out from these industries contain a very high concentration of multiple metal ions the efficiency of nanocomposite was experimentally estimated for the removal of multiple metal ions the percentage removal of mn ii cu ii fe ii cr vi ni ii cd ii and zn ii was found to be 99 07 99 96 100 100 98 52 98 23 and 98 98 respectively which suggested the multifarious ability of nanocomposite for the treatment of industrial effluents at commercial level fig 14 ed xrf analysis of nanocomposite samples was carried out before and after adsorption of multiple metal ions after adsorption the weight percentage composition of mn ii cu ii fe ii cr vi ni ii and zn ii in nanocomposite was found to be 0 097 0 684 1 846 0 0121 0 0119 and 0 706 respectively the obtained results confirmed the presence of multiple metal ions on the surface of nanocomposite after adsorption it may be due to the fact that the negative functional groups no cooc o present on the surface of the nanocomposite contributed to the adsorption of positively charged metal ions the solid phase analysis showed highest adsorption of fe ii followed by cu ii and zn ii by nanocomposite 3 3 adsorption isotherm study adsorption isotherm study is required to understand the adsorption mechanism between metal ions and nanocomposite surface the best suited isotherm model for cu ii and cr vi adsorption on nanocomposite would be further helpful for designing the fixed bed adsorption column in the present study langmuir freundlich dubnin radushkevich and tempkin isotherm models were tested with experimentally obtained equilibrium data for cu ii and cr vi adsorption on nanocomposite and are shown in fig 15 a and b respectively the parameters of different isotherms along with the coefficient of determination values were estimated using non linear equation of different isotherm models with the help of origin 6 and represented in table 4 the obtained values of coefficient of determination r 2 for langmuir isotherm was found to be maximum 0 963 for cu ii and 0 937 for cr vi adsorption as compared to other isotherm models this confirms that the equilibrium data for cu ii and cr vi adsorption on nanocomposite can be suitably represented by the langmuir isotherm the maximum adsorption capacity of nanocomposite obtained using the langmuir isotherm was 815 mg g 1 and 867 85 mg g 1 for cu ii and cr vi adsorption respectively which is higher as compared to the adsorption capacity obtained from experimental results table 4 the dimensionless parameter r l remained in the range of 0 037 and 0 05 0 r l 1 which confirmed the favorable adsorption of cu ii and cr vi on nanocomposite surface langmuir isotherm assumes the uniform energy and complete coverage of the surface by the adsorbate 54 hence it confirms the monolayer adsorption of cu ii and cr vi on nanocomposite surface 3 4 adsorption kinetics to understand the kinetics of cu ii and cr vi removal using nanocomposite non linear form of pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were fitted with the experimental data fig 16 a and b the maximum adsorption capacity values were calculated as 678 45 and 766 58 mg g 1 for cu ii and cr vi adsorption respectively using pseudo first order kinetic model which are found to be approximately same with the values obtained from experimental results table 5 the values of first order rate constant k 1 was obtained as 0 00694 min 1 and 0 00697 min 1 for cu ii and cr vi adsorption respectively the r 2 values were obtained as 0 987 and 0 979 for cu ii and cr vi adsorption respectively the obtained q e values from first order model were found to be very close with the value obtained from experiments table 5 the values of second order rate constant were obtained as 0 0087 10 3 g mg 1 min 1 and 0 0079 10 3g mg 1 min 1 for cu ii and cr vi adsorption respectively table 5 the q e values were estimated as 836 mg g 1 and 939 mg g 1 for cu ii and cr vi adsorption respectively using the second order kinetic model although the q e values obtained from the second order kinetic model do not fit well with the experimental values table 5 the higher r 2 value 0 99 and 0 984 for cu ii and cr vi respectively suggests the applicability pseudo second order kinetic model the r 2 value of both pseudo first order and pseudo second order are higher than elovich kinetic model the β desorption constant value were found to be decreasing with increase in cu ii and cr vi concentration the lower value of β signifies the higher adsorption capacity of nanocomposite for cu ii and cr vi 3 5 mechanism of adsorption parameters for liquid film boundary layer and intra particular mass transfer were estimated using eq 3 and 4 and are reported in table 6 the r 2 values for intra particular diffusion model were found out to be 0 9614 for cu ii and 0 9611 for cr vi which were significantly higher than the values obtained for liquid film boundary layer model 0 6419 for cu ii and 0 6113 for cr vi the values of intercept i provide information about the thickness of the boundary layer i e the resistance to the external mass transfer 84 this confirms that the rate of adsorption of cu ii and cr vi on nanocomposite was controlled by intra particular diffusion the experimental results from effect of time studies also suggested the major role of intra particular diffusion the rate of adsorption of metals ions has significantly decreased after 30 min of adsorption time which may be due to the higher mass transfer resistance offered by intra particular diffusion 3 6 regeneration of nanoadsorbent the saturated adsorbent containing heavy metal ions is not safe for disposal due to environmental hazards hence it is important and appropriate to propose a method for the regeneration and reuse of nanocomposite the adsorption of cu ii and cr vi were highly ph dependent hence desorption of cu ii and cr vi were accomplished by decreasing the ph of the solution in the present study the saturated nanocomposite was treated with 0 01 0 1 0 5 and 1 m hcl data not shown out of all these acid concentrations 1 m hcl treated nanocomposite showed maximum desorption capacity for cu ii and cr vi adsorption hence 1 m hcl was considered for the regeneration of nanocomposite fig 17 clearly shows that the regenerated nanocomposite efficiently removes cu ii and cr vi ions up to 4 consecutive cycles negligible reduction in the percent removal of cu ii 98 5 93 and cr vi 98 3 95 1 was observed during these 4 cycles this may be due to the loss of active sites while repetitive regeneration of nanocomposite 40 these results shows the higher desorption efficiency of synthesized nanocomposite which could be reused for adsorption of metals in several cycles 3 7 comparison with other known nanoadsorbents in the present study nanocomposite was used as an adsorbent for cu ii and cr vi removal from aqueous solution the maximum adsorption capacity of nanocomposite obtained for cu ii and cr vi adsorption was 685 21 21 mg g 1 and 768 11 31 mg g 1 respectively table 7 compare the adsorbent capacity of nanocomposite with various nanoadsorbents reported in the literature and indicates the approximately 300 higher adsorption capacity of nanocomposite synthesized during the present study the metallic ion uptake on nanocomposite was mainly due to surface adsorption which depends on the contact time ph solute concentration adsorbent dosage temperature as well as available surface area 4 antimicrobial efficacy of synthesized nanocomposite the environmental toxicity of synthesized nanocomposite was checked by determining its antibacterial and antifungal activity against selected beneficial microbial species the bacterial cells 107 cfu ml 1 were exposed to nanocomposite at the efficient adsorbent dose concentration 0 4 mg ml 1 the obtained results showed that nanocomposite do not affect the bacterial growth the bacterial cell count for both the tested bacteria species are represented in table 8 similar results were obtained in the disc diffusion assay fig 18 which showed no zone of inhibition in case of the tested bacterial and fungal species the obtained results suggest that the risk free and safe use of nanocomposite at commercial and industrial levels as it do not show any harmful effect on the environment 98 5 conclusion the present study demonstrates the synthesis of silver nanoparticles combined with yttrium oxide ag y2o3 and their versatile application for the adsorption of multiple heavy metal ions with special reference to cu ii and cr vi the synthesized nanocomposite had a larger surface area 18 05 m2 g 1 suitable for the efficient adsorption of heavy metal ions the maximum adsorption capacity observed was 685 21 21 and 778 11 31 mg g 1 for cu ii and cr vi ions respectively which was found to be best at ph 6 5 the obtained adsorption capacity is approximately 300 more than the available reports in the literature the presence of negative functional groups on the nanocomposite surface was found to be helpful behind their excellent adsorption capacity for the positively charged metal ions the adsorption rate was found to be faster for the first 240 min and decreased at later time intervals in case of both cu ii and cr vi ions the equilibrium time of 720 min was obtained for cu ii and cr vi adsorption the thermodynamic parameters suggested the endothermic and spontaneous adsorption equilibrium data were best fitted with the langmuir isotherm model which confirmed the monolayer adsorption of cu ii and cr vi on nanocomposite the obtained results suggest the multifarious ability of nanocomposite for efficient removal of multiple metal ions from industrial effluent at commercial scale the synthesized nanocomposite was successfully regenerated several times through adsorption and desorption cycles the synthesized nanocomposite did not show any harmful effects on the tested microbial species indicating their safe use and disposal at commercial and industrial scale declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

14241,recently electrochemical methods have been studied as an alternative to conventional methods to treat industrial and municipal waters one such water the mining water has been mainly treated previously by electrocoagulation ec to remove metals few studies have been performed on the removal of sulfate nitrate and cyanide from mining waters in this paper results from 39 lab scale experiments on the elimination of sulfate by electrocoagulation with iron electrodes are presented significance of parameters affecting the removal of sulfate by ec was studied using response surface methodology rsm also results from kinetic studies and comparison of synthetic and real mining waters are reported according to kinetics studies it was suggested that both physical and chemical mechanisms are involved in sulfate removal at the same test conditions sulfate removal from both synthetic and real mining waters followed the same pattern the study concludes that the most significant parameters in sulfate removal are initial sulfate concentration and applied current when initial ph was insignificant in batch operation from a technology development perspective this study enhances knowledge about the significance of process parameters and their interactions as well as allows further scale up of the process keywords sulfate response surface method mining waters electrochemical treatment 1 introduction electrochemical water treatment is mainly represented by electrochemical oxidation and reduction electrocoagulation electroflotation and electrodialysis 1 among others electrocoagulation ec is a promising technique for the removal of various contaminants such as dyes 2 toxic metals 3 5 natural organic matter 6 8 arsenic 9 10 fluoride 11 13 cyanide 14 sulfate 15 17 nitrate 18 and other anions 19 currently at laboratory scale electrocoagulation has been successfully applied to treat water streams from oil 20 tannery 21 textile 22 23 paper 24 25 and food productions 26 27 mining 15 28 29 and polishing operations 30 31 as well as from municipal waters 32 33 some studies report that a potential application of ec could be the removal of toxic metals sulfate and nitrate removal from mining waters at different stages of mining operations 15 28 29 electrocoagulation of mining waters can be considered to be successful when contaminants are removed from water and destroyed or made less soluble with the application of the reacted and excited state 34 possible mechanisms of contaminants removal can be coagulation precipitation enmeshment complexation adsorption or charge neutralization of particles 35 36 the removal mechanisms depend on the water composition ph as well as redox potential 37 39 another significant factor affecting the removal mechanisms and electrocoagulation process is the electrode material that mainly influences the coagulation efficiency and process costs 40 however electrode material and subsequently the predominant species formed are not the only parameters affecting the electrocoagulation process hence reactor design applied current operating time presence of other contaminants ph temperature as well as the combination of factors may affect the process performance significantly 36 41 43 to study the significance and possible contribution of factors and their interactions to the process performance detailed research should be conducted incorrect combination of factors and misunderstanding their influence on each other may lead to the failures of the process thus at the beginning of the process development and its upcoming implementation it is necessary to gain information about the parameters affecting the process for instance reactor design generally influences the mixing and settling characteristics bubble pass and flotation efficiency applied current mainly affects anodic dissolution system lifetime unit size coagulant dosage and bubble generation removal rate and energy consumption depend on operating time while temperature influences current efficiency flocs formation as well as power consumption 36 42 considering the electrocoagulation treatment of mining waters it has been reported by several researchers that process performance is mainly affected by the reactor design electrodes arrangement current density initial ph electrode material and concentration of the contaminants 15 28 29 in the modern world of mining operation high sulfate concentrations operational process requirements and established discharged limits make it obligatory to develop and implement new sulfate removal technologies 44 one such technology the electrocoagulation has gained much attention from the scientific and industrial world the scientific literature lacks information regarding the design and scale up of ec reactors only few studies are devoted to the scale up and commercialization of electrochemical processes 45 48 thus cameselle et al 45 have reported on a successful scale up of electrochemical decolorization of a textile dye process from 1 l to 20 l when garcia segura et al 46 have provided a comprehensive review on scalability and commercial application of electrochemical removal of nitrate from groundwaters and industrial waters souza et al 47 have investigated the effect of stacking single electrochemical cells on the energy efficiency and process performance of treatment of pesticide containing water martín de vidales et al 48 compared the performances of both bench scale and pilot plant electrolysis for treatment of urban waters it compels researchers to start from the laboratory scale studies once developing an ec process intended to eliminate contaminants that have been rarely incompletely and unsystematically studied before 8 10 15 18 one of the systematic approaches a response surface methodology rsm 47 is frequently used to formalize laboratory scale studies of process performance the methodology helps to check the significance of the effect of different factors on the responses and to predict response values for given values of factors 47 48 previously rsm has been applied to investigate the effect of various parameters on electrocoagulation processes for the removal of natural organic matter 8 uranium 49 fluoride 50 nitrate 51 and copper 52 a comprehensive review of the modeling approaches for electrocoagulation can be found from 53 lacasa et al 54 have performed the modeling of electrocoagulation for the elimination of anions from water in this paper rsm was employed to study the effects of initial ph applied current and initial sulfate concentration on sulfate removal efficiency full factorial design 55 that results in detailed information about the significance of factors and their interactions as well as their influence on the responses was applied herein such an approach makes future implementation and sizing of ec treatment possible and brings technology to another level of operation additionally the behavior of the ec process during the treatment of synthetic and real mining waters was investigated and compared to evaluate if the synthetic waters can be used for small laboratory tests before actual treatment at the mine site moreover kinetic studies were performed to confirm the possible removal mechanisms of sulfate this work is supported by other studies on sulfate elimination where continuous treatment concept was developed 15 removal mechanisms different electrodes arrangement and a combination of ec with precipitation have been studied 17 56 2 materials and methods 2 1 ec equipment and procedure electrocoagulation experiments were conducted in a batch mode using 1000 ml jacketed plexiglas reactor detailed information about the equipment is available from elsewhere 56 the reactor was equipped with two pairs of iron electrodes connected in a monopolar arrangement total anode area was equal to 168 cm2 the applied current was maintained constant at 1 a 6 ma cm2 2 a 12 ma cm2 or 3 a 18 ma cm2 the duration of each test was 5 h samples of 20 ml were taken every hour allowed to settle and then filtered with a 0 2 μm syringe filter to produce a particle free sample a plastic curved blade turbine maintained proper mixing conditions at a speed of 150 rpm which corresponded to the tip speed of 0 60 m s electrodes were cleaned with 10 hcl merck kgaa solution and rinsed with distilled water before each run contents of the dissolved metals were measured with icp ms agilent technologies agilent 7900 residual sulfate chloride and nitrate concentrations were analyzed with ion chromatography dionex ics 1100 equipped with autosampler dionex as dv the mineralogical phases were all identified using the panalytical highscore plus 3 software and the crystallography open database cod all the analytical data are post processed using grainclassifier v1 9 incamineral classification software developed at the luleå university of technology for mineral identification reporting mineral grades and chemical composition of the samples 2 2 materials electrocoagulation tests were performed using both synthetic and real mining water contaminants and their concentrations to prepare synthetic mining waters have been chosen considering the real mining water compositions available from the reports and literature compositions of synthetic mining waters used during ec tests are given in table 1 57 the initial ph of synthetic mining waters equaled to 4 7 and 10 depending on the experimental conditions sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid solutions of 0 1 m were used to adjust the ph of waters before ec treatment beside sulfate mining waters are known to be heavily contaminated with metals cu2 ni2 zn2 mg2 ca2 and anions no3 cl presence of these ions may affect the ec performance and efficient removal of sulfate by electrocoagulation the effect of the presence of no3 cu2 zn2 and ni2 were also studied experiments were performed according to the experimental procedure described above using synthetic mining waters and na2so4 nacl solutions in this study the real mining water sample was collected from one of the mines located in finland and the initial concentrations of the monitored compounds are given in table 6 in section 3 4 there was no need to adjust the ph or conductivity of the initial sample due to the suitable ph value of 6 5 and high concentrations of anions bringing the conductivity to the desired level of 5 6 ms cm 2 3 experimental design and modeling regression modeling was performed in matlab 58 using the results from tests with synthetic waters three variables sulfate concentration x 1 initial ph of the solution x 2 and applied current x 3 were selected as study parameters for regression modeling the levels were equally spaced and dedicated to the high 3 g l ph 10 and 3 a intermediate 2 g l ph 7 and 2 a and low 1 g l ph 4 and 1 a values of the parameters a total number of the experiments according to the full factorial design was 3 k where k corresponds to the number of factors 55 in total 39 experiments were performed including the repetition of combinations at high intermediate and low factor levels table 2 shows experimental runs that were performed according to full factorial experimental design including the initial values of parameters as well as experimental and predicted values of the final concentration of sulfate measured values were obtained after 5 h of ec process after each run while predicted values were calculated using the eq 4 proposed by the final model the analysis of variance anova was used to assess the importance and significance of the model and its parameters kinetic models for sulfate removal were developed using the results obtained during the tests performed according to the full factorial design of experiments results were fitted to first eq 5 and second order eq 6 models to study mechanisms involved in sulfate removal by electrocoagulation 3 results and discussion 3 1 summary of laboratory results before applying the rsm to study the influence of different parameters on the sulfate removal by electrocoagulation some laboratory results that provide more profound understanding of the models and approaches described in this article are presented during the ec the removal rate of sulfate varied from 1 to 54 depending on the operational conditions the summary of changes in final sulfate concentration is given in fig 1 the increase in ph during the first hour of treatment was observed regardless of the initial ph and applied current thus the ph after the first hour of treatment varied from 11 to 12 17 resulting in ec process operation at alkaline conditions the increase in ph is due to the water oxidation at the anode and evolution of oh radical from the cathode a buffering effect of the iron oxides hydroxides mixture is mainly responsible for the stabilization of ph over 11 55 59 in addition to sulfate removal elimination of chloride was observed thus chloride removal at 2 a was as high as 41 for initial chloride concentration of 200 mg l with the presence of 2000 mg l of sulfate and initial ph 10 11 at 3 a chloride removal was as high as 63 for initial chloride concentration of 300 mg l with the presence of 1000 mg l of sulfate and initial ph 9 7 no chloride removal was observed at 1 a the decrease in chloride concentration can be explained by the formation of its intermediates such as chlorine hypochloride and chloramines downward trend in chloride elimination with a decrease in current density is in agreement with the results reported by llanos et al 33 and souza et al 47 applied constant current of 1 2 and 3 a resulted in the electrode consumption of 1 2 and 3 g per liter of treated water per hour respectively the generation of iron was repeatable and increased with the increase in the applied current the weight loss from electrodes was consistent with the theoretical amounts calculated based on the faraday s law assuming the release of fe2 from the anode the initially clear colorless solution became turbid orange suspension typical for fe iii hydroxides after 5 min and turned to brown green suspension at the end of the treatment according to literature among the possible iron compounds formed within the studied ranges of initial ph 4 7 10 redox 0 2 to 0 2 v and sulfate concentration are fe3o4 γ feooh and positively charged fe3 feoh fe oh 2 the most expected sulfate containing compounds were expected to be h3o fe so4 2 h2o 3 rhomboclase and its modifications 60 the detected xrd pattern of a synthetic magnetite amourphus feo was obtained by the reflections originated from the corresponding natural magnetite the xrd results confirmed the formation of fe2o4 and fe3o4 as the main products of ec treatment more phases containing sulfate were determined from the solid samples using sem results from sem demonstrated the formation of banded and granulated species containing fe o and s fig 2 shows a backscattered sem image of solid sample taken after the ec test at 3 a in fig 2 light gray color denotes the iron oxide gray color corresponds to the phase containing sulfate and dark gray color turns to phase with the presence of chloride to evaluate the effect of co existing ions separate tests were performed using synthetic mining waters table 1 and solutions containing only so4 2 and cl anions after 5 h of treatment at initial sulfate concentrations 1000 and 2000 mg l final concentrations of sulfate were comparable within the 5 range no significant effects of the presence of other contaminants on sulfate removal were observed however differences in final sulfate concentrations for 3000 mg l with the presence of 8 mg l of cu zn and ni is probably due to possible precipitation of metals sulfide within the studied ranges of final ph over 11 and redox below 0 2 v 61 similar trends were observed within the studied ranges of initial ph 4 7 and applied current 1 a 3 a as an example the results from ec tests at 2 a and ph 10 are presented in fig 3 3 2 regression modeling of sulfate removal by electrocoagulation firstly the simplest linear regression model eq 1 predicting the final sulfate concentration in ec treated solution was used to study the main parameters affecting the process performance obtained results show the primary influence of initial sulfate concentration in the solution and applied current no effect of the initial ph was observed secondly the simplest model has been improved by adding interaction and quadratic terms eq 2 1 y b0 b1x1 b2x2 b3x3 2 y b0 b1x1 b2x2 b3x3 b4x1x2 b5x2x3 b6x3x1 b7x1 2 b8x2 2 b9x3 2 the analysis of variance anova was performed to evaluate the importance and significance of the model analysis of anova results was performed with respect to a p value that is commonly compared to a widely acceptable significance level of 5 anova results revealed that some terms were insignificant and only parameters with the p values less than 0 05 were included in the final model results observed in table 3 illustrate that all p values of linear terms c0 i i ph0 and i 2 terms were less than 0 05 that explained the significance of these variables and showed their significant influence on the sulfate elimination by ec the rest of the variables were considered insignificant due to the high p values and were expected to have the least effect on final sulfate concentration even though anova results showed the significance of term ph0 p 0 002 0 05 in the regression model the coefficient of this parameter was of minor significance with the p value equaled to 0 068 the results are not presented here that was higher than 0 05 threshold additionally it was observed in experiments that regardless of the initial ph the ph of the solutions increased up to 12 after 1 h of treatment meaning that the electrocoagulation took place at alkaline conditions based on these findings the term ph0 was removed from the final regression model the influence of initial ph was taken into account in interaction term i ph0 of the model after the deletion of insignificant terms the model became 3 y b0 b1x1 b2x2 b3x1x2 b4x2x3 b5x2 2 according to the experimental data the final empirical model valid within the variable range of parameters investigated can be described as follows 4 cfp 0 44 1 16 c0 0 62 i 0 17 c0 i 0 17 i ph0 0 20 i2 the measured and predicted final sulfate concentrations obtained during the ec treatment of synthetic mining waters are shown in table 2 comparison of experimental and modeled data suggests the reasonably good prediction of final sulfate concentration after ec treatment by the suggested final model the goodness of fit criteria r2 was equal to 0 98 table 4 presents the coefficients of the final model and their t and p values the t value showed the significance of the regression parameters the higher the absolute t value was the greater was the influence of the parameter the adverse effects of the linear term of applied current and interaction terms were observed resulting in lower final sulfate concentration with the increase of these variables the positive effect of the linear term of initial sulfate concentration and square term of applied current resulted in higher final sulfate concentrations with the increase of these factors since the final concentration of a contaminant is a controlled value in current regulations and established discharge limits it was decided to mainly study the final concentration as a response the measured and predicted values of the final sulfate concentration achieved during the ec treatment with iron electrodes are shown in fig 4 measured values of final sulfate concentration were measured after 5 h of ec treatment and predicted values of final sulfate concentration were obtained by applying the developed model eq 4 comparison of modeled and experimental data suggests a good prediction of final sulfate concentration by the studied regression model in a qualitative consideration it can be seen that the linear regression model well reproduced experimental results the relative difference between the calculated and experimental values did not exceed 10 for most of the experiments in addition to the final sulfate concentration the effect of studied factors on the removal efficiency as one of the process performance parameters was investigated here removal efficiency was calculated based on the predicted final concentrations of sulfate and the influence of the studied parameters was demonstrated nine surface plots as a function of two factors initial ph ph0 and applied current i a applied current i a and initial sulfate concentration co g l initial ph ph0 and initial sulfate concentration co g l were built to illustrate the relationship between various ec operation parameters and sulfate removal the third factor was fixed at the corner points initial sulfate concentration co g l initial ph ph0 and applied current i a no significant effect of ph on sulfate removal at low current was observed however ph had an essential effect on the process efficiency with an increase in current this finding is illustrated on the surface plots in fig 5 a demonstrating that a combination of high applied current and high initial ph resulted in more efficient removal of sulfate this is due to the speciation of the metal species generated during the ec process at different ph condition surface plots in fig 5b reflected that sulfate removal with ec improved at an applied current above 2 a and concentrations lower than 3000 mg l fig 5c illustrated that sulfate removal increased with ph increasing in both cases fig 5b c more efficient sulfate removal for lower concentration at selected applied current may be due to the greater amount of the coagulant available 3 3 kinetic study in this work the kinetic study for the sulfate removal was performed for various applied currents and initial sulfate concentrations first and second order kinetic models were tested to study the removal rate and electrocoagulation mechanisms rate constants were determined using linearized time dependent concentration equations of first eq 5 and second order eq 6 models 62 5 lnc lnc0 k1t 6 1 c 1 c0 k2t where c mg l is the concentration of sulfate in the solution at the end of treatment c0 mg l is the initial sulfate concentration k1 min 1 and k2 mg l 1 min 1 are the first and second order constants correlation coefficients were gained by plotting linear trend lines and rate constants were obtained as slopes of these lines the goodness of the kinetic model was described using the correlation coefficient r2 the values of the rate constants and the correlation coefficients are summarized in table 5 as can be seen sulfate obeys relatively well both first and second order kinetics suggesting that both physical enmeshment and chemical co precipitation reactions are involved in the removal mechanisms 62 values of k1 and k2 increase when the applied current increases and concentration decreases the negligible removal rate of sulfate could be the reason for the small correlation coefficient at current 1 a and initial sulfate concentration of 2953 mg l studying electrochemical treatment of mining waters nariyan et al 17 proposed that sulfate follows the second order kinetic model however reported values for correlation coefficients are close to each other and no decision on the model can be made only based on the correlation coefficient additionally it should be mentioned that obtained values for k1 and k2 were in agreement with the reported study 17 higher r2 values and removal efficiencies illustrated that experimental conditions proposed in the present research were more suitable for sulfate removal 3 4 ec treatment of real mining waters to evaluate the treatment performance of electrocoagulation method for sulfate removal electrochemical tests were performed also with a real mining water sample the removal efficiencies at two test conditions were compared with the results obtained for synthetic mining water treatment at the same conditions by applying the currents of 2 and 3 a ec treatment at current 1 a was not performed due to negligible removal rates achieved during the tests with synthetic waters sulfate concentration was monitored and sulfate removals were compared with those obtained during the tests with synthetic mining waters in addition to sulfate elimination nitrate and metals removals were also monitored according to the results presented in table 6 elelctrocoagulation was found to be suitable for the partial removal of sulfate from synthetic waters and real mining waters almost complete removal of studied metals was achieved after 1 h of treatment while over 90 removal of nitrate was observed only after 5 h of treatment this study demonstrates that sulfate can be removed to a concentration below current limits established in finland and chile nariyan et al 2018b multi stage electrocoagulation treatment as well as a combination of electrocoagulation with other treatment technologies allow efficient removal of sulfate from mining waters below the current discharge limits in most parts of the world to predict the removal efficiencies during the treatment of real mining waters the developed model was used firstly predicted final concentrations were calculated and used to estimate the removal efficiencies the comparison of the experimental and predicted values is given in table 7 additionally to verify the model experimental results reported by nariyan et al 17 were used and the following conditions were fitted to the model current 3 25 a initial ph 12 initial sulfate concentration 1600 mg l iron electrodes and monopolar arrangements the predicted removal efficiency was 45 which was in agreement with the experimental results reported 40 removal of sulfate after 2 5 h of treatment validation of the model by using the results of real mining water ec treatment demonstrated that the developed model could be used to predict the final concentrations especially at high currents 4 conclusion the performed study on parameters affecting the sulfate removal from mining waters by electrocoagulation provided knowledge on the significance of the parameters and their interactions that makes future implementation and scale up of the process possible the highest removal could be achieved at the highest applied current highest ph and lowest initial sulfate concentration with the increase in initial ph from 4 to 10 no significant influence of initial sulfate concentration was observed in general the increase in applied current and initial ph favors the removal of sulfate the most significant parameter in sulfate removal was its initial concentration in water the increase in concentration challenged the sulfate elimination kinetic studies proposed that both physical and chemical mechanisms are involved in sulfate removal from mining waters by electrocoagulation the tests with the real water sample prove the suitability of ec treatment for the sulfate removal from real mining waters the model developed using the results of synthetic water treatment successfully predicted the final concentration of sulfate after ec treatment of real mining waters in addition to sulfate the removal of nitrate co2 ni2 zn2 cu2 and cd2 from real mining waters was observed after

14241,recently electrochemical methods have been studied as an alternative to conventional methods to treat industrial and municipal waters one such water the mining water has been mainly treated previously by electrocoagulation ec to remove metals few studies have been performed on the removal of sulfate nitrate and cyanide from mining waters in this paper results from 39 lab scale experiments on the elimination of sulfate by electrocoagulation with iron electrodes are presented significance of parameters affecting the removal of sulfate by ec was studied using response surface methodology rsm also results from kinetic studies and comparison of synthetic and real mining waters are reported according to kinetics studies it was suggested that both physical and chemical mechanisms are involved in sulfate removal at the same test conditions sulfate removal from both synthetic and real mining waters followed the same pattern the study concludes that the most significant parameters in sulfate removal are initial sulfate concentration and applied current when initial ph was insignificant in batch operation from a technology development perspective this study enhances knowledge about the significance of process parameters and their interactions as well as allows further scale up of the process keywords sulfate response surface method mining waters electrochemical treatment 1 introduction electrochemical water treatment is mainly represented by electrochemical oxidation and reduction electrocoagulation electroflotation and electrodialysis 1 among others electrocoagulation ec is a promising technique for the removal of various contaminants such as dyes 2 toxic metals 3 5 natural organic matter 6 8 arsenic 9 10 fluoride 11 13 cyanide 14 sulfate 15 17 nitrate 18 and other anions 19 currently at laboratory scale electrocoagulation has been successfully applied to treat water streams from oil 20 tannery 21 textile 22 23 paper 24 25 and food productions 26 27 mining 15 28 29 and polishing operations 30 31 as well as from municipal waters 32 33 some studies report that a potential application of ec could be the removal of toxic metals sulfate and nitrate removal from mining waters at different stages of mining operations 15 28 29 electrocoagulation of mining waters can be considered to be successful when contaminants are removed from water and destroyed or made less soluble with the application of the reacted and excited state 34 possible mechanisms of contaminants removal can be coagulation precipitation enmeshment complexation adsorption or charge neutralization of particles 35 36 the removal mechanisms depend on the water composition ph as well as redox potential 37 39 another significant factor affecting the removal mechanisms and electrocoagulation process is the electrode material that mainly influences the coagulation efficiency and process costs 40 however electrode material and subsequently the predominant species formed are not the only parameters affecting the electrocoagulation process hence reactor design applied current operating time presence of other contaminants ph temperature as well as the combination of factors may affect the process performance significantly 36 41 43 to study the significance and possible contribution of factors and their interactions to the process performance detailed research should be conducted incorrect combination of factors and misunderstanding their influence on each other may lead to the failures of the process thus at the beginning of the process development and its upcoming implementation it is necessary to gain information about the parameters affecting the process for instance reactor design generally influences the mixing and settling characteristics bubble pass and flotation efficiency applied current mainly affects anodic dissolution system lifetime unit size coagulant dosage and bubble generation removal rate and energy consumption depend on operating time while temperature influences current efficiency flocs formation as well as power consumption 36 42 considering the electrocoagulation treatment of mining waters it has been reported by several researchers that process performance is mainly affected by the reactor design electrodes arrangement current density initial ph electrode material and concentration of the contaminants 15 28 29 in the modern world of mining operation high sulfate concentrations operational process requirements and established discharged limits make it obligatory to develop and implement new sulfate removal technologies 44 one such technology the electrocoagulation has gained much attention from the scientific and industrial world the scientific literature lacks information regarding the design and scale up of ec reactors only few studies are devoted to the scale up and commercialization of electrochemical processes 45 48 thus cameselle et al 45 have reported on a successful scale up of electrochemical decolorization of a textile dye process from 1 l to 20 l when garcia segura et al 46 have provided a comprehensive review on scalability and commercial application of electrochemical removal of nitrate from groundwaters and industrial waters souza et al 47 have investigated the effect of stacking single electrochemical cells on the energy efficiency and process performance of treatment of pesticide containing water martín de vidales et al 48 compared the performances of both bench scale and pilot plant electrolysis for treatment of urban waters it compels researchers to start from the laboratory scale studies once developing an ec process intended to eliminate contaminants that have been rarely incompletely and unsystematically studied before 8 10 15 18 one of the systematic approaches a response surface methodology rsm 47 is frequently used to formalize laboratory scale studies of process performance the methodology helps to check the significance of the effect of different factors on the responses and to predict response values for given values of factors 47 48 previously rsm has been applied to investigate the effect of various parameters on electrocoagulation processes for the removal of natural organic matter 8 uranium 49 fluoride 50 nitrate 51 and copper 52 a comprehensive review of the modeling approaches for electrocoagulation can be found from 53 lacasa et al 54 have performed the modeling of electrocoagulation for the elimination of anions from water in this paper rsm was employed to study the effects of initial ph applied current and initial sulfate concentration on sulfate removal efficiency full factorial design 55 that results in detailed information about the significance of factors and their interactions as well as their influence on the responses was applied herein such an approach makes future implementation and sizing of ec treatment possible and brings technology to another level of operation additionally the behavior of the ec process during the treatment of synthetic and real mining waters was investigated and compared to evaluate if the synthetic waters can be used for small laboratory tests before actual treatment at the mine site moreover kinetic studies were performed to confirm the possible removal mechanisms of sulfate this work is supported by other studies on sulfate elimination where continuous treatment concept was developed 15 removal mechanisms different electrodes arrangement and a combination of ec with precipitation have been studied 17 56 2 materials and methods 2 1 ec equipment and procedure electrocoagulation experiments were conducted in a batch mode using 1000 ml jacketed plexiglas reactor detailed information about the equipment is available from elsewhere 56 the reactor was equipped with two pairs of iron electrodes connected in a monopolar arrangement total anode area was equal to 168 cm2 the applied current was maintained constant at 1 a 6 ma cm2 2 a 12 ma cm2 or 3 a 18 ma cm2 the duration of each test was 5 h samples of 20 ml were taken every hour allowed to settle and then filtered with a 0 2 μm syringe filter to produce a particle free sample a plastic curved blade turbine maintained proper mixing conditions at a speed of 150 rpm which corresponded to the tip speed of 0 60 m s electrodes were cleaned with 10 hcl merck kgaa solution and rinsed with distilled water before each run contents of the dissolved metals were measured with icp ms agilent technologies agilent 7900 residual sulfate chloride and nitrate concentrations were analyzed with ion chromatography dionex ics 1100 equipped with autosampler dionex as dv the mineralogical phases were all identified using the panalytical highscore plus 3 software and the crystallography open database cod all the analytical data are post processed using grainclassifier v1 9 incamineral classification software developed at the luleå university of technology for mineral identification reporting mineral grades and chemical composition of the samples 2 2 materials electrocoagulation tests were performed using both synthetic and real mining water contaminants and their concentrations to prepare synthetic mining waters have been chosen considering the real mining water compositions available from the reports and literature compositions of synthetic mining waters used during ec tests are given in table 1 57 the initial ph of synthetic mining waters equaled to 4 7 and 10 depending on the experimental conditions sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid solutions of 0 1 m were used to adjust the ph of waters before ec treatment beside sulfate mining waters are known to be heavily contaminated with metals cu2 ni2 zn2 mg2 ca2 and anions no3 cl presence of these ions may affect the ec performance and efficient removal of sulfate by electrocoagulation the effect of the presence of no3 cu2 zn2 and ni2 were also studied experiments were performed according to the experimental procedure described above using synthetic mining waters and na2so4 nacl solutions in this study the real mining water sample was collected from one of the mines located in finland and the initial concentrations of the monitored compounds are given in table 6 in section 3 4 there was no need to adjust the ph or conductivity of the initial sample due to the suitable ph value of 6 5 and high concentrations of anions bringing the conductivity to the desired level of 5 6 ms cm 2 3 experimental design and modeling regression modeling was performed in matlab 58 using the results from tests with synthetic waters three variables sulfate concentration x 1 initial ph of the solution x 2 and applied current x 3 were selected as study parameters for regression modeling the levels were equally spaced and dedicated to the high 3 g l ph 10 and 3 a intermediate 2 g l ph 7 and 2 a and low 1 g l ph 4 and 1 a values of the parameters a total number of the experiments according to the full factorial design was 3 k where k corresponds to the number of factors 55 in total 39 experiments were performed including the repetition of combinations at high intermediate and low factor levels table 2 shows experimental runs that were performed according to full factorial experimental design including the initial values of parameters as well as experimental and predicted values of the final concentration of sulfate measured values were obtained after 5 h of ec process after each run while predicted values were calculated using the eq 4 proposed by the final model the analysis of variance anova was used to assess the importance and significance of the model and its parameters kinetic models for sulfate removal were developed using the results obtained during the tests performed according to the full factorial design of experiments results were fitted to first eq 5 and second order eq 6 models to study mechanisms involved in sulfate removal by electrocoagulation 3 results and discussion 3 1 summary of laboratory results before applying the rsm to study the influence of different parameters on the sulfate removal by electrocoagulation some laboratory results that provide more profound understanding of the models and approaches described in this article are presented during the ec the removal rate of sulfate varied from 1 to 54 depending on the operational conditions the summary of changes in final sulfate concentration is given in fig 1 the increase in ph during the first hour of treatment was observed regardless of the initial ph and applied current thus the ph after the first hour of treatment varied from 11 to 12 17 resulting in ec process operation at alkaline conditions the increase in ph is due to the water oxidation at the anode and evolution of oh radical from the cathode a buffering effect of the iron oxides hydroxides mixture is mainly responsible for the stabilization of ph over 11 55 59 in addition to sulfate removal elimination of chloride was observed thus chloride removal at 2 a was as high as 41 for initial chloride concentration of 200 mg l with the presence of 2000 mg l of sulfate and initial ph 10 11 at 3 a chloride removal was as high as 63 for initial chloride concentration of 300 mg l with the presence of 1000 mg l of sulfate and initial ph 9 7 no chloride removal was observed at 1 a the decrease in chloride concentration can be explained by the formation of its intermediates such as chlorine hypochloride and chloramines downward trend in chloride elimination with a decrease in current density is in agreement with the results reported by llanos et al 33 and souza et al 47 applied constant current of 1 2 and 3 a resulted in the electrode consumption of 1 2 and 3 g per liter of treated water per hour respectively the generation of iron was repeatable and increased with the increase in the applied current the weight loss from electrodes was consistent with the theoretical amounts calculated based on the faraday s law assuming the release of fe2 from the anode the initially clear colorless solution became turbid orange suspension typical for fe iii hydroxides after 5 min and turned to brown green suspension at the end of the treatment according to literature among the possible iron compounds formed within the studied ranges of initial ph 4 7 10 redox 0 2 to 0 2 v and sulfate concentration are fe3o4 γ feooh and positively charged fe3 feoh fe oh 2 the most expected sulfate containing compounds were expected to be h3o fe so4 2 h2o 3 rhomboclase and its modifications 60 the detected xrd pattern of a synthetic magnetite amourphus feo was obtained by the reflections originated from the corresponding natural magnetite the xrd results confirmed the formation of fe2o4 and fe3o4 as the main products of ec treatment more phases containing sulfate were determined from the solid samples using sem results from sem demonstrated the formation of banded and granulated species containing fe o and s fig 2 shows a backscattered sem image of solid sample taken after the ec test at 3 a in fig 2 light gray color denotes the iron oxide gray color corresponds to the phase containing sulfate and dark gray color turns to phase with the presence of chloride to evaluate the effect of co existing ions separate tests were performed using synthetic mining waters table 1 and solutions containing only so4 2 and cl anions after 5 h of treatment at initial sulfate concentrations 1000 and 2000 mg l final concentrations of sulfate were comparable within the 5 range no significant effects of the presence of other contaminants on sulfate removal were observed however differences in final sulfate concentrations for 3000 mg l with the presence of 8 mg l of cu zn and ni is probably due to possible precipitation of metals sulfide within the studied ranges of final ph over 11 and redox below 0 2 v 61 similar trends were observed within the studied ranges of initial ph 4 7 and applied current 1 a 3 a as an example the results from ec tests at 2 a and ph 10 are presented in fig 3 3 2 regression modeling of sulfate removal by electrocoagulation firstly the simplest linear regression model eq 1 predicting the final sulfate concentration in ec treated solution was used to study the main parameters affecting the process

been improved by adding interaction and quadratic terms eq 2 1 y b0 b1x1 b2x2 b3x3 2 y b0 b1x1 b2x2 b3x3 b4x1x2 b5x2x3 b6x3x1 b7x1 2 b8x2 2 b9x3 2 the analysis of variance anova was performed to evaluate the importance and significance of the model analysis of anova results was performed with respect to a p value that is commonly compared to a widely acceptable significance level of 5 anova results revealed that some terms were insignificant and only parameters with the p values less than 0 05 were included in the final model results observed in table 3 illustrate that all p values of linear terms c0 i i ph0 and i 2 terms were less than 0 05 that explained the significance of these variables and showed their significant influence on the sulfate elimination by ec the rest of the

14242,forward osmosis fo has been listed as one of the best strategies to combat growing worldwide water scarcity not only fo but all membrane based technologies are still suffering from unpleasant fouling propensity hindering their continuous performance in a long term application using polyaniline pani and graphene herein we fabricated a novel electro conductive membrane graphene pani laminated membrane gpanilm through laminating by facile pressure assisted technique onto polyamide imide pai support layer to improve the mechanical stability of the fabricated film via crosslinking of pani with graphene nanosheetsthe membrane was thermal treated in 140 c for 3 h gpanilm 140 both nanocomposite membranes gpanilm and gpanilm 140 demonstrated excellent mechanical stability and their performances in terms of water permeation jw and reverse salt flux js were verified using a regular fo desalination system our results showed that the selectivity ratios js jw of gpanilm and gpanilm

anti fouling behaviors of the electro conductive membranes were investigated by a fs containing alginate as a model organic foulant by applying 2 v anodic potential both flux recovery rate frr and fouling resistance were substantially improved in both membranes keywords forward osmosis conductive membranes graphene polyaniline nanocomposite anti fouling properties 1 introduction the fo process has recently received considerable attention from research and industrial communities due to its great potentials in addressing global water scarcity 1 4 fo utilizes the natural osmotic pressure gradient as driving force across a semi permeable membrane to drag water molecules from a diluted fs with higher water chemical potential to a concentrated draw solution ds with lower water chemical potential 5 8 comparing to pressure driven membrane processes e g reverse osmosis ro fo exhibits many advantages in practice such as lower fouling tendency as well as potentially reduced energy consumption 9 11 the main reason for such important achievements in fo is the lack of hydraulic pressure which conversely is a very essential factor to conduct any pressure driven membrane processes despite these advantages practical applications of fo in real desalination plants are still restricted by the availability of high performance membranes with high water flux low fouling tendency and high selectivity 12 thin film composite tfc membranes have been considered as a gold standard for desalination of seawater through different technologies 13 14 the tfc membrane could be fabricated by interfacial polymerization ip reaction of polyamide pa upon a suitable support layer which is mainly responsible for mechanical stability 15 17 although the highly crosslinked pa film shows very good performances in water permeation and solute rejection its long term applicability in the fo process is still under doubt one of the major bottlenecks of the pa layer appears when the tfc membrane is working in a high chlorine environment chlorination is the most commonly used disinfection process to pretreat the water to reduce fouling and thus it is potentially able to deteriorate pa layer structure 18 also the pa layer covers by a nano scale ridge and valley structure on which foulants could easily accumulate due to its higher effective surface area 19 furthermore the high density of carboxyl group as well as the hydrophobic nature of the pa layer can enhance fouling propensity of the tfc membranes 20 graphene is an allotrope of carbon which possesses one atom thick planar sheet

carboxyl are removed to some extents 21 22 two dimensional structure with sub nanometric surface apertures enables graphene as a promising barrier for selective mass transport 23 it was reported that using go in the membrane materials could reduce interfacial energy between the membrane s surface and water molecules 24 25 this fact can improve surface and bulk hydrophilicity and make anti fouling properties in the go modified membranes laminating go nanosheets onto a polymeric porous support layer has been found as a feasible technique to fabricate a go based membrane 26 27 in this state the neighboring go nanosheets create specific nanochannels allowing extraordinary water permeation while rejecting other solutes species these free spaces are commonly termed as d spacing and play a very crucial role in the go membrane selectivity 28 the d spacing could be measured via xrd technique which in dry go film was determined to be 0 8 0 1 nm 29 but in wet environments hydrophilic functional groups of go could be hydrated by water molecules increasing d spacing and thereby impairing membrane s separation efficacy 30 31 due to lack of interlayer functional groups in graphene its d spacing is lower than the go one which was measured to be about 0 34 nm this value is not affected by any peripheral conditions meaning that graphene based membranes are conversely able to show stable separation performance for long working hours however graphene sheets suffer from lower hydrophilicity that may result in a higher fouling propensity recently electro conductive membranes have opened

rejections of the obtained membranes in fo desalination process were measured through a lab scale cross flow fo set up as described in our previous reports 6 25 the system was operated by the circulation of ds containing 1 m nacl and fs of pure water flowing counter currently on each side of the embedded membrane at a constant flow rate of 0 2 l min 8 cm s in room temperature to better assess the membrane performance all fo tests were conducted in both pro active layer facing ds mode and fo active layer facing fs mode by employing a digital weight balance mettler toledo at the ds side which was connected to a computer data logging system water permeation in any desired intervals was exactly recorded in the fo experiments the water flux jv lm2 h 1 denoted as lmh and reverse salt flux js gm 2 h 1 denoted as gmh were respectively determined as follows 6 36 1 j v δ v a m δ t 2 j s c t v t c 0 v 0 a m δ t where δv l is the volume change of the ds over an interval time δt h also am is the effective membrane surface area m2 c0 and v0 are the initial salt concentration and fs volume and ct and vt are their corresponding values at time t respectively to measure salt concentration values during the fo tests a calibrated electrical conductivity sensor was put in the feed side increasing the accuracy every experiment was repeated three times and the final results were reported with standard deviations 2 7 membrane fouling tests protocol fouling experiments were carried out in the same cross flow system schematically shown in fig 2 where a 4 l model fs containing sa 500 ppm cacl2 1 mm and na2so4 10 mm was used as a fs again 1 m nacl solution was used as a ds and prior to starting each run both solutions were circulated for 60 min to ensure flow stabilization and membrane equilibrium afterward the pre weighted sa was added to fs to initialize the fouling test every fouling experiment was performed in room temperature for 24 h with a cross flow velocity of 8 cm s during this step initial and final water fluxes are respectively called j0 and js were determined by a digital balance thereafter in order to assess fouling reversibility the membrane surfaces were simply washed by di water at elevated cross flow velocity of 80 cm s and the recovered water fluxes jr were simply measured after reaching a steady water flux to further analyze the anti fouling properties of the membranes flux recovery rate frr and total fouling rate rt values were calculated as follows 37 3 f r r j r j 0 100 4 r t j 0 j s j 0 100 to investigate fouling behavior of the prepared membranes under the electrical field a dc power supply instek gps 4303 200 w 4 channels was used where its anode and cathode were respectively connected to the membrane surface and a thin stainless steel sheet radius 1 cm the distance between anode and cathode was adjusted to be 5 mm using two copper tapes a 2 v electric potential was applied on the membrane surface 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of graphene fig 3 a represents the tem image of the synthesized graphene the obtained transparent planar structure clearly proved the successful synthesis of graphene via improved hummer method followed by hydrazine chemical reduction to gain further insight into the morphology of graphene its fesem image was also taken as shown in fig 3b the nano structural graphene sheets could be easily observed confirming tem analysis result energy dispersive spectroscopy eds was also conducted from the same analysis region and the resultants were plotted as a red spectrum on the fesem image as could be seen the o c ratio was 0 0175 in graphene sample indicating that the oxygen functional groups on the go were almost removed after hydrazine treatment according to xrd pattern which was taken for the synthesized graphene fig 3c demonstrated a broad peak at 2θ 26 02 indicating that graphene was successfully synthesized through the utilized procedure 38 bet analysis from the synthesized graphene is represented in fig 3d it showed that the sbet and total pore volume of graphene were 210 11 m2 gr and 1 24 cm3 gr respectively 3 2 characterization of the prepared membranes to get more insight into chemical structures of as synthesized membranes their atr ftir spectrums were provided and the obtained results are illustrated in fig 4 a as seen both membranes have very similar atr ftir peaks implying that post thermal treatment did not have any influence on the chemical structure of the membrane two absorption peaks at 2984 and 2893 cm 1 attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric ch2 stretching vibrations of the methylene groups in graphene 39 the cn stretching mode in pani is represented by a peak at 1370 cm 1 mainly due to its benzoid structure 40 furthermore the peaks at 1081 and 861 cm 1 ascribe to the absorption of aromatic ch in plane bending and out of plane ch bending vibrations respectively 41 we explored the influences that post thermal treatment exerted on the hydrophilicity nanocomposite membranes according to the results obtained via water contact angle measurements shown in fig 4b gpanilm had higher hydrophilicity compared to the gpanilm 140 due to the lack of hydrophilic functional groups graphene may increase the hydrophobicity of both membranes whereas pani contains secondary amine groups improving overall hydrophilicity in addition the difference between the hydrophilicity of gpanilm and gpanilm 140 membranes could be attributed to the surface roughness generally the contact angle is smaller on a rough surface of the same material 42 the material is therefore even more wettable therefore the gpanilm membrane with rougher surface fig 7 would possess the lower water contact angle to assess surface charge densities of the prepared membranes their zeta potentials were measured in different ph values and the obtained results are depicted in fig 5 the observed zeta potential profiles could be explained through two possible reasons 1 existence of negative charges corresponding to the remained oxygen containing functional groups of graphene and 2 presence of pani chains with positive charges on the surface of gpanilm and gpanilm 140 membranes 43 45 the pi a ph which zeta potential is zero value for pani was reported to be 10 29 meaning that in phs less than the pi nitrogen of imine groups could be protonated in a wide range of phs 46 it caused the pani to carry positive charges in this ph range in general the gpanilm 140 membrane showed a more positive surface than the gpanilm one thermal annealing of gpanilm 140 may provide a better condition for pani chains to place in membrane s external surface fig 6 shows sem images of gpanilm and gpanilm 140 membranes which were obtained from their top surfaces in both membranes the surface was almost coated by the planar structure of graphene the specific channels between two neighboring graphene sheets could cause strong molecular sieving effect that is very beneficial for getting an optimal selectivity after post thermal treatment the gpanilm 140 membrane shows a smoother surface than that of the gpanilm membrane due to the gradual removal of the oxygen species and solvent between the nanosheets packing them more tightly 47 therefore the thermal annealing is not only concerned with removing atomic scale lattice defects but is also aimed at restoration the conjugated network of the graphitic lattice 45 these structural changes result in the recovery of electrical conductivity and other properties of gpanilm 140 membrane surface roughness has a considerable influence on direct and indirect interactions between membranes and foulant s molecules manifesting in antifouling behavior of the membrane 5 48 49 to assess this important characteristic afm images were taken for both membranes and the obtained results are shown in fig 7 we hypothesize that thermal treatment shall decrease the roughness of gpanilm 140 and be favorable to improve the anti fouling property of gpanilm 140 membrane the surface average roughness ra of the gpanilm was 97 4 8 9 nm while this value for the gpanilm 140 membrane was 86 5 8 7 nm which is consistent with the results observed using sem as mentioned above the post thermal treatment in 140 c could make the outer membrane s surface a little more uniform and consequently reduce its roughness 3 3 fo performance the performances of newly fabricated membranes in terms of water flux and reverse salt flux were evaluated via a regular fo setup which is shown in fig 8 comparing to fo mode both membranes illustrated higher water fluxes in pro mode as mentioned before in pro mode the ds is facing to the top thin active layer of the membrane in such condition the draw solute concentration over the membrane surface is considerably higher than fo mode 50 in another word due to having a thick support layer structure in the front of ds the osmotic pressure difference across the membrane s top thin active layer in fo mode is lower than the pro one leading to the lower driving force and water flux in fo mode despite the fact that higher water fluxes could be achieved in pro orientation but in this state the porous support layer of membrane is facing the fs which is possibly containing natural foulants therefore the membrane is more prone to be fouled in pro configuration when it is working in a real environment the gpanilm represented water fluxes of 8 4 and 20 3 lmh in fo and pro modes respectively the performance of gpanilm 140 membrane in both modes was slightly lower than the gpanilm one molecules transport paths through graphene membranes are considered to be mainly dependent on the size of nanochannel in graphene membranes 51 these channels can allow water molecules to pass but reject hydrated ions the above investigations indicate that thermal treatment successfully changed nanochannels size of gpanilm 140 with thermal treatment the d spacing between graphene nanosheets changed and further affected the performance of membranes given that the post thermal treatment tight the graphene nanosheets we can attribute the reduction of water flux rate to the decrease of nano channel size of gpanilm 140 membrane assessment of reverse salt flux through an ec meter revealed that there is a trade off relationship between water permeability and salt rejection in the pani graphene nanocomposite membranes in salt rejection terms it was observed that by post thermal annealing the reverse salt flux decreased from 6 2 gmh in fo mode for gpanilm to 4 3 gmh for gpanilm 140 membrane in other words the reverse salt flux decreased as the interlayer distance was diminished by thermal annealing from the trade off relation between water flux and solute rejection of graphene based membranes we could deduce that the size of 2d nano channel was reduced by post thermal annealing selectivity ratio js jw as an independent factor from the properties of the support layer and ds could be determined to better compare the efficiency of two different membranes our results showed that the selectivity ratios for gpanilm and gpanilm 140 are 0 79 and 0 69 g l in fo mode and 0 67 and 0 58 g l in pro mode respectively these findings translate to a better overall performance of gpanilm 140 membrane compared to the gpanilm one 3 4 antifouling test fouling parameter of gpanilm and gpanilm 140 membranes in terms of values of flux recovery rate frr and total fouling rate rt was measured using eqs 3 and 4 respectively and the obtained results are illustrated in fig 9 as mentioned before 500 ppm of sa as a model organic foulant was added to the fs in the fouling tests calcium cations were also used to assist gel layer formation of alginate anions on the fo membrane this thick layer provides resistance to water flux so decline the water flux during fo test the experimental data showed that the rt values for gpanilm and gpanilm 140 membranes are about 53 5 and 45 4 respectively comparing to the gpanilm membrane with frr 71 6 the gpanilm 140 membrane demonstrated slightly better performance in the flux recovery rate with frr 79 9 one of the possible reason for such observation is more negative charge density of gpanilm surface compared to gpanilm 140 one according to the zeta potential results which are depicted in fig 5 the effect of membrane charge is most significant on membranes fouled by alginate due to gel formation in the presence of calcium cations gel forming is caused by the divalent calcium ions in solution cross linking the carboxyls of the membrane surface with the carboxyl groups of the sa macromolecules this fouling mechanism enhanced the attachment of sa macromolecules to the membrane with more negative charge surface 52 54 by imposing 2 v of electric potential the anti fouling behaviors were remarkably changed where the frr values for gpanilm and gpanilm 140 membranes were improved to 95 9 and 98 8 respectively direct eq 5 and indirect electro oxidation eqs 6 and 7 of organic alginate could mainly involve in this improvement 5 s a a d s n e s a o x i d i z e d 6 m h 2 o m o h h e 7 m o h s a m s a o x i d i z e d h e from the kinetic viewpoint the rate of direct oxidation is very low meaning that alginate molecules were almost degraded by the indirect pathway 55 in the indirect mechanism the electro conductive membrane surface m is initially oxidized in which super active hydroxyl radicals oh could be produced via oxidation of water subsequently they are able to attack the organic backbone of alginate and destroy it 56 there are other side reactions that may occur on the surface of the membrane when 2 v electrical potential is applying on it due to the lower potential which is required for oxygen evolution reaction oer on the carbon based electrodes 55 oxygen could be generated on the surface of both membranes in the first step higher oxide or superoxide m o may be formed on the surface through deprotonation of m oh 57 8 m o h m o h e afterward oxygen could be evolved on the membrane surface as follows 9 m o m 1 2 o 2 it was previously proved that gas bubbling i e oxygen is strongly able to mitigate membrane fouling and improve its water permeability 58 furthermore in this study the membranes were connected to the anode of a dc power supply during electro oxidation imposing a positive charge on the surface therefore the electrostatic repulsive effect generating between the membrane s surface and calcium cations bridging agent could also decline the fouling tendency of the electro conductive membranes to some extent 4 conclusion in this study novel electro conductive membranes were fabricated via simple pressure assisted filtration of pani graphene nanocomposite on the pai support layer and their performances in terms of water permeation reverse salt flux and anti fouling propensity were systematically evaluated in fo desalination process tightly packed graphene nanosheets stabilized by long chains of pani made specific channels within the top thin layer of membranes improving membrane performance in both permeability and selectivity the observed excellent anti fouling properties in the prepared membranes can also be explained through four different mechanisms including direct and indirect electro oxidation oxygen bubbling and electrostatic repulsive interactions acknowledgment the authors gratefully acknowledge financial and instrumental support received by the

has recently received considerable attention from research and industrial communities due to its great potentials in addressing global water scarcity 1 4 fo utilizes the natural osmotic pressure gradient as driving force across a semi permeable membrane to drag water molecules from a diluted fs with higher water chemical potential to a concentrated draw solution ds with lower water chemical potential 5 8 comparing to pressure driven membrane processes e g reverse osmosis ro fo exhibits many advantages in practice such as lower fouling tendency as well as potentially reduced energy consumption 9 11 the main reason for such important achievements in fo is the lack of hydraulic pressure which conversely is a very essential factor to conduct any pressure driven membrane processes despite these advantages practical applications of fo in real desalination plants are still restricted by the availability of high performance membranes with high water flux low fouling tendency and high selectivity 12 thin film composite tfc membranes have been considered as a gold standard for desalination of seawater through different technologies 13 14 the tfc membrane could be fabricated by

also am is the effective membrane surface area m2 c0 and v0 are the initial salt concentration and fs volume and ct and vt are their corresponding values at time t respectively to measure salt concentration values during the fo tests a calibrated electrical conductivity sensor was put in the feed side increasing the accuracy every experiment was repeated three times and the final results were reported with standard deviations 2 7 membrane fouling tests protocol fouling experiments were carried out in the same cross flow system schematically shown in fig 2 where a 4 l model fs containing sa 500 ppm cacl2 1 mm and na2so4 10 mm was used as a fs again 1 m nacl solution was used as a ds and prior to starting each run both solutions were circulated for 60 min to ensure flow stabilization and membrane equilibrium afterward the pre weighted sa was added to fs to initialize the fouling test every fouling experiment was performed in room temperature for 24 h with a cross flow velocity of 8 cm s during this step initial and final water fluxes are respectively called j0 and js were determined by a digital balance thereafter in order to assess fouling reversibility the membrane surfaces were simply washed by di water at elevated cross flow velocity of 80 cm s and the recovered water fluxes jr were simply measured after reaching a steady water flux to further analyze the anti fouling properties of the membranes flux recovery rate frr and total fouling rate rt values were calculated as follows 37 3 f r r j r j 0 100 4 r t j 0 j s j 0 100 to investigate fouling behavior of the prepared membranes under the electrical field a dc power supply instek gps 4303 200 w 4 channels was used where its anode and cathode were respectively connected to the membrane surface and a thin stainless steel sheet radius 1 cm the distance between anode and cathode was adjusted to be 5 mm using two copper tapes a 2 v electric potential was applied on the membrane surface 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of graphene fig 3 a represents the tem image of the synthesized graphene the obtained transparent planar structure clearly proved the successful synthesis of graphene via improved hummer method followed by hydrazine chemical reduction to gain further insight into the morphology of graphene its fesem image was also taken as shown in fig 3b the nano structural graphene sheets could be easily observed confirming tem analysis result energy dispersive spectroscopy eds was also conducted from the same analysis region and the resultants were plotted as a red spectrum on the fesem image as could be seen the o c ratio was 0 0175 in graphene sample indicating that the oxygen functional groups on the go were almost removed after hydrazine treatment according to xrd pattern which was taken for the synthesized graphene fig 3c demonstrated a broad peak at 2θ 26 02 indicating that graphene was successfully synthesized through the utilized procedure 38 bet analysis from the synthesized graphene is represented in fig 3d it showed that the sbet and total pore volume of graphene were 210 11 m2 gr and 1 24 cm3 gr respectively 3 2 characterization of the prepared membranes to get more insight into chemical structures of as synthesized membranes their atr ftir spectrums were provided and the obtained results are illustrated in fig 4 a as seen both membranes have very similar atr ftir peaks implying that post thermal treatment did not have any influence on the chemical structure of the membrane two absorption peaks at 2984 and 2893 cm 1 attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric ch2 stretching vibrations of the methylene groups in graphene 39 the cn stretching mode in pani is represented by a peak at 1370 cm 1 mainly due to its benzoid structure 40 furthermore the peaks at 1081 and 861 cm 1 ascribe to the absorption of aromatic ch in plane bending and out of plane ch bending vibrations respectively 41 we explored the influences that post thermal treatment exerted on the hydrophilicity nanocomposite membranes according to the results obtained via water contact angle measurements shown in fig 4b gpanilm had higher hydrophilicity compared to the gpanilm 140 due to the lack of hydrophilic functional groups graphene may increase the hydrophobicity of both membranes whereas pani contains secondary amine groups improving overall hydrophilicity in addition the difference between the hydrophilicity of gpanilm and gpanilm 140 membranes could be attributed to the surface roughness generally the contact angle is smaller on a rough surface of the same material 42 the material is therefore even more wettable therefore the gpanilm membrane with rougher surface fig 7 would possess the lower water contact angle to assess surface charge densities of the prepared membranes their zeta potentials were measured in different ph values and the obtained results are depicted in fig 5 the observed zeta potential profiles could be explained through two possible reasons 1 existence of negative charges corresponding to the remained oxygen containing functional groups of graphene and 2 presence of pani chains with positive charges on the surface of gpanilm and gpanilm 140 membranes 43 45 the pi a ph which zeta potential is zero value for pani was reported to be 10 29 meaning that in phs less than the pi nitrogen of imine groups could be protonated in a wide range of phs 46 it caused the pani to carry positive charges in this ph range in general the gpanilm 140 membrane showed a more positive surface than the gpanilm one thermal annealing of gpanilm 140 may provide a better condition for pani chains to place in membrane s external surface fig 6 shows sem images of gpanilm and gpanilm 140 membranes which were obtained from their top surfaces in both membranes the surface was almost coated by the planar structure of graphene the specific channels between two neighboring graphene sheets could cause strong molecular sieving effect that is very beneficial for getting an optimal selectivity after post thermal treatment the gpanilm 140 membrane shows a smoother surface than that of the gpanilm membrane due to the gradual removal of the oxygen species and solvent between the nanosheets packing them more tightly 47 therefore the thermal annealing is not only concerned with removing atomic scale lattice defects but is also aimed at restoration the conjugated network of the graphitic lattice 45 these structural changes result in the recovery of electrical conductivity and other properties of gpanilm 140 membrane surface roughness has a considerable influence on direct and indirect interactions between membranes and foulant s molecules manifesting in antifouling behavior of the membrane 5 48 49 to assess this important characteristic afm images were taken for both membranes and the obtained results are shown in fig 7 we hypothesize that thermal treatment shall decrease the roughness of gpanilm 140 and be favorable to improve the anti fouling property of gpanilm 140 membrane the surface average roughness ra of the gpanilm was 97 4 8 9 nm while this value for the gpanilm 140 membrane was 86 5 8 7 nm which is consistent with the results observed using sem as mentioned above the post thermal treatment in 140 c could make the outer membrane s surface a little more uniform and consequently reduce its roughness 3 3 fo performance the performances of newly fabricated membranes in terms of water flux and reverse salt flux were evaluated via a regular fo setup which is shown in fig 8 comparing to fo mode both membranes illustrated higher water fluxes in pro mode as mentioned before in pro mode the ds is facing to the top thin active layer of the membrane in such condition the draw solute concentration over the membrane surface is considerably higher than fo mode 50 in another word due to having a thick support layer structure in the front of ds the osmotic pressure difference across the membrane s top thin active layer in fo mode is lower than the pro one leading to the lower driving force and water flux in fo mode despite the fact that higher water fluxes could be achieved in pro orientation but in this state the porous support layer of membrane is facing the fs which is possibly containing natural foulants therefore the membrane is more prone to be fouled in pro configuration when it is working in a real environment the gpanilm represented water fluxes of 8 4 and 20 3 lmh in fo and pro modes respectively the performance of gpanilm 140 membrane in both modes was slightly lower than the gpanilm one molecules transport paths through graphene membranes are considered to be mainly dependent on the size of nanochannel in graphene membranes 51 these channels can allow water molecules to pass but reject hydrated ions the above investigations indicate that thermal treatment successfully changed nanochannels size of gpanilm 140 with thermal treatment the d spacing between graphene nanosheets changed and further affected the performance of membranes given that the post thermal treatment tight the graphene nanosheets we can attribute the reduction of water flux rate to the decrease of nano channel size of gpanilm 140 membrane assessment of reverse salt flux through an ec meter revealed that there is a trade off relationship between water permeability and salt rejection in the pani graphene nanocomposite membranes in salt rejection terms it was observed that by post thermal annealing the reverse salt flux decreased from 6 2 gmh in fo mode for gpanilm to 4 3 gmh for gpanilm 140 membrane in other words the reverse salt flux decreased as the interlayer distance was diminished by thermal annealing from the trade off relation between water flux and solute rejection of graphene based membranes we could deduce that the size of 2d nano channel was reduced by post thermal annealing selectivity ratio js jw as an independent factor from the properties of the support layer and ds could be determined to better compare the efficiency of two different membranes our results showed that the selectivity ratios for gpanilm and gpanilm 140 are 0 79 and 0 69 g l in fo mode and 0 67 and 0 58 g l in pro mode respectively these findings translate to a better overall performance of gpanilm 140 membrane compared to the gpanilm one 3 4 antifouling test fouling parameter of gpanilm and gpanilm 140 membranes in terms of values of flux recovery rate frr and total fouling rate rt was measured using eqs 3 and 4 respectively and the obtained results are illustrated in fig 9 as mentioned before 500 ppm of sa as a model organic foulant was added to the fs in the fouling tests calcium cations were also used to assist gel layer formation of alginate anions on the fo membrane this thick layer provides resistance to water flux so decline the water flux during fo test the experimental data showed that the rt values for gpanilm and gpanilm 140 membranes are about 53 5 and 45 4 respectively comparing to the gpanilm membrane with frr 71 6 the gpanilm 140 membrane demonstrated slightly better performance in the flux recovery rate with frr 79 9 one of the possible reason for such observation is more negative charge density of gpanilm surface compared to gpanilm 140 one according to the zeta potential results which are depicted in fig 5 the effect of membrane charge is most significant on membranes fouled by alginate due to gel formation in the presence of calcium cations gel forming is caused by the divalent calcium ions in solution cross linking the carboxyls of the membrane surface with the carboxyl groups of the sa macromolecules this fouling mechanism enhanced the attachment of sa macromolecules to the membrane with more negative charge surface 52 54 by imposing 2 v of electric potential the anti fouling behaviors were remarkably changed where the frr values for gpanilm and gpanilm 140 membranes were improved to 95 9 and 98 8 respectively direct eq 5 and indirect electro oxidation eqs 6 and 7 of organic alginate could mainly involve in this improvement 5 s a a d s n e s a o x i d i z e d 6 m h 2 o m o h h e 7 m o h s a m s a o x i d i z e d h e from the kinetic viewpoint the rate of direct oxidation is very low meaning that alginate molecules were almost degraded by the indirect pathway 55 in the indirect mechanism the electro conductive membrane surface m is initially oxidized in which super active hydroxyl radicals oh could be produced via oxidation of water subsequently they are able to attack the organic backbone of alginate and destroy it 56 there are other side reactions that may occur on the surface of the membrane when 2 v electrical potential is applying on it due to the lower potential which is required for oxygen evolution reaction oer on the carbon based electrodes 55 oxygen could be generated on the surface of both membranes in the first step higher oxide or superoxide m o may be formed on the surface through deprotonation of m oh 57 8 m o h m o h e afterward oxygen could be evolved on the membrane surface as follows 9 m o m 1 2 o 2 it was previously proved that gas bubbling i e oxygen is strongly able to mitigate membrane fouling and improve its water permeability 58 furthermore in this study the membranes were connected to the anode of a dc power supply during electro oxidation imposing a positive charge on the surface therefore the electrostatic repulsive effect generating between the membrane s surface and calcium cations bridging agent could also decline the fouling tendency of the electro conductive membranes to some extent 4 conclusion in this study novel electro conductive membranes were fabricated via simple pressure assisted filtration of pani graphene nanocomposite on the pai support layer and their performances in terms of water permeation reverse salt flux and anti fouling propensity were systematically evaluated in fo desalination process tightly packed graphene nanosheets stabilized by long chains of pani made specific channels within the top thin layer of membranes improving membrane performance in both permeability and selectivity the observed excellent anti fouling properties in the prepared membranes can also be explained through four different mechanisms including direct and indirect electro oxidation oxygen bubbling and electrostatic repulsive interactions acknowledgment the authors gratefully acknowledge financial and instrumental support received by the

14243,this paper reviews the occurrence of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs in water and wastewater worldwide as well as their fate focusing on the removal by conventional water and wastewater treatment plants and the risk imposed to human health associated to the presence of phacs in raw and drinking water for this it was assessed 23 drinking water treatment plants and 30 municipal wastewater treatment plants around the world of different capacities due to the high stability intrinsic characteristics and low concentration adsorption to the sludge and biodegradation are the most used path to remove of these compounds in wastewater treatment plants wwtp in water treatment plants wtp chlorination and application of activated granular carbon are the processes associated with the highest removal of pharmaceutical compounds but in general conventional wtps are able to reduce but not completely remove phacs in potable water carbamazepine gemfizobril and fenofibrate are found to be the phacs that risks to human health could not be excluded this indicates the necessity of investments in advanced techniques for the treatment of water and wastewater the results also point to the need for more studies focusing on the determination of guideline values for drinking water of more phacs keywords pharmaceutically active compounds phacs water treatment wastewater treatment risk assessment emerging pollutants 1 introduction worldwide pharmaceutical products such as analgesics anti inflammatory drugs antibiotics lipid regulators beta blockers and x rays contrast media have become more and more a part of the daily routine life being used in human and animal for health treatment to improve life quality and to increase their life span in 2017 it was estimated that it was spent a total of us 1135 billion on prescription medications 1 with the aging population combined with improvements in health standards specially in developing countries the consumption of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs is set to increase in future years 2 in the year of 2013 alone over 100 new formulations or chemical entities were approved by the us food and drug administration fda for clinical use 3 these compounds reach water systems from different sources such as human excretion sewage wrongful disposal landfill leachate drain water or from industries 4 phacs have been found in wastewater effluent drinking water rivers and dams in many different places such as asia 5 7 america 8 11 australia 9 11 12 and europe 9 11 13 17 and africa 18 at low concentration ng l to μg l range and the increase in the production consumption and therefore discharge to the environment has been raising global attention and concern the presence of phacs in the water cycle has been increasing the concern about the efficacy of water and wastewater treatment processes in removing these compounds several papers were published about the presence of phacs in the environment in drinking water and wastewater treatment plants a research on scopus was done in order to rise how many studies have been carried out in the last decade about the subject using the keywords pharmaceutically active compounds and drinking water and pharmaceutically active compounds and wastewater the majority of the studies are located in europe asia and north america fig 1 thus this paper reviews the occurrence of phacs worldwide their fate in the environment focusing on the removal by the conventional water and wastewater plants and the risk imposed on human by the presence of these compounds in drinking water for this among more than 4000 papers it was selected 99 papers on the subject using the key words pharmaceutically active compounds and drinking water and pharmaceutically active compounds and wastewater where it was possible to observe phacs concentration before and after the treatment it was assessed 23 drinking water treatment plants and 30 municipal wastewater treatment plants around the world of different sizes it was selected the papers published no earlier than 2000 2 environmental health issues and regulations related to phacs over 200 different phacs were observed in surface ground water and sewage 19 20 and it is still unclear the levels and effects as well as the fate of these compounds on the human health and wildlife however it has been found their potential to cause aquatic toxicity development of resistance in pathogenic microbes genotoxicity and endocrine disruption 20 22 in addition the release of phacs in the environment is not regulated and covered by the existing water quality 23 verlicchi et al 2 assessed the environmental risk posed by phacs in secondary effluent it was concluded that 14 out of 51 assessed compounds pose a high environmental risk 7 antibiotics erythromycin ofloxacin sulfamethoxazole clarithromycin amoxicillin tetracycline and azithromycin 2 psychiatric drugs fluoxetine and diazepam 2 analgesics anti inflammatories ibuprofen and mefenamic acid and 3 lipid regulators fenofibric acid fenofibrate and gemfibrozil however most of the toxicity data refer to acute rather than chronic effects which limits the assessment long term effects are of hugely importance to understand of phacs fate and effect on the environment and public health many studies have been carried out to assess the effects of the exposure to phacs on the environment and on human health chen et al 24 assessed the effects of hormones on sexual behaviours of o melastigma it was observed that sexual behaviour was induced in the fish groups submitted to hormones increasing the duration of dancing also estrogenic pharmaceutical compounds are found to cause an increase in the vitellogenin levels in male fish as well as decreased levels of vitellogenin and estradiol in the plasma of female fish these findings were associated with immature gonads and lower gonadosomatic index in g brasiliensis adult females as well as histological changes such as degeneration of germ cells 25 in addition diclofenac was found to cause vitellogenin in male japanese medaka fish 26 and ibuprofen naproxen and diclofenac destabilize dmps bilayers affecting their thermodynamic properties 27 diclofenac and the carbamazepine were found to decrease the emergence ratio and reduce the growth of the midges of chironomus riparius respectively 28 phacs were also associated to affect microbial communities by changing the ability of microbes to metabolize different carbon sources thus affecting the metabolic diversity of the soil community 29 thus this study suggests that the repeated amendment of agricultural soils with biosolids sludges or even irrigation of wastewater rich in phacs residuals may result in an increase of concentration of these compounds in the soil throughout the time and impact key ecological functions i e the carbon cycle 29 when human health is concerned many of these compounds may cause problems such as allergies lung diseases and cancers 30 another important source of concern is the increased resistance to antibiotics in humans strongly related to the production of antibiotic resistant bacteria which in turn have become ineffective for the prevention and treatment of various infectious diseases 30 because of this in an attempt to ban or establish limits on the use or disposal of these phacs in the environment internationally recognized agencies have been struggling to develop lists of phacs that either deserve special attention or need to be banned as an example the european union 30 listed 45 priority compounds so that the established environmental quality standards eqs should be respected in aquatic environments and listed 8 others in the watch list of priority compounds in order address and verify the risk posed by these substances 30 31 in this watch list it is possible to observe antibiotics such as trimethoprim clarithromycin anti inflammatory drugs such as diclofenac in addition to synthetic hormones ethinyl estradiol ee2 decision 2018 840 published on june 5 2018 similar regulations were also followed by switzerland government when several ecs endocrine compounds are concerned in the drinking water contaminant candidate list 32 it was also covered a large number of drugs and edcs endocrine disrupting compounds carbamazepine naproxen sulfamethoxazole ibuprofen genfibrozil atenolol diclofenac erythromycin and bezafibrate are examples of phacs which have been classified as class i i e high priority pharmaceutical products according to the global water research coalition 32 3 the current panorama of phacs on wastewater municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps is the major barriers that can prevent contaminants in wastewater from entering the receiving environment however wwtps are designed aiming the removal of easily or moderately biodegradable carbon nitrogen and phosphorus compounds and microbiological organisms which regularly arrive at the wwtp in concentrations to the order of mg l 1 and at least 106 mpn 100 ml respectively wwtps are not equipped to deal with complex compounds in low concentrations such as pharmaceuticals 2 33 since phacs are not removed in the conventional treatment process applied to the urban wastewater they are continuously discharged into aquatic ecosystems which makes wwtp effluents the main source of human pharmaceuticals in the environment 34 generally municipal wastewater treatment plants include screening degritting primary sedimentation secondary treatment and final sedimentation show low efficiency in removing phacs the capabilities of primary treatment processes i e sedimentation in removing phacs are very limited 35 since adsorption is one of the main mechanisms of phacs removal in these processes and most phacs have hydrophilic nature secondary treatment involves biological process biological processes removal of phacs can occur through partition adsorption biotransformation and biodegradation 36 biodegradation is the breakdown of complex molecules which can or cannot confer the property of toxicity into simples less toxic products by the activity of microorganisms using these compounds as a donator of electrons in order to produce energy this mechanism is the key processes of a biological treatment system it is possible to highlight two main mechanisms which are associated with the biodegradation of phacs in the wwtp co metabolism and degradation of the substrate sludge in the first the compound is degraded through the enzymes secreted by the microorganisms present in the biological sludge in the second mechanism phacs represent the carbon and energy source of the active microbiological mass 36 studies by jiang et al 37 point out that the trametes versicolor fungus was efficient in removing carbamazepine by being able to secrete laccase and peroxidase enzymes according to jiang et al 37 several strains of pseudomonas use the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole as the only source of carbon and energy for its development a comparison was performed between the co metabolic and single substrate degradation processes to determine the main mechanism of removal of phacs it was found that for ibuprofen bezafibrate and naproxen the co metabolic biodegradation process was the main mechanism involved in the removal process meanwhile it was observed that the total amount of ketoprofen was only partially degraded as a single substrate 38 it is possible to observe that even for the drugs belonging to the same therapeutic group the removal mechanisms can differ considerably as well as the rate of degradation and removal efficiency of each compound can vary greatly and be directly dependent on the type of digestion developed in the reactor be it aerobic or anaerobic digestion it may also be dependent on the molecular structure and functional group of the compounds table 1 studies conducted by schwarzenbach et al 39 point out that a greater speed in the efficiency of the degradation of chlorinated compounds in aerobic digestion processes however slower degradation of the polyhalogenated compounds is observed in the same type of digestion long chain aliphatic compounds are more easily degraded by biological treatments than the aromatic compounds of the sulphate or halogen group due to their complex ring structure 39 the biodegradation of phacs following first order kinetics depends directly on their structure and bioavailability their potential for biodegradation is also closely linked to the characteristics of the medium the ph redox potential its own stereochemical structure as well as the chemical properties of adsorbent and sorbent molecules since these molecules favour intercalation 52 thus it can be stated that biodegradability is governed by the sum of several factors associated with the complexity and stability of the compounds as well as the way in which the medium interacts with the compound 39 according to tiwari et al 52 compounds having short and unsaturated aliphatic side chains are more readily biodegradable than aromatic or highly branched side chain compounds in addition the removal of these compounds in the wwtp is also associated with the presence of electron withdrawal donation groups in their structure 53 in addition an increase in the concentration of some phacs after treatment table 1 is possible to observed which can be associated both to deficiencies in sample collection and to the transformation of human metabolites and the conversion of metabolites formed into parent compounds 52 table 1 summarizes the occurrence of phacs as influents and effluents of wwtps worldwide the removal efficiency also changes as a function of the solids retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt and the tertiary treatment process the increase of some compounds in the wwtps effluents can be associated either to analytical deviations and or cleavage of conjugates glucuronides sulfates of target compounds 54 diversity and size of the microbial community in wwtp are controlled by the sludge retention time it was observed an increase of phacs removal with a longer srt 26d whereas decreased removal with shorter srt of 8 d 55 hydrophobic compounds can be removed using a high sludge retention time srt it has been reported that with an srt of at least 10 days there is effective removal 56 as well as the transformation of ibuprofen sulfamethoxazole acetylsalicylic acid and bezafibrate are achieved which require an srt of d 57 long srt promotes the growth of specialized microorganisms which although they naturally have a slower growth are effective in the removal of nitrogen and therefore can increase the removal of phacs however in general wwtps are not planned to operate with a long enough srt to satisfy this requirement besides that some pharmaceuticals for example carbamazepine are highly persistent and have been shown to be inert to the biological treatment process 56 58 properties such as acidity and alkalinity of influent of wastewater treatment plants may affect the nature of the pharmaceutical compound in addition to being able to influence the structure and composition of the microbial community acting in the medium and may increase or decrease the activity of the microbial enzymes released in the medium and therefore the phacs biodegradation it has been found that the removal of ionizable compounds such as ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole is highly dependent on the ph for degradation 52 in acidic media these compounds are in a hydrophobic form which turns in greater elimination and therefore a higher efficiency of the process however compounds such as carbamazepine that are non ionizable compounds the removal is independent of ph 59 in the biological treatment stage of wwtp the removal of phacs are also related to sorption to suspended solids 60 adsorption is the main mechanism in the removal of micropollutants during primary treatment 47 and it is generally in agreement with their hydrophobicity expressed by the octanol water partition coefficient kow compounds with low logkow values 3 0 such as carbamazepine metoprolol 1 88 trimethoprim 0 91 sulpiride 1 10 and atenolol 0 16 are not expected to adsorb greatly to the particles but to dissociate in the aqueous phase 14 trimethoprim is neither biodegraded nor adsorbed and carbamazepine could be hardly removed regardless of secondary treatment process applied 47 inyang et al 40 in their research found that trimethoprim was removed under both anoxic and aerobic conditions and atenolol could be removed in anaerobic anoxic and aerobic regimes the eawag biodegradation biocatalysis database prediction pathway system eawag bbd pps predicts that under aerobic conditions atenolol can degrade by microbial hydrolysis of its primary amide into carboxylic acid 13 proving its high removal in all studied cases table 1 phacs with logkow that varies from 3 0 to 5 9 such as diclofenac 4 51 and naproxen 3 18 corresponded to high and medium adsorption observed and therefore more expressive removal rates this effect could be due to the high biodegradation rates observed for these two compounds ibuprofen however can be observed to be an exception that although presents a medium logkow value 3 97 low adsorption is observed 14 under aerobic condition the metabolization of ibuprofen yields hydroxyibuprofen and carboxy ibuprofen metabolites 61 whereas biotransformation of naproxen can yield 2 6 hyd roxynaphthalen 2 yl propanoic acid and 1 6 methoxynaphtha len 2 yl ethanon as intermediates 62 increasing hrt of these compounds by sludge adsorption provides more time for microbial degradation i e micro pollutant gets degraded either by catabolic microbial enzymes or utilized by microorganisms as a carbon source on the other hand hydrophilic micro pollutants escape from wwtp without biodegradation along with effluent and evades the biodegradation process another feature related to the phacs removal is associated to volatilization of the compound which is defined by the henry law constant kh to achieve significant volatilization it is required kh value 3 103 mol m3 pa however in the case of pharmaceuticals this value is normally around of kh 10 5 63 thus volatilization of phacs in a wastewater treatment plant can be negligible photo degradation of these compounds is also considered insignificant due to the high sludge concentration which increases the wastewater turbidity and therefore blocks the penetration of sunlight in the top layer 52 since wwtps are not designed to remove phacs especially antibiotic they are known to be the main source of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes for surface waters 64 thus more attention has to be paid to the adverse ecological effect caused by their persistence especially throughout the wwtps and potential long term effects toward the non target aquatic organisms even at low concentrations it is possible to note that in general individual concentrations of many phacs are higher in effluents of wwtps than concentrations found in surface water it is attributed to dilution as well as partial remediation by natural pathways like hydrolysis sorption onto colloids biodegradation natural attenuation and photolysis 65 66 due to the majority phacs characteristics of being biorefractory partial transformation by abiotic reactions is more likely to happen 67 ph natural organic matter nom and ionic strength of the receiving media may influence the speciation and concentration level of each phac in the environment once in the water body phacs can take many different pathways some phacs at different ph become charged and can easily absorb onto colloids trapped by nom or associated with cations in the water and transferred to sediments 65 in general the levels of the studied pharmaceutical compounds were also water source dependent which in turn depends on the location popular habits wastewater treatment type phacs consumption patterns physicochemical properties and stability as well as the season 68 rainfall or lack of therefore might be one of the causes associated with the phacs fluctuation concentration 24 69 increased flow caused by rainfall might have two different effects on the phacs concentration influent to wtp firstly they might dilute the phacs concentrations on rivers bed resulting in lower removal efficiency by wtp secondly it could suspend settled sediments in which pharmaceutical compounds are adsorbed and releasing them into the water stream 23 additionally after rainfall incidents surface water could be polluted by wwtp overflows which might increase the phacs concentration on water sources to wtp 23 some compounds have higher usage rates during winter months for example antipyretics such as diclofenac ibuprofen and naproxen which are less efficiently removed during wastewater treatment in winter weather the same can be stated to warmer seasons where it is possible to note a pick in the consumption of antihistamines for example gemfibrozil salicylic acid and acetaminophen 68 70 also on warmer seasons the microbiological active is higher due to the increase in the temperature 50 71 other pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics antiepileptic or b blockers are similarly consumed during both seasons thus it is not observed seasonal pattern 68 nelson et al 71 assessed the distribution of phacs concentration during the days it was found that some compounds have broad increase decrease in concentration over such as erythromycin azithromycin atenolol propranolol and gemfibrozil the highest concentrations generally occur between 4 and 7 pm and lowest concentrations seem to occur between 8 and 11 a m gemfibrozil seems to have a bimodal cycle similar to naproxen other compounds such as carbamazepine primidone fluoxetine metoprolol triclocarban and phenytoin don t show any variation in their concentration along the day some compounds appear to have daily minima during 10 11 30 a m this behaviour is possible to be explained by taking into consideration that both consumption and excretion patterns of the studied population phacs are usually administered every 8 or 12 h and the last intake of the day is usually at night during the night these compounds are accumulated in urine and faeces and are released along with the first toilet flush of the morning 72 also from table 1 it is possible to observe that some compounds found all around the world are also listed on the watch list of eu 30 for instance macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin clarithromycin and estrone also carbamazepine atenolol ibuprofen bezafibrate gemfizobril sulfamethoxazole and naproxen are classified as class i high priority in global water research coalition gwrc 32 this rise attention to the possibility of consumption increase and therefore the release in the environment of these compounds as well as their potential threat to the environment and public health more toxicity data should be raised in order to determine the effects of these phacs not only in target organisms but also in non target populations as well as their effects as a mixture 4 the current panorama of phacs on drinking water when public health is concern drinking water treatment plants wtp may impose another barrier that can prevent the return of these phacs to human body many studies have been carried out in order to detect phacs in conventional wtp table 2 however the conventional treatment plants that consist in coagulation flocculation and filtration followed by a kind of disinfection such as chlorination and ozonation have poor removal efficiencies especially the steps of coagulation flocculation and sand filtration 74 74 prechlorinaton is found to be very efficient in removal some phacs due to the high reactivity of chlorine with primary and secondary amines 75 76 according to huerta fontela et al 73 the efficiency of the prechlorination is ph dependent achieving higher removal at lower phs when applied for carbamazepine also the same study suggests that the absence of the imidazole moiety contributed to the deactivation of the aromatic ring to the chlorine reaction when analysing the angiotensin agents behaviour the presence of a bromide instead of chlorine in one of the aromatic rings and the substitution of a benzene ring by a pyridine one block the reactivity of this compound through chlorine attack 77 however the application of chlorine has no efficiency in the removal of β blockers 73 according to stackelberg et al 78 the process of clarification which consists of coagulation flocculation sedimentation and filtration is generally not a primary route by which phacs in filtered water samples are degraded or removed mostly due to the intrinsic characteristics of the compounds the application of ferric chloride coagulation may result in base or acid hydrolysis however the low concentration of phacs in superficial water and the hydrophobic behaviour of some phacs with log kow 3 0 may explain the lower removal of phacs through this process which could indicate removal by partitioning some such as sulfamethoxazole or acetaminophen compounds can occur hydrolysis during coagulation step 78 sand filtration is based on the sieving and in less proportion adsorption processes and since phacs have a molecular weight ranging from 100 to 800 kda these processes is not efficient in removing the target compounds gemfibrozil diclofenac naproxen propranolol atenolol carbamazepine iopamidol and fenofibrate were the major compounds detected in wtp effluents 74 79 81 these compounds are characterized by low kow and carbamazepine is also found to be persistent throughout physic chemical treatment this compound is considered to be a trace of human presence 58 60 47 in general most of the phacs removal would be dependent on chemical oxidation by chlorination and or ozonation adsorptive process by granular activated carbon gac and membrane filtration employed at each wtp the removal ratios of several pharmaceuticals i e ibuprofen and fenofibrate ranged from 10 and 80 ibuprofen could also be removed moderately by ozonation and activated carbon adsorption according to huber et al 82 ibuprofen was considered slow reacting pharmaceutical during conventional ozonation and in contrast carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole were considered fast reacting pharmaceuticals being in accordance with the results found in survey realised by huerta fontela et al 73 fenofibrate that has high hydrophobic property log kow 5 28 and exists as neutral molecular at ph 7 0 is expected to be efficiently removed by activated carbon filtration however it was observed a removal of approximately 9 table 2 this may be due to the competition of adsorption on activated sites of gac 74 it is possible to observe a negative removal efficiency when progesterone and testosterone are concerned table 2 it may be due to a gap in the actual hydraulic retention time hrt at each wtp and estimated hrt to set sampling schedule of its source water and finished water advanced treatment technologies such as ozonation activated carbon adsorption and reverse osmosis ro are applicable to phacs removal in wtps 74 83 86 ozonation is able to remove a large spectrum of contaminants found in raw waters although studies have demonstrated that the primary attack by ozone is sufficient to reduce specific effects such as endocrine disruption 82 antibacterial 87 and antiviral activity 83 during ozonation a mineralization of phacs is typically not achieved and compounds are only transformed 88 despite the general removal of specific effects by ozonation there is a concern about the unspecific toxicity of the mostly unknown transformation products which rises up possible problems with the application of ozone and the consequences to human health granular active carbon gac filtration is also efficient to remove compounds with high hydrophobic properties 73 reverse osmosis is recognized as an effective and reliable form of being applied mainly in the treatment of supply water either as a polishing step or in raw water purification 89 90 studies indicate that electrostatic exclusion is the predominant phenomenon in the rejection process of these membranes and therefore effective rejections of negative pharmaceutical compounds were observed exceeding 95 by ro membranes 84 86 the results of a study on the removal of hormones and pharmaceuticals in treated wastewater indicated that treatments using ozonation microfiltration and nanofiltration were partially effective while the treatment with ro was the most successful in the removal of target compounds 91 ozaki and li 92 investigated the rejection of various products among them the phacs by polyamide nf and ro membranes and observed that the rejection of organic compounds by ultra low pressure ro ulpro increased linearly with molecular weight and molecular weight of the evaluated compound from table 2 it is possible to note that as well as for the wastewater panorama many compounds that are listed in the watch list of eu 30 are found in the water surface as well as in drinking water for instance macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin and clarithromycin estrone and ethinylestradiol which confirms the necessity of increasing the efforts in order to monitor water sources and drinking water all around the world also since the consumption of phac tends to increase throughout the time more emphasis should be paid to non detected or not studied phacs as well as to developing countries in order to fill the gaps about occurrence of phacs in the environment drinking water and wastewater a risk assessment was conducted with the concentration values of phacs in the raw and treated water observed in table 2 for this purpose the benchmark quotient bq was calculated as the ratio between the mean or maximum drinking water concentration and the drinking water guidelines values drinking water equivalent level dwel for the compounds for which the values were available in the literature the dwel values were calculated by using eq 1 1 d w e l t d i x m x f v where tdi m f and v are tolerable daily intake μg kg bw day values available in supplementary material body weight considered to be 60 kg drinking water allocation adopted value of 0 2 and personal drinking water consumption 2 l day a bq value of 1 corresponds to a potable water concentration equal to the reference value dwel thus when a value of bq 1 is observed in the drinking water a potential human health risk may be associated if this consumption is prolonged over a period of life 102 bq values 0 1 in drinking water need an in depth investigation of the risk imposed associated with the presence of phacs it is worth mentioning that for compounds that have been found in raw water be it surface or underground water conventional drinking water treatment can dampen the risks and provide additional safety for these compounds it was assumed that a bq of 0 2 presents no significant risk to human health 102 in fig 2 the concentrations reported for drinking water fig 2a and raw water fig 2b are compared with dwel fig 2 shows that for most substances bq values are 0 1 or 0 2 for drinking raw water respectively representing no significant risk to human health in the range that needs further investigation it is possible to observe carbamazepine diazepam hydrochlorothiazide clarithromycin sotalol and gemfizobril raising attention to the presence of these compounds in the drinking water also of these compounds only clarithromycin is listed in the watch list of eu 30 and carbamazepine and gemfizobril are listed in the gwrc 32 as class i high priority bringing special attention to explore the human exposure to these phacs in drinking water three compounds were detected with a bq 1 fenofibrate carbamazepine and atenolol all of the three compounds are listed as class i in the gwrc 32 also their high concentration in drinking water and the inefficiency of wtp in reducing their concentrations and therefore risks in different parts of the globe draws attention to the necessity of removing these phacs and produce safer drinking water also it is possible to observe the presence of these compounds in the wastewater effluent in high concentration table 2 specially carbamazepine which is not considered as a highly persistent compounds and have been shown to be inert to the biological treatment process 56 58 studies from turkey mexico canada and 2 from china have found either carbamazepine or carbamazepine and gemfizobril in the wwtp effluent as well as diazepam atenolol sulfamethoxazole clarithromycin and erythromycin this also brings attention to the necessity of an application of an advanced treatment for wastewater in order to reduce the possible risks associated to the higher concentrations in raw surface water for 18 of the 38 phacs evaluated in this study the health risk assessment for drinking water could not be performed because either toxicity data or their concentrations in drinking water were missing most of these phacs are classified as psychiatric cardiac or hormonal highlighting the need for further studies focusing on determining the guideline values of these compounds in drinking water 5 future perspectives there are thousands of pharmaceuticals in the market that can go to the environment but less than 2 of them have been detected and investigated for treatment 74 therefore more efforts are needed to work on detection toxicities persistence and priorities of other compounds furthermore close attention has to be paid to the sensitive vulnerable subpopulations e g pregnant women since these groups are not contemplated in the researches found in the literature also it should be noted that the majority of the surveys are realised with target pharmaceuticals alone which may not represent the real hazard to human health since there is a mixture of many different phacs in the drinking water supplies effects of chronic low level exposure to pharmaceutical including exposure of sensitive subpopulations in a life time of consumption should also be assessed considering the difficulty in predicting the real and the full effects and risks of those trace organic substances impose either to human health or to wild life as well as their consumption increasing trend and therefore release in the environment the removal of these compounds of the wastewater and drinking water is paramount thus due to the failure of the current wwtp and wtp in removing phacs mainly due to the low concentration many studies have focused on the application of advanced water treatment processes such as membrane separation processes 33 86 88 90 103 in order to produce water with enough quality to protect human health and wild life membrane separation processes msp including nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have become an important alternative to produce good quality water reaching the drinking water standards due to their higher removal rate of low molecular weight organic pollutants minimizing the risk associated to the source and its contaminants as well as its modularity and ability to integrate with other systems to increase its efficiency and to reduce problems with fouling it is possible to integrate membrane systems using low pressure driven membranes such as ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf with nf ro membranes 6 conclusion pharmaceutically active compounds are a real threat around the world and the increasing tendency in the consumption and therefore the realise of these compounds in the environment raises a global warning since the acute and chronical effects are still not clear the chemical stability associated with a low concentration of phacs makes conventional water and wastewater treatment not efficient processes in removing these kinds of micropollutants what turns out to be released in the environment biodegradation adsorption and chlorination are the processes associated with the highest removal of phacs the existence of these compounds in the domestic wastewater as well as in the superficial and ground water are linked to the location season and populational habits more attention should be paid to developing countries in order to assess the real risks due to phacs in the environment especially due to lack of sanitation and trends of consumption increase of these compounds also more efforts should be given in order to determine all the range of phacs in the environment as well as their respective drinking water guideline value although conventional drinking water treatment were able to reduce the risks associated to the phacs in the water carbamazepine diazepam and genfizobril were still found with high risks associated to human health which brings attention to the development of safer techniques for drinking water production more studies are still needed on the detection toxicities especially on non target organisms persistence and priorities of other compounds especially in order to give background and subsidize decision making as well as to evaluate the environmental impact of mixtures of different phacs and to evaluate the best end of pipe technology to guarantee better removal of the most persistence and toxic compounds acknowledgements this work was supported by the coordination of superior level staff

14243,this paper reviews the occurrence of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs in water and wastewater worldwide as well as their fate focusing on the removal by conventional water and wastewater treatment plants and the risk imposed to human health associated to the presence of phacs in raw and drinking water for this it was assessed 23 drinking water treatment plants and 30 municipal wastewater treatment plants around the world of different capacities due to the high stability intrinsic characteristics and low concentration adsorption to the sludge and biodegradation are the most used path to remove of these compounds in wastewater treatment plants wwtp in water treatment plants wtp chlorination and application of activated granular carbon are the processes associated with the highest removal of pharmaceutical compounds but in general conventional wtps are able to reduce but not completely remove phacs in potable water carbamazepine gemfizobril and fenofibrate are found to be the phacs that risks to human health could not be excluded this indicates the necessity of investments in advanced techniques for the treatment of water and wastewater the results also point to the need for more studies focusing on the determination of guideline values for drinking water of more phacs keywords pharmaceutically active compounds phacs water treatment wastewater treatment risk assessment emerging pollutants 1 introduction worldwide pharmaceutical products such as analgesics anti inflammatory drugs antibiotics lipid regulators beta blockers and x rays contrast media have become more and more a part of the daily routine life being used in human and animal for health treatment to improve life quality and to increase their life span in 2017 it was estimated that it was spent a total of us 1135 billion on prescription medications 1 with the aging population combined with improvements in health standards specially in developing countries the consumption of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs is set to increase in future years 2 in the year of 2013 alone over 100 new formulations or chemical entities were approved by the us food and drug administration fda for clinical use 3 these compounds reach water systems from different sources such as human excretion sewage wrongful disposal landfill leachate drain water or from industries 4 phacs have been found in wastewater effluent drinking water rivers and dams in many different places such as asia 5 7 america 8 11 australia 9 11 12 and europe 9 11 13 17 and africa 18 at low concentration ng l to μg l range and the increase in the production consumption and therefore discharge to the environment has been raising global attention and concern the presence of phacs in the water cycle has been increasing the concern about the efficacy of water and wastewater treatment processes in removing these compounds several papers were published about the presence of phacs in the environment in drinking water and wastewater treatment plants a research on scopus was done in order to rise how many studies have been carried out in the last decade about the subject using the keywords pharmaceutically active compounds and drinking water and pharmaceutically active compounds and wastewater the majority of the studies are located in europe asia and north america fig 1 thus this paper reviews the occurrence of phacs worldwide their fate in the environment focusing on the removal by the conventional water and wastewater plants and the risk imposed on human by the presence of these compounds in drinking water for this among more than 4000 papers it was selected 99 papers on the subject using the key words pharmaceutically active compounds and drinking water and pharmaceutically active compounds and wastewater where it was possible to observe phacs concentration before and after the treatment it was assessed 23 drinking water treatment plants and 30 municipal wastewater treatment plants around the world of different sizes it was selected the papers published no earlier than 2000 2 environmental health issues and regulations related to phacs over 200 different phacs were observed in surface ground water and sewage 19 20 and it is still unclear the levels and effects as well as the fate of these compounds on the human health and wildlife however it has been found their potential to cause aquatic toxicity development of resistance in pathogenic microbes genotoxicity and endocrine disruption 20 22 in addition the release of phacs in the environment is not regulated and covered by the existing water quality 23 verlicchi et al 2 assessed the environmental risk posed by phacs in secondary effluent it was concluded that 14 out of 51 assessed compounds pose a high environmental risk 7 antibiotics erythromycin ofloxacin sulfamethoxazole clarithromycin amoxicillin tetracycline and azithromycin 2 psychiatric drugs fluoxetine and diazepam 2 analgesics anti inflammatories ibuprofen and mefenamic acid and 3 lipid regulators fenofibric acid fenofibrate and gemfibrozil however most of the toxicity data refer to acute rather than chronic effects which limits the assessment long term effects are of hugely importance to understand of phacs fate and effect on the environment and public health many studies have been carried out to assess the effects of the exposure to phacs on the environment and on human health chen et al 24 assessed the effects of hormones on sexual behaviours of o melastigma it was observed that sexual behaviour was induced in the fish groups submitted to hormones increasing the duration of dancing also estrogenic pharmaceutical compounds are found to cause an increase in the vitellogenin levels in male fish as well as decreased levels of vitellogenin and estradiol in the plasma of female fish these findings were associated with immature gonads and lower gonadosomatic index in g brasiliensis adult females as well as histological changes such as degeneration of germ cells 25 in addition diclofenac was found to cause vitellogenin in male japanese medaka fish 26 and ibuprofen naproxen and diclofenac destabilize dmps bilayers affecting their thermodynamic properties 27 diclofenac and the carbamazepine were found to decrease the emergence ratio and reduce the growth of the midges of chironomus riparius respectively 28 phacs were also associated to affect microbial communities by changing the ability of microbes to metabolize different carbon sources thus affecting the metabolic diversity of the soil community 29 thus this study suggests that the repeated amendment of agricultural soils with biosolids sludges or even irrigation of wastewater rich in phacs residuals may result in an increase of concentration of these compounds in the soil throughout the time and impact key ecological functions i e the carbon cycle 29 when human health is concerned many of these compounds may cause problems such as allergies lung diseases and cancers 30 another important source of concern is the increased resistance to antibiotics in humans strongly related to the production of antibiotic resistant bacteria which in turn have become ineffective for the prevention and treatment of various infectious diseases 30 because of this in an attempt to ban or establish limits on the use or disposal of these phacs in the environment internationally recognized agencies have been struggling to develop lists of phacs that either deserve special attention or need to be banned as an example the european union 30 listed 45 priority compounds so that the established environmental quality standards eqs should be respected in aquatic environments and listed 8 others in the watch list of priority compounds in order address and verify the risk posed by these substances 30 31 in this watch list it is possible to observe antibiotics such as trimethoprim clarithromycin anti inflammatory drugs such as diclofenac in addition to synthetic hormones ethinyl estradiol ee2 decision 2018 840 published on june 5 2018 similar regulations were also followed by switzerland government when several ecs endocrine compounds are concerned in the drinking water contaminant candidate list 32 it was also covered a large number of drugs and edcs endocrine disrupting compounds carbamazepine naproxen sulfamethoxazole ibuprofen genfibrozil atenolol diclofenac erythromycin and bezafibrate are examples of phacs which have been classified as class i i e high priority pharmaceutical products according to the global water research coalition 32 3 the current panorama of phacs on wastewater municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps is the major barriers that can prevent contaminants in wastewater from entering the receiving environment however wwtps are designed aiming the removal of easily or moderately biodegradable carbon nitrogen and phosphorus compounds and microbiological organisms which regularly arrive at the wwtp in concentrations to the order of mg l 1 and at least 106 mpn 100 ml respectively wwtps are not equipped to deal with complex compounds in low concentrations such as pharmaceuticals 2 33 since phacs are not removed in the conventional treatment process applied to the urban wastewater they are continuously discharged into aquatic ecosystems which makes wwtp effluents the main source of human pharmaceuticals in the environment 34 generally municipal wastewater treatment plants include screening degritting primary sedimentation secondary treatment and final sedimentation show low efficiency in removing phacs the capabilities of primary treatment processes i e sedimentation in removing phacs are very limited 35 since adsorption is one of the main mechanisms of phacs removal in these processes and most phacs have hydrophilic nature secondary treatment involves biological process biological processes removal of phacs can occur through partition adsorption biotransformation and biodegradation 36 biodegradation is the breakdown of complex molecules which can or cannot confer the property of toxicity into simples less toxic products by the activity of microorganisms using these compounds as a donator of electrons in order to produce energy this mechanism is the key processes of a biological treatment system it is possible to highlight two main mechanisms which are associated with the biodegradation of phacs in the wwtp co metabolism and degradation of the substrate sludge in the first the compound is degraded through the enzymes secreted by the microorganisms present in the biological sludge in the second mechanism phacs represent the carbon and energy source of the active microbiological mass 36 studies by jiang et al 37 point out that the trametes versicolor fungus was efficient in removing carbamazepine by being able to secrete laccase and peroxidase enzymes according to jiang et al 37 several strains of pseudomonas use the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole as the only source of carbon and energy for its development a comparison was performed between the co metabolic and single substrate degradation processes to determine the main mechanism of removal of phacs it was found that for ibuprofen bezafibrate and naproxen the co metabolic biodegradation process was the main mechanism involved in the removal process meanwhile it was observed that the total amount of ketoprofen was only partially degraded as a single substrate 38 it is possible to observe that even for the drugs belonging to the same therapeutic group the removal mechanisms can differ considerably as well as the rate of degradation and removal efficiency of each compound can vary greatly and be directly dependent on the type of digestion developed in the reactor be it aerobic or anaerobic digestion it may also be dependent on the molecular structure and functional group of the compounds table 1 studies conducted by schwarzenbach et al 39 point out that a greater speed in the efficiency of the degradation of chlorinated compounds in aerobic digestion processes however slower degradation of the polyhalogenated compounds is observed in the same type of digestion long chain aliphatic compounds are more easily degraded by biological treatments than the aromatic compounds of the sulphate or halogen group due to their complex ring structure 39 the biodegradation of phacs following first order kinetics depends directly on their structure and bioavailability their potential for biodegradation is also closely linked to the characteristics of the medium the ph redox potential its own stereochemical structure as well as the chemical properties of adsorbent and sorbent molecules since these molecules favour intercalation 52 thus it can be stated that biodegradability is governed by the sum of several factors associated with the complexity and stability of the compounds as well as the way in which the medium interacts with the compound 39 according to tiwari et al 52 compounds having short and unsaturated aliphatic side chains are more readily biodegradable than aromatic or highly branched side chain compounds in addition the removal of these compounds in the wwtp is also associated with the presence of electron withdrawal donation groups in their structure 53 in addition an increase in the concentration of some phacs after treatment table 1 is possible to observed which can be associated both to deficiencies in sample collection and to the transformation of human metabolites and the conversion of metabolites formed into parent compounds 52 table 1 summarizes the occurrence of phacs as influents and effluents of wwtps worldwide the removal efficiency also changes as a function of the solids retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt and the tertiary treatment process the increase of some compounds in the wwtps effluents can be associated either to analytical deviations and or cleavage of conjugates glucuronides sulfates of target compounds 54 diversity and size of the microbial community in wwtp are controlled by the sludge retention time it was observed an increase of phacs removal with a longer srt 26d whereas decreased removal with shorter srt of 8 d 55 hydrophobic compounds can be removed using a high sludge retention time srt it has been reported that with an srt of at least 10 days there is effective removal 56 as well as the transformation of ibuprofen sulfamethoxazole acetylsalicylic acid and bezafibrate are achieved which require an srt of d 57 long srt promotes the growth of specialized microorganisms which although they naturally have a slower growth are effective in the removal of nitrogen and therefore can increase the removal of phacs however in general wwtps are not planned to operate with a long enough srt to satisfy this requirement besides that some pharmaceuticals for example carbamazepine are highly persistent and have been shown to be inert to the biological treatment process 56 58 properties such as acidity and alkalinity of influent of wastewater treatment plants may affect the nature of the pharmaceutical compound in addition to being able to influence the structure and composition of the microbial community acting in the medium and may increase or decrease the activity of the microbial enzymes released in the medium and therefore the phacs biodegradation it has been found that the removal of ionizable compounds such as ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole is highly dependent on the ph for degradation 52 in acidic media these compounds are in a hydrophobic form which turns in greater elimination and therefore a higher efficiency of the process however compounds such as carbamazepine that are non ionizable compounds the removal is independent of ph 59 in the biological treatment stage of wwtp the removal of phacs are also related to sorption to suspended solids 60 adsorption is the main mechanism in the removal of micropollutants during primary treatment 47 and it is generally in agreement with their hydrophobicity expressed by the octanol water partition coefficient kow compounds with low logkow values 3 0 such as carbamazepine metoprolol 1 88 trimethoprim 0 91 sulpiride 1 10 and atenolol 0 16 are not expected to adsorb greatly to the particles but to dissociate in the aqueous phase 14 trimethoprim is neither biodegraded nor adsorbed and carbamazepine could be hardly removed regardless of secondary treatment process applied 47 inyang et al 40 in their research found that trimethoprim was removed under both anoxic and aerobic conditions and atenolol could be removed in anaerobic anoxic and aerobic regimes the eawag biodegradation biocatalysis database prediction pathway system eawag bbd pps predicts that under aerobic conditions atenolol can degrade by microbial hydrolysis of its primary amide into carboxylic acid 13 proving its high removal in all studied cases table 1 phacs with logkow that varies from 3 0 to 5 9 such as diclofenac 4 51 and naproxen 3 18 corresponded to high and medium adsorption observed and therefore more expressive removal rates this effect could be due to the high biodegradation rates observed for these two compounds ibuprofen however can be observed to be an exception that although presents a medium logkow value 3 97 low adsorption is observed 14 under aerobic condition the metabolization of ibuprofen yields hydroxyibuprofen and carboxy ibuprofen metabolites 61 whereas biotransformation of naproxen can yield 2 6 hyd roxynaphthalen 2 yl propanoic acid and 1 6 methoxynaphtha len 2 yl ethanon as intermediates 62 increasing hrt of these compounds by sludge adsorption provides more time for microbial degradation i e micro pollutant gets degraded either by catabolic microbial enzymes or utilized by microorganisms as a carbon source on the other hand hydrophilic micro pollutants escape from wwtp without biodegradation along with effluent and evades the biodegradation process another feature related to the phacs removal is associated to volatilization of the compound which is defined by the henry law constant kh to achieve significant volatilization it is required kh value 3 103 mol m3 pa however in the case of pharmaceuticals this value is normally around of kh 10 5 63 thus volatilization of phacs in a wastewater treatment plant can be negligible photo degradation of these compounds is also considered insignificant due to the high sludge concentration which increases the wastewater turbidity and therefore blocks the penetration of sunlight in the top layer 52 since wwtps are not designed to remove phacs especially antibiotic they are known to be the main source of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes for surface waters 64 thus more attention has to be paid to the adverse ecological effect caused by their persistence especially throughout the wwtps and potential long term effects toward the non target aquatic organisms even at low concentrations it is possible to note that in general individual concentrations of many phacs are higher in effluents of wwtps than concentrations found in surface water it is attributed to dilution as well as partial remediation by natural pathways like hydrolysis sorption onto colloids biodegradation natural attenuation and photolysis 65 66 due to the majority phacs characteristics of being biorefractory partial transformation by abiotic reactions is more likely to happen 67 ph natural organic matter nom and ionic strength of the receiving media may influence the speciation and concentration level of each phac in the environment once in the water body phacs can take many different pathways some phacs at different ph become charged and can easily absorb onto colloids trapped by nom or associated with cations in the water and transferred to sediments 65 in general the levels of the studied pharmaceutical compounds were also water source dependent which in turn depends on the location popular habits wastewater treatment type phacs consumption patterns physicochemical properties and stability as well as the season 68 rainfall or lack of therefore might be one of the causes associated with the phacs fluctuation concentration 24 69 increased flow caused by rainfall might have two different effects on the phacs concentration influent to wtp firstly they might dilute the phacs concentrations on rivers bed resulting in lower removal efficiency by wtp secondly it could suspend settled sediments in which pharmaceutical compounds are adsorbed and releasing them into the water stream 23 additionally after rainfall incidents surface water could be polluted by wwtp overflows which might increase the phacs concentration on water sources to wtp 23 some compounds have higher usage rates during winter months for example antipyretics such as diclofenac ibuprofen and naproxen which are less efficiently removed during wastewater treatment in winter weather the same can be stated to warmer seasons where it is possible to note a pick in the consumption of antihistamines for example gemfibrozil salicylic acid and acetaminophen 68 70 also on warmer seasons the microbiological active is higher due to the increase in the temperature 50 71 other pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics antiepileptic or b blockers are similarly consumed during both seasons thus it is not observed seasonal pattern 68 nelson et al 71 assessed the distribution of phacs concentration during the days it was found that some compounds have broad increase decrease in concentration over such as erythromycin azithromycin atenolol propranolol and gemfibrozil the highest concentrations generally occur between 4 and 7 pm and lowest concentrations seem to occur between 8 and 11 a m gemfibrozil seems to have a bimodal cycle similar to naproxen other compounds such as carbamazepine primidone fluoxetine metoprolol triclocarban and phenytoin don t show any variation in their concentration along the day some compounds appear to have daily minima during 10 11 30 a m this behaviour is possible to be explained by taking into consideration that both consumption and excretion patterns of the studied population phacs are usually administered every 8 or 12 h and the last intake of the day is usually at night during the night these compounds are accumulated in urine and faeces and are released along with the first toilet flush of the morning 72 also from table 1 it is possible to observe that some compounds found all around the world are also listed on the watch list of eu 30 for instance macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin clarithromycin and estrone also carbamazepine atenolol ibuprofen bezafibrate gemfizobril sulfamethoxazole and naproxen are classified as class i high priority in global water research coalition gwrc 32 this rise attention to the possibility of consumption increase and therefore the release in the environment of these compounds as well as their potential threat to the environment and public health more toxicity data should be raised in order to determine the effects of these phacs not only in target organisms but also in non target populations as well as their effects as a mixture 4 the current panorama of phacs on drinking water when public health is concern drinking water treatment plants wtp may impose another barrier that can prevent the return of these phacs to human body many studies have been carried out in order to detect phacs in conventional wtp table 2 however the conventional treatment plants that consist in coagulation flocculation and filtration followed by a kind of disinfection such as chlorination and ozonation have poor removal efficiencies especially the steps of coagulation flocculation and sand filtration 74 74 prechlorinaton is found to be very efficient in removal some phacs due to the high reactivity of chlorine with primary and secondary amines 75 76 according to huerta fontela et al 73 the efficiency of the prechlorination is ph dependent achieving higher removal at lower phs when applied for carbamazepine also the same study suggests that the absence of the imidazole moiety contributed to the deactivation of the aromatic ring to the chlorine reaction when analysing the angiotensin agents behaviour the presence of a bromide instead of chlorine in one of the aromatic rings and the substitution of a benzene ring by a pyridine one block the reactivity of this compound through chlorine attack 77 however the application of chlorine has no efficiency in the removal of β blockers 73 according to stackelberg et al 78 the process of clarification which consists of coagulation flocculation sedimentation and filtration is generally not a primary route by which phacs in filtered water samples are degraded or removed mostly due to the intrinsic characteristics of the compounds the application of ferric chloride coagulation may result in base or acid hydrolysis however the low concentration of phacs in superficial water and the hydrophobic behaviour of some phacs with log kow 3 0 may explain the lower removal of phacs through this process which could indicate removal by partitioning some such as sulfamethoxazole or acetaminophen compounds can occur hydrolysis during coagulation step 78 sand filtration is based on the sieving and in less proportion adsorption processes and since phacs have a molecular weight ranging from 100 to 800 kda these processes is not efficient in removing the target compounds gemfibrozil diclofenac naproxen propranolol atenolol carbamazepine iopamidol and fenofibrate were the major compounds detected in wtp effluents 74 79 81 these compounds are characterized by low kow and carbamazepine is also found to be persistent throughout physic chemical treatment this compound is considered to be a trace of human presence 58 60 47 in general most of the phacs removal would be dependent on chemical oxidation by chlorination and or ozonation adsorptive process by granular activated carbon gac and membrane filtration employed at each wtp the removal ratios of several pharmaceuticals i e ibuprofen and fenofibrate ranged from 10 and 80 ibuprofen could also be removed moderately by ozonation and activated carbon adsorption according to huber et al 82 ibuprofen was considered slow reacting pharmaceutical during conventional ozonation and in contrast carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole were considered fast reacting pharmaceuticals being in accordance with the results found in survey realised by huerta fontela et al 73 fenofibrate that has high hydrophobic property log kow 5 28 and exists as neutral molecular at ph 7 0 is expected to be efficiently removed by activated carbon filtration however it was observed a removal of approximately 9 table 2 this may be due to the competition of adsorption on activated sites of gac 74 it is possible to observe a negative removal efficiency when progesterone and testosterone are concerned table 2 it may be due to a gap in the actual hydraulic retention time hrt at each wtp and estimated hrt to set sampling schedule of its source water and finished water advanced treatment technologies such as ozonation activated carbon adsorption and reverse osmosis ro are applicable to phacs removal in wtps 74 83 86 ozonation is able to remove a large spectrum of contaminants found in raw waters although studies have demonstrated that the primary attack by ozone is sufficient to reduce specific effects such as endocrine disruption 82 antibacterial 87 and antiviral activity 83 during ozonation a mineralization of phacs is typically not achieved and compounds are only transformed 88 despite the general removal of specific effects by ozonation there is a concern about the unspecific toxicity of the mostly unknown transformation products which rises up possible problems with the application of ozone and the consequences to human health granular active carbon gac filtration is also efficient to remove compounds with high hydrophobic properties 73 reverse osmosis is recognized as an effective and reliable form of being applied mainly in the treatment of supply water either as a polishing step or in raw water purification 89 90 studies indicate that electrostatic exclusion is the predominant phenomenon in the rejection process of these membranes and therefore effective rejections of negative pharmaceutical compounds were observed exceeding 95 by ro membranes 84 86 the results of a study on the removal of hormones and pharmaceuticals in treated wastewater indicated that treatments using ozonation microfiltration and nanofiltration were partially effective while the treatment with ro was the most successful in the removal of target compounds 91 ozaki and li 92 investigated the rejection of various products among them the phacs by polyamide nf and ro membranes and observed that the rejection of organic compounds by ultra low pressure ro ulpro increased linearly with molecular weight and molecular weight of the evaluated compound from table 2 it is possible to note that as well as for the wastewater panorama many compounds that are listed in the watch list of eu 30 are found in the water surface as well as in drinking water for instance macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin and clarithromycin estrone and ethinylestradiol which confirms the necessity of increasing the efforts in order to monitor water sources and drinking water all around the world also since the consumption of phac tends to increase throughout the time more emphasis should be paid to non detected or not studied phacs as well as to developing countries in order to fill the gaps about occurrence of phacs in the environment drinking water and wastewater a risk assessment was conducted with the concentration values of phacs in the raw and treated water observed in table 2 for this purpose the benchmark quotient bq was calculated as the ratio between the mean or maximum drinking water concentration and the drinking water guidelines values drinking water equivalent level dwel for the compounds for which the values were available in the literature the dwel values were calculated by using eq 1 1 d w e l t d i x m x f v where tdi m f and v are tolerable daily intake μg kg bw day values available in supplementary material body weight considered to be 60 kg drinking water allocation adopted value of 0 2 and personal drinking water consumption 2 l day a bq value of 1 corresponds to a potable water concentration equal to the reference value dwel thus when a value of bq 1 is observed in the drinking water a potential human health risk may be associated if this consumption is prolonged over a period of life 102 bq values 0 1 in drinking water need an in depth investigation of the risk imposed associated with the presence of phacs it is worth mentioning that for compounds that have been found in raw water be it surface or underground water conventional drinking water treatment can dampen the risks and provide additional safety for these compounds it was assumed that a bq of 0 2 presents no significant risk to human health 102 in fig 2 the concentrations reported for drinking water fig 2a and raw water fig 2b are compared with dwel fig 2 shows that for most substances bq values are 0 1 or 0 2 for drinking raw water respectively representing no significant risk to human health in the range that needs further investigation it is possible to observe carbamazepine diazepam hydrochlorothiazide clarithromycin sotalol and gemfizobril raising attention to the presence of these compounds in the drinking water also of these compounds only clarithromycin is listed in the watch list of eu 30 and carbamazepine and gemfizobril are listed in the gwrc 32 as class i high priority bringing special attention to explore the human exposure to these phacs in drinking water three compounds were detected with a bq 1 fenofibrate carbamazepine and atenolol all of the three compounds are listed as class i in the gwrc 32 also their high concentration in drinking water and the inefficiency of wtp in reducing their concentrations and therefore risks in different parts of the globe draws attention to the necessity of removing these phacs and produce safer drinking water also it is possible to observe the presence of these compounds in the wastewater effluent in high concentration table 2 specially carbamazepine which is not considered as a highly persistent compounds and have been shown to be inert to the biological treatment process 56 58 studies from turkey mexico canada and 2 from china have found either carbamazepine or carbamazepine and gemfizobril in the wwtp effluent as well as diazepam atenolol sulfamethoxazole clarithromycin and erythromycin this also brings attention to the necessity of an application of an advanced treatment for wastewater in order to reduce the possible risks associated to the higher concentrations in raw surface water for 18 of the 38 phacs evaluated in this study the health risk assessment for drinking water could not be performed because either toxicity data or their concentrations in drinking water were missing most of these phacs are classified as psychiatric cardiac or hormonal highlighting the need for further studies focusing on determining the guideline values of these compounds in drinking water 5 future perspectives there are thousands of pharmaceuticals in the market that can go to the environment but less than 2 of them have been detected and investigated for treatment 74 therefore more efforts are needed to work on detection toxicities persistence and priorities of other compounds furthermore close attention has to be paid to the sensitive vulnerable subpopulations e g pregnant women since these groups are not contemplated in the researches found in the literature also it should be noted that the majority of the surveys are realised with target pharmaceuticals alone which may not represent the real hazard to human health since there is a mixture of many different phacs in the drinking water supplies effects of chronic low level exposure to pharmaceutical including exposure of sensitive subpopulations in a life time of consumption should also be assessed considering the difficulty in predicting the real and the full effects and risks of those trace organic substances impose either to human health or to wild life as well as their consumption increasing trend and therefore release in the environment the removal of these compounds of the wastewater and drinking water is paramount thus due to the failure of the current wwtp and wtp in removing phacs mainly due to the low concentration many studies have focused on the application of advanced water treatment processes such as membrane separation processes 33 86 88 90 103 in order to produce water with enough quality to protect human health and wild life membrane separation processes msp including nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have become an important alternative to produce good quality water reaching the drinking water standards due to their higher removal rate of low molecular weight organic pollutants minimizing the risk associated to the source and its contaminants as well as its modularity and ability to integrate with other systems to increase its efficiency and to reduce problems with fouling it is possible to integrate membrane systems using low pressure driven membranes such as ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf with nf ro membranes 6 conclusion pharmaceutically active compounds are a real threat around the world and the increasing tendency in the consumption and therefore the realise of these compounds in the environment raises a global warning since the acute and chronical effects are still not clear the chemical stability associated with a low concentration of phacs makes conventional water and wastewater treatment not efficient processes in removing these kinds of micropollutants what turns out to be released in the environment biodegradation adsorption and chlorination are the processes associated with the highest removal of phacs the existence of these compounds in the domestic wastewater as well as in the superficial and ground water are linked to the location season and populational habits more attention should be paid to developing countries in order to assess the real risks due to phacs in the environment especially due to lack of sanitation and trends of consumption increase of these compounds also more efforts should be given in order to determine all the range of phacs in the environment as well as their respective drinking water guideline value although conventional drinking water treatment were able to reduce the risks associated to the phacs in the water carbamazepine diazepam and genfizobril were still found with high risks associated to human health which brings attention to the development of safer techniques for drinking water production more studies are still needed on the detection toxicities especially on non target organisms persistence and priorities of other compounds especially in order to give background and subsidize decision making as well as to evaluate the environmental impact of mixtures of different phacs and to evaluate the best end of pipe technology to guarantee better removal of the most persistence and toxic compounds acknowledgements this work was supported by the coordination of superior level staff

14244,constructed wetland microbial fuel cells cw mfc can be used to treat wastewater while also generating bio electricity most research on cw mfcs have focused on cell configuration rather than the influence different wetland plants have on bio electricity production in this study three different indigenous wetland plants were investigated cyperus prolifer wachendorfia thyrsiflora and phragmites australis bio electricity production was assessed in terms of maximum power density and voltage variation the highest power density and voltage was obtained from the c prolifer plant species 229 52 mw m3 510 mv the removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand was 97 1 for c prolifer which was higher than w thyrsiflora 94 1 p australis 94 1 and the control unplanted system 90 2 phosphorus removal was measured in terms of orthophosphate removal efficiency the c prolifer plant species achieved higher orthophosphate removal efficiency 98 0 than the control 72 7 w thyrsiflora 58 6 and p australis 81 4 it was determined that a high root specific area and biomass were advantageous to power production it was also found that rapid acclimatisation to the wastewater was an important factor for generating power from this study it was determined that c prolifer was the most suitable wetland plant in terms of bio electricity organic matter ammonia and phosphate removal among the investigated plant species hence in the design of a cw mfc it would be advisable to use c prolifer to simultaneously treat wastewater and produce bio electricity keywords bio electricity cyperus prolifer phosphorus wastewater 1 introduction constructed wetlands are engineered systems that mimic natural purification mechanisms such as nitrification denitrification ammonification and adsorption to treat wastewater 1 being a cost effective eco friendly and low maintenance technology the technique has grown in popularity in recent years 2 the use of wastewater to produce energy has been implemented in the past using bio electrochemical wastewater treatment technologies these technologies simultaneously treat wastewater and produce electricity by using microbial fuel cells mfc the process of bio electricity generation starts in the anode where exoelectrogenic bacteria break down organic matter in an anaerobic condition and release electrons the electrons flow to the cathode via an external circuit due to a potential difference at the cathode a reduction process involving hydrogen ions oxygen and electrons normally takes place under aerobic conditions in 2012 researchers applied the concept of mfc to constructed wetlands to simultaneously treat wastewater and produce electricity 3 this technology dubbed constructed wetland microbial fuel cell cw mfc takes advantage of the anaerobic environment in the sediment layer and the aerobic environment in the upper water layer as constructed wetlands have inherently low energy consumption the use of mfcs in this system can potentially make it a self sustaining energy system hence cw mfc can be used to replace conventional wastewater treatment technologies when installation operational and maintenance costs are limiting factors however the implementation of cw mfc on a large scale has yet to be explored the concept is still in its infancy and several aspects of it are not fully understood the carbon source in a cw mfc comes from the root exudates of plants and the wastewater thus the bioelectricity production and treatment performance is based on the combined actions of the plants microorganisms and type of rhizodeposition 1 microorganisms are the catalyst in the breakdown of organics and therefore play a major role in bioelectric production and treatment performance plants can improve bacterial activity by releasing oxygen and rhizodeposition since each plant has its own physiology and morphology the bioelectricity production and treatment performance are directly related to the plant type therefore the selection of a suitable wetland plant species to be implemented in a cw mfc is an important decision for its design several studies have investigated the role of wetland plants in a cw mfc 4 6 however these studies only used one plant species and no comparison between plant species was investigated research that compares wetland plant species are rare in this regard saz and co workers 1 compared four wetland plant species however these plant species are not abundant or found in south africa zhou and co workers 7 compared several wetland plants for bioelectricity production using a cw mfc but did not compare treatment efficiencies furthermore little research has been done to investigate the effect of wetland plants on phosphorus removal in cw mfcs the aim of this work was therefore to investigate the performance of cw mfcs using three indigenous south african plant species 2 material and methods 2 1 plant species three different south african wetland plants were chosen for this study namely cyperus prolifer wachendorfia thyrsiflora and phragmites australis the former is a member of the cyperaceae sedge family and grows along the east coast of africa from kenya tanzania and mozambique through kwazulu natal and into the eastern 8 c prolifer is a perennial plant that flowers in early and late summer favourable growth conditions have been observed in neutral ph substrate 8 its fibrous roots make it suitable for cw mfc system as it provides a high surface area for microbial attachment w thyrsiflora grows in the western cape and eastern cape 9 it is a perennial plant of the haemodoraceae family that can grow in slightly acidic to neutral substrate the rootstock is a branched fleshy rhizome with clusters of thin fibrous roots at the nodes 9 no researcher has studied the use of this plant in cw mfcs as far as we know p australis is a cosmopolitan wetland plant of the poaceae family in south africa it is widespread in aquatic and semi aquatic areas 10 it is a very robust plant that can tolerate any soil conditions provided there is adequate moisture and thus can be very invasive it has been used extensively in constructed wetland for wastewater treatment 11 as a result cw mfc studies with p australis is quite common and thus can be used as a comparison in this study it has mostly shown to increase power production and contaminant removal efficiency in cw mfc systems 12 three plants of each species of c prolifer and w thyrsiflora were collected from kirstenbosch national botanical garden cape town south africa three p australis plants were obtained from the intaka island in century city cape town south africa the plants were in their vegetative state from the time of collection and until the end of the experiment after collection the plants were fully submerged in a solution of rooting hormone dynaroot for a duration of six days to help the roots acclimatise to a hydroponic system and reduce shock 2 2 experimental setup the cw mfc systems were constructed and operated in the water quality laboratory at the university of cape town for each plant three lab scale cw mfc systems were constructed furthermore three unplanted systems controls were built fig 1 shows the configuration used for the control and the planted cw mfcs the construction of the cw mfc equipment started with the inoculation of the anode granular activated carbon gac was mixed with sludge from an anaerobic digester a grain size of 1 7 to 3 3 mm was used for the gac about 300 ml of the gac was thoroughly mixed with 100 ml of the sludge the mixture was placed directly in a 5 l bucket and compacted a mesh of steel wire was placed on the layer to allow for an easier movement of electrons from the gac to the circuit wires see supplementary data a second identical layer of inoculated gac was then placed onto the mesh of wire and compacted the thickness of the gac layer was 20 mm as shown in fig 1 lightweight expanded clay aggregate leca was used as the support matrix for the plant as it helps with plant growth and also supports microbial attachment the support matrix was added up to 25 mm from the rim of the bucket whilst adding leca sampling tubes were placed at 50 mm and 120 mm from the bottom of the bucket the separator a permeable plastic sheet see supplementary data was placed at 90 mm from the bottom of the bucket the purpose of the separator was to prevent any roots from reaching the anode a layer of stone was placed on top of the leca layer to prevent it from floating platinum coated carbon cathode 0 4 mg cm2 was used for this experiment as it has widely been used in mfcs and has yielded high power densities 13 the cathode was placed on top of the stone layer settled sewage obtained from potsdam wastewater treatment works in cape town south africa was used for all experiments and added up to the level of the stones settled sewage was used as it remains as a homogenous liquid in the batch containers as opposed to raw wastewater or primary sludge which form a solid and liquid layer after a period approximately 5 to 10 mm of distilled water was then added to the container to ensure the cathode was fully immersed 2 3 operation 2 3 1 circuitry for the first five days the 12 systems triplicates of three different planted systems and three controls were left as open circuits this allowed each system to stabilize and reach a constant open circuit voltage the cathode and anode copper wires were connected directly to a data logger usb 6000 national instruments hungary the data logger read the voltage between the two electrodes every 10 min during normal operation after five days the systems had stabilized and 1000 ω resistors were connected in series with the cathode and anode for the remainder of the experiments 2 3 2 external conditions the natural environment was mimicked by having light dark cycles of 12 h on 50 w cob led lights the temperature in the laboratory was approximately 20 c due to evaporation and evapotranspiration the water level continuously dropped and thus water was topped up to the original level once a day 2 3 3 sampling and testing using a syringe approximate 13 ml of solution was extracted from each sampling tube top and bottom and then mixed thoroughly from the first treatment day samples for each system were tested for cod ammonia nitrate and phosphate at set intervals the cod of the samples were measured using standard titrimetric methods ammonia nitrate and orthophosphate were tested using an automated photometric analyzer gallery thermofisher scientific united states an initial test on a settled sewage sample showed that the cod ammonia phosphorus and nitrate concentrations were 730 mg cod l 106 94 mg n l 11 46 mg p l and 7 53 mg no3 l respectively the total phosphorus of the inoculum was 520 mg p l 2 3 4 polarization curves polarization tests were done on the 25th day of operation when the systems voltages stabilized the tests were conducted after the daily water addition to avoid any consequential disturbance to the system the following resistances were used for the polarization tests 100 ω 220 ω 560ω 1000 ω 4700 ω 10 000 ω 33 000 ω 56 000 ω 100000 ω 560000 ω and 1000000 ω voltage readings were taken two to three minutes after each resistor was inserted into the circuit to allow for stable voltage readings 2 4 bio electricity for each system the voltage across the 1000 ω resistor was plotted against time polarization curves were obtained by plotting current density versus power density for each resistor power and current density were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 13 for each resistor the average voltage was used in the equations shown below standard deviations for the power density were calculated using eq 3 internal resistances were determined by calculating the gradient of a current voltage iv characteristic curve 1 p v 2 r v a n 2 i v r v a n 3 s x i 1 n x i x 2 n 1 where r resistance ω van volume of the anode compartment m3 xi value of data point x mean value of data point n number of data point 2 5 removal efficiency the average cod ammonia nitrate and orthophosphate concentration readings were plotted against time for each system the removal efficiency was calculated using eq 4 4 removal efficiency c initial c final c initial 100 where c is the concentration of cod ammonia nitrate or orthophosphate in mg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of wetland plant species on bio electricity production the three wetland plants performed differently in closed circuit the voltage variations for the three wetland plants are shown in fig 2 among each triplicate the voltage variation showing the least external disturbances was chosen for analysis due to a power shortage it was not possible to record the voltage between the 17th and the 20th treatment day for the three planted systems cyclic variation in voltage caused by the release of oxygen during photosynthesis could be observed 3 1 1 cyperus prolifer the c prolifer systems fig 2a achieved a low voltage of approximately 85 mv from day 5 to day 10 the low voltage was possibly due to the high concentration of nitrate between treatment day 5 and 13 when the concentration of nitrate e n o 3 n 2 0 74 v was high nitrate was reduced instead of oxygen e o 2 h 2 o 1 23 v thus resulting in a lower cell potential this was due to a smaller reduction potential for nitrate ions however after thirteen days of operation the cell voltage for the c prolifer systems rose quickly to 0 51 v and exceeded the control s cell voltage the higher cell voltage could have been due to a lower anode and higher cathode potential the former is potentially due to the rise in the density of bacteria and number of exoelectrogens as compared to the control wetland plant species have shown to increase the density of bacteria by 10 times 14 and favour the growth of exoelectrogens 6 also as the plant acclimatised the amount of photosynthetic product released as root exudates would rise this could increase the amount of organic matter available at the anode and thus reduce the anode potential 1 the higher cathode potential was likely due to the release of oxygen from the roots of the wetland plant as the photosynthesis rate increased 5 low concentration of dissolved oxygen do contributes to mass transfer and activation losses through photosynthesis c prolifer could increase the do concentration and decrease the abovementioned losses 15 a steep decrease in voltage at the end of the experiment was observed and could be due to several reasons after breaking down the systems it was observed that the roots of c prolifer had penetrated the separator see supplementary data and reached the proximity of the anode as a result the anodic region was probably slightly aerobic at the end of the experiment and thus the coulombic efficiency of the system would have decreased since bacteria use oxygen as their terminal electron acceptor rather than the anode 16 furthermore the concentration of biodegradable organic matter was very low 20 mg cod l at the end of the experiment and thus the only electron source was the root exudates 3 1 2 wachendorfia thyrsiflora the w thyrsiflora systems initially yielded a closed circuit voltage of approximately 0 11 v the voltage increased slowly to a maximum of 0 31 v on the 25th treatment day the cell voltage of the w thyrsiflora systems were generally less than the control systems by monitoring the plant health it was deduced that the wetland plant did not acclimatise to its environment initially this was likely due to the high initial concentration of ammonia in the wastewater which was detrimental to the health of the plant 17 the root biomass that was initially present at the start of the experiment had all died by the 28th treatment day see supplementary data consequently the high density of the dead root biomass see supplementary data caused a decrease in proton transfer efficiency towards the cathode which resulted in high ohmic losses in the w thyrsiflora systems in a similar study saz and co workers 1 observed that wetland plants achieved a lower cell potential than the control due to high ohmic losses as the ammonia concentration dropped the wetland plant could start its metabolic and photosynthetic activities the release of oxygen and root exudates were likely the causes for the increased cell voltage after the 14th treatment day as shown in fig 2b however the cell voltage of w thyrsiflora remained lower than the control it is suggested that the low density of new emerging roots and the high ohmic losses limited the cell voltage however it is expected that the high density and surface area of fibrous roots for the w thyrsiflora plant species has the potential to achieve a relatively high voltage in cw mfcs 3 1 3 phragmites australis the p australis systems initially produced a cell potential of approximately 0 26 v in closed circuit the cell voltage then slowly increased to a maximum of 0 40 v this voltage was maintained during the last phase of the experiment p australis is a robust wetland plant that can support very harsh environments 10 and therefore acclimatised quickly the p australis systems used in a previous study achieved an average cell voltage of 0 7 v across a 1000 ω resistor 18 the higher voltage could be due to the use of a different configuration and wastewater in the abovementioned study the anode and cathode were completely separated by a non porous membrane and thus no oxygen could reach the anode another study obtained an average voltage of 0 31 v with a continuous up flow p australis system across a 1000 ω resistor 19 compared to the control the p australis systems had higher initial cell voltages since the plant acclimatised quickly it started photosynthesizing shortly after the experiment commenced by releasing oxygen and exudates through its roots the wetland plant likely increased the cathode potential and decreased the anode potential respectively the initially higher cell potential was probably due to a higher microbial density and higher proportion of exoelectrogens in this system in the last stage of the experiment the cell potential of the control was similar to the p australis systems this was likely as a result of the microbial population in the control gradually increasing and eventually reaching a similar population density as the p australis systems this can be explained by the low density and surface area of the p australis root biomass see supplementary data that provided a very limited surface area for biofilm attachment which would have limited the release of oxygen and exudates 3 2 maximum power density the polarization tests were carried out on the 25th day of operation polarization curves for the different systems are shown in fig 3 a the internal resistance for each system was obtained from the gradient of a voltage versus current graph shown in fig 3b the bio electricity results are summarised in table 1 the maximum power density for the c prolifer systems was 24 higher than the control whilst the maximum power density for w thyrsiflora and p australis were 42 and 41 less than the control respectively on the polarization test day the roots of c prolifer had developed more extensively than w thyrsiflora and p australis consequently the flux of oxygen and exudates to the cathode and anode respectively was the highest for c prolifer as discussed in section 3 1 both these factors contributed to a higher voltage and thus a higher maximum power density w thyrsiflora and p australis achieved a lower maximum power density than the control as the power production in both systems was limited by the amount of organics 47 mg cod l available at the time of polarization in a continuous flow cw mfc with p australis a maximum power density of 276 mw m3 was obtained when a cod concentration of 583 mg cod l was used 19 in this case a constant source of electrons was available and therefore power production was not constrained by low cod concentrations in general the standard deviations for the power densities were high as the power production is highly dependent on the physiological factors such as root density leaves surface area chlorophyll content which varied within each plant species the internal resistances obtained using the current voltage characteristic curve do not agree with the maximum power densities as well as the voltage readings for the c prolifer system the internal resistance was expected to be much lower than the control whilst for the w thyrsiflora and p australis system the internal resistances were expected to be both much higher than the control other studies have obtained much higher differences between their planted and control systems for instance zhou and co workers 7 determined that the internal resistance of a dead acorus calamus was 5000 ω whilst the unplanted control was 600 ω furthermore it was observed that the internal resistance obtained using the current voltage gradient did not match with the peak power density method 20 hence the internal resistances value obtained in this study have not been used for analysis it is thus recommended for future research to obtain the actual internal resistance values using other methods such as the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis 20 the internal resistance values can then be used to make deductions about the effect of the different plants on the presence of exoelectrogens the three plant systems investigated in this study have shown different behaviours with respect to bio electricity generation c prolifer and w thyrsiflora adapted slowly to their environment and the voltage gradually increased for the duration of the experiment the p australis systems showed a quick adaptation and generated a near constant cell voltage during the experiment the c prolifer systems achieved the highest cell potential as well as the highest maximum power density 3 3 removal efficiencies 3 3 1 ammonia removal the difference between the ammonia removal efficiencies among the plant systems is not significant as shown in fig 5a however from fig 5a it can be seen that the ammonia concentration in the c prolifer systems is less than the other systems c prolifer was able to achieve a high density of root biomass which offered a large surface area for the growth of bacteria these roots released oxygen and thus aerated a larger volume theoretically a higher root biomass provided a higher removal of ammonia several studies have found a similar relationship between the root surface area and ammonia removal efficiency 1 5 21 the change in ammonia concentration after seven days in the c prolifer and p australis systems were initially similar this demonstrates that the latter adapted quickly to its environment but the removal rate was limited by its low density root system it is not fully understood why the ammonia removal efficiency for the w thyrsiflora system varied extensively among the triplicates 3 3 2 nitrate removal the control systems achieved the highest nitrate removal efficiency after 28 days of operation by promoting an anoxic environment and thus favouring denitrification the c prolifer systems achieved the lowest nitrate removal efficiencies as they provided more aeration than the other wetland plants furthermore the c prolifer systems achieved the highest rate of nitrate formation via nitrification these results indicate that nitrate removal efficiency is dependent on the plant species high root biomass has shown to be detrimental to the required anoxic environment for denitrification and thus nitrate removal 3 3 3 phosphorus removal the removal of phosphorus in constructed wetlands is mainly controlled by the combined effect of filtration media plant species and bacteria 22 in this study the removal of phosphorus was investigated by measuring the concentration of orthophosphate the orthophosphate removal efficiencies are shown in fig 5c the c prolifer and p australis systems initially had similar trends in orthophosphate concentrations fig 4 c the initial steep decrease in orthophosphate concentration was likely due to absorption by phosphate accumulating organisms pao the gac was inoculated with sludge from an anaerobic digester fed with sludge containing paos a total phosphorus test on the inoculum showed the p content was 520 mg p l hence all microcosms started with a high population of paos the c prolifer and p australis systems achieved higher removal efficiencies when compared to the control systems as there was also an immediate uptake of phosphate by the plant roots with time the c prolifer system developed higher root biomass when compared to the p australis systems subsequently a higher surface area was available for increased phosphate uptake a similar relationship between root biomass and phosphate removal efficiency was obtained by saz and co workers 1 the w thyrsiflora systems achieved lower removal efficiencies than the control systems as there was no uptake of phosphate initially because the roots died when new roots emerged around the 13th treatment day there was a sharp decrease in orthophosphate concentration however due to the low density of the new roots these systems achieved the lowest removal efficiency when compared to the other wetland plant systems the increase in orthophosphate concentration in the w thyrsiflora system after the 21st day of operation was likely due to the release of orthophosphate from phosphate bound organic compound it is expected that w thyrsiflora would perform better than the control systems when operated for longer periods after the 28th day of operation the orthophosphate removal efficiencies for the control c prolifer w thyrsiflora and p australis were 72 6 99 0 3 58 6 3 and 81 4 respectively fig 5 c the c prolifer and p australis systems performed better than the control systems whilst the w thyrsiflora systems achieved lower removal efficiencies the c prolifer systems outperformed the other systems because it was able to grow more root biomass that resulted in a higher absorption rate and microbial density 3 3 4 chemical oxygen demand removal the organic matter was measured in terms of the chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations the trends in cod concentrations for the different systems are shown in figs 4d and 5 d all the plant systems had a slightly better organic removal efficiency than the control systems by the end of the experiments the differences in cod removal efficiency for c prolifer w thyrsiflora and p australis were 6 3 3 3 and 3 2 respectively the presence of wetland plants therefore has a positive effect on organic removal this has also been widely reported in literature 4 6 however the differences in cod removal efficiencies between the control systems and the plant systems in this study were very small 7 to infer significant relationships with respect to the role of wetland plants in cw mfc systems higher organic loading and longer operating times are required 4 5 and should therefore be investigated further the highest organic breakdown rate obr occurred in the first seven days of operation the high proportion of volatile fatty acid vfa in the settled sewage was readily broken down by the bacteria this was a major limitation for this experiment when the wetland plants eventually acclimatised to their environment the amount of biodegradable matter was low liu and co workers 23 showed that the wetland plants are more efficient when the cod concentrations were higher after the first week of treatment the obr varied for the different plant systems c prolifer and p australis had a higher obr than the control systems this is probably because these systems were rapidly colonised by bacteria as their roots secreted exudates on the other hand the w thyrsiflora systems initially achieved lower obrs than the control systems the existing roots of w thyrsiflora did not survive and thus did not secrete oxygen or exudates before the 13th treatment day furthermore the dead roots were taking up space in the systems and limited the spatial distribution of bacteria after the 15th day of treatment the obr decreased slightly for the c prolifer and p australis systems as the amount of biodegradable organic decreased the c prolifer systems likely achieved higher degradation rates than the p australis systems due to higher microbial densities after the 13th treatment day the w thyrsiflora systems obr increased due to the emergence of new root biomass after the 28th treatment day c prolifer w thyrsiflora and p australis achieved a cod removal efficiency of 98 1 93 1 and 93 1 respectively using a batch system with ipomoea aquatica zhao and co workers 24 obtained a maximum removal efficiency of 75 the lower removal efficiency for their system could be due to a shorter operating time of 11 days the maximum cod removal efficiency was achieved by c prolifer theoretically the larger root surface area of c prolifer provided a more extensive area for bacteria growth consequently the quantity of organic matter broken down in the c prolifer systems within the duration of the experiment was higher than the two other wetland plants w thyrsiflora achieved a cod removal efficiency relatively close to the two other wetland plants even though its existing roots died initially it is thus expected that w thyrsiflora can achieve a higher cod removal if the growth conditions are adequate for its quick adaptation however the composition of wastewaters varies significantly and therefore the growth conditions would also vary therefore using w thyrsiflora plants in a constructed wetland would be challenging as constant monitoring would be required to ensure that the growth conditions are adequate hence in terms of cod removal c prolifer is the most adequate among the three wetland plants considered 4 other consideration and implications of this research this research had two major limitations the use of settled sewage in a fed batch system meant that the organic matter decreased quickly with time thus when the plants were eventually acclimatised the low cod concentration limited power production to determine the long term effect of the plants a different feed higher cod concentration or continuous operation should be investigated this study only investigated three indigenous south african plants due to limited time space and budget future research with different plants should be investigated so that a large database is available for plant selection when designing cw mfcs this study also gives ideal characteristics of wetland plants which should be considered for cw mfc systems 5 conclusions this study provides an exploratory investigation into which south african plant species are best for cw mfc systems in terms of bio electricity production and contaminant removal bio electricity production was assessed in terms of maximum power density and voltage variation it was determined that a high specific root area and biomass were advantageous to power production it was also found that a rapid acclimatisation to the wastewater was an important factor for generating a stable voltage hence a wetland plant that can adapt quickly to wastewater and develop a high root biomass and specific area is most beneficial to a cw mfc in terms of bioelectricity production the ammonia removal efficiencies varied for the different plants investigated the removal of ammonia was mainly via nitrification and adsorption in this regard high root biomass and surface area were also advantageous as they promoted higher oxygen release and nitrification the removal of nitrate was likely due to the biological denitrification process in this regard high root biomass was not advantageous phosphorus was removed by microorganisms and wetland plant absorption high root biomass and specific surface area significantly improved phosphorus removal the c prolifer systems were the most adequate wetland plant in terms of bio electricity organic matter ammonia and phosphate removal when compared to the other systems investigated hence in the design of a cw mfc it would be advisable to use c prolifer

14244,constructed wetland microbial fuel cells cw mfc can be used to treat wastewater while also generating bio electricity most research on cw mfcs have focused on cell configuration rather than the influence different wetland plants have on bio electricity production in this study three different indigenous wetland plants were investigated cyperus prolifer wachendorfia thyrsiflora and phragmites australis bio electricity production was assessed in terms of maximum power density and voltage variation the highest power density and voltage was obtained from the c prolifer plant species 229 52 mw m3 510 mv the removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand was 97 1 for c prolifer which was higher than w thyrsiflora 94 1 p australis 94 1 and the control unplanted system 90 2 phosphorus removal was measured in terms of orthophosphate removal efficiency the c prolifer plant species achieved higher orthophosphate removal efficiency 98 0 than the control 72 7 w thyrsiflora 58 6 and p australis 81 4 it was determined that a high root specific area and biomass were advantageous to power production it was also found that rapid acclimatisation to the wastewater was an important factor for generating power from this study it was determined that c prolifer was the most suitable wetland plant in terms of bio electricity organic matter ammonia and phosphate removal among the investigated plant species hence in the design of a cw mfc it would be advisable to use c prolifer to simultaneously treat wastewater and produce bio electricity keywords bio electricity cyperus prolifer phosphorus wastewater 1 introduction constructed wetlands are engineered systems that mimic natural purification mechanisms such as nitrification denitrification ammonification and adsorption to treat wastewater 1 being a cost effective eco friendly and low maintenance technology the technique has grown in popularity in recent years 2 the use of wastewater to produce energy has been implemented in the past using bio electrochemical wastewater treatment technologies these technologies simultaneously treat wastewater and produce electricity by using microbial fuel cells mfc the process of bio electricity generation starts in the anode where exoelectrogenic bacteria break down organic matter in an anaerobic condition and release electrons the electrons flow to the cathode via an external circuit due to a potential difference at the cathode a reduction process involving hydrogen ions oxygen and electrons normally takes place under aerobic conditions in 2012 researchers applied the concept of mfc to constructed wetlands to simultaneously treat wastewater and produce electricity 3 this technology dubbed constructed wetland microbial fuel cell cw mfc takes advantage of the anaerobic environment in the sediment layer and the aerobic environment in the upper water layer as constructed wetlands have inherently low energy consumption the use of mfcs in this system can potentially make it a self sustaining energy system hence cw mfc can be used to replace conventional wastewater treatment technologies when installation operational and maintenance costs are limiting factors however the implementation of cw mfc on a large scale has yet to be explored the concept is still in its infancy and several aspects of it are not fully understood the carbon source in a cw mfc comes from the root exudates of plants and the wastewater thus the bioelectricity production and treatment performance is based on the combined actions of the plants microorganisms and type of rhizodeposition 1 microorganisms are the catalyst in the breakdown of organics and therefore play a major role in bioelectric production and treatment performance plants can improve bacterial activity by releasing oxygen and rhizodeposition since each plant has its own physiology and morphology the bioelectricity production and treatment performance are directly related to the plant type therefore the selection of a suitable wetland plant species to be implemented in a cw mfc is an important decision for its design several studies have investigated the role of wetland plants in a cw mfc 4 6 however these studies only used one plant species and no comparison between plant species was investigated research that compares wetland plant species are rare in this regard saz and co workers 1 compared four wetland plant species however these plant species are not abundant or found in south africa zhou and co workers 7 compared several wetland plants for bioelectricity production using a cw mfc but did not compare treatment efficiencies furthermore little research has been done to investigate the effect of wetland plants on phosphorus removal in cw mfcs the aim of this work was therefore to investigate the performance of cw mfcs using three indigenous south african plant species 2 material and methods 2 1 plant species three different south african wetland plants were chosen for this study namely cyperus prolifer wachendorfia thyrsiflora and phragmites australis the former is a member of the cyperaceae sedge family and grows along the east coast of africa from kenya tanzania and mozambique through kwazulu natal and into the eastern 8 c prolifer is a perennial plant that flowers in early and late summer favourable growth conditions have been observed in neutral ph substrate 8 its fibrous roots make it suitable for cw mfc system as it provides a high surface area for microbial attachment w thyrsiflora grows in the western cape and eastern cape 9 it is a perennial plant of the haemodoraceae family that can grow in slightly acidic to neutral substrate the rootstock is a branched fleshy rhizome with clusters of thin fibrous roots at the nodes 9 no researcher has studied the use of this plant in cw mfcs as far as we know p australis is a cosmopolitan wetland plant of the poaceae family in south africa it is widespread in aquatic and semi aquatic areas 10 it is a very robust plant that can tolerate any soil conditions provided there is adequate moisture and thus can be very invasive it has been used extensively in constructed wetland for wastewater treatment 11 as a result cw mfc studies with p australis is quite common and thus can be used as a comparison in this study it has mostly shown to increase power production and contaminant removal efficiency in cw mfc systems 12 three plants of each species of c prolifer and w thyrsiflora were collected from kirstenbosch national botanical garden cape town south africa three p australis plants were obtained from the intaka island in century city cape town south africa the plants were in their vegetative state from the time of collection and until the end of the experiment after collection the plants were fully submerged in a solution of rooting hormone dynaroot for a duration of six days to help the roots acclimatise to a hydroponic system and reduce shock 2 2 experimental setup the cw mfc systems were constructed and operated in the water quality laboratory at the university of cape town for each plant three lab scale cw mfc systems were constructed furthermore three unplanted systems controls were built fig 1 shows the configuration used for the control and the planted cw mfcs the construction of the cw mfc equipment started with the inoculation of the anode granular activated carbon gac was mixed with sludge from an anaerobic digester a grain size of 1 7 to 3 3 mm was used for the gac about 300 ml of the gac was thoroughly mixed with 100 ml of the sludge the mixture was placed directly in a 5 l bucket and compacted a mesh of steel wire was placed on the layer to allow for an easier movement of electrons from the gac to the circuit wires see supplementary data a second identical layer of inoculated gac was then placed onto the mesh of wire and compacted the thickness of the gac layer was 20 mm as shown in fig 1 lightweight expanded clay aggregate leca was used as the support matrix for the plant as it helps with plant growth and also supports microbial attachment the support matrix was added up to 25 mm from the rim of the bucket whilst adding leca sampling tubes were placed at 50 mm and 120 mm from the bottom of the bucket the separator a permeable plastic sheet see supplementary data was placed at 90 mm from the bottom of the bucket the purpose of the separator was to prevent any roots from reaching the anode a layer of stone was placed on top of the leca layer to prevent it from floating platinum coated carbon cathode 0 4 mg cm2 was used for this experiment as it has widely been used in mfcs and has yielded high power densities 13 the cathode was placed on top of the stone layer settled sewage obtained from potsdam wastewater treatment works in cape town south africa was used for all experiments and added up to the level of the stones settled sewage was used as it remains as a homogenous liquid in the batch containers as opposed to raw wastewater or primary sludge which form a solid and liquid layer after a period approximately 5 to 10 mm of distilled water was then added to the container to ensure the cathode was fully immersed 2 3 operation 2 3 1 circuitry for the first five days the 12 systems triplicates of three different planted systems and three controls were left as open circuits this allowed each system to stabilize and reach a constant open circuit voltage the cathode and anode copper wires were connected directly to a data logger usb 6000 national instruments hungary the data logger read the voltage between the two electrodes every 10 min during normal operation after five days the systems had stabilized and 1000 ω resistors were connected in series with the cathode and anode for the remainder of the experiments 2 3 2 external conditions the natural environment was mimicked by having light dark cycles of 12 h on 50 w cob led lights the temperature in the laboratory was approximately 20 c due to evaporation and evapotranspiration the water level continuously dropped and thus water was topped up to the original level once a day 2 3 3 sampling and testing using a syringe approximate 13 ml of solution was extracted from each sampling tube top and bottom and then mixed thoroughly from the first treatment day samples for each system were tested for cod ammonia nitrate and phosphate at set intervals the cod of the samples were measured using standard titrimetric methods ammonia nitrate and orthophosphate were tested using an automated photometric analyzer gallery thermofisher scientific united states an initial test on a settled sewage sample showed that the cod ammonia phosphorus and nitrate concentrations were 730 mg cod l 106 94 mg n l 11 46 mg p l and 7 53 mg no3 l respectively the total phosphorus of the inoculum was 520 mg p l 2 3 4 polarization curves polarization tests were done on the 25th day of operation when the systems voltages stabilized the tests were conducted after the daily water addition to avoid any consequential disturbance to the system the following resistances were used for the polarization tests 100 ω 220 ω 560ω 1000 ω 4700 ω 10 000 ω 33 000 ω 56 000 ω 100000 ω 560000 ω and 1000000 ω voltage readings were taken two to three minutes after each resistor was inserted into the circuit to allow for stable voltage readings 2 4 bio electricity for each system the voltage across the 1000 ω resistor was plotted against time polarization curves were obtained by plotting current density versus power density for each resistor power and current density were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 13 for each resistor the average voltage was used in the equations shown below standard deviations for the power density were calculated using eq 3 internal resistances were determined by calculating the gradient of a current voltage iv characteristic curve 1 p v 2 r v a n 2 i v r v a n 3 s x i 1 n x i x 2 n 1 where r resistance ω van volume of the anode compartment m3 xi value of data point x mean value of data point n number of data point 2 5 removal efficiency the average cod ammonia nitrate and orthophosphate concentration readings were plotted against time for each system the removal efficiency was calculated using eq 4 4 removal efficiency c initial c final c initial 100 where c is the concentration of cod ammonia nitrate or orthophosphate in mg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of wetland plant species on bio electricity production the three wetland plants performed differently in closed circuit the voltage variations for the three wetland plants are shown in fig 2 among each triplicate the voltage variation showing the least external disturbances was chosen for analysis due to a power shortage it was not possible to record the voltage between the 17th and the 20th treatment day for the three planted systems cyclic variation in voltage caused by the release of oxygen during photosynthesis could be observed 3 1 1 cyperus prolifer the c prolifer systems fig 2a achieved a low voltage of approximately 85 mv from day 5 to day 10 the low voltage was possibly due to the high concentration of nitrate between treatment day 5 and 13 when the concentration of nitrate e n o 3 n 2 0 74 v was high nitrate was reduced instead of oxygen e o 2 h 2 o 1 23 v thus resulting in a lower cell potential this was due to a smaller reduction potential for nitrate ions however after thirteen days of operation the cell voltage for the c prolifer systems rose quickly to 0 51 v and exceeded the control s cell voltage the higher cell voltage could have been due to a lower anode and higher cathode potential the former is potentially due to the rise in the density of bacteria and number of exoelectrogens as compared to the control wetland plant species have shown to increase the density of bacteria by 10 times 14 and favour the growth of exoelectrogens 6 also as the plant acclimatised the amount of photosynthetic product released as root exudates would rise this could increase the amount of organic matter available at the anode and thus reduce the anode potential 1 the higher cathode potential was likely due to the release of oxygen from the roots of the wetland plant as the photosynthesis rate increased 5 low concentration of dissolved oxygen do contributes to mass transfer and activation losses through photosynthesis c prolifer could increase the do concentration and decrease the abovementioned losses 15 a steep decrease in voltage at the end of the experiment was observed and could be due to several reasons after breaking down the systems it was observed that the roots of c prolifer had penetrated the separator see supplementary data and reached the proximity of the anode as a result the anodic region was probably slightly aerobic at the end of the experiment and thus the coulombic efficiency of the system would have decreased since bacteria use oxygen as their terminal electron acceptor rather than the anode 16 furthermore the concentration of biodegradable organic matter was very low 20 mg cod l at the end of the experiment and thus the only electron source was the root exudates 3 1 2 wachendorfia thyrsiflora the w thyrsiflora systems initially yielded a closed circuit voltage of approximately 0 11 v the voltage increased slowly to a maximum of 0 31 v on the 25th treatment day the cell voltage of the w thyrsiflora systems were generally less than the control systems by monitoring the plant health it was deduced that the wetland plant did not acclimatise to its environment initially this was likely due to the high initial concentration of ammonia in the wastewater which was detrimental to the health of the plant 17 the root biomass that was initially present at the start of the experiment had all died by the 28th treatment day see supplementary data consequently the high density of the dead root biomass see supplementary data caused a decrease in proton transfer efficiency towards the cathode which resulted in high ohmic losses in the w thyrsiflora systems in a similar study saz and co workers 1 observed that wetland plants achieved a lower cell potential than the control due to high ohmic losses as the ammonia concentration dropped the wetland plant could start its metabolic and photosynthetic activities the release of oxygen and root exudates were likely the causes for the increased cell voltage after the 14th treatment day as shown in fig 2b however the cell voltage of w thyrsiflora remained lower than the control it is suggested that the low density of new emerging roots and the high ohmic losses limited the cell voltage however it is expected that the high density and surface area of fibrous roots for the w thyrsiflora plant species has the potential to achieve a relatively high voltage in cw mfcs 3 1 3 phragmites australis the p australis systems initially produced a cell potential of approximately 0 26 v in closed circuit the cell voltage then slowly increased to a maximum of 0 40 v this voltage was maintained during the last phase of the experiment p australis is a robust wetland plant that can support very harsh environments 10 and therefore acclimatised quickly the p australis systems used in a previous study achieved an average cell voltage of 0 7 v across a 1000 ω resistor 18 the higher voltage could be due to the use of a different configuration and wastewater in the abovementioned study the anode and cathode were completely separated by a non porous membrane and thus no oxygen could reach the anode another study obtained an average voltage of 0 31 v with a continuous up flow p australis system across a 1000 ω resistor 19 compared to the control the p australis systems had higher initial cell voltages since the plant acclimatised quickly it started photosynthesizing shortly after the experiment commenced by releasing oxygen and exudates through its roots the wetland plant likely increased the cathode potential and decreased the anode potential respectively the initially higher cell potential was probably due to a higher microbial density and higher proportion of exoelectrogens in this system in the last stage of the experiment the cell potential of the control was similar to the p australis systems this was likely as a result of the microbial population in the control gradually increasing and eventually reaching a similar population density as the p australis systems this can be explained by the low density and surface area of the p australis root biomass see supplementary data that provided a very limited surface area for biofilm attachment which would have limited the release of oxygen and exudates 3 2 maximum power density the polarization tests were carried out on the 25th day of operation polarization curves for the different systems are shown in fig 3 a the internal resistance for each system was obtained from the gradient of a voltage versus current graph shown in fig 3b the bio electricity results are summarised in table 1 the maximum power density for the c prolifer systems was 24 higher than the control whilst the maximum power density for w thyrsiflora and p australis were 42 and 41 less than the control respectively on the polarization test day the roots of c prolifer had developed more extensively than w thyrsiflora and p australis consequently the flux of oxygen and exudates to the cathode and anode respectively was the highest for c prolifer as discussed in section 3 1 both these factors contributed to a higher voltage and thus a higher maximum power density w thyrsiflora and p australis achieved a lower maximum power density than the control as the power production in both systems was limited by the amount of organics 47 mg cod l available at the time of polarization in a continuous flow cw mfc with p australis a maximum power density of 276 mw m3 was obtained when a cod concentration of 583 mg cod l was used 19 in this case a constant source of electrons was available and therefore power production was not constrained by low cod concentrations in general the standard deviations for the power densities were high as the power production is highly dependent on the physiological factors such as root density leaves surface area chlorophyll content which varied within each plant species the internal resistances obtained using the current voltage characteristic curve do not agree with the maximum power densities as well as the voltage readings for the c prolifer system the internal resistance was expected to be much lower than the control whilst for the w thyrsiflora and p australis system the internal resistances were expected to be both much higher than the control other studies have obtained much higher differences between their planted and control systems for instance zhou and co workers 7 determined that the internal resistance of a dead acorus calamus was 5000 ω whilst the unplanted control was 600 ω furthermore it was observed that the internal resistance obtained using the current voltage gradient did not match with the peak power density method 20 hence the internal resistances value obtained in this study have not been used for analysis it is thus recommended for future research to obtain the actual internal resistance values using other methods such as the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis 20 the internal resistance values can then be used to make deductions about the effect of the different plants on the presence of exoelectrogens the three plant systems investigated in this study have shown different behaviours with respect to bio electricity generation c prolifer and w thyrsiflora adapted slowly to their environment and the voltage gradually increased for the duration of the experiment the p australis systems showed a quick adaptation and generated a near constant cell voltage during the experiment the c prolifer systems achieved the highest cell potential as well as the highest maximum power density 3 3 removal efficiencies 3 3 1 ammonia removal the difference between the ammonia removal efficiencies among the plant systems is not significant as shown in fig 5a however from fig 5a it can be seen that the ammonia concentration in the c prolifer systems is less than the other systems c prolifer was able to achieve a high density of root biomass which offered a large surface area for the growth of bacteria these roots released oxygen and thus aerated a larger volume theoretically a higher root biomass provided a higher removal of ammonia several studies have found a similar relationship between the root surface area and ammonia removal efficiency 1 5 21 the change in ammonia concentration after seven days in the c prolifer and p australis systems were initially similar this demonstrates that the latter adapted quickly to its environment but the removal rate was limited by its low density root system it is not fully understood why the ammonia removal efficiency for the w thyrsiflora system varied extensively among the triplicates 3 3 2 nitrate removal the control systems achieved the highest nitrate removal efficiency after 28 days of operation by promoting an anoxic environment and thus favouring denitrification the c prolifer systems achieved the lowest nitrate removal efficiencies as they provided more aeration than the other wetland plants furthermore the c prolifer systems achieved the highest rate of nitrate formation via nitrification these results indicate that nitrate removal efficiency is dependent on the plant species high root biomass has shown to be detrimental to the required anoxic environment for denitrification and thus nitrate removal 3 3 3 phosphorus removal the removal of phosphorus in constructed wetlands is mainly controlled by the combined effect of filtration media plant species and bacteria 22 in this study the removal of phosphorus was investigated by measuring the concentration of orthophosphate the orthophosphate removal efficiencies are shown in fig 5c the c prolifer and p australis systems initially had similar trends in orthophosphate concentrations fig 4 c the initial steep decrease in orthophosphate concentration was likely due to absorption by phosphate accumulating organisms pao the gac was inoculated with sludge from an anaerobic digester fed with sludge containing paos a total phosphorus test on the inoculum showed the p content was 520 mg p l hence all microcosms started with a high population of paos the c prolifer and p australis systems achieved higher removal efficiencies when compared to the control systems as there was also an immediate uptake of phosphate by the plant roots with time the c prolifer system developed higher root biomass when compared to the p australis systems subsequently a higher surface area was available for increased phosphate uptake a similar relationship between root biomass and phosphate removal efficiency was obtained by saz and co workers 1 the w thyrsiflora systems achieved lower removal efficiencies than the control systems as there was no uptake of phosphate initially because the roots died when new roots emerged around the 13th treatment day there was a sharp decrease in orthophosphate concentration however due to the low density of the new roots these systems achieved the lowest removal efficiency when compared to the other wetland plant systems the increase in orthophosphate concentration in the w thyrsiflora system after the 21st day of operation was likely due to the release of orthophosphate from phosphate bound organic compound it is expected that w thyrsiflora would perform better than the control systems when operated for longer periods after the 28th day of operation the orthophosphate removal efficiencies for the control c prolifer w thyrsiflora and p australis were 72 6 99 0 3 58 6 3 and 81 4 respectively fig 5 c the c prolifer and p australis systems performed better than the control systems whilst the w thyrsiflora systems achieved lower removal efficiencies the c prolifer systems outperformed the other systems because it was able to grow more root biomass that resulted in a higher absorption rate and microbial density 3 3 4 chemical oxygen demand removal the organic matter was measured in terms of the chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations the trends in cod concentrations for the different systems are shown in figs 4d and 5 d all the plant systems had a slightly better organic removal efficiency than the control systems by the end of the experiments the differences in cod removal efficiency for c prolifer w thyrsiflora and p australis were 6 3 3 3 and 3 2 respectively the presence of wetland plants therefore has a positive effect on organic removal this has also been widely reported in literature 4 6 however the differences in cod removal efficiencies between the control systems and the plant systems in this study were very small 7 to infer significant relationships with respect to the role of wetland plants in cw mfc systems higher organic loading and longer operating times are required 4 5 and should therefore be investigated further the highest organic breakdown rate obr occurred in the first seven days of operation the high proportion of volatile fatty acid vfa in the settled sewage was readily broken down by the bacteria this was a major limitation for this experiment when the wetland plants eventually acclimatised to their environment the amount of biodegradable matter was low liu and co workers 23 showed that the wetland plants are more efficient when the cod concentrations were higher after the first week of treatment the obr varied for the different plant systems c prolifer and p australis had a higher obr than the control systems this is probably because these systems were rapidly colonised by bacteria as their roots secreted exudates on the other hand the w thyrsiflora systems initially achieved lower obrs than the control systems the existing roots of w thyrsiflora did not survive and thus did not secrete oxygen or exudates before the 13th treatment day furthermore the dead roots were taking up space in the systems and limited the spatial distribution of bacteria after the 15th day of treatment the obr decreased slightly for the c prolifer and p australis systems as the amount of biodegradable organic decreased the c prolifer systems likely achieved higher degradation rates than the p australis systems due to higher microbial densities after the 13th treatment day the w thyrsiflora systems obr increased due to the emergence of new root biomass after the 28th treatment day c prolifer w thyrsiflora and p australis achieved a cod removal efficiency of 98 1 93 1 and 93 1 respectively using a batch system with ipomoea aquatica zhao and co workers 24 obtained a maximum removal efficiency of 75 the lower removal efficiency for their system could be due to a shorter operating time of 11 days the maximum cod removal efficiency was achieved by c prolifer theoretically the larger root surface area of c prolifer provided a more extensive area for bacteria growth consequently the quantity of organic matter broken down in the c prolifer systems within the duration of the experiment was higher than the two other wetland plants w thyrsiflora achieved a cod removal efficiency relatively close to the two other wetland plants even though its existing roots died initially it is thus expected that w thyrsiflora can achieve a higher cod removal if the growth conditions are adequate for its quick adaptation however the composition of wastewaters varies significantly and therefore the growth conditions would also vary therefore using w thyrsiflora plants in a constructed wetland would be challenging as constant monitoring would be required to ensure that the growth conditions are adequate hence in terms of cod removal c prolifer is the most adequate among the three wetland plants considered 4 other consideration and implications of this research this research had two major limitations the use of settled sewage in a fed batch system meant that the organic matter decreased quickly with time thus when the plants were eventually acclimatised the low cod concentration limited power production to determine the long term effect of the plants a different feed higher cod concentration or continuous operation should be investigated this study only investigated three indigenous south african plants due to limited time space and budget future research with different plants should be investigated so that a large database is available for plant selection when designing cw mfcs this study also gives ideal characteristics of wetland plants which should be considered for cw mfc systems 5 conclusions this study provides an exploratory investigation into which south african plant species are best for cw mfc systems in terms of bio electricity production and contaminant removal bio electricity production was assessed in terms of maximum power density and voltage variation it was determined that a high specific root area and biomass were advantageous to power production it was also found that a rapid acclimatisation to the wastewater was an important factor for generating a stable voltage hence a wetland plant that can adapt quickly to wastewater and develop a high root biomass and specific area is most beneficial to a cw mfc in terms of bioelectricity production the ammonia removal efficiencies varied for the different plants investigated the removal of ammonia was mainly via nitrification and adsorption in this regard high root biomass and surface area were also advantageous as they promoted higher oxygen release and nitrification the removal of nitrate was likely due to the biological denitrification process in this regard high root biomass was not advantageous phosphorus was removed by microorganisms and wetland plant absorption high root biomass and specific surface area significantly improved phosphorus removal the c prolifer systems were the most adequate wetland plant in terms of bio electricity organic matter ammonia and phosphate removal when compared to the other systems investigated hence in the design of a cw mfc it would be advisable to use c prolifer
