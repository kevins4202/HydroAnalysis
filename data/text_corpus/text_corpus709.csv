3545,groundwater use can reduce streamflow by reducing groundwater flows into streams and or increasing losses from the stream into the aquifer streamflow depletion streamflow depletion can impact aquatic ecosystems through changes in the availability and temperature of surface water regions with a combination of groundwater withdrawals and groundwater dependent resources therefore require management strategies that respond to the needs of both humans and aquatic ecosystems here we review and evaluate opportunities and challenges for applying an environmental flows approach to streamflow depletion management based on functional flows and the ecological limits of hydrological alteration eloha frameworks we highlight the need for explicit recognition of temperature in streamflow depletion science especially given the realities of climate change using a demonstrative analysis on wisconsin streams we show that both the magnitude and variability of streamflow and stream temperatures are likely to be impacted by groundwater withdrawal with particular impacts on low flows during the baseflow period then we evaluate potential challenges to integrating existing groundwater withdrawal management and environmental flows approaches and provide a pathway to address inherent tensions between these two frameworks in particular we find that uncertainty associated with the first two eloha steps setting a baseline and classifying streams can lead to substantially different estimates of ecological impacts in streamflow depletion contexts navigating these tensions requires stakeholder engagement throughout the process of setting acceptable management thresholds to move towards practical management focused integration of environmental flows and streamflow depletion science keywords streamflow depletion environmental flows groundwater management stream temperature groundwater surface water interaction 1 introduction groundwater withdrawals have increased substantially since the mid 20th century worldwide with accelerated growth since 1990 wada et al 2014 increasing groundwater withdrawals can be detrimental both to human users when over use leads to groundwater depletion wada et al 2014 and rivers and streams that rely on discharge from groundwater sources e g perkin et al 2017 streamflow depletion occurs when groundwater withdrawals capture water that would otherwise discharge to a stream or when altered groundwater flow pathways enhance or induce infiltration from the stream into the streambed barlow and leake 2012 most pumped groundwater is captured from streamflow as streamflow depletion konikow and leake 2014 gleeson and richter 2018 and therefore represents a pervasive challenge even in settings where groundwater levels are relative stable see barlow and leake 2012 for a detailed introduction to streamflow depletion streamflow depletion is already a significant global problem de graaf et al 2019 found that streamflow in 15 20 of watersheds with groundwater withdrawals has already dropped below the flow needs of aquatic ecosystems environmental flows and up to 80 of watersheds will fail to maintain environmental flows by 2050 under a business as usual development and climate change scenario the impacts of streamflow depletion extend beyond ecosystem collapse perkin et al 2017 to impact surface water availability for human users as well given these challenges effective integrated management of interconnected surface water and groundwater resources is essential for maintaining water availability for human and ecosystem needs moving into the future due to potentially long time lags between groundwater withdrawals and measurable impacts including both streamflow depletion and water quality changes currell 2016 currell et al 2012 especially when wells are further from streams or buffered from streams by low transmissivity aquifer materials barlow and leake 2012 and the challenges in removing water rights once they have been allocated groundwater management is a long term process that requires a multi generational perspective gleeson et al 2012 however managing surface water groundwater interactions is particularly challenging because it is difficult to attribute changes in streamflow to specific stressors without detailed modeling or analysis beyond pumping changes in streamflow can also be driven by climate variability changes in groundwater levels climate change land use change and other human actions with impacts that vary regionally and locally carlisle et al 2019 cuthbert et al 2019 craig et al 2017 if these uncertainties are built into a modeling framework scientists and water managers can still robustly make predictions of potential future streamflow depletion impacts and develop appropriate management plans doherty and moore 2020 however more commonly complex uncertainties result in groundwater management goals that often lack explicit quantifiable connections to the ecological communities they are meant to protect saito et al 2021 environmental flows poff and zimmerman 2010 are one approach to setting science informed water management goals by quantifying the hydrological regime necessary to support aquatic ecosystems recognizing that in stream habitat requires more than a simple minimum level of flow e g poff et al 1997 bunn and arthington 2002 environmental flows incorporate a more comprehensive view of the magnitude timing variability and quality of streamflow poff and zimmerman 2010 given that groundwater level based management methods like drawdown triggers often fail to capture ecologically relevant changes in streamflow currell 2016 it is important to invest in improving and adapting environmental flows approaches there are many approaches to estimate environmental flows for example the functional flows framework yarnell et al 2020 relates qualitative aspects of a hydrograph that have important effects on ecological communities i e functional flow components to a quantifiable set of ecologically important flow characteristics that can be used for management once quantitative flow characteristics are set the ecological limits of hydrological alteration eloha framework poff and zimmerman 2010 provides a process for decision making on ecohydrological resources the eloha framework consists of four main technical steps 1 build a hydrological foundation for analysis 2 classify streams 3 quantify hydrological alteration and 4 relate hydrological alteration to ecological impacts poff and zimmerman 2010 though the eloha framework has been applied with success e g kendy et al 2012 integrating streamflow depletion remains a stubborn challenge and few existing groundwater management plans include quantifiable streamflow depletion targets or thresholds e g jurisdictions in the european union india and most jurisdictions in the us lack quantifiable targets gage and milman 2021 gleeson and richter 2018 kallis and butler 2001 srinivasan and kulkarni 2014 harsha 2016 in this review we focus on the specific management challenge of designing a decision process for permitting groundwater withdrawals in a manner that adequately accounts for potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems and respects environmental flows to provide a scientific foundation for addressing this challenge this synthesis paper focuses on the following objectives 1 discuss how existing environmental flows approaches such as using functional flows in the eloha approach can provide an ecological framework for streamflow depletion management section 2 2 review and identify challenges in integrating environmental flows into groundwater management section 3 this review is targeted primarily towards the groundwater and ecohydrological research communities while we primarily focus on management examples in the united states of america the social and technical challenges highlighted in this review are relevant for streamflow depletion management globally the intent of this review is to provide a pathway for overcoming existing scientific limitations at the streamflow depletion ecology nexus to guide future development of decision support systems for streamflow depletion management that explicitly account for potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems in particular we emphasize a need for more research on detecting and predicting hydrological changes from groundwater withdrawal beyond flow reduction i e changes in temperature variability and timing and the associated ecological impacts on ecosystems including impacts on macroinvertebrates and fish such research is essential for providing reliable guidance on management thresholds 2 ecological impacts of streamflow depletion it is well recognized that groundwater withdrawal can result in streamflow depletion e g barlow and leake 2012 demonstrated by the strong focus on the impacts of pumping on flow magnitudes in both management e g hamilton and seelbach 2011 diebel et al 2015 and scientific contexts e g zipper et al 2019 wen and chen 2006 burt et al 2002 however the choice of the specific hydrological targets used for management can have a large impact on allowable pumping limits granato and barlow 2005 in this section we use a functional flows framework yarnell et al 2020 and introduce a complementary functional temperature framework to identify ecologically important aspects of a stream hydrograph functional flow components and thermograph functional temperature components using the upper midwest as an example section 2 1 we then identify which functional components are likely to be impacted by groundwater withdrawal section 2 2 finally we link these functional flows and temperatures components to water management using the eloha framework section 2 3 2 1 a functional flows and temperatures framework for the upper midwest growing awareness of the importance of the entire streamflow regime beyond just mean streamflow to aquatic ecosystems and communities e g poff and zimmerman 2010 nuhfer et al 2017 has led to efforts to quantitatively classify the flow regime in both the scientific e g yarnell et al 2020 and management e g susquehanna river basin dephilip and moberg 2010 communities the functional flows framework starts with a qualitative description of ecologically relevant aspects of the flow regime such as baseflow recession peak flow or fall pulse called functional components yarnell et al 2020 each component can then be broken down into flow characteristics magnitude timing duration frequency rate of change each of which is measured using a hydrological signature which is a metric derived from the hydrograph that quantify different aspects of hydrological behavior mcmillan 2020 the outcome of the functional flows framework is a set of hydrological signatures that describe the ecologically relevant aspects of the flow regime while functional flows focus on the streamflow hydrograph water temperature is also essential to high quality habitat olden and naiman 2010 here we adapt the functional flows framework to the streamflow thermograph to demonstrate functional temperatures as a potential tool to understand the ecological impacts of pumping induced water temperature changes relative to the natural thermal regime a description of a thermograph under reference conditions arismendi et al 2013 for each component the characteristics we use in this study are magnitude timing duration frequency rate of change and variability poff et al 1997 magnitude refers to the value of flow temperature timing duration and frequency describe when certain flow temperature magnitudes occur how long they last and how often they occur throughout a year or season respectively it is common to use only rate of change or variability as a functional characteristic e g poff and zimmerman 2010 but we argue that these are distinct characteristics with diverse potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems therefore we separately define variability as the overall range of flow or temperature and the coefficient of variation for different time periods e g arismendi et al 2013 xu et al 2010 whereas the rate of change describes the overall change per unit time over a given time period i e rate of decrease in flow or temperature over the recession period e g nicola et al 2009 cattanéo et al 2002 yarnell et al 2020 demonstrate functional flows for a mixed rain snowmelt system common in california in fig 1 we adapt this approach to demonstrate how functional flows and functional temperatures may appear for a snowmelt and groundwater dominated system eau galle river wi location marked in fig 1a that is representative of many streams in mid to high latitudes around the world the particularities of the hydrograph shape may vary substantially among regions but this shape is common among all 34 streamflow stations in wisconsin examined in this study for plots of all annual hydrograph shapes see the data supplement lapides et al 2021 the annual shape of the hydrograph in the top left shows a baseflow period throughout most of the year with a pronounced spring freshet and summer recession peak flows occur throughout the year following snowmelt or rain events while extreme low flows occur during the baseflow period at the end of summer and beginning of fall because climate in the midwest differs substantially from that of california we performed a literature review on the seasonal importance of streamflow for aquatic organisms in this region i e autumn winter spring and summer which roughly correspond to the hydroperiods in fig 1 where possible ecological literature from the u s upper midwest was used in this review but literature from other mid to high latitude studies with similar hydrograph functions were used to expand the scope of information where studies were not available in the upper midwest at the bottom left of fig 1 we identify functional characteristics associated with each functional flow component with an x based on our literature review and analogy to yarnell et al 2020 see appendix a for a detailed summary of the regional functional flows review we also performed a literature review on the importance of stream temperature during autumn winter spring and summer for aquatic organisms in the upper midwest olden and naiman 2010 describe a natural thermal regime based on factors important for stream organisms which they use to explore the impact of dams on thermal stream characteristics and poff 2018 extend the concept to consider a flexible thermal regime that supports aquatic ecosystems here we build on this in our development of a functional temperatures description of upper midwest streams in the right half of fig 1 we use temperature data from the usgs united states geologic survey 2021 to illustrate functional temperature components for the eau galle river in wisconsin stream temperature tracks seasonal temperature changes so that streams are typically around freezing during the winter months and 20 25 c warmer during the summer each functional temperature component identified as important for stream communities in the upper midwest is marked with an x in fig 1 see appendix b for a detailed summary of the regional functional temperatures review 2 2 hydrological signatures sensitive to groundwater withdrawal the functional flows temperatures approach outlines all of the aspects of the hydrograph thermograph that are important for aquatic ecosystems but not all of the functional characteristics or components may be equally impacted by streamflow depletion since it can be difficult to obtain all of the prerequisite data to calculate an entire suite of signatures we seek to identify a smaller set of signatures that capture the ecologically relevant aspects of stream conditions that are most sensitive to groundwater withdrawal to identify which flow components are sensitive to groundwater withdrawal we selected a set of hydrological signatures that summarize the findings of the literature review see tables a 1 and b 2 and applied these signatures to hydrographs from 34 wisconsin streams with long term usgs streamflow records united states geologic survey 2021 and mean annual streamflow below 1 13 m3 s 40 ft3 s limiting this analysis to smaller streams reduces the importance of precipitation driven events in the hydrographs allowing the results to apply more specifically to groundwater dominated stream systems we simulated altered hydrographs by assuming one well for each stream at a distance of 1 000 m using the glover and balmer analytical solution glover and balmer 1954 implemented in streamdepletr zipper 2020 for simplicity the aquifer properties are held constant across all sites with hydraulic conductivity of k 10 m d aquifer thickness of b 100 m and specific yield of s y 0 2 which is typical for an unconfined unconsolidated sedimentary aquifer freeze and cherry 1979 since pumping is often seasonal i e for irrigation the well is pumped from june 1 to september 1 at a rate of 1 25 times the median baseflow implemented via the analytical superposition technique of jenkins 1968 since it is important to examine the impacts of groundwater pumping on streamflow over multiple years bradbury et al 2017 pumping was simulated throughout the duration of each stream gauge record associated thermographs for the original and altered hydrographs were calculated using a simple groundwater surface water end member mixing model groundwater is assumed to have a constant temperature year round of 9 9 c which is the median of mean annual temperatures from all wisconsin streams with temperature data surface flow temperatures were simulated using air temperature in madison wi nationalcenters 2021 temperatures were calculated daily so subdaily signatures are not calculated in this study although temperature changes at sub daily temporal resolution could be impacted by groundwater withdrawal and have ecological importance we adopted this simplified approach as an illustrative exploration of the flow and temperature components most sensitive to streamflow depletion rather than a detailed site specific characterization of actual impacts which is beyond the scope of this review paper but an important future research direction as an example this analysis is shown for the eau galle river wi in fig 2 this site was chosen because it has particularly well defined hydrograph seasonality fig 2a shows the original hydrograph blue and the calculated altered hydrograph red with selected change statistics for the eau galle river across all studied sites streamflow depletion leads to a substantial decrease in baseflow that extends beyond the summer pumping season with decreases up to 38 of median unimpacted baseflows and an increase in variability as shown by the cv statistics while less pronounced than during the baseflow period flows are reduced by streamflow depletion during freshet and recession periods flows at all times of year exhibit a greater variability when considering streamflow depletion impacts larger interquartile range and since baseflows are lower there is a more rapid recession following the freshet we found that the strongest impacts from groundwater withdrawal on wisconsin streams are on the magnitude characteristics frequency of extreme flows and flow variability fig 2b these results are largely unsurprising since the most apparent and recognized impact from groundwater withdrawal on a hydrograph is to reduce streamflow magnitude barlow and leake 2012 by reducing magnitude variability as measured by coefficient of variation the ratio between standard deviation and mean during different components of the hydrograph also increases since the range of flows does not change significantly but the mean drops the frequency of peak flows and low flows can be impacted by a decrease in magnitude since the number of flows throughout the year that exceed a given high flow decreases when all flow magnitudes decrease this can even be the case for an n yr return interval flow the same is true for low flows where flow more frequently drops below a low flow threshold when overall hydrograph magnitude drops due to streamflow depletion we hypothesize that the duration of the longest low flow period could be longer and the timing change for the same reason all the streamflow characteristics with observed impacts from groundwater withdrawal in our simple analysis are impacted primarily by a decrease in flow magnitude lacking data necessary to define the ecological response to each of these flow characteristics we used a threshold of 10 for demonstrative purposes as this large of a change could have impacts on ecological function since this analysis is limited by design we also mark with a grey dashed box the characteristics that we expect could be impacted by groundwater withdrawal although we did not observe large impacts in our simple analysis however different or more complex groundwater withdrawal schedules or different aquifer properties could result in more important transient effects on hydrographs resulting in potentially earlier onset of the baseflow season baseflow timing which could impact the timing and duration of low flows as well the strong impact of streamflow depletion on low flows is particularly problematic because pumping requirements i e irrigation are likely to be greatest during dry periods when low flows are naturally already at their lowest fig 3 a shows the estimated unimpacted teal and altered brown thermographs for the eau galle river wi decreased groundwater contributions caused by streamflow depletion led to warmer summer temperatures up to 3 9 c increase in mean daily across all sites in the summer and slightly colder temperatures in the winter up to 1 8 c in mean daily across all sites than the unimpacted thermograph fig 3b summarizes temperature impacts across all 34 wisconsin streams for temperature magnitude signatures a 2 c change is used as a threshold for impacts rather than a 10 change to better reflect the influence of temperature on fish bioenergetics hartman and cox 2008 hayes et al 2000 the largest impacts from pumping on the thermograph are on winter and summer temperatures decreases in flow magnitude increase the annual temperature range leading to hotter summer temperatures and colder winter temperatures ultimately stream temperatures are more responsive to air temperature as groundwater inputs to the stream decrease resulting in more temperature variability faster rates of change in temperature and more extreme temperatures for these reasons we also expect that peak temperatures and low temperatures could be more impacted by flow reduction including the duration of heat during the summer we tended to observe the lowest thermal impacts during the summer and fall when air temperature is closest to the groundwater temperature and therefore the relative contributions of groundwater and surface water do not have a substantial thermal impact though these two water sources may still have ecologically important chemical distinctions as with the functional flows analysis this was meant to be an illustrative exploration of potential temperature sensitivity to streamflow depletion as part of this review paper rather than a detailed site specific characterization so there are several potential limitations to the thermal analysis in reality surface water temperature is likely to be lower than air temperature and groundwater has a muted seasonal temperature signal so the real difference in temperature between surface water and groundwater is likely to be smaller than we estimated using our end member mixing model this model also assumes a nearby direct contribution of groundwater to streamflow by giving the baseflow the temperature profile of groundwater a reasonable assumption in gaining streams but not for losing streams losing streams will likely be more responsive to air temperature variation with a relatively small influence of groundwater temperature since water flows from the stream into the groundwater system barlow and leake 2012 and areas where streamflow depletion has caused streams to shift from gaining to losing may exhibit threshold type changes in the temperature regime rather than the linear mixing based changes estimated here it is difficult to identify over broad areas which streams are gaining or losing jasechko et al 2021 but these assumptions indicate that our analysis should be considered a baseline understanding and could be used to prioritize future research on affected aspects of the thermograph a full description of the methods used for the analyses in this section can be found in c the full set of hydrological signatures can be found in a and the full set of temperature signatures can be found in b 2 3 using eloha to relate hydrological signatures to ecological impacts the previous section illustrates how the functional flows framework can be used to identify a set of temperature and hydrological signatures that describe attributes of ecological importance that are sensitive to groundwater withdrawal the ecological limits of hydrological alteration eloha framework poff and zimmerman 2010 describes one method for designing a management procedure to respect environmental flow needs as described by these signatures the eloha framework assumes that as flow becomes more altered from a reference condition impacts on ecosystems increase the eloha framework follows four general steps 1 setting a hydrological reference condition from which alteration can be assessed 2 classifying streams to generalize results and plan monitoring strategies 3 quantifying hydrological alteration and 4 developing flow function curves that relate hydrological alteration to ecological impacts based on these steps a management threshold can be set using the flow function curves as a guide in practice flow function curves can be developed for individual species or whole communities e g zorn et al 2012 armstrong et al 2011 diebel et al 2015 wilding and poff 2008 these curves are developed by monitoring species presence population size and or community composition and relating change in these ecological indicators to different hydrological signatures for example both wisconsin diebel et al 2015 and michigan zorn et al 2012 use standardized long term monitoring data from stream surveys to generate flow function relationships between wisconsin fish presence and michigan fish abundance data and flow temperature signatures for statewide environmental flows protection in ohio kendy et al 2012 related mean daily flow in september to sensitive fish species using quantile regression on data from an existing habitat flow model to address statewide water planning in colorado kendy et al 2012 developed flow function curves for fish riparian vegetation invertebrates and whitewater kayak raft conditions using regression or categorical relationships from literature with expert input and in rhode island kendy et al 2012 took advantage of literature from georgia on flow fish and flow invertebrate relationships to examine impacts from changes in 7q10 the lowest 7 day flow that has a probability of occurring once every 10 years one particularly difficult aspect of using flow function curves is identifying an appropriate threshold of hydrological change which corresponds to unacceptable ecological impacts thresholds can be species specific or a composite threshold for impacts on all species of interest in a stream and they depend on the choice of hydrological signature while it is sometimes visually apparent where ecological condition starts to deteriorate purely ecological thresholds can be rare hillebrand et al 2020 and a choice of threshold typically constitutes a compromise between needs of stakeholders and ecosystems to identify thresholds and flow standards that are acceptable to all parties see d for examples of decision processes throughout the remainder of this review we will use the functional flows and eloha frameworks as a starting point to consider opportunities to build on current research and practice to develop more effective management protocols to manage groundwater withdrawals for ecological health but many of the opportunities and tensions we discuss are broadly generalizable across different environmental flows assessment approaches 3 challenges to integrating environmental flows into groundwater withdrawal permitting the environmental flows framework from the previous section provides a way to evaluate how well existing approaches to groundwater withdrawal management support the needs of aquatic ecosystems we identified a suite of signatures or types of signatures that are sensitive to groundwater withdrawal many of which are already embedded in management of groundwater withdrawals for instance in wisconsin diebel et al 2015 ohio kendy et al 2012 and michigan zorn et al 2012 statewide management focuses on the mean median flow for the low flow month in each state to capture more of the holistic hydrograph shape colorado sanderson et al 2012 maine weinberg 2013 massachusetts weinberg 2013 and the susquehanna river basin dephilip and moberg 2010 evaluate hydrological signatures on a monthly or seasonal basis including mean median flows in all cases and high low flows for the susquehanna river basin flow variability is also evaluated in the colorado sanderson et al 2012 and susquehanna river basin dephilip and moberg 2010 in contrast to streamflow data temperature data are less commonly available which may possibly explain why temperature is often not included in management processes notable exceptions are the wisconsin diebel et al 2015 and michigan zorn et al 2012 statewide processes which only focus on mean water temperature during the hottest low flow month july even by focusing on a small number of signatures it may be possible to capture most of the major impacts from groundwater withdrawal though since hydrograph impacts are primarily attributed to decreasing flow levels and thermograph impacts are primarily attributable to changes to winter and summer temperatures see section 2 adherence to environmental flows paradigms moves beyond selecting appropriate signatures uncertainty is a general problem in groundwater management and minimizing uncertainty may be the largest technical challenge in effective management of streamflow depletion doherty and moore 2020 as described above the eloha framework has four main technical steps 1 setting a reference condition 2 stream classification 3 quantifying alteration and 4 relating alteration to ecological impacts uncertainty from each step propagates through to the final management decision thus it is important to both quantify and minimize the uncertainty in the outcome of each step thinking of each step as a separate model that needs to be optimized for the specific outcomes required by the next step to manage for environmental flows it is important that the reference conditions section 3 1 stream classification section 3 2 and quantifying alteration from streamflow depletion sections 3 3 and 3 4 used for calculating the signatures are accurately calculated 3 1 setting a reference condition to detect alteration in the eloha framework hydrological signatures are compared under reference and altered conditions a hydrological reference is meant to characterize undisturbed stream conditions poff and zimmerman 2010 and therefore is best represented as the historical pre disturbance conditions in practice this is not done at large scales because few streams have adequate historical data to characterize a pre disturbance state instead hydrological reference conditions are commonly set using present day conditions e g driest month flows in wisconsin ohio and michigan statewide processes diebel et al 2014 kendy et al 2012 zorn et al 2012 reference streams e g the susquehanna river basin massachusetts statewide process dephilip and moberg 2010 archfield and vogel 2008 or by removing modeled impacts on current flows e g rhode island streamflow depletion methodology colorado statewide assessment richardson 2005 sanderson et al 2012 statistical approaches can then be used to extend streamflow reference estimates from gauged to ungauged sites e g wisconsin ohio michigan susquehanna river basin massachusetts rhode island colorado california diebel et al 2014 kendy and bredehoeft 2006 zorn et al 2012 dephilip and moberg 2010 archfield and vogel 2008 richardson 2005 sanderson et al 2012 zimmerman et al 2018 to decrease uncertainty in calculating the reference condition many agencies only calculate specific signatures like the mean flow during the driest month michigan wisonsin ohio diebel et al 2015 kendy et al 2012 or 7q10 rhode island richardson 2005 while practical due to data limitations focusing on the mean flow during part of the year necessarily excludes many potentially important functional flow and functional temperature components section 2 the underlying intention of setting the reference condition is to characterize ideal conditions for the stream ecosystem and it is typically assumed that an undisturbed natural condition is the appropriate reference condition e g archfield and vogel 2008 richardson 2005 sanderson et al 2012 dephilip and moberg 2010 however the meaning of undisturbed is complicated given a long history of land management wagner et al 2000 that often predates existing records regardless of how the undisturbed condition is defined stream ecosystems that have adapted to a modified flow regime and or contain introduced species may be better conserved using a well chosen reference representing disturbed conditions for example brown trout are a socially and politically important species in the central sands region of wisconsin but they are also an introduced species in this case a return to a historical or undisturbed reference condition may actually be detrimental to the current ecosystem although we are not aware of any significant documented examples of this phenomenon related to groundwater withdrawal however regardless of what conditions the current community is adapted to the true reference condition for aquatic ecosystems may not be captured in available datasets pauly 1995 thus it may be preferable or simply the only feasible option to use a disturbed state for the reference based on the conditions in which species of interest have been observed at a socially acceptable level rather than an undisturbed or historical state ultimately choosing a hydrological reference condition is a social decision about which aspects of an ecosystem are valuable and the choice of reference has a significant impact on management outcomes to demonstrate this impact we consider an example stream in fig 4 with a pre development flow of 0 8 m3 s and a current flow of 0 7 m3 s caused by 0 1 m3 s of depletion from existing wells there has been request for groundwater extraction well x nearby that will result in streamflow depletion of an additional 0 01 m3 s we explore three different scenarios for setting a reference condition 1 the reference is set at an undisturbed reference condition when no wells impact the stream 0 8 m3 s 2 the reference is set under the incorrect assumption that no existing wells impact the stream yet 0 7 m3 s and 3 the reference is set under the incorrect assumption that the full impacts of all existing wells have already impacted the stream from the undisturbed reference of 0 8 m3 s the depletion includes the estimated depletion from all wells 0 15 m3 s 19 for the disturbed reference if it is assumed that none of the existing wells are impacting the stream then the reference is set at 0 7 m3 s and the estimated cumulative future depletion of 0 15 m3 s is 21 change relative to the reference finally if all existing wells are assumed to impact the stream at the reference condition then only the proposed well x contributes to the depletion calculation 0 01 m3 s 1 depending on the reference condition the estimated cumulative streamflow depletion ranges from 1 to 21 if allowable depletion levels are less than 21 then this uncertainty range includes the allowable depletion range and assumptions about the reference directly impact whether well x will be permitted or approved by a regulatory agency in this example very little streamflow depletion is likely to result from approving well x when considered alone this well is unlikely to harm the stream and would be likely to be approved by a groundwater manager however the cumulative impacts of all of the existing wells on the stream are more substantial this leads directly to a social issue in groundwater permitting should well x be denied due to groundwater pumping by other water users with wells a e if yes then it is very difficult for newer property owners to access groundwater rights even when their needs are modest if not then groundwater managers will need to find other creative ways of maintaining streamflow for instance by reducing existing groundwater rights or other programs that encourage compromises in water use among water users in a water use district as many regions reach their ecological limits for groundwater withdrawals managers will be faced with overcoming this type of social dilemma beyond the decision about which impacts to include in a reference condition the metric used to define the reference condition can have a large impact on streamflow depletion calculated in fig 5 we explore how using the august mean or median streamflow could impact streamflow depletion calculations plum creek fig 5a has a very variable hydrograph whereas pleasant valley creek fig 5b is very stable as a result the august mean and median streamflow at pleasant valley are nearly the same but the august median is significantly less than the mean at plum creek for both streams we assume that groundwater pumping has resulted in a streamflow reduction equal to 10 of the mean flow since the mean and median are nearly the same at pleasant valley creek this level of depletion is measured as an 11 depletion from the august median streamflow however this 10 depletion from the mean is measured as a 35 depletion from the median in plum creek both of these case study examples also demonstrate that a large amount of uncertainty is embedded in the decisions made about reference conditions and existing disturbance in setting a reference condition uncertainty can come from two different sources the best time period or type of reference may be uncertain fig 4 but there also may be uncertainty in the calculated streamflow reference for each scenario uncertainty can be more important in some scenarios than others if streamflow depletion is small then uncertainty in the reference condition may be greater than the expected level of depletion making it impossible to estimate hydrological alteration caused by groundwater pumping comparing across the three scenarios in fig 4 if there is a 0 1 m3 s uncertainty in the reference condition then there is no quantifiable difference between the three reference conditions this issue may be particularly acute in small headwater streams that tend to have limited monitoring nadeau and rains 2007 which increases uncertainty and low flows which means that small magnitudes of uncertainty can be a large percentage of flow headwater streams are both highly vulnerable to streamflow depletion and important ecological habitat bishop et al 2008 van meerveld et al 2020 so enhanced monitoring and improved modeling of headwater systems is essential for streamflow depletion management 3 2 stream classification in stream classification uncertainty can arise from how class boundaries are defined in practice stream classifications have distinct boundaries but for streams on the borderline between classes the limits chosen for the classification scheme can have a large impact on how the stream is managed to our knowledge no sensitivity analyses have been performed to identify the impact of classification boundaries on resulting management decisions fig 6 shows a demonstrative example with only two classes in this example streams a and d are clearly members of classes 1 and 2 respectively but streams b and c are both borderline and falling within the grey uncertainty area separating the two classes uncertainty in classification can be caused by either uncertainty in the precise location of the boundaries between classes i e stream b and or uncertainty in the stream s position in parameter space i e stream c a further consideration is that streamflow depletion may cause a stream to move within classification space if pumping affects the hydrological signatures used for classification the arrows in fig 6 indicate possible trajectories for streams with increased groundwater withdrawal these arrows show how streams can change classification over time as emphasized by rypel et al 2019 for lakes in wisconsin if the class boundary corresponds to an ecologically relevant threshold for example a threshold on a flow function curve section 3 then maintaining class membership could be essential for ecological health in that case stream c would require more strict management than stream d to maintain class membership in class 2 however this also brings up concerns about why stream c should be managed differently from stream d if they are in the same region of the classification space this type of thinking could motivate the inclusion of fuzzy classification and transitional classes along class boundaries as in rypel et al 2019 or zorn et al 2012 further exploration into the prevalence of borderline streams under different classification systems and the impacts on aggregate management actions would support thoughtful management 3 3 quantifying streamflow depletion quantifying streamflow depletion consists of two steps first establishing the conceptual model for the problem and second applying a quantitative method to calculate streamflow depletion one particularly difficult aspect of establishing a conceptual model for streamflow depletion is determining the appropriate geographical extent for analysis if the geographical extent is too small then local impacts on a stream may be exaggerated in importance since aquatic organisms are able to migrate throughout a stream channel to find suitable habitat conversely if the geographical extent is too large then it may be difficult to identify the importance or validity of local changes or even to account for spatially variable phenomena noorduijn et al 2019 these considerations in model set up are also tied closely to the inclusion of nearby wells and cumulative impacts in the model as discussed in section 3 1 with a small geographical extent cumulative impacts are more likely to be neglected since nearby wells fall outside of the model domain whereas the impact of a new well may be hard to tease out of a larger model with already substantial impacts to the stream from existing wells the correct geographical extent for each management scenario depends on the geological setting after identifying an appropriate conceptual model for the management scenario and defining the geographical extent streamflow depletion is calculated using a quantitative model streamflow depletion is the difference between actual streamflow and what streamflow would have been in the absence of groundwater withdrawal barlow et al 2018 as a result streamflow is impossible to directly measure because it requires comparing observed streamflow to a hypothetical scenario and is challenging to estimate because groundwater withdrawal impacts are masked by other causes of hydrological variability barlow and leake 2012 at the scale of an individual stream reach detailed field observations directly estimate streamflow depletion i e hunt et al 2001 sophocleous et al 1988 kollet and zlotnik 2003 flores et al 2020 weeks et al 1965 however estimating streamflow depletion from observational data alone is not practical at larger scales such as a watershed aquifer or region for these spatial scales streamflow depletion can be estimated using analytical numerical and or statistical methods zipper et al 2021 review and compare methods for calculating streamflow depletion huang et al 2018 reeves et al 2009 and hunt 2014 comprehensively review analytical methods griebling and neupauer 2013 describe standard numerical techniques here we briefly discuss performance and capabilities of different streamflow depletion estimation methods with specific emphasis on their use for groundwater withdrawal permitting analytical methods were the first approach used to estimate streamflow depletion e g glover and balmer 1954 theis 1941 hantush 1965 jenkins 1968 hunt 1999 they are the simplest methods available requiring relatively little input data and training to use and are the most common choice for decision support systems for groundwater withdrawal permitting e g wisconsin ohio massachusetts and michigan diebel et al 2014 kendy et al 2012 reeves et al 2009 analytical methods are powerful because of their modest data requirements and fast computation but they are limited by simplifying assumptions commonly including homogeneity of stream and aquifer properties in space and time huang et al 2018 analytical solutions also typically apply only to one well and one stream with cumulative impacts of wells assumed to be linearly additive reilly et al 1987 which is not a valid assumption when streams dry completely ahlfeld et al 2016 analytical depletion functions were recently developed to distribute the impacts of a well across multiple stream reaches with good agreement with process based numerical models zipper et al 2021 zipper et al 2019 reeves et al 2009 li et al 2020 zipper et al 2018 even though data requirements for analytical methods are modest data limitations are still common streambed hydraulic properties for instance can have a significant impact on estimated depletion neupauer et al 2020 lackey et al 2015 christensen 2000 but are rarely known at adequate spatiotemporal resolution numerical models such as modflow gsflow parflow and hydrogeosphere typically use process based governing equations to route water through a two or three dimensional representation of a landscape numerical models can explicitly represent stream aquifer exchange at the scale of each model grid cell and therefore provide fine spatial resolution estimates of streamflow depletion and other related ecohydrological processes and some numerical models can simulate water temperature and other water quality impacts in addition to flows of water however this spatial fidelity requires significantly more data time and expertise to build and calibrate numerical models are the most powerful tool we have for projecting changes in streams and identifying mechanisms and can be subjected to robust uncertainty assessments to bound depletion estimates with confidence intervals foster et al 2021 doherty and moore 2020 new tools are making it easier to develop and analyze numerical models e g modflow setup https github com aleaf modflow setup bakker et al 2016 fienen et al 2021 white et al 2021 and are well suited for detailed reviews where managers have site specific expertise and sufficient data and resources available to represent key model processes numerical models have been used extensively for evaluation of groundwater withdrawal zipper et al 2021 analytic element models have intermediate complexity between analytical solutions and numerical models strack 2003 they are typically two dimensional steady state simulations with a great deal of flexibility in terms of landscape heterogeneity and problem geometry haitjema 1995 while the two dimensional setup makes them less accurate than multi layer numerical models where vertical flow is important haitjema 1987 they can provide spatial resolution difficult to achieve with large numerical models and problem specificity that cannot be achieved with standard analytical solutions while recent research has helped develop analytic element models which can simulate transient conditions multi layer flow or both e g ttim timml anaqsim bakker 2013 bakker and strack 2003 fitts 2010 analytic element models are still not as widely used as other approaches such as finite difference or finite element models hunt 2006 they have been applied in wisconsin to model groundwater systems e g juckem and coalition 2009 juckem and dunning 2015 but the relative advantages of these different approaches in terms of quantitative performance have yet to be well defined statistical methods have also been used to infer and estimate streamflow depletion although they have seen less use than analytical or numerical approaches in streamflow depletion assessment zipper et al 2021 statistical assessments can be used to identify trends and relationships among data and may be best suited for settings where data essential to numerical methods such as subsurface and streambed data are unavailable while statistical approaches are typically informed by process understanding they unlike numerical and analytical approaches are not underpinned by physical laws to incorporate more physical knowledge emerging process guided machine learning approaches can use physical laws to penalize unreasonable model behavior e g read et al 2019 these approaches have not yet been tested for streamflow depletion assessment data driven methods have been shown to be more accurate than numerical models in some hydrological modeling scenarios gauch et al 2019 booker and woods 2014 and can be a powerful tool to tease out the importance of different landscape factors and land use in impacting low flows in streams hammond and fleming 2021 given the numerous options for estimating streamflow depletion the best tool for use in a management framework depends on the complexity of the problem the level of accuracy needed and the time constraints for getting results in many cases fast review turn around for groundwater withdrawal applications is essential for maintaining support from water users and is even legislated to short timeframes in some areas which would preclude the development of a site specific calibrated numerical model while some model intercomparisons have compared within and among different estimation methods flores et al 2020 sophocleous et al 1995 li et al 2020 knowling et al 2019 more thorough benchmarking and comparison among a wide suite of different methods using common input data is a critical research need to better understand the capabilities and limitations of simpler quantitative tools 3 4 quantifying temperature changes due to groundwater withdrawal stream temperature is a complex quantity dependent on climatic variables physical attributes shade from plants and wood hyporheic exchange water depth and water velocity and relative contributions of surface water and groundwater to streamflow stark et al 1994 since groundwater is buffered from air by soil and rock groundwater temperatures are typically cooler than surface water temperatures during the summer warmer than surface water temperatures during the winter and change much more slowly than surface water temperatures bonan 2015 thus groundwater inputs to streams serve to moderate extreme temperatures and smooth out variability as a simple example fig 7 shows how groundwater contributions to streamflow moderate streamflow temperatures and reduce variability effect becomes more pronounced as groundwater contribution increases from 0 groundwater red to 100 groundwater contribution blue a reduction in groundwater contribution for instance from 50 to 25 approximates the impact of streamflow depletion on a thermograph since streamflow depletion reduces groundwater inputs to streams while temperature is ecologically important literature assessing the impacts of groundwater withdrawal on temperature in nearby streams is limited streamflow depletion field experiments generally use surface water diversion to simulate streamflow depletion e g nuhfer et al 2017 sstelzer and pillsburytelzer and pillsbury 2020 do not report temperature data e g hunt et al 2001 1966 2002 1988 2004 or are not controlled enough to allow for evaluating the impacts of pumping on stream temperature kwon et al 2020 one exception is flores et al 2020 who examined the impact of pumping on stream temperature in a field study and identified an immediate stream temperature change of a few degrees when pumping started or stopped indicating the potential importance of this understudied aspect of streamflow depletion several studies have investigated potential temperature impacts of streamflow depletion risley et al 2010 evaluated the impacts of pumping on stream temperature in archetypal numerical models they found that while pumping generally increased stream temperature in the summer and reduced stream temperature in the winter the change was generally less than 0 5 c conversely stark et al 1994 found that pumping for irrigation could result in a 0 5 1 5 increase in summer streamflow temperatures and foglia et al 2013 found that a 50 increase in minimum summer flows could significantly reduce the proportion of the stream network where temperatures exceed 25 c andrews 2018 did a comparison among a suite of temperature models to identify which variables and processes were most important to include in order to capture observed thermal properties of streams they found that it was important to consider three thermal water pools groundwater surface water and overland flow a model that considers only water depth such as those used for assessment in michigan and wisconsin zorn et al 2012 diebel et al 2015 was not sufficient to capture observed behavior using the best fit models changes in stream temperature induced by pumping were generally less than 0 5 c these initial explorations of the impacts of groundwater withdrawal on stream temperature combined with our preliminary analysis of functional temperature components section 2 2 indicate that there may be a substantial thermal change induced by pumping in some cases there are numerous tools available that are capable of calculating stream temperatures andrews 2018 and some calibrated groundwater models with temperature already exist e g woolfenden et al 2011 chunn et al 2019 however some of these existing temperature models are not capable of accurately predicting pumping impacts on streamflow and field data to evaluate models for the thermal impacts of pumping are still very limited see above because a warming climate contributes directly to increases in stream temperatures ducharne et al 2007 and may combine with agricultural expansion to increase streamflow depletion through increasing human demand for water resources wada et al 2013 it is critical to consider the combined impacts of climatic warming land use change and streamflow depletion on stream temperatures deitchman and loheide 2012 enhanced research focus on the thermal impacts of groundwater withdrawal situated in the broader context of changing thermal regimes including diverse field studies and exploration of widely applicable model structures is necessary to disentangle diverse drivers of temperature change and further develop a functional temperatures approach to streamflow depletion management 3 5 connecting stream alteration to ecological impacts as emphasized in section 2 environmental flows management requires evaluating more than streamflow quantity many of the methods described above for temperature and streamflow modeling can be used to calculate multiple flow temperature characteristics to manage for future conditions though it is essential to incorporate future impacts on streamflow and temperature that derive from climate change or land use change as well craig et al 2017 understanding these feedbacks is essential for making decisions about acceptable thresholds of change described in section 2 for instance climate change land use change and groundwater withdrawal can all increase variability in stream conditions above variability ecosystems are adapted to greater variation in streamflow results in even greater variation in wetted channel extent in headwater streams with implications for seasonal stream habitat dynamics that aquatic ecosystems rely on lapides et al 2021 when variability becomes more extreme than the ecosystems are adapted for more variation can result in for example more extreme dry years when flows become low enough to cause catastrophic population declines in particular shifts in streamflow patterns from perennial to non perennial can have devastating impacts on aquatic ecosystems bogan and lytle 2011 a general shift to non perennial flow has become increasing common across much of the southern united states and europe zipper et al 2021 tramblay et al 2021 and has been linked in some regions to streamflow depletion perkin et al 2017 zimmer et al 2020 ecosystems can recover after dry years in certain situations due to density dependent recruitment but it is important to understand long term population dynamics to decide whether it is acceptable to plan for occasional community collapse wang et al 2003 wang et al 2001 zorn et al 2012 or whether community collapse is an unacceptable impact lack of information about ecosystem resilience to the impacts of groundwater withdrawal can complicate discussions around socially acceptable impacts as an example bradbury et al 2017 found that there were significant impacts to stream ecosystems in the little plover river wisconsin as a result of groundwater withdrawal however years of high precipitation in wisconsin resulted in replenished streamflow with rebounding fish communities by the time the results were published this drove water users to challenge the importance of ecological impacts because of visible ecosystem resilience part of quantifying the risks of streamflow depletion is a greater understanding of how ecosystems respond to and rebound from stressors over long timescales so that there is greater ability to identify types of stresses that will cause reversible vs irreversible damage to ecosystems 4 towards ecologically informed groundwater withdrawal decision making developing a well rounded description of environmental flow needs and the timing and magnitude of streamflow depletion is the foundation of a groundwater withdrawal decision making protocol designed to balance the needs of society and aquatic ecosystems incorporating aquatic ecosystem water needs into groundwater withdrawal permitting is challenging due to uncertainty in the quantification of streamflow depletion impacts environmental flow requirements and implementation challenges related to stakeholder buy in and limited resource availability the functional flows framework provides a structure with which to describe a holistic streamflow and stream temperature state a description that can guide use of an environmental flows management framework such as eloha which as we review here has been used for groundwater management in some form in several jurisdictions given the difficulties inherent to describing streams and ecoystems quantitatively at large scales it is important that uncertainty be incorporated into all technical steps of a management process from calculating reference conditions and classifying streams to quantifying alteration particular attention should be paid to how a reference condition is defined and calculated to ensure that it is appropriate for the management goals even with general agreement among the scientific community on the necessary technical steps for successful management of streamflow depletion substantial challenges remain in terms of functional implementation numerous studies have identified jurisdictional complexities to groundwater management e g molle and closas 2020 gage and milman 2021 structural barriers to improving monitoring and scientific programs saito et al 2021 and difficulties in balancing the needs of water users and ecosystems e g dnr water use section 2021 closas and molle 2018 molle and closas 2020 while a complete review of the sociopolitical challenges in managing streamflow depletion is beyond the scope of this study prior research identifies the importance of stakeholder buy in for groundwater permitting programs e g tsvetanov and earnhart 2020 deines et al 2019 drysdale and hendricks 2018 baldwin et al 2012 kendy et al 2012 considering the needs of all stakeholders including water users people who enjoy outdoor recreation in waterways indigenous peoples and ecosystems in groundwater management allows for the development of management protocols that work for everyone additionally streamflow depletion management needs to be placed in the larger context of impacts to streams taking into account future land use and climate changes that could amplify or cancel out impacts of streamflow depletion since ecosystems cannot show up to advocate for themselves the strategies discussed in this review can help to bring ecosystem needs to the table in a quantitative way as other jurisdictions move towards ecologically informed groundwater withdrawal decision making they can prioritize the successful approaches we review here most importantly stakeholder engagement throughout the process of identifying ecosystem needs and setting appropriate streamflow depletion thresholds many of the challenges raised in this review are more generally applicable to a larger range of streamflow management problems such as defining waters of the united states wotus department of the army et al 2020 as a basis for regulation to support these management needs the scientific community should prioritize research on user friendly methods to estimate pumping impacts and associated uncertainty on streamflow stream temperature and aquatic ecosystems to empower local managers and stakeholders to make informed decisions data availability code and data used for analyses in this study are available at https github com lapidesd eco stream

snowmelt and groundwater dominated system eau galle river wi in the left half of fig 1 that is representative of many streams typical of wisconsin and mid to high latitudes around the world the annual shape of the hydrograph in the top left shows a baseflow period throughout most of the year with a pronounced spring freshet and summer recession peak flows occur throughout the year while extreme low flows occur during the baseflow period at the end of summer and beginning of fall because climate regimes in the midwest differ substantially from those of california we performed a literature review on the seasonal importance of streamflow for aquatic organisms in this region i e autumn winter spring and summer which roughly correspond to the hydroperiods in fig 1 where possible ecological literature from the u s upper midwest was used in this review but literature from other mid to high latitude studies with similar hydrograph functions were used to expand the scope of information where studies were not available in the upper midwest see table a 1 for full set of references at the bottom left of fig 1 we identify functional characteristics associated with each functional flow component with an x based on our literature review and analogy to yarnell et al 2020 these results are summarized below streamflow is a master variable that shapes the ecological condition of flowing water ecosystems and thus the life history traits of aquatic biota power et al 1995 streamflow characteristics vary over a year and relate to different bioperiods of freshwater species autumn september november is a key bioperiod for brook and brown trout in the upper midwest as it coincides with adult spawning activity field studies have found a positive relationship between autumn streamflows and trout growth recruitment and survival for example xu et al 2010 found that high autumn streamflow increased brook trout growth in a massachusetts stream and numerous studies have found that low autumn flows or precipitation are associated with decreased population sizes in subsequent years kanno et al 2015 kanno et al 2016 bassar et al 2016 blum et al 2018 indeed declines in late summer and autumn base flows have been implicated in the degradation of both cold and warm water fish assemblages in southern wisconsin wang et al 2003 wang et al 2001 streamflow patterns during winter december february have historically been considered less consequential for animal population dynamics in temperate freshwater ecosystems however recent research has challenged this view high winter precipitation and streamflow events during the egg incubation and fry rearing period have been shown to be related to low age 0 fish abundances suggesting that winter high flows result in bed scouring that negatively impacts survival of eggs and newly hatched individuals blum et al 2018 kanno et al 2016 xu et al 2010 kanno et al 2015 kanno et al 2017 jensen and johnsen 1999 roghair et al 2002 this single year effect translates into decreasing occurrence probability for fall spawning trout with increasing winter high flows wenger et al 2011 streamflow during or just after trout emergence is a primary factor in determining recruitment and subsequent population dynamics across geographic regions in the upper midwest this time period corresponds with spring march may during spring the timing magnitude and duration of extreme flow conditions and the rate of change in discharge directly impact autumn spawning trout survival growth and recruitment xu et al 2010 blum et al 2018 kanno et al 2015 kanno et al 2017 spring streamflow can also show non linear relationships with trout population dynamics in spain brown trout recruitment increases with increasing spring streamflows until a high flow threshold beyond which recruitment declines lobón cerviá 2004 lobón cerviá et al 2018 lobón cerviá and rincón and rincón 2004 while extreme high flows during spring or

pillsburytelzer and pillsbury 2020 or reduction in access to food or refugia hakala and hartman 2004 deitchman and loheide 2012 kanno et al 2015 the importance of these changes in flow variation to biota in tributary and mainstem reaches can be very different though xu et al 2010 letcher et al 2015 mccargo and peterson 2010 for instance letcher et al 2015 found that low flows in tributaries were more harmful to trout populations than in mainstem reaches in wisconsin the summer season corresponds to the growth and adult pre spawning bioperiod of brook and brown trout and the magnitude duration and timing of summer low flows appear to be a critical factor for survival of young trout nicola et al 2009 dare et al 2002 harvey et al 2006 sotiropoulos et al 2006 generally higher summer streamflow improves fish population health xu et al 2010 found that high summer flows increased brook trout growth and kanno et al 2016 found that high summer precipitation and thus high streamflows were associated with high young of year abundances the following year conversely increasing duration of low flow events during the summer has been associated with increases in macrophyte biomass suren and riis 2010 decreases in macroinvertebrate richness datry 2012 and decreases in fish growth and abundance nuhfer et al 2017 jowett et al 2005 zorn et al 2012 letcher et al 2015 and nuhfer et al 2017 all found that low summer flows and streamflow depletion had strong negative effects on trout survival and growth in addition the rate of change in summer flow recession can rapidly alter abiotic conditions and influences access to refugia by mobile biota rolls et al 2012 for example rapid dewatering of stream channels can result in mortality of fish that were not able to emigrate and thus were stranded in shallow pools or on dry ground walker et al 2018 and thus has been associated with decreased survival in riverine fish harvey et al 2006 bradford 1997 the frequency of low flow events during summer and baseflow periods in regions that rarely experience ecologically critical low flow magnitudes like wisconsin can also have negative effects on biota rolls et al 2012 but few studies have investigated these effects despite the fact that groundwater extraction has been associated with increased frequency and duration of low flows kustu et al 2010 finally high variability in summer streamflows can also reduce fish population survival xu et al 2010 found that adult brook trout survival declined as the coefficient of variation cv of daily streamflow increased appendix b identifying temperature signatures for the upper midwest we also performed a literature review on the importance of stream temperature during autumn winter spring and summer for aquatic organisms in the upper midwest see table b 2 for a summary of the literature review with a full reference list in the right half of fig 1 we use temperature data from the usgs united states geologic survey 2021 to illustrate functional temperature components for the eau galle river in wisconsin stream temperature tracks seasonal temperature changes in wisconsin so that streams are around freezing during the winter months and about 20 25 c warmer during the summer each functional temperature component identified as important for stream communities in the upper midwest is marked with an x in fig 1 observed differences in stream communities are often attributable to variation in stream thermal regimes wehrly et al 2003 wehrly et al 2007 lyons et al 2009 because decreasing autumn temperature is an environmental cue for fall spawning fishes warren et al 2012 changes to a natural thermal regime such as extreme high fall temperatures xu et al 2010 or delays in the onset timing of fall cooling can delay or reduce spawning activity with implications for annual recruitment and subsequent population dynamics letcher et al 2015 stream trout can also experience a metabolic deficit during acclimation to rapidly declining water temperatures in the fall cunjak and power 1987 which has implications for overwinter survival in addition to temporal variation spatial variation of temperature can impact fish populations spatial variation in water temperatures can enable better growth if fish have access to warmwater forage during the winter armstrong et al 2021 during winter the physiological ecology of stream dwelling salmonids suggests a positive relationship between population dynamics and temperature huusko et al 2007 high winter temperatures have a positive effect on incubating eggs since trout eggs hatch faster and are more successful in warmer water baxter and mcphail 1999 additionally earlier hatching results in a longer growing season for newly hatched fry further improving their chances of survival similarly high winter water temperatures are correlated with greater survival for overwintering young of year fish hunt 1969 higher growth rates xu et al 2010 and increasing young of year abundances in subsequent summers kanno et al 2016 kanno et al 2015 kanno et al 2017 conversely extreme low temperatures e g 1 c can physiologically stress trout and lead to lower overwinter survival letcher et al 2015 or result in direct mortality from severe ice or snow conditions as the young of year cohort is extremely important for long term population stability kanno et al 2016 such effects can lead to population declines personal communication kirk olson wdnr fisheries biologist or induce downstream movement when frequent freezing and thawing lead to variable surface ice cover and frequent supercooling 0 c jakober et al 1998 the spring warming period is related to the fry rearing bioperiod of autumn spawning salmonids increases in average spring water and air temperatures are consistently and positively associated with young of year kanno et al 2015 and adult trout survival xu et al 2010 growth xu et al 2010 and the following summer s young of year abundance kanno et al 2016 although tsang et al 2016 found a slight negative association between brook and brown trout populations and maximum daily mean temperatures in spring we also expect that the variability and rate of change in magnitudes and predictability of thermal patterns in spring over time are important for recruitment growth and survival of stream trout and have the potential to drive non linear population effects within the season arismendi et al 2013 for example blum et al 2018 found that warmer maximum daily spring temperatures were associated with increased young of year abundance up to about 1 5 standard deviations above which abundance declined stream temperatures during the summer heat period have important implications for species adapted to cold water which if possible actively avoid high temperatures petty et al 2012 for example when stressful summer water temperatures occurred in a mainstem river of michigan s upper peninsula hayes et al 1998 documented brook trout migrating several kilometers upstream to a tributary to avoid the unfavorable thermal condition when trout cannot avoid stressful habitats and stream temperatures reach or exceed critical levels direct mortality events such as fish kills can occur till et al 2019 prolonged periods of elevated summer temperatures can have negative physiological effects on individuals that reduce population biomass kratzer and warren 2013 growth of young of year bassar et al 2016 and adult fish xu et al 2010 robinson et al 2010 nuhfer et al 2017 reduce annual survival xu et al 2010 letcher et al 2015 and delay spawning and reduce redd construction warren et al 2012 given the substantial and unequivocal support for the negative effects of warming temperatures on cold water adapted animals combined with growing evidence showing how flow reductions can increase stream temperatures gaffield et al 2005 nuhfer et al 2017 it follows that changes in stream thermal regimes during the summer warm period may pose the most serious threats to stream trout for example trout population inhabiting cold transitional streams in michigan declined in abundance when a mere 10 in flow reduction occurred because these streams had reference summer temperatures near the critical thermal tolerance levels for trout zorn et al 2012 similarly stream temperatures in wisconsin may reach critical maximum thresholds for stream trout mortality if both air temperature increases and baseflow declines deitchman and loheide 2012 selbig 2015 with mitro et al 2019 projecting a 68 and 32 decline in brook and brown trout thermal habitat by mid century in response to warming summer air temperatures it is important to also note that streamflow and temperature can have strong and complex interactive effects xu et al 2010 nuhfer et al 2017 but a general takeaway is that population declines result from low streamflows and high temperatures in summer and high streamflows and low stream temperatures in winter letcher et

pumping was simulated using the glover solution glover and balmer 1954 implemented in streamdepletr https cran r project org web packages streamdepletr index html for simplicity the aquifer properties are held constant across all sites with hydraulic conduction of k 10 m d aquifer thickness of b 100 m and specific yield of s y 0 2 the well has a seasonal pumping schedule with constant pumping from june 1 until september 1 every year for thermographs we used an end member mixing model on the same 34 wisconsin streams used for the hydrograph analysis to simulate temperatures with two water sources groundwater and surface flow flows were modeled with the same temperature profiles in all cases for simplicity groundwater was assumed to be 9 9 c the median of mean annual streamflow temperatures across all temperature sites and surface flow was assumed to match daily air temperature in madison wi from noaa climate data online nationalcenters 2021 groundwater and surface flow components of the hydrograph were separated using the usgs hysep fixed interval method sloto and crouse 1996 implemented in python at https github com dadelforge baseflow separation blob master physep hysep py using a window size of 52 days we identified 40 usgs sites in wisconsin with both temperature and streamflow data for these sites the median r 2 between the actual temperature measurements and the end member mixing model is 0 42 hydrograph separation window was chosen to maximize the median r 2 the low r 2 can be accounted for by the simplicity of the model and the fact that the same groundwater temperature is used in all cases when groundwater temperature is site specific median r 2 increases to 0 55 but site specific estimates are not available statewide so the single value is used in all cases changes in temperature signatures are calculated by comparing the results of the end member mixing model for the original and altered hydrograph timeseries for all streams so that i the analysis could be applied at sites without temperature data and ii results do not account for inaccuracies in the model to calculate seasonal flow and temperature signatures we algorithmically identified boundaries between hydroperiods thermoperiods we calculated a best fit to a broken stick function two lines that hinge at a point through a range of time that encompasses the expected timing of the seasonal boundary the seasonal boundary is defined as the hinge point for the broken stick function timeframes used for identifying seasonal breaks for each season are included in table c 3 an algorithmic method was required in order to assess changes in seasonal timing objectively about 30 sites were discarded from available usgs data since the seasonal fitting algorithm was not adequate to capture visual season boundaries to determine overall impacted flow and temperature signatures percent difference between the original and well impacted hydro and thermographs were calculated for each site timing signatures do not make sense as a percent difference so are reported as a difference in number of days we considered signatures to be generally impacted if the median percent difference is greater than 10 signatures are often impacted if the 25th 75th percentiles of percent different for the signature extend beyond 10 for timing signatures a difference of more than 5 days was considered significant no hydrograph showed a difference in timing for any period of larger than 2 days all median and interquartile impacts are shown in table c 3 appendix d stakeholder engagement maintaining stakeholder buy in is important for the success of a management strategy because water users are far more likely to agree to water rights reductions or water rights reductions if they are involved in the process of setting guidelines and deciding on implementation based on local knowledge baldwin et al 2012 there are many potential stakeholders for management decisions related to streamflow depletion including those who pump groundwater across the domestic industrial and municipal sectors institutions within these sectors such as groundwater management boards the communities in which these stakeholders are embedded and ngos such as environmental groups to name a few stakeholders have played an important role in building many existing groundwater management systems for example the advisory council for the michigan water withdrawal assessment process consisted of diverse stakeholders who collaborated to decide acceptable ecological thresholds and determined that decline past a 10 reduction in characteristic fish abundance would constitute a significant impact zorn et al 2012 in a similar working group process with stakeholders the rhode island sdm used a stream classification based on existing alteration to prioritize stream protections kendy et al 2012 there a board representing 68 organizations with varying interests formed a working group involved in setting limits the group agreed that a reduction of greater than 50 7q10 during the summer would cause a significant loss of fish and stream invertebrates to help meet the needs of water users they decided to allow more water withdrawal during non summer seasons when water resources are less strained giving water users security against limited water supply during the summer months additional examples where stakeholders were involved in setting ecological limits to streamflow depletion can be found in tables c 4 c 5 c 6 different projects have included a range of levels of stakeholder engagement higher levels of stakeholder engagement can be difficult to coordinate but the rewards can be great including diverse stakeholders can ensure that the management decisions represent the values of all interested parties emphasizing the inclusion both of water users and environmental groups most projects include stakeholders as advisors to the technical process to either set goals or agree on interpretation of results this role means that effective engagement with stakeholders relies on the ability of the technical team to adequately communicate findings for instance colorado produced a series of easily interpretable maps to guide discussions with stakeholders choosing appropriate aspects of the project for inclusion of stakeholders is important to maintain stakeholder interest limit the number of decision makers involved in certain decisions and ensure that stakeholder input is valuable 
3545,groundwater use can reduce streamflow by reducing groundwater flows into streams and or increasing losses from the stream into the aquifer streamflow depletion streamflow depletion can impact aquatic ecosystems through changes in the availability and temperature of surface water regions with a combination of groundwater withdrawals and groundwater dependent resources therefore require management strategies that respond to the needs of both humans and aquatic ecosystems here we review and evaluate opportunities and challenges for applying an environmental flows approach to streamflow depletion management based on functional flows and the ecological limits of hydrological alteration eloha frameworks we highlight the need for explicit recognition of temperature in streamflow depletion science especially given the realities of climate change using a demonstrative analysis on wisconsin streams we show that both the magnitude and variability of streamflow and stream temperatures are likely to be impacted by groundwater withdrawal with particular impacts on low flows during the baseflow period then we evaluate potential challenges to integrating existing groundwater withdrawal management and environmental flows approaches and provide a pathway to address inherent tensions between these two frameworks in particular we find that uncertainty associated with the first two eloha steps setting a baseline and classifying streams can lead to substantially different estimates of ecological impacts in streamflow depletion contexts navigating these tensions requires stakeholder engagement throughout the process of setting acceptable management thresholds to move towards practical management focused integration of environmental flows and streamflow depletion science keywords streamflow depletion environmental flows groundwater management stream temperature groundwater surface water interaction 1 introduction groundwater withdrawals have increased substantially since the mid 20th century worldwide with accelerated growth since 1990 wada et al 2014 increasing groundwater withdrawals can be detrimental both to human users when over use leads to groundwater depletion wada et al 2014 and rivers and streams that rely on discharge from groundwater sources e g perkin et al 2017 streamflow depletion occurs when groundwater withdrawals capture water that would otherwise discharge to a stream or when altered groundwater flow pathways enhance or induce infiltration from the stream into the streambed barlow and leake 2012 most pumped groundwater is captured from streamflow as streamflow depletion konikow and leake 2014 gleeson and richter 2018 and therefore represents a pervasive challenge even in settings where groundwater levels are relative stable see barlow and leake 2012 for a detailed introduction to streamflow depletion streamflow depletion is already a significant global problem de graaf et al 2019 found that streamflow in 15 20 of watersheds with groundwater withdrawals has already dropped below the flow needs of aquatic ecosystems environmental flows and up to 80 of watersheds will fail to maintain environmental flows by 2050 under a business as usual development and climate change scenario the impacts of streamflow depletion extend beyond ecosystem collapse perkin et al 2017 to impact surface water availability for human users as well given these challenges effective integrated management of interconnected surface water and groundwater resources is essential for maintaining water availability for human and ecosystem needs moving into the future due to potentially long time lags between groundwater withdrawals and measurable impacts including both streamflow depletion and water quality changes currell 2016 currell et al 2012 especially when wells are further from streams or buffered from streams by low transmissivity aquifer materials barlow and leake 2012 and the challenges in removing water rights once they have been allocated groundwater management is a long term process that requires a multi generational perspective gleeson et al 2012 however managing surface water groundwater interactions is particularly challenging because it is difficult to attribute changes in streamflow to specific stressors without detailed modeling or analysis beyond pumping changes in streamflow can also be driven by climate variability changes in groundwater levels climate change land use change and other human actions with impacts that vary regionally and locally carlisle et al 2019 cuthbert et al 2019 craig et al 2017 if these uncertainties are built into a modeling framework scientists and water managers can still robustly make predictions of potential future streamflow depletion impacts and develop appropriate management plans doherty and moore 2020 however more commonly complex uncertainties result in groundwater management goals that often lack explicit quantifiable connections to the ecological communities they are meant to protect saito et al 2021 environmental flows poff and zimmerman 2010 are one approach to setting science informed water management goals by quantifying the hydrological regime necessary to support aquatic ecosystems recognizing that in stream habitat requires more than a simple minimum level of flow e g poff et al 1997 bunn and arthington 2002 environmental flows incorporate a more comprehensive view of the magnitude timing variability and quality of streamflow poff and zimmerman 2010 given that groundwater level based management methods like drawdown triggers often fail to capture ecologically relevant changes in streamflow currell 2016 it is important to invest in improving and adapting environmental flows approaches there are many approaches to estimate environmental flows for example the functional flows framework yarnell et al 2020 relates qualitative aspects of a hydrograph that have important effects on ecological communities i e functional flow components to a quantifiable set of ecologically important flow characteristics that can be used for management once quantitative flow characteristics are set the ecological limits of hydrological alteration eloha framework poff and zimmerman 2010 provides a process for decision making on ecohydrological resources the eloha framework consists of four main technical steps 1 build a hydrological foundation for analysis 2 classify streams 3 quantify hydrological alteration and 4 relate hydrological alteration to ecological impacts poff and zimmerman 2010 though the eloha framework has been applied with success e g kendy et al 2012 integrating streamflow depletion remains a stubborn challenge and few existing groundwater management plans include quantifiable streamflow depletion targets or thresholds e g jurisdictions in the european union india and most jurisdictions in the us lack quantifiable targets gage and milman 2021 gleeson and richter 2018 kallis and butler 2001 srinivasan and kulkarni 2014 harsha 2016 in this review we focus on the specific management challenge of designing a decision process for permitting groundwater withdrawals in a manner that adequately accounts for potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems and respects environmental flows to provide a scientific foundation for addressing this challenge this synthesis paper focuses on the following objectives 1 discuss how existing environmental flows approaches such as using functional flows in the eloha approach can provide an ecological framework for streamflow depletion management section 2 2 review and identify challenges in integrating environmental flows into groundwater management section 3 this review is targeted primarily towards the groundwater and ecohydrological research communities while we primarily focus on management examples in the united states of america the social and technical challenges highlighted in this review are relevant for streamflow depletion management globally the intent of this review is to provide a pathway for overcoming existing scientific limitations at the streamflow depletion ecology nexus to guide future development of decision support systems for streamflow depletion management that explicitly account for potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems in particular we emphasize a need for more research on detecting and predicting hydrological changes from groundwater withdrawal beyond flow reduction i e changes in temperature variability and timing and the associated ecological impacts on ecosystems including impacts on macroinvertebrates and fish such research is essential for providing reliable guidance on management thresholds 2 ecological impacts of streamflow depletion it is well recognized that groundwater withdrawal can result in streamflow depletion e g barlow and leake 2012 demonstrated by the strong focus on the impacts of pumping on flow magnitudes in both management e g hamilton and seelbach 2011 diebel et al 2015 and scientific contexts e g zipper et al 2019 wen and chen 2006 burt et al 2002 however the choice of the specific hydrological targets used for management can have a large impact on allowable pumping limits granato and barlow 2005 in this section we use a functional flows framework yarnell et al 2020 and introduce a complementary functional temperature framework to identify ecologically important aspects of a stream hydrograph functional flow components and thermograph functional temperature components using the upper midwest as an example section 2 1 we then identify which functional components are likely to be impacted by groundwater withdrawal section 2 2 finally we link these functional flows and temperatures components to water management using the eloha framework section 2 3 2 1 a functional flows and temperatures framework for the upper midwest growing awareness of the importance of the entire streamflow regime beyond just mean streamflow to aquatic ecosystems and communities e g poff and zimmerman 2010 nuhfer et al 2017 has led to efforts to quantitatively classify the flow regime in both the scientific e g yarnell et al 2020 and management e g susquehanna river basin dephilip and moberg 2010 communities the functional flows framework starts with a qualitative description of ecologically relevant aspects of the flow regime such as baseflow recession peak flow or fall pulse called functional components yarnell et al 2020 each component can then be broken down into flow characteristics magnitude timing duration frequency rate of change each of which is measured using a hydrological signature which is a metric derived from the hydrograph that quantify different aspects of hydrological behavior mcmillan 2020 the outcome of the functional flows framework is a set of hydrological signatures that describe the ecologically relevant aspects of the flow regime while functional flows focus on the streamflow hydrograph water temperature is also essential to high quality habitat olden and naiman 2010 here we adapt the functional flows framework to the streamflow thermograph to demonstrate functional temperatures as a potential tool to understand the ecological impacts of pumping induced water temperature changes relative to the natural thermal regime a description of a thermograph under reference conditions arismendi et al 2013 for each component the characteristics we use in this study are magnitude timing duration frequency rate of change and variability poff et al 1997 magnitude refers to the value of flow temperature timing duration and frequency describe when certain flow temperature magnitudes occur how long they last and how often they occur throughout a year or season respectively it is common to use only rate of change or variability as a functional characteristic e g poff and zimmerman 2010 but we argue that these are distinct characteristics with diverse potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems therefore we separately define variability as the overall range of flow or temperature and the coefficient of variation for different time periods e g arismendi et al 2013 xu et al 2010 whereas the rate of change describes the overall change per unit time over a given time period i e rate of decrease in flow or temperature over the recession period e g nicola et al 2009 cattanéo et al 2002 yarnell et al 2020 demonstrate functional flows for a mixed rain snowmelt system common in california in fig 1 we adapt this approach to demonstrate how functional flows and functional temperatures may appear for a snowmelt and groundwater dominated system eau galle river wi location marked in fig 1a that is representative of many streams in mid to high latitudes around the world the particularities of the hydrograph shape may vary substantially among regions but this shape is common among all 34 streamflow stations in wisconsin examined in this study for plots of all annual hydrograph shapes see the data supplement lapides et al 2021 the annual shape of the hydrograph in the top left shows a baseflow period throughout most of the year with a pronounced spring freshet and summer recession peak flows occur throughout the year following snowmelt or rain events while extreme low flows occur during the baseflow period at the end of summer and beginning of fall because climate in the midwest differs substantially from that of california we performed a literature review on the seasonal importance of streamflow for aquatic organisms in this region i e autumn winter spring and summer which roughly correspond to the hydroperiods in fig 1 where possible ecological literature from the u s upper midwest was used in this review but literature from other mid to high latitude studies with similar hydrograph functions were used to expand the scope of information where studies were not available in the upper midwest at the bottom left of fig 1 we identify functional characteristics associated with each functional flow component with an x based on our literature review and analogy to yarnell et al 2020 see appendix a for a detailed summary of the regional functional flows review we also performed a literature review on the importance of stream temperature during autumn winter spring and summer for aquatic organisms in the upper midwest olden and naiman 2010 describe a natural thermal regime based on factors important for stream organisms which they use to explore the impact of dams on thermal stream characteristics and poff 2018 extend the concept to consider a flexible thermal regime that supports aquatic ecosystems here we build on this in our development of a functional temperatures description of upper midwest streams in the right half of fig 1 we use temperature data from the usgs united states geologic survey 2021 to illustrate functional temperature components for the eau galle river in wisconsin stream temperature tracks seasonal temperature changes so that streams are typically around freezing during the winter months and 20 25 c warmer during the summer each functional temperature component identified as important for stream communities in the upper midwest is marked with an x in fig 1 see appendix b for a detailed summary of the regional functional temperatures review 2 2 hydrological signatures sensitive to groundwater withdrawal the functional flows temperatures approach outlines all of the aspects of the hydrograph thermograph that are important for aquatic ecosystems but not all of the functional characteristics or components may be equally impacted by streamflow depletion since it can be difficult to obtain all of the prerequisite data to calculate an entire suite of signatures we seek to identify a smaller set of signatures that capture the ecologically relevant aspects of stream conditions that are most sensitive to groundwater withdrawal to identify which flow components are sensitive to groundwater withdrawal we selected a set of hydrological signatures that summarize the findings of the literature review see tables a 1 and b 2 and applied these signatures to hydrographs from 34 wisconsin streams with long term usgs streamflow records united states geologic survey 2021 and mean annual streamflow below 1 13 m3 s 40 ft3 s limiting this analysis to smaller streams reduces the importance of precipitation driven events in the hydrographs allowing the results to apply more specifically to groundwater dominated stream systems we simulated altered hydrographs by assuming one well for each stream at a distance of 1 000 m using the glover and balmer analytical solution glover and balmer 1954 implemented in streamdepletr zipper 2020 for simplicity the aquifer properties are held constant across all sites with hydraulic conductivity of k 10 m d aquifer thickness of b 100 m and specific yield of s y 0 2 which is typical for an unconfined unconsolidated sedimentary aquifer freeze and cherry 1979 since pumping is often seasonal i e for irrigation the well is pumped from june 1 to september 1 at a rate of 1 25 times the median baseflow implemented via the analytical superposition technique of jenkins 1968 since it is important to examine the impacts of groundwater pumping on streamflow over multiple years bradbury et al 2017 pumping was simulated throughout the duration of each stream gauge record associated thermographs for the original and altered hydrographs were calculated using a simple groundwater surface water end member mixing model groundwater is assumed to have a constant temperature year round of 9 9 c which is the median of mean annual temperatures from all wisconsin streams with temperature data surface flow temperatures were simulated using air temperature in madison wi nationalcenters 2021 temperatures were calculated daily so subdaily signatures are not calculated in this study although temperature changes at sub daily temporal resolution could be impacted by groundwater withdrawal and have ecological importance we adopted this simplified approach as an illustrative exploration of the flow and temperature components most sensitive to streamflow depletion rather than a detailed site specific characterization of actual impacts which is beyond the scope of this review paper but an important future research direction as an example this analysis is shown for the eau galle river wi in fig 2 this site was chosen because it has particularly well defined hydrograph seasonality fig 2a shows the original hydrograph blue and the calculated altered hydrograph red with selected change statistics for the eau galle river across all studied sites streamflow depletion leads to a substantial decrease in baseflow that extends beyond the summer pumping season with decreases up to 38 of median unimpacted baseflows and an increase in variability as shown by the cv statistics while less pronounced than during the baseflow period flows are reduced by streamflow depletion during freshet and recession periods flows at all times of year exhibit a greater variability when considering streamflow depletion impacts larger interquartile range and since baseflows are lower there is a more rapid recession following the freshet we found that the strongest impacts from groundwater withdrawal on wisconsin streams are on the magnitude characteristics frequency of extreme flows and flow variability fig 2b these results are largely unsurprising since the most apparent and recognized impact from groundwater withdrawal on a hydrograph is to reduce streamflow magnitude barlow and leake 2012 by reducing magnitude variability as measured by coefficient of variation the ratio between standard deviation and mean during different components of the hydrograph also increases since the range of flows does not change significantly but the mean drops the frequency of peak flows and low flows can be impacted by a decrease in magnitude since the number of flows throughout the year that exceed a given high flow decreases when all flow magnitudes decrease this can even be the case for an n yr return interval flow the same is true for low flows where flow more frequently drops below a low flow threshold when overall hydrograph magnitude drops due to streamflow depletion we hypothesize that the duration of the longest low flow period could be longer and the timing change for the same reason all the streamflow characteristics with observed impacts from groundwater withdrawal in our simple analysis are impacted primarily by a decrease in flow magnitude lacking data necessary to define the ecological response to each of these flow characteristics we used a threshold of 10 for demonstrative purposes as this large of a change could have impacts on ecological function since this analysis is limited by design we also mark with a grey dashed box the characteristics that we expect could be impacted by groundwater withdrawal although we did not observe large impacts in our simple analysis however different or more complex groundwater withdrawal schedules or different aquifer properties could result in more important transient effects on hydrographs resulting in potentially earlier onset of the baseflow season baseflow timing which could impact the timing and duration of low flows as well the strong impact of streamflow depletion on low flows is particularly problematic because pumping requirements i e irrigation are likely to be greatest during dry periods when low flows are naturally already at their lowest fig 3 a shows the estimated unimpacted teal and altered brown thermographs for the eau galle river wi decreased groundwater contributions caused by streamflow depletion led to warmer summer temperatures up to 3 9 c increase in mean daily across all sites in the summer and slightly colder temperatures in the winter up to 1 8 c in mean daily across all sites than the unimpacted thermograph fig 3b summarizes temperature impacts across all 34 wisconsin streams for temperature magnitude signatures a 2 c change is used as a threshold for impacts rather than a 10 change to better reflect the influence of temperature on fish bioenergetics hartman and cox 2008 hayes et al 2000 the largest impacts from pumping on the thermograph are on winter and summer temperatures decreases in flow magnitude increase the annual temperature range leading to hotter summer temperatures and colder winter temperatures ultimately stream temperatures are more responsive to air temperature as groundwater inputs to the stream decrease resulting in more temperature variability faster rates of change in temperature and more extreme temperatures for these reasons we also expect that peak temperatures and low temperatures could be more impacted by flow reduction including the duration of heat during the summer we tended to observe the lowest thermal impacts during the summer and fall when air temperature is closest to the groundwater temperature and therefore the relative contributions of groundwater and surface water do not have a substantial thermal impact though these two water sources may still have ecologically important chemical distinctions as with the functional flows analysis this was meant to be an illustrative exploration of potential temperature sensitivity to streamflow depletion as part of this review paper rather than a detailed site specific characterization so there are several potential limitations to the thermal analysis in reality surface water temperature is likely to be lower than air temperature and groundwater has a muted seasonal temperature signal so the real difference in temperature between surface water and groundwater is likely to be smaller than we estimated using our end member mixing model this model also assumes a nearby direct contribution of groundwater to streamflow by giving the baseflow the temperature profile of groundwater a reasonable assumption in gaining streams but not for losing streams losing streams will likely be more responsive to air temperature variation with a relatively small influence of groundwater temperature since water flows from the stream into the groundwater system barlow and leake 2012 and areas where streamflow depletion has caused streams to shift from gaining to losing may exhibit threshold type changes in the temperature regime rather than the linear mixing based changes estimated here it is difficult to identify over broad areas which streams are gaining or losing jasechko et al 2021 but these assumptions indicate that our analysis should be considered a baseline understanding and could be used to prioritize future research on affected aspects of the thermograph a full description of the methods used for the analyses in this section can be found in c the full set of hydrological signatures can be found in a and the full set of temperature signatures can be found in b 2 3 using eloha to relate hydrological signatures to ecological impacts the previous section illustrates how the functional flows framework can be used to identify a set of temperature and hydrological signatures that describe attributes of ecological importance that are sensitive to groundwater withdrawal the ecological limits of hydrological alteration eloha framework poff and zimmerman 2010 describes one method for designing a management procedure to respect environmental flow needs as described by these signatures the eloha framework assumes that as flow becomes more altered from a reference condition impacts on ecosystems increase the eloha framework follows four general steps 1 setting a hydrological reference condition from which alteration can be assessed 2 classifying streams to generalize results and plan monitoring strategies 3 quantifying hydrological alteration and 4 developing flow function curves that relate hydrological alteration to ecological impacts based on these steps a management threshold can be set using the flow function curves as a guide in practice flow function curves can be developed for individual species or whole communities e g zorn et al 2012 armstrong et al 2011 diebel et al 2015 wilding and poff 2008 these curves are developed by monitoring species presence population size and or community composition and relating change in these ecological indicators to different hydrological signatures for example both wisconsin diebel et al 2015 and michigan zorn et al 2012 use standardized long term monitoring data from stream surveys to generate flow function relationships between wisconsin fish presence and michigan fish abundance data and flow temperature signatures for statewide environmental flows protection in ohio kendy et al 2012 related mean daily flow in september to sensitive fish species using quantile regression on data from an existing habitat flow model to address statewide water planning in colorado kendy et al 2012 developed flow function curves for fish riparian vegetation invertebrates and whitewater kayak raft conditions using regression or categorical relationships from literature with expert input and in rhode island kendy et al 2012 took advantage of literature from georgia on flow fish and flow invertebrate relationships to examine impacts from changes in 7q10 the lowest 7 day flow that has a probability of occurring once every 10 years one particularly difficult aspect of using flow function curves is identifying an appropriate threshold of hydrological change which corresponds to unacceptable ecological impacts thresholds can be species specific or a composite threshold for impacts on all species of interest in a stream and they depend on the choice of hydrological signature while it is sometimes visually apparent where ecological condition starts to deteriorate purely ecological thresholds can be rare hillebrand et al 2020 and a choice of threshold typically constitutes a compromise between needs of stakeholders and ecosystems to identify thresholds and flow standards that are acceptable to all parties see d for examples of decision processes throughout the remainder of this review we will use the functional flows and eloha frameworks as a starting point to consider opportunities to build on current research and practice to develop more effective management protocols to manage groundwater withdrawals for ecological health but many of the opportunities and tensions we discuss are broadly generalizable across different environmental flows assessment approaches 3 challenges to integrating environmental flows into groundwater withdrawal permitting the environmental flows framework from the previous section provides a way to evaluate how well existing approaches to groundwater withdrawal management support the needs of aquatic ecosystems we identified a suite of signatures or types of signatures that are sensitive to groundwater withdrawal many of which are already embedded in management of groundwater withdrawals for instance in wisconsin diebel et al 2015 ohio kendy et al 2012 and michigan zorn et al 2012 statewide management focuses on the mean median flow for the low flow month in each state to capture more of the holistic hydrograph shape colorado sanderson et al 2012 maine weinberg 2013 massachusetts weinberg 2013 and the susquehanna river basin dephilip and moberg 2010 evaluate hydrological signatures on a monthly or seasonal basis including mean median flows in all cases and high low flows for the susquehanna river basin flow variability is also evaluated in the colorado sanderson et al 2012 and susquehanna river basin dephilip and moberg 2010 in contrast to streamflow data temperature data are less commonly available which may possibly explain why temperature is often not included in management processes notable exceptions are the wisconsin diebel et al 2015 and michigan zorn et al 2012 statewide processes which only focus on mean water temperature during the hottest low flow month july even by focusing on a small number of signatures it may be possible to capture most of the major impacts from groundwater withdrawal though since hydrograph impacts are primarily attributed to decreasing flow levels and thermograph impacts are primarily attributable to changes to winter and summer temperatures see section 2 adherence to environmental flows paradigms moves beyond selecting appropriate signatures uncertainty is a general problem in groundwater management and minimizing uncertainty may be the largest technical challenge in effective management of streamflow depletion doherty and moore 2020 as described above the eloha framework has four main technical steps 1 setting a reference condition 2 stream classification 3 quantifying alteration and 4 relating alteration to ecological impacts uncertainty from each step propagates through to the final management decision thus it is important to both quantify and minimize the uncertainty in the outcome of each step thinking of each step as a separate model that needs to be optimized for the specific outcomes required by the next step to manage for environmental flows it is important that the reference conditions section 3 1 stream classification section 3 2 and quantifying alteration from streamflow depletion sections 3 3 and 3 4 used for calculating the signatures are accurately calculated 3 1 setting a reference condition to detect alteration in the eloha framework hydrological signatures are compared under reference and altered conditions a hydrological reference is meant to characterize undisturbed stream conditions poff and zimmerman 2010 and therefore is best represented as the historical pre disturbance conditions in practice this is not done at large scales because few streams have adequate historical data to characterize a pre disturbance state instead hydrological reference conditions are commonly set using present day conditions e g driest month flows in wisconsin ohio and michigan statewide processes diebel et al 2014 kendy et al 2012 zorn et al 2012 reference streams e g the susquehanna river basin massachusetts statewide process dephilip and moberg 2010 archfield and vogel 2008 or by removing modeled impacts on current flows e g rhode island streamflow depletion methodology colorado statewide assessment richardson 2005 sanderson et al 2012 statistical approaches can then be used to extend streamflow reference estimates from gauged to ungauged sites e g wisconsin ohio michigan susquehanna river basin massachusetts rhode island colorado california diebel et al 2014 kendy and bredehoeft 2006 zorn et al 2012 dephilip and moberg 2010 archfield and vogel 2008 richardson 2005 sanderson et al 2012 zimmerman et al 2018 to decrease uncertainty in calculating the reference condition many agencies only calculate specific signatures like the mean flow during the driest month michigan wisonsin ohio diebel et al 2015 kendy et al 2012 or 7q10 rhode island richardson 2005 while practical due to data limitations focusing on the mean flow during part of the year necessarily excludes many potentially important functional flow and functional temperature components section 2 the underlying intention of setting the reference condition is to characterize ideal conditions for the stream ecosystem and it is typically assumed that an undisturbed natural condition is the appropriate reference condition e g archfield and vogel 2008 richardson 2005 sanderson et al 2012 dephilip and moberg 2010 however the meaning of undisturbed is complicated given a long history of land management wagner et al 2000 that often predates existing records regardless of how the undisturbed condition is defined stream ecosystems that have adapted to a modified flow regime and or contain introduced species may be better conserved using a well chosen reference representing disturbed conditions for example brown trout are a socially and politically important species in the central sands region of wisconsin but they are also an introduced species in this case a return to a historical or undisturbed reference condition may actually be detrimental to the current ecosystem although we are not aware of any significant documented examples of this phenomenon related to groundwater withdrawal however regardless of what conditions the current community is adapted to the true reference condition for aquatic ecosystems may not be captured in available datasets pauly 1995 thus it may be preferable or simply the only feasible option to use a disturbed state for the reference based on the conditions in which species of interest have been observed at a socially acceptable level rather than an undisturbed or historical state ultimately choosing a hydrological reference condition is a social decision about which aspects of an ecosystem are valuable and the choice of reference has a significant impact on management outcomes to demonstrate this impact we consider an example stream in fig 4 with a pre development flow of 0 8 m3 s and a current flow of 0 7 m3 s caused by 0 1 m3 s of depletion from existing wells there has been request for groundwater extraction well x nearby that will result in streamflow depletion of an additional 0 01 m3 s we explore three different scenarios for setting a reference condition 1 the reference is set at an undisturbed reference condition when no wells impact the stream 0 8 m3 s 2 the reference is set under the incorrect assumption that no existing wells impact the stream yet 0 7 m3 s and 3 the reference is set under the incorrect assumption that the full impacts of all existing wells have already impacted the stream from the undisturbed reference of 0 8 m3 s the depletion includes the estimated depletion from all wells 0 15 m3 s 19 for the disturbed reference if it is assumed that none of the existing wells are impacting the stream then the reference is set at 0 7 m3 s and the estimated cumulative future depletion of 0 15 m3 s is 21 change relative to the reference finally if all existing wells are assumed to impact the stream at the reference condition then only the proposed well x contributes to the depletion calculation 0 01 m3 s 1 depending on the reference condition the estimated cumulative streamflow depletion ranges from 1 to 21 if allowable depletion levels are less than 21 then this uncertainty range includes the allowable depletion range and assumptions about the reference directly impact whether well x will be permitted or approved by a regulatory agency in this example very little streamflow depletion is likely to result from approving well x when considered alone this well is unlikely to harm the stream and would be likely to be approved by a groundwater manager however the cumulative impacts of all of the existing wells on the stream are more substantial this leads directly to a social issue in groundwater permitting should well x be denied due to groundwater pumping by other water users with wells a e if yes then it is very difficult for newer property owners to access groundwater rights even when their needs are modest if not then groundwater managers will need to find other creative ways of maintaining streamflow for instance by reducing existing groundwater rights or other programs that encourage compromises in water use among water users in a water use district as many regions reach their ecological limits for groundwater withdrawals managers will be faced with overcoming this type of social dilemma beyond the decision about which impacts to include in a reference condition the metric used to define the reference condition can have a large impact on streamflow depletion calculated in fig 5 we explore how using the august mean or median streamflow could impact streamflow depletion calculations plum creek fig 5a has a very variable hydrograph whereas pleasant valley creek fig 5b is very stable as a result the august mean and median streamflow at pleasant valley are nearly the same but the august median is significantly less than the mean at plum creek for both streams we assume that groundwater pumping has resulted in a streamflow reduction equal to 10 of the mean flow since the mean and median are nearly the same at pleasant valley creek this level of depletion is measured as an 11 depletion from the august median streamflow however this 10 depletion from the mean is measured as a 35 depletion from the median in plum creek both of these case study examples also demonstrate that a large amount of uncertainty is embedded in the decisions made about reference conditions and existing disturbance in setting a reference condition uncertainty can come from two different sources the best time period or type of reference may be uncertain fig 4 but there also may be uncertainty in the calculated streamflow reference for each scenario uncertainty can be more important in some scenarios than others if streamflow depletion is small then uncertainty in the reference condition may be greater than the expected level of depletion making it impossible to estimate hydrological alteration caused by groundwater pumping comparing across the three scenarios in fig 4 if there is a 0 1 m3 s uncertainty in the reference condition then there is no quantifiable difference between the three reference conditions this issue may be particularly acute in small headwater streams that tend to have limited monitoring nadeau and rains 2007 which increases uncertainty and low flows which means that small magnitudes of uncertainty can be a large percentage of flow headwater streams are both highly vulnerable to streamflow depletion and important ecological habitat bishop et al 2008 van meerveld et al 2020 so enhanced monitoring and improved modeling of headwater systems is essential for streamflow depletion management 3 2 stream classification in stream classification uncertainty can arise from how class boundaries are defined in practice stream classifications have distinct boundaries but for streams on the borderline between classes the limits chosen for the classification scheme can have a large impact on how the stream is managed to our knowledge no sensitivity analyses have been performed to identify the impact of classification boundaries on resulting management decisions fig 6 shows a demonstrative example with only two classes in this example streams a and d are clearly members of classes 1 and 2 respectively but streams b and c are both borderline and falling within the grey uncertainty area separating the two classes uncertainty in classification can be caused by either uncertainty in the precise location of the boundaries between classes i e stream b and or uncertainty in the stream s position in parameter space i e stream c a further consideration is that streamflow depletion may cause a stream to move within classification space if pumping affects the hydrological signatures used for classification the arrows in fig 6 indicate possible trajectories for streams with increased groundwater withdrawal these arrows show how streams can change classification over time as emphasized by rypel et al 2019 for lakes in wisconsin if the class boundary corresponds to an ecologically relevant threshold for example a threshold on a flow function curve section 3 then maintaining class membership could be essential for ecological health in that case stream c would require more strict management than stream d to maintain class membership in class 2 however this also brings up concerns about why stream c should be managed differently from stream d if they are in the same region of the classification space this type of thinking could motivate the inclusion of fuzzy classification and transitional classes along class boundaries as in rypel et al 2019 or zorn et al 2012 further exploration into the prevalence of borderline streams under different classification systems and the impacts on aggregate management actions would support thoughtful management 3 3 quantifying streamflow depletion quantifying streamflow depletion consists of two steps first establishing the conceptual model for the problem and second applying a quantitative method to calculate streamflow depletion one particularly difficult aspect of establishing a conceptual model for streamflow depletion is determining the appropriate geographical extent for analysis if the geographical extent is too small then local impacts on a stream may be exaggerated in importance since aquatic organisms are able to migrate throughout a stream channel to find suitable habitat conversely if the geographical extent is too large then it may be difficult to identify the importance or validity of local changes or even to account for spatially variable phenomena noorduijn et al 2019 these considerations in model set up are also tied closely to the inclusion of nearby wells and cumulative impacts in the model as discussed in section 3 1 with a small geographical extent cumulative impacts are more likely to be neglected since nearby wells fall outside of the model domain whereas the impact of a new well may be hard to tease out of a larger model with already substantial impacts to the stream from existing wells the correct geographical extent for each management scenario depends on the geological setting after identifying an appropriate conceptual model for the management scenario and defining the geographical extent streamflow depletion is calculated using a quantitative model streamflow depletion is the difference between actual streamflow and what streamflow would have been in the absence of groundwater withdrawal barlow et al 2018 as a result streamflow is impossible to directly measure because it requires comparing observed streamflow to a hypothetical scenario and is challenging to estimate because groundwater withdrawal impacts are masked by other causes of hydrological variability barlow and leake 2012 at the scale of an individual stream reach detailed field observations directly estimate streamflow depletion i e hunt et al 2001 sophocleous et al 1988 kollet and zlotnik 2003 flores et al 2020 weeks et al 1965 however estimating streamflow depletion from observational data alone is not practical at larger scales such as a watershed aquifer or region for these spatial scales streamflow depletion can be estimated using analytical numerical and or statistical methods zipper et al 2021 review and compare methods for calculating streamflow depletion huang et al 2018 reeves et al 2009 and hunt 2014 comprehensively review analytical methods griebling and neupauer 2013 describe standard numerical techniques here we briefly discuss performance and capabilities of different streamflow depletion estimation methods with specific emphasis on their use for groundwater withdrawal permitting analytical methods were the first approach used to estimate streamflow depletion e g glover and balmer 1954 theis 1941 hantush 1965 jenkins 1968 hunt 1999 they are the simplest methods available requiring relatively little input data and training to use and are the most common choice for decision support systems for groundwater withdrawal permitting e g wisconsin ohio massachusetts and michigan diebel et al 2014 kendy et al 2012 reeves et al 2009 analytical methods are powerful because of their modest data requirements and fast computation but they are limited by simplifying assumptions commonly including homogeneity of stream and aquifer properties in space and time huang et al 2018 analytical solutions also typically apply only to one well and one stream with cumulative impacts of wells assumed to be linearly additive reilly et al 1987 which is not a valid assumption when streams dry completely ahlfeld et al 2016 analytical depletion functions were recently developed to distribute the impacts of a well across multiple stream reaches with good agreement with process based numerical models zipper et al 2021 zipper et al 2019 reeves et al 2009 li et al 2020 zipper et al 2018 even though data requirements for analytical methods are modest data limitations are still common streambed hydraulic properties for instance can have a significant impact on estimated depletion neupauer et al 2020 lackey et al 2015 christensen 2000 but are rarely known at adequate spatiotemporal resolution numerical models such as modflow gsflow parflow and hydrogeosphere typically use process based governing equations to route water through a two or three dimensional representation of a landscape numerical models can explicitly represent stream aquifer exchange at the scale of each model grid cell and therefore provide fine spatial resolution estimates of streamflow depletion and other related ecohydrological processes and some numerical models can simulate water temperature and other water quality impacts in addition to flows of water however this spatial fidelity requires significantly more data time and expertise to build and calibrate numerical models are the most powerful tool we have for projecting changes in streams and identifying mechanisms and can be subjected to robust uncertainty assessments to bound depletion estimates with confidence intervals foster et al 2021 doherty and moore 2020 new tools are making it easier to develop and analyze numerical models e g modflow setup https github com aleaf modflow setup bakker et al 2016 fienen et al 2021 white et al 2021 and are well suited for detailed reviews where managers have site specific expertise and sufficient data and resources available to represent key model processes numerical models have been used extensively for evaluation of groundwater withdrawal zipper et al 2021 analytic element models have intermediate complexity between analytical solutions and numerical models strack 2003 they are typically two dimensional steady state simulations with a great deal of flexibility in terms of landscape heterogeneity and problem geometry haitjema 1995 while the two dimensional setup makes them less accurate than multi layer numerical models where vertical flow is important haitjema 1987 they can provide spatial resolution difficult to achieve with large numerical models and problem specificity that cannot be achieved with standard analytical solutions while recent research has helped develop analytic element models which can simulate transient conditions multi layer flow or both e g ttim timml anaqsim bakker 2013 bakker and strack 2003 fitts 2010 analytic element models are still not as widely used as other approaches such as finite difference or finite element models hunt 2006 they have been applied in wisconsin to model groundwater systems e g juckem and coalition 2009 juckem and dunning 2015 but the relative advantages of these different approaches in terms of quantitative performance have yet to be well defined statistical methods have also been used to infer and estimate streamflow depletion although they have seen less use than analytical or numerical approaches in streamflow depletion assessment zipper et al 2021 statistical assessments can be used to identify trends and relationships among data and may be best suited for settings where data essential to numerical methods such as subsurface and streambed data are unavailable while statistical approaches are typically informed by process understanding they unlike numerical and analytical approaches are not underpinned by physical laws to incorporate more physical knowledge emerging process guided machine learning approaches can use physical laws to penalize unreasonable model behavior e g read et al 2019 these approaches have not yet been tested for streamflow depletion assessment data driven methods have been shown to be more accurate than numerical models in some hydrological modeling scenarios gauch et al 2019 booker and woods 2014 and can be a powerful tool to tease out the importance of different landscape factors and land use in impacting low flows in streams hammond and fleming 2021 given the numerous options for estimating streamflow depletion the best tool for use in a management framework depends on the complexity of the problem the level of accuracy needed and the time constraints for getting results in many cases fast review turn around for groundwater withdrawal applications is essential for maintaining support from water users and is even legislated to short timeframes in some areas which would preclude the development of a site specific calibrated numerical model while some model intercomparisons have compared within and among different estimation methods flores et al 2020 sophocleous et al 1995 li et al 2020 knowling et al 2019 more thorough benchmarking and comparison among a wide suite of different methods using common input data is a critical research need to better understand the capabilities and limitations of simpler quantitative tools 3 4 quantifying temperature changes due to groundwater withdrawal stream temperature is a complex quantity dependent on climatic variables physical attributes shade from plants and wood hyporheic exchange water depth and water velocity and relative contributions of surface water and groundwater to streamflow stark et al 1994 since groundwater is buffered from air by soil and rock groundwater temperatures are typically cooler than surface water temperatures during the summer warmer than surface water temperatures during the winter and change much more slowly than surface water temperatures bonan 2015 thus groundwater inputs to streams serve to moderate extreme temperatures and smooth out variability as a simple example fig 7 shows how groundwater contributions to streamflow moderate streamflow temperatures and reduce variability effect becomes more pronounced as groundwater contribution increases from 0 groundwater red to 100 groundwater contribution blue a reduction in groundwater contribution for instance from 50 to 25 approximates the impact of streamflow depletion on a thermograph since streamflow depletion reduces groundwater inputs to streams while temperature is ecologically important literature assessing the impacts of groundwater withdrawal on temperature in nearby streams is limited streamflow depletion field experiments generally use surface water diversion to simulate streamflow depletion e g nuhfer et al 2017 sstelzer and pillsburytelzer and pillsbury 2020 do not report temperature data e g hunt et al 2001 1966 2002 1988 2004 or are not controlled enough to allow for evaluating the impacts of pumping on stream temperature kwon et al 2020 one exception is flores et al 2020 who examined the impact of pumping on stream temperature in a field study and identified an immediate stream temperature change of a few degrees when pumping started or stopped indicating the potential importance of this understudied aspect of streamflow depletion several studies have investigated potential temperature impacts of streamflow depletion risley et al 2010 evaluated the impacts of pumping on stream temperature in archetypal numerical models they found that while pumping generally increased stream temperature in the summer and reduced stream temperature in the winter the change was generally less than 0 5 c conversely stark et al 1994 found that pumping for irrigation could result in a 0 5 1 5 increase in summer streamflow temperatures and foglia et al 2013 found that a 50 increase in minimum summer flows could significantly reduce the proportion of the stream network where temperatures exceed 25 c andrews 2018 did a comparison among a suite of temperature models to identify which variables and processes were most important to include in order to capture observed thermal properties of streams they found that it was important to consider three thermal water pools groundwater surface water and overland flow a model that considers only water depth such as those used for assessment in michigan and wisconsin zorn et al 2012 diebel et al 2015 was not sufficient to capture observed behavior using the best fit models changes in stream temperature induced by pumping were generally less than 0 5 c these initial explorations of the impacts of groundwater withdrawal on stream temperature combined with our preliminary analysis of functional temperature components section 2 2 indicate that there may be a substantial thermal change induced by pumping in some cases there are numerous tools available that are capable of calculating stream temperatures andrews 2018 and some calibrated groundwater models with temperature already exist e g woolfenden et al 2011 chunn et al 2019 however some of these existing temperature models are not capable of accurately predicting pumping impacts on streamflow and field data to evaluate models for the thermal impacts of pumping are still very limited see above because a warming climate contributes directly to increases in stream temperatures ducharne et al 2007 and may combine with agricultural expansion to increase streamflow depletion through increasing human demand for water resources wada et al 2013 it is critical to consider the combined impacts of climatic warming land use change and streamflow depletion on stream temperatures deitchman and loheide 2012 enhanced research focus on the thermal impacts of groundwater withdrawal situated in the broader context of changing thermal regimes including diverse field studies and exploration of widely applicable model structures is necessary to disentangle diverse drivers of temperature change and further develop a functional temperatures approach to streamflow depletion management 3 5 connecting stream alteration to ecological impacts as emphasized in section 2 environmental flows management requires evaluating more than streamflow quantity many of the methods described above for temperature and streamflow modeling can be used to calculate multiple flow temperature characteristics to manage for future conditions though it is essential to incorporate future impacts on streamflow and temperature that derive from climate change or land use change as well craig et al 2017 understanding these feedbacks is essential for making decisions about acceptable thresholds of change described in section 2 for instance climate change land use change and groundwater withdrawal can all increase variability in stream conditions above variability ecosystems are adapted to greater variation in streamflow results in even greater variation in wetted channel extent in headwater streams with implications for seasonal stream habitat dynamics that aquatic ecosystems rely on lapides et al 2021 when variability becomes more extreme than the ecosystems are adapted for more variation can result in for example more extreme dry years when flows become low enough to cause catastrophic population declines in particular shifts in streamflow patterns from perennial to non perennial can have devastating impacts on aquatic ecosystems bogan and lytle 2011 a general shift to non perennial flow has become increasing common across much of the southern united states and europe zipper et al 2021 tramblay et al 2021 and has been linked in some regions to streamflow depletion perkin et al 2017 zimmer et al 2020 ecosystems can recover after dry years in certain situations due to density dependent recruitment but it is important to understand long term population dynamics to decide whether it is acceptable to plan for occasional community collapse wang et al 2003 wang et al 2001 zorn et al 2012 or whether community collapse is an unacceptable impact lack of information about ecosystem resilience to the impacts of groundwater withdrawal can complicate discussions around socially acceptable impacts as an example bradbury et al 2017 found that there were significant impacts to stream ecosystems in the little plover river wisconsin as a result of groundwater withdrawal however years of high precipitation in wisconsin resulted in replenished streamflow with rebounding fish communities by the time the results were published this drove water users to challenge the importance of ecological impacts because of visible ecosystem resilience part of quantifying the risks of streamflow depletion is a greater understanding of how ecosystems respond to and rebound from stressors over long timescales so that there is greater ability to identify types of stresses that will cause reversible vs irreversible damage to ecosystems 4 towards ecologically informed groundwater withdrawal decision making developing a well rounded description of environmental flow needs and the timing and magnitude of streamflow depletion is the foundation of a groundwater withdrawal decision making protocol designed to balance the needs of society and aquatic ecosystems incorporating aquatic ecosystem water needs into groundwater withdrawal permitting is challenging due to uncertainty in the quantification of streamflow depletion impacts environmental flow requirements and implementation challenges related to stakeholder buy in and limited resource availability the functional flows framework provides a structure with which to describe a holistic streamflow and stream temperature state a description that can guide use of an environmental flows management framework such as eloha which as we review here has been used for groundwater management in some form in several jurisdictions given the difficulties inherent to describing streams and ecoystems quantitatively at large scales it is important that uncertainty be incorporated into all technical steps of a management process from calculating reference conditions and classifying streams to quantifying alteration particular attention should be paid to how a reference condition is defined and calculated to ensure that it is appropriate for the management goals even with general agreement among the scientific community on the necessary technical steps for successful management of streamflow depletion substantial challenges remain in terms of functional implementation numerous studies have identified jurisdictional complexities to groundwater management e g molle and closas 2020 gage and milman 2021 structural barriers to improving monitoring and scientific programs saito et al 2021 and difficulties in balancing the needs of water users and ecosystems e g dnr water use section 2021 closas and molle 2018 molle and closas 2020 while a complete review of the sociopolitical challenges in managing streamflow depletion is beyond the scope of this study prior research identifies the importance of stakeholder buy in for groundwater permitting programs e g tsvetanov and earnhart 2020 deines et al 2019 drysdale and hendricks 2018 baldwin et al 2012 kendy et al 2012 considering the needs of all stakeholders including water users people who enjoy outdoor recreation in waterways indigenous peoples and ecosystems in groundwater management allows for the development of management protocols that work for everyone additionally streamflow depletion management needs to be placed in the larger context of impacts to streams taking into account future land use and climate changes that could amplify or cancel out impacts of streamflow depletion since ecosystems cannot show up to advocate for themselves the strategies discussed in this review can help to bring ecosystem needs to the table in a quantitative way as other jurisdictions move towards ecologically informed groundwater withdrawal decision making they can prioritize the successful approaches we review here most importantly stakeholder engagement throughout the process of identifying ecosystem needs and setting appropriate streamflow depletion thresholds many of the challenges raised in this review are more generally applicable to a larger range of streamflow management problems such as defining waters of the united states wotus department of the army et al 2020 as a basis for regulation to support these management needs the scientific community should prioritize research on user friendly methods to estimate pumping impacts and associated uncertainty on streamflow stream temperature and aquatic ecosystems to empower local managers and stakeholders to make informed decisions data availability code and data used for analyses in this study are available at https github com lapidesd eco stream

snowmelt and groundwater dominated system eau galle river wi in the left half of fig 1 that is representative of many streams typical of wisconsin and mid to high latitudes around the world the annual shape of the hydrograph in the top left shows a baseflow period throughout most of the year with a pronounced spring freshet and summer recession peak flows occur throughout the year while extreme low flows occur during the baseflow period at the end of summer and beginning of fall because climate regimes in the midwest differ substantially from those of california we performed a literature review on the seasonal importance of streamflow for aquatic organisms in this region i e autumn winter spring and summer which roughly correspond to the hydroperiods in fig 1 where possible ecological literature from the u s upper midwest was used in this review but literature from other mid to high latitude studies with similar hydrograph functions were used to expand the scope of information where studies were not available in the upper midwest see table a 1 for full set of references at the bottom left of fig 1 we identify functional characteristics associated with each functional flow component with an x based on our literature review and analogy to yarnell et al 2020 these results are summarized below streamflow is a master variable that shapes the ecological condition of flowing water ecosystems and thus the life history traits of aquatic biota power et al 1995 streamflow characteristics vary over a year and relate to different bioperiods of freshwater species autumn september november is a key bioperiod for brook and brown trout in the upper midwest as it coincides with adult spawning activity field studies have found a positive relationship between autumn streamflows and trout growth recruitment and survival for example xu et al 2010 found that high autumn streamflow increased brook trout growth in a massachusetts stream and numerous studies have found that low autumn flows or precipitation are associated with decreased population sizes in subsequent years kanno et al 2015 kanno et al 2016 bassar et al 2016 blum et al 2018 indeed declines in late summer and autumn base flows have been implicated in the degradation of both cold and warm water fish assemblages in southern wisconsin wang et al 2003 wang et al 2001 streamflow patterns during winter december february have historically been considered less consequential for animal population dynamics in temperate freshwater ecosystems however recent research has challenged this view high winter precipitation and streamflow events during the egg incubation and fry rearing period have been shown to be related to low age 0 fish abundances suggesting that winter high flows result in bed scouring that negatively impacts survival of eggs and newly hatched individuals blum et al 2018 kanno et al 2016 xu et al 2010 kanno et al 2015 kanno et al 2017 jensen and johnsen 1999 roghair et al 2002 this single year effect translates into decreasing occurrence probability for fall spawning trout with increasing winter high flows wenger et al 2011 streamflow during or just after trout emergence is a primary factor in determining recruitment and subsequent population dynamics across geographic regions in the upper midwest this time period corresponds with spring march may during spring the timing magnitude and duration of extreme flow conditions and the rate of change in discharge directly impact autumn spawning trout survival growth and recruitment xu et al 2010 blum et al 2018 kanno et al 2015 kanno et al 2017 spring streamflow can also show non linear relationships with trout population dynamics in spain brown trout recruitment increases with increasing spring streamflows until a high flow threshold beyond which recruitment declines lobón cerviá 2004 lobón cerviá et al 2018 lobón cerviá and rincón and rincón 2004 while extreme high flows during spring or

streamflow conditions during the summer recession and base flow periods june august are described by low flow hydrology which is strongly driven by variability in the magnitude timing seasonality frequency duration and rate of change flow characteristics rolls et al 2012 changes in flow magnitude can negatively affect fish populations poff and allan 1995 letcher et al 2015 kanno et al 2016 and

pillsburytelzer and pillsbury 2020 or reduction in access to food or refugia hakala and hartman 2004 deitchman and loheide 2012 kanno et al 2015 the importance of these changes in flow variation to biota in tributary and mainstem reaches can be very different though xu et al 2010 letcher et al 2015 mccargo and peterson 2010 for instance letcher et al 2015 found that low flows in tributaries were more harmful to trout populations than in mainstem reaches in wisconsin the summer season corresponds to the growth and adult pre spawning bioperiod of brook and brown trout and the magnitude duration and timing of summer low flows appear to be a critical factor for survival of young trout nicola et al 2009 dare et al 2002 harvey et al 2006 sotiropoulos et al 2006 generally higher summer streamflow improves fish population health xu et al 2010 found that high summer flows increased brook trout growth and kanno et al 2016 found that high summer precipitation and thus high streamflows were associated with high young of year abundances the following year conversely increasing duration of low flow events during the summer has been associated with increases in macrophyte biomass suren and riis 2010 decreases in macroinvertebrate richness datry 2012 and decreases in fish growth and abundance nuhfer et al 2017 jowett et al 2005 zorn et al 2012 letcher et al 2015 and nuhfer et al 2017 all found that low summer flows and streamflow depletion had strong negative effects on trout survival and growth in addition the rate of change in summer flow recession can rapidly alter abiotic conditions and influences access to refugia by mobile biota rolls et al 2012 for example rapid dewatering of stream channels can result in mortality of fish that were not able to emigrate and thus were stranded in shallow pools or on dry ground walker et al 2018 and thus has been associated with decreased survival in riverine fish harvey et al 2006 bradford 1997 the frequency of low flow events during summer and baseflow periods in regions that rarely experience ecologically critical low flow magnitudes like wisconsin can also have negative effects on biota rolls et al 2012 but few studies have investigated these effects despite the fact that groundwater extraction has been associated with increased frequency and duration of low flows kustu et al 2010 finally high variability in summer streamflows can also reduce fish population survival xu et al 2010 found that adult brook trout survival declined as the coefficient of variation cv of daily streamflow increased appendix b identifying temperature signatures for the upper midwest we also performed a literature review on the importance of stream temperature during autumn winter spring and summer for aquatic organisms in the upper midwest see table b 2 for a summary of the literature review with a full reference list in the right half of fig 1 we use temperature data from the usgs united states geologic survey 2021 to illustrate functional temperature components for the eau galle river in wisconsin stream temperature tracks seasonal temperature changes in wisconsin so that streams are around freezing during the winter months and about 20 25 c warmer during the summer each functional temperature component identified as important for stream communities in the upper midwest is marked with an x in fig 1 observed differences in stream communities are often attributable to variation in stream thermal regimes wehrly et al 2003 wehrly et al 2007 lyons et al 2009 because decreasing autumn temperature is an environmental cue for fall spawning fishes warren et al 2012 changes to a natural thermal regime such as extreme high fall temperatures xu et al 2010 or delays in the onset timing of fall cooling can delay or reduce spawning activity with implications for annual recruitment and subsequent population dynamics letcher et al 2015 stream trout can also experience a metabolic deficit during acclimation to rapidly declining water temperatures in the fall cunjak and power 1987 which has implications for overwinter survival in addition to temporal variation spatial variation of temperature can impact fish populations spatial variation in water temperatures can enable better growth if fish have access to warmwater forage during the winter armstrong et al 2021 during winter the physiological ecology of stream dwelling salmonids suggests a positive relationship between population dynamics and temperature huusko et al 2007 high winter temperatures have a positive effect on incubating eggs since trout eggs hatch faster and are more successful in warmer water baxter and mcphail 1999 additionally earlier hatching results in a longer growing season for newly hatched fry further improving their chances of survival similarly high winter water temperatures are correlated with greater survival for overwintering young of year fish hunt 1969 higher growth rates xu et al 2010 and increasing young of year abundances in subsequent summers kanno et al 2016 kanno et al 2015 kanno et al 2017 conversely extreme low temperatures e g 1 c can physiologically stress trout and lead to lower overwinter survival letcher et al 2015 or result in direct mortality from severe ice or snow conditions as the young of year cohort is extremely important for long term population stability kanno et al 2016 such

are consistently and positively associated with young of year kanno et al 2015 and adult trout survival xu et al 2010 growth xu et al 2010 and the following summer s young of year abundance kanno et al 2016 although tsang et al 2016 found a slight negative association between brook and brown trout populations and maximum daily mean temperatures in spring we also expect that the variability and rate of change in magnitudes and predictability of thermal patterns in spring over time are important for recruitment growth and survival of stream trout and have the potential to drive non linear population effects within the season arismendi et al 2013 for example blum et al 2018 found that warmer maximum daily spring temperatures were associated with increased young of year abundance up to about 1 5 standard deviations above which abundance declined stream temperatures during the summer heat period have important implications for species adapted to cold water which if possible actively avoid high temperatures petty et al 2012 for example when stressful summer water temperatures occurred in a mainstem river of michigan s upper peninsula hayes et al 1998 documented brook trout migrating several kilometers upstream to a tributary to avoid the unfavorable thermal condition when trout cannot avoid stressful habitats and stream temperatures reach or exceed critical levels direct mortality events such as fish kills can occur till et al 2019 prolonged periods of elevated summer temperatures can have negative physiological effects on individuals that reduce population

delay spawning and reduce redd construction warren et al 2012 given the substantial and unequivocal support for the negative effects of warming temperatures on cold water adapted animals combined with growing evidence showing how flow reductions can increase stream temperatures gaffield et al 2005 nuhfer et al 2017 it follows that changes in stream thermal regimes during the summer warm period may pose the most serious threats to stream trout for example trout population inhabiting cold transitional streams in michigan declined in abundance when a mere 10 in flow reduction occurred because these streams had reference summer temperatures near the critical thermal tolerance levels for trout zorn et al 2012 similarly stream temperatures in wisconsin may reach critical maximum thresholds for stream trout mortality if both air temperature increases and baseflow declines deitchman and loheide 2012 selbig 2015 with mitro et al 2019 projecting a 68 and 32 decline in brook and brown trout thermal habitat by mid century in response to warming summer air temperatures it is important to also note that streamflow and temperature can have strong and complex interactive effects xu et al 2010 nuhfer et al 2017 but a general takeaway is that population declines result from low streamflows and high temperatures in summer and high streamflows and low stream temperatures in winter letcher et

2012 mi usa appendix c characterizing hydrological signatures sensitive to groundwater withdrawal in wisconsin as an illustrative example we calculated the signatures in tables a 1 and b 2 for 34 wisconsin streams under existing conditions and with simulated pumping from one nearby well hydrographs were obtained from usgs surface water for the nation united states geologic survey 2021 and pumping was simulated using the glover solution glover and balmer 1954 implemented in streamdepletr https cran r project org web packages streamdepletr index html for simplicity the aquifer properties are held constant across all sites with hydraulic conduction of k 10 m d aquifer thickness of b 100 m and specific yield of s y 0 2 the well has a seasonal pumping schedule with constant pumping from june 1 until september 1 every year for thermographs we used an end member mixing model on the same 34 wisconsin streams used for the hydrograph analysis to simulate temperatures with two water sources groundwater and surface flow flows were modeled with the same temperature profiles in all cases for simplicity groundwater was assumed to be 9 9 c the median of mean annual streamflow temperatures across all temperature sites and surface flow was assumed to match daily air temperature in madison wi from noaa climate data online nationalcenters 2021 groundwater and surface flow components of the hydrograph were separated using the usgs hysep fixed interval method sloto and crouse 1996 implemented in python at https github com dadelforge baseflow separation blob master physep hysep py using a window size of 52 days we identified 40 usgs sites in wisconsin with both temperature and streamflow data for these sites the median r 2 between the actual temperature measurements and the end member mixing model is 0 42 hydrograph separation window was chosen to maximize the median r 2 the low r 2 can be accounted for by the simplicity of the model and the fact that the same groundwater temperature is used in all cases when groundwater temperature is site specific median r 2 increases to 0 55 but site specific estimates are not available statewide so the single value is used in all cases changes in temperature signatures are calculated by comparing the results of the end member mixing model for the original and altered hydrograph timeseries for all streams so that i the analysis could be applied at sites without temperature data and ii results do not account for inaccuracies in the model to calculate seasonal flow and temperature signatures we algorithmically identified boundaries between hydroperiods thermoperiods we calculated a best fit to a broken stick function two lines that hinge at a point through a range of time that encompasses the expected timing of the seasonal boundary the seasonal boundary is defined as the hinge point for the broken stick function timeframes used for identifying seasonal breaks for each season are included in table c 3 an algorithmic method was required in order to assess changes in seasonal timing objectively about 30 sites were discarded from available usgs data since the seasonal fitting algorithm was not adequate to capture visual season boundaries to determine overall impacted flow and temperature signatures percent difference between the original and well impacted hydro and thermographs were calculated for each site timing signatures do not make sense as a percent difference so are reported as a difference in number of days we considered signatures to be generally impacted if the median percent difference is greater than 10 signatures are often impacted if the 25th 75th percentiles of percent different for the signature extend beyond 10 for timing signatures a difference of more than 5 days was considered significant no hydrograph showed a difference in timing for any period of larger than 2 days all median and interquartile impacts are shown in table c 3 appendix d stakeholder engagement maintaining stakeholder buy in is important for the success of a management strategy because water users are far more likely to agree to water rights reductions or water rights reductions if they are involved in the process of setting guidelines and deciding on implementation based on local knowledge baldwin et al 2012 there are many potential stakeholders for management decisions related to streamflow depletion including those who pump groundwater across the domestic industrial and municipal sectors institutions within these sectors such as groundwater management boards the communities in which these stakeholders are embedded and ngos such as environmental groups to name a few stakeholders have played an important role in building many existing groundwater management systems for example the advisory council for the michigan water withdrawal assessment process consisted of diverse stakeholders who collaborated to decide acceptable ecological thresholds and determined that decline past a 10 reduction in characteristic fish abundance would constitute a significant impact zorn et al 2012 in a similar working group process with stakeholders the rhode island sdm used a stream classification based on existing alteration to prioritize stream protections kendy et al 2012 there a board representing 68 organizations with varying interests formed a working group involved in setting limits the group agreed that a reduction of greater than 50 7q10 during the summer would cause a significant loss of fish and stream invertebrates to help meet the needs of water users they decided to allow more water withdrawal during non summer seasons when water resources are less strained giving water users security against limited water supply during the summer months additional examples where stakeholders were involved in setting ecological limits to streamflow depletion can be found in tables c 4 c 5 c 6 different projects have included a range of levels of stakeholder engagement higher levels of stakeholder engagement can be difficult to coordinate but the rewards can be great including diverse stakeholders can ensure that the management decisions represent the values of all interested parties emphasizing the inclusion both of water users and environmental groups most projects include stakeholders as advisors to the technical process to either set goals or agree on interpretation of results this role means that effective engagement with stakeholders relies on the ability of the technical team to adequately communicate findings for instance colorado produced a series of easily interpretable maps to guide discussions with stakeholders choosing appropriate aspects of the project for inclusion of stakeholders is important to maintain stakeholder interest limit the number of decision makers involved in certain decisions and ensure that stakeholder input is valuable 
3546,the stochastic simulation of deltas has always been one of the significant problems in the numerical simulation of reservoirs three problems of deltaic simulations are non stationary geological characteristics in training images tis insufficient quantity of tis in certain regions and unavailable reuse of training parameters and models even after the first training which have caused big challenges for the stochastic simulation of deltas especially in the circumstances of only heterogeneous tis are available and the simulation quantity is quite large as one of the important numerical methods for the simulation of deltas multiple point statistics mps obtains the statistical characteristics through the patterns in tis to perform simulation however due to the non stationarity of deltaic tis the traditional mps cannot extract the non stationary characteristics of tis smoothly and is incapable of reusing the extracted probability information making the simulation process quite time consuming if multiple simulations are performed successively thanks to the powerful feature extraction capability brought by deep learning the delta simulation possibly will be largely improved the generative adversarial network gan is an important deep learning method for image generation but it needs large quantity training samples and its training process is unstable but another famous neural network variational auto encoder vae is more stable on the other hand vae generated images are often a little blurred but gan generated images are clearer therefore based on vae gan and a multi stage idea a concurrent multi stage vae gan model is proposed for the stochastic simulation of deltas to hopefully address the three problems in deltaic simulation by concurrently performing multi stage simulation based on gan and vae the comparison of our method with some typical mps methods and deep learning methods has shown its good performance in deltaic simulation keywords stochastic simulation delta generative adversarial network training image concurrent 1 introduction deltas are the subaerial and submerged contiguous sediment mass deposited in a body of water oceans or lakes primarily by the action of a river and include secondary riverine derived deposits that have been reworked and molded by waves currents or tides moore and asquith 1971 wright 1985 delta sedimentation is closely related to the generation and accumulation of oil and natural gas resources qing et al 2021 for example the deltaic front channel mouth bar deltaic plain distributary channel bar and fluvial channel bar microfacies are important hydrocarbon accumulation sites therefore to accurately describe the spatial distribution of deltaic bodies has become a significant problem for the study of hydrological characteristics including river structures related to the oil and gas exploration and development in deltaic regions however the simulation or modeling methods of deltas for reservoir prediction have been challenged because of the unclear understanding of reservoirs and sand body distribution from multiple angles multiple point statistics mps has become a type of popular stochastic simulation methods in the reservoir modeling especially for stochastically simulating fluvial regions or deltas since strebelle 2002 proposed the single normal equation simulation snesim as a typical mps method then the filter based simulation filtersim based on dimensionality reduction by filters was used for continuous and discrete numerical simulation zhang et al 2006 which was also used for the simulation of deltas wu 2007 a location based snesim yin and feng 2017 was used to simulate a fan delta by splitting it into several parts with different features and then to combine these separate simulated parts together but the splitting of the image was performed by artificial image segmentation jika et al 2020 reconstructed the niger delta basin by using the sequence indicator simulation sisim a variogram based algorithm vba snesim and filtersim respectively clearly demonstrating that snesim and filtersim were both effective algorithms in facies modeling of deltas some other methods were also developed for the simulation of deltas or fluvial regions for example li et al 2016 proposed a graph cut gc method to stochastically simulate the intricate river deltas based on image segmentation and splicing any statistics including mps rely on a stationary assumption meaning all structures can only be conveyed through a statistical average without stationarity statistical information will not be successfully extracted in mps and other similar statistical methods for stochastic simulation the requirement of stationarity means retaining repeated patterns of the training image ti mps and other methods based on statistical assumption can only capture stationary patterns from a ti and transfer these patterns to simulated results however some real geological structures or patterns in tis e g deltaic tis are typically location dependent meaning non stationarity and heterogeneity of the tis wu 2007 zhang 2002 which has brought challenges for mps or other similar statistical methods besides the normally existing cpu intensive and time consuming problems when the scales of simulated deltas are relatively large and the internal structures are complex to address the highly non stationary issue of deltas two constraints are added in the simulation process local rotation angles and affinity ratios of the coordinates system zhang 2002 liu 2006 the former can control the local directions or angles of channels and the latter can control the channel widths in deltas although the angle and affinity data can be available from the analysis of well logging geological and seismic interpretation of deltas there can be a lot of uncertainty in the whole analysis process due to the possibly insufficient well and geological data besides for a complicated delta region a large number of ratios or coefficients for rotation and affinity transforms may need to be set which is a quite complicated process three problems in delta simulation are summarized below first for the non stationarity problem in the simulation of deltaic features or characteristics although the rotation and affinity transforms of mps methods can solve the problem to a certain extent the actual operation process is complicated and the accuracy is difficult to guarantee second in the process of simulating geological characteristics of deltas in relatively large regions the quantity of real tis is usually insufficient because the cost of obtaining tis in such large regions is high finally since the parameters cannot be reused in the traditional methods e g mps the simulation of deltas especially 3d simulation is quite time consuming when performing multiple simulation tasks at present deep learning is becoming one of the mainstream methods for pattern extraction and feature discrimination and has been used for the modeling of geological data bringing hope to solve the above problems as a branch of deep learning generative adversarial network gan goodfellow et al 2014 has been widely used in the reconstruction and simulation of geological images and reservoir modeling zhang et al 2019 proposed an elastic gan for generating geologically realistic facies models conditioned to 3d well data gao et al 2020 proposed a new reservoir modeling scheme of the meandering river delta based on conditional gan whose generator was designed using an autoencoder zhang et al 2021 used a u net gan framework to model conditioning geological facies song et al 2022 proposed improved gans for conditional facies simulation called gansim in a progressive growing way in which an extra condition based loss function was designed and the generator could take the conditioning data as inputs song et al 2021 used gansim to bridge the gap between geophysics and geology by generating realizations from the conditional information of real geological facies models conditioned to probability maps or with well observations and global features to solve the problem that original gan requires a large amount of training data for training single image gan singan shaham et al 2019 built a non conditional generative model learning multi stage features from a single image through which singan can improve the problem of insufficient samples of tis concurrent singan consingan hinz et al 2020 was proposed to shorten the training time based on singan by concurrently performing the multi stage simulation but the training time is still a big challenge when the simulation tasks are huge besides gan and its variants have the problem of training instability but vae is more stable in contrast vae generated images are often a little blurred but gan generated images are clearer so a proper combination of vae and gan may balance their strengths and weaknesses therefore based on vae gan and the multi stage idea a concurrent multi stage vae gan model is proposed in this paper for the stochastic simulation of deltas to hopefully circumvent the process of complicated parameter settings and handle the possible situation of insufficient tis thanks to the strong ability of extracting characteristics by the multi stage architecture in the vae gan model the non stationary characteristics can be learned from the coarse scales to fine scales without complicated adjustments of rotation angles and affinity ratios the proposed model only uses a single image as its ti so the problem of insufficient tis can be solved besides the efficiency of stochastic simulation of deltas can be largely improved by reusing the parameters and models once the first training is finished showing a great speed advantage over traditional methods in large quantity simulations 2 the main idea of our method 2 1 related work 2 1 1 introduction to ae vae gan and vae gan hinton and zemel 1993 proposed the first generation auto encoder ae with two parts an encoder and a decoder a real image is input into an ae through the encoder to obtain a latent vector lv equivalent to a dimensionality reduction operation representing the main features of the real image x and then lv is input to the decoder to obtain the generated image x that is hopefully close enough to x the structure of ae is shown in fig 1 a kingma and welling 2013 proposed vae based on ae mainly used for image generation what vae learns is no longer an individual image or sample but the distribution of the image or sample variational distribution between the input and output is especially focused in vae whose structure is shown in fig 1 b it is seen that vae s encoder outputs two vectors i e mean and lg var the former represents the mean of the input distribution and the latter represents the variance of the input distribution the latent vector lv is formulated as 1 lv ε l g v a r m e a n where the auxiliary parameter ε is obtained by sampling from the standard normal distribution n 0 1 gan goodfellow 2016 is an unsupervised learning framework inspired by the two person zero sum game theory learning the implicit probability distribution of data in a confrontational way and thus generating new data the structure of gan consists of the generator g and the discriminator d as shown in fig 1 c in which z represents random noises g z is the fake image generated by the noises through the generator g x represents a real image the generator g receives the randomly generated noises z and then generates a fake image g z the discriminator d receives the real image and the fake image g z and then estimates the probability that the input image is the real one through the continuous game between g and d the generator g constantly optimizes itself and tries to deceive the discriminator d as much as possible until d cannot distinguish the fake images from the input data the vae generated images are often vague or blurred due to the use of its own loss function vahdat and kautz 2020 but the training process of vae is stable in contrast the gan generated images are clear but gan has the problem of instability in training process larsen et al 2015 first proposed a vae gan model combining vae and gan to retain the strengths of these two types of network and avoid their weaknesses whose structure is shown in fig 1 d 2 1 2 introduction to singan since gan has a limited receptive field it is almost impossible to directly memorize the entire image or to capture the whole characteristics of the ti only through a single image because it is often difficult to obtain both the global information and local details from only an image by gan gan usually is trained based on a large number of training samples or images however if the available training data are insufficient then the model must be trained on the basis of limited images or even a single sample to address this issue singan shaham et al 2019 was proposed to achieve the statistical information of a single ti from the global structures to the local details through its multi stage pyramidal structure the original ti is scaled down to different stages to form a multi stage training sequence as shown in fig 2 in fig 2 n training stages from stage 1 to stage n are implemented to capture statistical information of the ti i e the image xn shown at stage n the ti is scaled down to some small images defined as x 1 at stage 1 x 2 at stage 2 and xn 1 at stage n 1 which are used as the input image at their corresponding stages x i and zi i 1 2 n respectively are the generated image and noise at stage i gi and di i 1 2 n respectively are the generator and discriminator at stage i it can be seen from fig 2 that singan is composed of a multi stage pyramidal network and the generated images are trained step by step from the coarsest stage stage 1 to the finest one stage n in stage 1 the generator g 1 receives the noise z 1 for training to generate the image x 1 then x 1 is upsampled to magnify its size to achieve x 1 that is input into the next stage i e stage 2 in stage 2 x 1 and the noise z 2 are both input into g 2 for training repeat the training process until stage n it is easily inferred that in a larger image the characteristics in a fixed receptive field can only represent the detailed information while in a smaller image the fixed receptive field can reflect much more general information of the image correspondingly at the lower stages the model mainly learns the overall layout information of the image but the focus is on learning the details of the image at the higher stages as mentioned previously deltaic regions have evident non stationarity and the training data of deltas in large regions are often insufficient due to the high acquisition costs aiming at these two problems the idea of multiple stages is a desirable solution since the sizes of deltaic tis in lower stages are much smaller than those in higher stages the receptive field is relatively small compared to the size of high stage tis as a result the overall non stationary features in the lower stages are much easier captured by a limited receptive field than those in the higher stages the lower stages focus on the overall information so the basic outline of non stationarity in tis can be effectively captured while the higher stages pay more attention to details rather than outlines since hence such design can alleviate the simulation difficulty raised by non stationarity in tis and create additional tis with different scales to make up for the insufficient number of tis 2 1 3 dilated convolution in general there are two methods to expand the receptive field by using standard convolution one is to perform down sampling on the feature image before convolution and the other is to directly expand the size of the convolution kernel the former lowers the image resolution and possibly loses useful information while the latter increases the burdens on hardware memory cpu gpu dilated convolution chen et al 2014 yu and koltun 2016 was first widely used in the field of image semantic segmentation to effectively solve the problems caused by the above phenomena expanding the convolution kernel by adding invalid nodes i e holes whereby the convolution kernel with certain invalid nodes holes and a small number of valid nodes can have the receptive field like a large sized kernel the setting of the holes is controlled by the expansion factor of dilation which represents the spacing between two adjacent nodes in a convolution kernel as shown in fig 3 a the distance of adjacent green squares in the standard kernel 3 3 is considered as 1 i e dilation 1 and the receptive field is 3 3 in fig 3 b an input image is scanned by the standard kernel to obtain an output image in fig 3 d the distance of a dilated kernel with 3 3 valid nodes shown as green squares is 2 i e dilation 2 so the dilated kernel has a larger receptive field 5 5 than that of the standard kernel when scanning the input image to achieve an output as shown in fig 3 c the number of valid nodes in fig 3 d remains unchanged compared to fig 3 a while the invalid nodes shown as white squares in fig 3 d increases which will not increase the burdens on hardware obviously but the features in a larger region can be captured by a larger sized kernel although the effect of the 3 3 dilated kernel i e dilation 2 is not as good as the 5 5 standard kernel in the actual situation of capturing features it can balance the size of the receptive field and hardware load 2 1 4 simplified rfb dilated kernel is used in the receptive field block rfb with multi layer structures to simulate the receptive field of human vision increasing the feature extraction capability of networks liu et al 2017 a structure of rfb is shown in fig 4 a in which there are three layers the first layer is composed of a standard kernel conv 1 1 of 1 1 and a standard kernel conv 1 2 of 3 3 the second one is composed of a standard kernel conv 2 1 3 3 valid nodes and a dilated kernel conv 2 2 3 3 valid nodes dilation 3 the third one is composed a standard kernel conv 3 1 5 5 valid nodes and a dilated kernel conv 3 2 3 3 valid nodes dilation 5 the operation concat is used to superimpose the output feature maps of the above three layers conv 4 1 1 valid node is used to reduce the dimensionality of the output from concat since concat triples the original channel by superimposing three layers inspired by rfb and dilated kernels a simplified rfb s rfb is designed to combine multiple kernels including standard kernels and dilated kernels hopefully integrating the benefits of both standard kernels and dilated kernels without largely increasing hardware burdens a structure of s rfb with three layers is shown in fig 4 b the first layer is a standard kernel conv 1 of 3 3 the second one is a dilated kernel conv 2 3 3 valid nodes dilation 2 the third one is composed of a standard kernel conv 3 1 3 3 valid nodes and a dilated kernel conv 3 2 3 3 valid nodes dilation 3 conv 4 is a standard kernel 3 3 valid nodes it is also seen that conv 1 is linked with conv 2 and conv 3 1 directly meaning the convolutional result by conv 1 will be input to the second and third layers the goal of such design is to further reduce the number of network parameters and accelerate the training of network while still remaining the simulation quality 2 2 the structure of our method according to singan shaham et al 2019 the multi stage training from low resolution to high resolution is very effective for the reconstruction based on a single ti but the training of each stage is separate a serious disadvantage is that network parameters at each stage need to be initialized randomly while the actual image features between adjacent stages are highly related and share high similarity so it can be inferred that the network parameters of adjacent stages are relatively closer compared to randomly initialized values hence the random initialization causes a lengthy training process in singan therefore in this paper we proposed a concurrent multi stage vae gan model in which the parameters trained in the previous stage are directly passed to the next stage to avoid random initialization i e the initial parameters of the i 1 th stage are the final parameters of its previous stage the i th stage it is concluded that the next stage is updated based on its previous stage so that the network converges faster in our method the structure of our network is shown in fig 5 fig 6 as shown in fig 5 the network consists of three types of convolution operations which are represented in different colors the green one is the convolutional input layer converting the input image into a multi channel image the yellow one represents the convolutional output layer converting the multi channel feature map into an image with the same format as the original one the red one is the s rfb introduced in section 2 1 4 which participates in feature extraction as the middle layer suppose the output of s rfb at stage 1 is x starting from stage 2 each stage has two adding operations shown as the first adding at each stage excluding stage 1 is to add the image feature upsampled from its previous stage and random noises that conform to the gaussian distribution as the input of current stage the noises are to increase some disturbances to the image feature and therefore enhance diversity then another s rfb is added to extract the features after the first adding whose result is f x through the second adding a result h x x f x can be achieved which has formed a short connection as in residual networks he et al 2016 since from stage 2 to stage n there is a short connection at each stage the whole structure of the generator has formed a residual network alleviating the problem of network degradation the whole network is divided into n stages for training and the number of training rounds in each stage is fixed in advance generators and discriminators are alternately trained to update parameters once the current training stage i 1 2 n 1 finishes its training stage i 1 will start training in which an s rfb is added to the generator but the structure of the discriminator remains unchanged in addition the training of two adjacent stages is executed concurrently at the beginning of stage i 1 the parameters of newly added s rfb and the discriminator are copied from stage i to avoid random initialization of parameters during the training of stage i 1 the parameters of stage i should also be updated with the whole training progress although such design can accelerate training through reusing parameters from the previous stage to its next stage it surely increases the possibility of limiting the variability of learned features e g riverbed deformation and erosion in deltaic simulation therefore a maximum concurrent stage number is set to balance the training speed and the above possibility the concurrent stage number for training is set to 2 in our method which means at most two adjacent stages are trained concurrently for example if there are altogether 3 stages in the training process then the parameters of stage 1 will be frozen and will not participate in the training of stages 2 and 3 while stage 2 will be trained together with stage 3 concurrently 2 3 the size of generated images at each stage since our model is built on a multi stage process and the whole simulation is progressive stage by stage the size of the generated image at each stage directly determines the simulation quality of the next stage therefore the different size of the generated image at each stage should be considered for the balance of training time and image quality suppose y i li wi i 1 n 1 in 2d simulation and y i li wi hi in 3d simulation where y i represents the size of the generated image at the i th stage li and wi are the elements of y i respectively meaning the length and width of the generated image at the i th stage hi is the height of the generated image at the i th stage only useful in 3d cases similarly suppose y t i l w in 2d simulation and y t i l w h in 3d simulation where y t i represents the size of the ti l and w are the length and width of the ti and h represents the height of the ti only useful in 3d cases suppose ln wn and hn only useful in 3d cases are respectively the length width and height of the final generated image at stage n which will be specified in advance the size of the generated image at each stage is defined as follows 2 y i y t i m n 1 l o g n log n i 1 i 1 n 1 for 2d simulation m is defined as m s min min l δ w δ 1 n 1 3 w h e r e δ m i n m a x l n w n max l w 1 for 3d simulation m is defined as m s min min l δ w δ h δ 1 n 1 4 w h e r e δ m i n max l n w n h n max l w h 1 where smin represents the minimum value among l 1 w 1 and h 1 meaning l 1 w 1 and h 1 should be specified in advance min and max are respectively the minimizing function and the maximizing function m and δ are the scaling factors note that the generated image x i and the input image xi at each stage have the same size in our method 2 4 the learning rate in the training process a too large learning rate in the lower stage will easily cause overfitting making the generated images extremely close to the ti but a small learning rate leads to the decrease of learning efficiency therefore the way of slowly increasing the learning rate is used in our method by setting a suitable scaling factor λ for the learning rate at stage i the learning rate αi at stage i is formulated as 5 α i α n λ n i where αn represents the learning rate at stage n which will be specified in advance the scaling factor λ is set as 0 1 in our paper 2 5 the loss function of our method in our method each generator gi is coupled with a discriminator di at stage i however since the encoder only exists in the first stage i 1 the loss function is defined as follows 6 l total min m a x g i d i l adv g i d i φ l sim g i l latent i 1 min m a x g i d i l adv g i d i φ l sim g i i 2 3 n where l adv g i d i represents the adversarial loss l sim g i represents the simulation loss φ is the weight of l sim g i and set as 10 by default l latent is a regularization term to make the latent vector lv always fit the gaussian distribution defined as 7 l latent 0 5 1 l g v a r mean 2 e l g v a r l adv is the adversarial loss

hand it also increases the risk of overfitting so some measures e g the addition of noises to enhance diversity and slowly increasing learning rates have been taken to lower this risk 2 6 the procedure of the proposed method step 1 input the ti of deltas initialize the training model and parameters set the maximum concurrent stage number numcon step 2 calculate the size of the generated images at each stage according to eq 2 step 3 train the model at the current stage and update parameters according to the loss function eq 6 step 4 perform the multi stage concurrent training and update parameters in each stage for each stage its next training stage starts only when the number of current concurrent stages is smaller than numcon repeatedly test whether the number of current concurrent stages is smaller than numcon if so start training the next stage if not the first stage in the training sequence stops step 5 if all the training stages end go to step 6 otherwise go to step 3 step 6 save the training model and output the simulated results of deltas 3 experimental results and discussions to verify the effectiveness of our method for 2d and 3d stochastic simulation of deltas the simulations by consingan singan snesim filtersim gc and our method were compared by the metrics of variogram running time proportions of facies etc the comparisons of six methods can be viewed as the traditional simulation methods snesim filtersim and gc versus deep learning methods consingan singan and our method 3 1 2d categorical simulation of a deltaic image a 2d categorical fan deltaic ti with the size of 250 250 pixels is shown in fig 7 in which the channel is much thicker in the upper left corner and gradually becomes thinner towards the low right corner displaying obvious non stationarity in the whole deltaic region this ti has only two categories 1 for channel and 0 for mudstone 3 1 1 simulated results of 2d categorical images to achieve average performance ten simulations respectively by our method consingan singan gc snesim and filtersim were implemented each row in fig 8 shows three results out of these ten results respectively simulated by these six methods it is seen that consingan singan and our method can generate similar results with the ti but the other three methods fail to reflect the characteristics of the ti in our method the maximum stage number n is 6 so the dimensions of the generated image at each stage are 25 25 33 33 45 45 72 72 158 158 and 250 250 respectively the initial learning rate at stage 6 namely α 6 is set to 0 0005 so the learning rate αi at stage i 1 2 5 can be respectively obtained according to eq 5 3 1 2 discussions about the 2d categorical simulated results a comparison of variogram variogram zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 shows the variability of spatial structure in a certain direction which is defined as 12 γ h 1 2 e z x h z x 2 where e stands for the mathematical expectation z x stands for the attribute value at the position x h is the lag distance between two positions and x h fig 9 is the variogram curves of the ti and the average variogram curves of ten simulated images generated by the above methods it is seen that the variograms of simulated image by our method are closer to those of the ti indicating that the simulation quality of our method is better than other methods to quantitatively measure the difference of variogram curves between the ti and the simulation of each method a difference degree dd is defined as follows 13 d d s i m h 1 n x h x h 2 where sim is the simulation method x h and x h are the variogram values of the ti and the simulated image when the lag distance is h a smaller dd means a smaller difference between the ti and the simulation dds between the ti and the simulations of our method consingan singan gc snesim and filtersim measured by variograms in the x and y directions are shown in table 1 in which the bold numbers are best compared to other statistics it seems that the simulated images by our method are closest to the ti b proportions of each facies in 2d simulations there are only two facies in the 2d ti mudstone and channel the average proportions of each facies calculated from the ten simulations are displayed in table 2 it seems that the proportions of simulation by our method are closest to those of the ti 3 2 2d continuous simulation of a deltaic image different from the categorical ti in section 3 1 a continuous 2d deltaic image called lena delta 250 250 pixels was used as the ti in the experiment as shown in fig 10 3 2 1 simulated results of 2d continuous images since snesim cannot be used for continuous simulation it is not used in continuous comparison to achieve average performance ten simulations respectively by our method consingan singan gc and filtersim were implemented three results out of these ten results are displayed in each row of fig 11 respectively simulated by these five methods it is seen that consingan and our method can generate similar results with the ti but the other methods fail to reflect the characteristics of the ti in our method the maximum stage number n is 5 so the dimensions of the generated image at each stage are 50 50 65 65 92 92 168 168 and 250 250 respectively the initial learning rate at stage 5 namely α 5 is set to 0 0005 3 2 2 discussions about the 2d continuous simulated results as shown in fig 12 the average normalized variograms calculated from ten simulations by each method are shown in the x and y directions it is seen that simulations by our method are closest to the ti in the x and y directions also the dds between the ti and the simulated results are calculated by variograms as shown in table 3 it is seen that the deltas simulated by our method are very close to ti 3 3 3d simulation of a fan deltaic image after the experiments on the 2d categorical and continuous tis the following test will focus on 3d simulation a categorical 3d deltaic ti red channel blue mudstone with the size of 110 160 39 voxels is shown in fig 13 which is a typical fan delta with the characteristics of non stationarity and heterogeneity 3 3 1 simulated results of 3d images ten 3d simulations respectively by our method consingan singan gc filtersim and snesim were implemented fig 14 shows the cross sections the first column x 1 y 160 z 1 the second column x 1 y 160 z 20 the third column x 1 y 160 z 39 of the ti and one result respectively simulated by these methods it is seen that only our method can generate similar results with the ti in our method the maximum stage number n is 5 so the dimensions of the generated image at each stage are 21 30 11 27 39 13 38 57 17 72 106 28 and 110 160 39 respectively the initial learning rate at stage 5 namely α 5 is set to 0 0005 3 3 2 discussions about the 3d simulated results a comparison of variogram the variogram curves of the ti and the average variogram curves calculated from ten simulations by each method are shown in the x y and z directions of fig 15 it is seen that the simulations by our method are closest to the ti in the x y and z directions the dds measured by variogram differences in the x y and z directions between the ti and the simulated results are calculated as shown in table 4 it is seen that the deltas simulated by our method are closest to ti b proportions of each facies in 3d simulations there are only two facies in the 3d ti mudstone and channel the average proportions of each facies calculated from the ten simulations and the ti are displayed in table 5 it seems that the proportions of our method are closest to those of the ti 3 4 discussions about running time and cpu gpu memory usage the experiments were performed using an amd r9 3900x cpu an nvidia geforce rtx 2080 gpu with 8g video memory and 16 gb memory the average cpu gpu memory usage and simulation times for ten 2d and 3d simulations by these 6 methods were recorded as shown in tables 6 8 the simulation time is divided into the time for the first simulation and the time for the other nine simulations because some methods require more training time during their first simulation the traditional simulation methods mostly cannot reuse the extracted statistical information from the first simulation so the same training process is repeatedly performed in each simulation resulting in nearly the equal simulation time for each simulation it can be seen from tables 6 8 that although our method consingan and singan cost much longer time in the first simulation once their first simulations are over the subsequent nine simulations can be quickly realized using the models and parameters saved from the first simulation which is also the advantage of such deep learning methods over the traditional simulation methods such as gc snesim and filtersim compared to consingan and singan our method has shown obvious speed advantage in the first simulation but in the subsequent nine simulations they are almost equally fast 3 5 discussions about some important parameters in our method 3 5 1 the size of the generated image at the first stage according to eq 3 or eq 4 the minimum size of the generated image is the one at the first stage i e l 1 w 1 in 2d cases or l 1 w 1 h 1 in 3d cases which should be specified in advance therefore in the multi stage training the size of the generated image at the first stage called min size is very important since it heavily affects the sizes of generated images at the following stages it is assumed that the scaling factor λ in eq 5 of the learning rate is 0 1 and the total number of stages is set to 6 the min size is set to 15 15 25 25 and 35 35 respectively to generate 2d categorical simulations as shown in fig 16 judging from fig 16 there are more disconnections and evident lower quality in the channel with the increase of min size so a smaller min size is helpful to improve the simulation quality 3 5 2 the number of training stages because our network is a multi stage training process the number of stages is also quite important for the simulation quality and simulation time suppose the number of stages i e n is set to 3 6 and 9 respectively for the experiments as shown in fig 17 each row displays three simulations of a 2d lena delta generally the higher the number of stages the better the image quality however too many stages easily increase the risk of overfitting for example when the number of stages is 9 the phenomena of local overfitting occur for convenience the ti is put under the simulations of n 9 see the white boxes and red ellipses in fig 17 the possible reason is that since there are too many stages in the whole network some features inherited from the previous stage are copied and strengthened multiple times so that the added noises at each stage are not strong enough to diversify the result resulting in local overfitting at the same time simulation time increases sharply with the increase of the total stage number which are 399 s n 3 710 s n 6 and 1600 s n 9 respectively 4 conclusion the modeling or simulation of deltas is meaningful for the development of natural gas and oil industry since understanding the structures of deltas is one of the preconditions to explore and develop reservoir resources in deltaic regions as mentioned previously the traditional methods suffer from the following three problems in deltaic simulation complicated coefficients setting due to the non stationarity in tis e g the rotation angels and affinity ratios in mps possibly insufficient deltaic tis and unavailable reuse of training information vae gan combining the advantages of vae and gan has a strong ability of extracting the features of deltaic training data a multi stage architecture can alleviate the problems of non stationarity since it can perform the whole simulation from low stage simulation to high stage simulation successfully capturing the overall information and local details at different stages meanwhile the multi stage design also generates more tis for simulation at different scales alleviating the problem of insufficient deltaic tis therefore a multi stage concurrent vae gan model is proposed for the stochastic simulation of deltas which can be used as an effective method for the prediction or simulation of deltaic reservoirs riverbed deformation and erosion in deltaic regions our method shows its strong advantages in delta simulations including 1 the concurrent training of adjacent stages increases the interaction between stages and the introduction of s rfb enhances the ability of feature learning both helpful to the generation quality and speed avoiding the complicated settings of transform coefficients like the rotation angels and affinity ratios 2 due to the multi stage training approach only one 2d or 3d ti is required and no other additional training data are required which is very suitable for the situation with few tis in deltaic simulation 3 our method can save and reuse the training model which is established in the first training so that subsequent simulations can be finished in a short time in the case of multiple simulations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china nos 41702148 and 41672114 appendix a main parameters of our method in the structure of our method there are mainly four types of structures including multiple s rfbs an encoder n generators and n discriminators for n stages note that s rfbs exist in the generators and discriminators some parameters and corresponding explanations about the above structures and layers are shown in tables 9 13 some functions are further explained below conv2d is a 2d convolution function using convolution kernels to scan the input of a layer and extract the characteristics of input data conv3d has the same function but is used for 3d simulation leakyrelu is the activation function that can alleviate vanishing gradient tanh is a saturated activation function with an s shaped curve which can transform the real valued input into the range 1 1 since the input of our method ranges from 1 to 1 tanh is used to map the output back to 1 to 1 batchnorm2d and batchnorm3d are the batch normalization functions to alleviate the difficulty of training neural networks and accelerate the learning process of the model respectively used in 2d and 3d simulation 
3546,the stochastic simulation of deltas has always been one of the significant problems in the numerical simulation of reservoirs three problems of deltaic simulations are non stationary geological characteristics in training images tis insufficient quantity of tis in certain regions and unavailable reuse of training parameters and models even after the first training which have caused big challenges for the stochastic simulation of deltas especially in the circumstances of only heterogeneous tis are available and the simulation quantity is quite large as one of the important numerical methods for the simulation of deltas multiple point statistics mps obtains the statistical characteristics through the patterns in tis to perform simulation however due to the non stationarity of deltaic tis the traditional mps cannot extract the non stationary characteristics of tis smoothly and is incapable of reusing the extracted probability information making the simulation process quite time consuming if multiple simulations are performed successively thanks to the powerful feature extraction capability brought by deep learning the delta simulation possibly will be largely improved the generative adversarial network gan is an important deep learning method for image generation but it needs large quantity training samples and its training process is unstable but another famous neural network variational auto encoder vae is more stable on the other hand vae generated images are often a little blurred but gan generated images are clearer therefore based on vae gan and a multi stage idea a concurrent multi stage vae gan model is proposed for the stochastic simulation of deltas to hopefully address the three problems in deltaic simulation by concurrently performing multi stage simulation based on gan and vae the comparison of our method with some typical mps methods and deep learning methods has shown its good performance in deltaic simulation keywords stochastic simulation delta generative adversarial network training image concurrent 1 introduction deltas are the subaerial and submerged contiguous sediment mass deposited in a body of water oceans or lakes primarily by the action of a river and include secondary riverine derived deposits that have been reworked and molded by waves currents or tides moore and asquith 1971 wright 1985 delta sedimentation is closely related to the generation and accumulation of oil and natural gas resources qing et al 2021 for example the deltaic front channel mouth bar deltaic plain distributary channel bar and fluvial channel bar microfacies are important hydrocarbon accumulation sites therefore to accurately describe the spatial distribution of deltaic bodies has become a significant problem for the study of hydrological characteristics including river structures related to the oil and gas exploration and development in deltaic regions however the simulation or modeling methods of deltas for reservoir prediction have been challenged because of the unclear understanding of reservoirs and sand body distribution from multiple angles multiple point statistics mps has become a type of popular stochastic simulation methods in the reservoir modeling especially for stochastically simulating fluvial regions or deltas since strebelle 2002 proposed the single normal equation simulation snesim as a typical mps method then the filter based simulation filtersim based on dimensionality reduction by filters was used for continuous and discrete numerical simulation zhang et al 2006 which was also used for the simulation of deltas wu 2007 a location based snesim yin and feng 2017 was used to simulate a fan delta by splitting it into several parts with different features and then to combine these separate simulated parts together but the splitting of the image was performed by artificial image segmentation jika et al 2020 reconstructed the niger delta basin by using the sequence indicator simulation sisim a variogram based algorithm vba snesim and filtersim respectively clearly demonstrating that snesim and filtersim were both effective algorithms in facies modeling of deltas some other methods were also developed for the simulation of deltas or fluvial regions for example li et al 2016 proposed a graph cut gc method to stochastically simulate the intricate river deltas based on image segmentation and splicing any statistics including mps rely on a stationary assumption meaning all structures can only be conveyed through a statistical average without stationarity statistical information will not be successfully extracted in mps and other similar statistical methods for stochastic simulation the requirement of stationarity means retaining repeated patterns of the training image ti mps and other methods based on statistical assumption can only capture stationary patterns from a ti and transfer these patterns to simulated results however some real geological structures or patterns in tis e g deltaic tis are typically location dependent meaning non stationarity and heterogeneity of the tis wu 2007 zhang 2002 which has brought challenges for mps or other similar statistical methods besides the normally existing cpu intensive and time consuming problems when the scales of simulated deltas are relatively large and the internal structures are complex to address the highly non stationary issue of deltas two constraints are added in the simulation process local rotation angles and affinity ratios of the coordinates system zhang 2002 liu 2006 the former can control the local directions or angles of channels and the latter can control the channel widths in deltas although the angle and affinity data can be available from the analysis of well logging geological and seismic interpretation of deltas there can be a lot of uncertainty in the whole analysis process due to the possibly insufficient well and geological data besides for a complicated delta region a large number of ratios or coefficients for rotation and affinity transforms may need to be set which is a quite complicated process three problems in delta simulation are summarized below first for the non stationarity problem in the simulation of deltaic features or characteristics although the rotation and affinity transforms of mps methods can solve the problem to a certain extent the actual operation process is complicated and the accuracy is difficult to guarantee second in the process of simulating geological characteristics of deltas in relatively large regions the quantity of real tis is usually insufficient because the cost of obtaining tis in such large regions is high finally since the parameters cannot be reused in the traditional methods e g mps the simulation of deltas especially 3d simulation is quite time consuming when performing multiple simulation tasks at present deep learning is becoming one of the mainstream methods for pattern extraction and feature discrimination and has been used for the modeling of geological data bringing hope to solve the above problems as a branch of deep learning generative adversarial network gan goodfellow et al 2014 has been widely used in the reconstruction and simulation of geological images and reservoir modeling zhang et al 2019 proposed an elastic gan for generating geologically realistic facies models conditioned to 3d well data gao et al 2020 proposed a new reservoir modeling scheme of the meandering river delta based on conditional gan whose generator was designed using an autoencoder zhang et al 2021 used a u net gan framework to model conditioning geological facies song et al 2022 proposed improved gans for conditional facies simulation called gansim in a progressive growing way in which an extra condition based loss function was designed and the generator could take the conditioning data as inputs song et al 2021 used gansim to bridge the gap between geophysics and geology by generating realizations from the conditional information of real geological facies models conditioned to probability maps or with well observations and global features to solve the problem that original gan requires a large amount of training data for training single image gan singan shaham et al 2019 built a non conditional generative model learning multi stage features from a single image through which singan can improve the problem of insufficient samples of tis concurrent singan consingan hinz et al 2020 was proposed to shorten the training time based on singan by concurrently performing the multi stage simulation but the training time is still a big challenge when the simulation tasks are huge besides gan and its variants have the problem of training instability but vae is more stable in contrast vae generated images are often a little blurred but gan generated images are clearer so a proper combination of vae and gan may balance their strengths and weaknesses therefore based on vae gan and the multi stage idea a concurrent multi stage vae gan model is proposed in this paper for the stochastic simulation of deltas to hopefully circumvent the process of complicated parameter settings and handle the possible situation of insufficient tis thanks to the strong ability of extracting characteristics by the multi stage architecture in the vae gan model the non stationary characteristics can be learned from the coarse scales to fine scales without complicated adjustments of rotation angles and affinity ratios the proposed model only uses a single image as its ti so the problem of insufficient tis can be solved besides the efficiency of stochastic simulation of deltas can be largely improved by reusing the parameters and models once the first training is finished showing a great speed advantage over traditional methods in large quantity simulations 2 the main idea of our method 2 1 related work 2 1 1 introduction to ae vae gan and vae gan hinton and zemel 1993 proposed the first generation auto encoder ae with two parts an encoder and a decoder a real image is input into an ae through the encoder to obtain a latent vector lv equivalent to a dimensionality reduction operation representing the main features of the real image x and then lv is input to the decoder to obtain the generated image x that is hopefully close enough to x the structure of ae is shown in fig 1 a kingma and welling 2013 proposed vae based on ae mainly used for image generation what vae learns is no longer an individual image or sample but the distribution of the image or sample variational distribution between the input and output is especially focused in vae whose structure is shown in fig 1 b it is seen that vae s encoder outputs two vectors i e mean and lg var the former represents the mean of the input distribution and the latter represents the variance of the input distribution the latent vector lv is formulated as 1 lv ε l g v a r m e a n where the auxiliary parameter ε is obtained by sampling from the standard normal distribution n 0 1 gan goodfellow 2016 is an unsupervised learning framework inspired by the two person zero sum game theory learning the implicit probability distribution of data in a confrontational way and thus generating new data the structure of gan consists of the generator g and the discriminator d as shown in fig 1 c in which z represents random noises g z is the fake image generated by the noises through the generator g x represents a real image the generator g receives the randomly generated noises z and then generates a fake image g z the discriminator d receives the real image and the fake image g z and then estimates the probability that the input image is the real one through the continuous game between g and d the generator g constantly optimizes itself and tries to deceive the discriminator d as much as possible until d cannot distinguish the fake images from the input data the vae generated images are often vague or blurred due to the use of its own loss function vahdat and kautz 2020 but the training process of vae is stable in contrast the gan generated images are clear but gan has the problem of instability in training process larsen et al 2015 first proposed a vae gan model combining vae and gan to retain the strengths of these two types of network and avoid their weaknesses whose structure is shown in fig 1 d 2 1 2 introduction to singan since gan has a limited receptive field it is almost impossible to directly memorize the entire image or to capture the whole characteristics of the ti only through a single image because it is often difficult to obtain both the global information and local details from only an image by gan gan usually is trained based on a large number of training samples or images however if the available training data are insufficient then the model must be trained on the basis of limited images or even a single sample to address this issue singan shaham et al 2019 was proposed to achieve the statistical information of a single ti from the global structures to the local details through its multi stage pyramidal structure the original ti is scaled down to different stages to form a multi stage training sequence as shown in fig 2 in fig 2 n training stages from stage 1 to stage n are implemented to capture statistical information of the ti i e the image xn shown at stage n the ti is scaled down to some small images defined as x 1 at stage 1 x 2 at stage 2 and xn 1 at stage n 1 which are used as the input image at their corresponding stages x i and zi i 1 2 n respectively are the generated image and noise at stage i gi and di i 1 2 n respectively are the generator and discriminator at stage i it can be seen from fig 2 that singan is composed of a multi stage pyramidal network and the generated images are trained step by step from the coarsest stage stage 1 to the finest one stage n in stage 1 the generator g 1 receives the noise z 1 for training to generate the image x 1 then x 1 is upsampled to magnify its size to achieve x 1 that is input into the next stage i e stage 2 in stage 2 x 1 and the noise z 2 are both input into g 2 for training repeat the training process until stage n it is easily inferred that in a larger image the characteristics in a fixed receptive field can only represent the detailed information while in a smaller image the fixed receptive field can reflect much more general information of the image correspondingly at the lower stages the model mainly learns the overall layout information of the image but the focus is on learning the details of the image at the higher stages as mentioned previously deltaic regions have evident non stationarity and the training data of deltas in large regions are often insufficient due to the high acquisition costs aiming at these two problems the idea of multiple stages is a desirable solution since the sizes of deltaic tis in lower stages are much smaller than those in higher stages the receptive field is relatively small compared to the size of high stage tis as a result the overall non stationary features in the lower stages are much easier captured by a limited receptive field than those in the higher stages the lower stages focus on the overall information so the basic outline of non stationarity in tis can be effectively captured while the higher stages pay more attention to details rather than outlines since hence such design can alleviate the simulation difficulty raised by non stationarity in tis and create additional tis with different scales to make up for the insufficient number of tis 2 1 3 dilated convolution in general there are two methods to expand the receptive field by using standard convolution one is to perform down sampling on the feature image before convolution and the other is to directly expand the size of the convolution kernel the former lowers the image resolution and possibly loses useful information while the latter increases the burdens on hardware memory cpu gpu dilated convolution chen et al 2014 yu and koltun 2016 was first widely used in the field of image semantic segmentation to effectively solve the problems caused by the above phenomena expanding the convolution kernel by adding invalid nodes i e holes whereby the convolution kernel with certain invalid nodes holes and a small number of valid nodes can have the receptive field like a large sized kernel the setting of the holes is controlled by the expansion factor of dilation which represents the spacing between two adjacent nodes in a convolution kernel as shown in fig 3 a the distance of adjacent green squares in the standard kernel 3 3 is considered as 1 i e dilation 1 and the receptive field is 3 3 in fig 3 b an input image is scanned by the standard kernel to obtain an output image in fig 3 d the distance of a dilated kernel with 3 3 valid nodes shown as green squares is 2 i e dilation 2 so the dilated kernel has a larger receptive field 5 5 than that of the standard kernel when scanning the input image to achieve an output as shown in fig 3 c the number of valid nodes in fig 3 d remains unchanged compared to fig 3 a while the invalid nodes shown as white squares in fig 3 d increases which will not increase the burdens on hardware obviously but the features in a larger region can be captured by a larger sized kernel although the effect of the 3 3 dilated kernel i e dilation 2 is not as good as the 5 5 standard kernel in the actual situation of capturing features it can balance the size of the receptive field and hardware load 2 1 4 simplified rfb dilated kernel is used in the receptive field block rfb with multi layer structures to simulate the receptive field of human vision increasing the feature extraction capability of networks liu et al 2017 a structure of rfb is shown in fig 4 a in which there are three layers the first layer is composed of a standard kernel conv 1 1 of 1 1 and a standard kernel conv 1 2 of 3 3 the second one is composed of a standard kernel conv 2 1 3 3 valid nodes and a dilated kernel conv 2 2 3 3 valid nodes dilation 3 the third one is composed a standard kernel conv 3 1 5 5 valid nodes and a dilated kernel conv 3 2 3 3 valid nodes dilation 5 the operation concat is used to superimpose the output feature maps of the above three layers conv 4 1 1 valid node is used to reduce the dimensionality of the output from concat since concat triples the original channel by superimposing three layers inspired by rfb and dilated kernels a simplified rfb s rfb is designed to combine multiple kernels including standard kernels and dilated kernels hopefully integrating the benefits of both standard kernels and dilated kernels without largely increasing hardware burdens a structure of s rfb with three layers is shown in fig 4 b the first layer is a standard kernel conv 1 of 3 3 the second one is a dilated kernel conv 2 3 3 valid nodes dilation 2 the third one is composed of a standard kernel conv 3 1 3 3 valid nodes and a dilated kernel conv 3 2 3 3 valid nodes dilation 3 conv 4 is a standard kernel 3 3 valid nodes it is also seen that conv 1 is linked with conv 2 and conv 3 1 directly meaning the convolutional result by conv 1 will be input to the second and third layers the goal of such design is to further reduce the number of network parameters and accelerate the training of network while still remaining the simulation quality 2 2 the structure of our method according to singan shaham et al 2019 the multi stage training from low resolution to high resolution is very effective for the reconstruction based on a single ti but the training of each stage is separate a serious disadvantage is that network parameters at each stage need to be initialized randomly while the actual image features between adjacent stages are highly related and share high similarity so it can be inferred that the network parameters of adjacent stages are relatively closer compared to randomly initialized values hence the random initialization causes a lengthy training process in singan therefore in this paper we proposed a concurrent multi stage vae gan model in which the parameters trained in the previous stage are directly passed to the next stage to avoid random initialization i e the initial parameters of the i 1 th stage are the final parameters of its previous stage the i th stage it is concluded that the next stage is updated based on its previous stage so that the network converges faster in our method the structure of our network is shown in fig 5 fig 6 as shown in fig 5 the network consists of three types of convolution operations which are represented in different colors the green one is the convolutional input layer converting the input image into a multi channel image the yellow one represents the convolutional output layer converting the multi channel feature map into an image with the same format as the original one the red one is the s rfb introduced in section 2 1 4 which participates in feature extraction as the middle layer suppose the output of s rfb at stage 1 is x starting from stage 2 each stage has two adding operations shown as the first adding at each stage excluding stage 1 is to add the image feature upsampled from its previous stage and random noises that conform to the gaussian distribution as the input of current stage the noises are to increase some disturbances to the image feature and therefore enhance diversity then another s rfb is added to extract the features after the first adding whose result is f x through the second adding a result h x x f x can be achieved which has formed a short connection as in residual networks he et al 2016 since from stage 2 to stage n there is a short connection at each stage the whole structure of the generator has formed a residual network alleviating the problem of network degradation the whole network is divided into n stages for training and the number of training rounds in each stage is fixed in advance generators and discriminators are alternately trained to update parameters once the current training stage i 1 2 n 1 finishes its training stage i 1 will start training in which an s rfb is added to the generator but the structure of the discriminator remains unchanged in addition the training of two adjacent stages is executed concurrently at the beginning of stage i 1 the parameters of newly added s rfb and the discriminator are copied from stage i to avoid random initialization of parameters during the training of stage i 1 the parameters of stage i should also be updated with the whole training progress although such design can accelerate training through reusing parameters from the previous stage to its next stage it surely increases the possibility of limiting the variability of learned features e g riverbed deformation and erosion in deltaic simulation therefore a maximum concurrent stage number is set to balance the training speed and the above possibility the concurrent stage number for training is set to 2 in our method which means at most two adjacent stages are trained concurrently for example if there are altogether 3 stages in the training process then the parameters of stage 1 will be frozen and will not participate in the training of stages 2 and 3 while stage 2 will be trained together with stage 3 concurrently 2 3 the size of generated images at each stage since our model is built on a multi stage process and the whole simulation is progressive stage by stage the size of the generated image at each stage directly determines the simulation quality of the next stage therefore the different size of the generated image at each stage should be considered for the balance of training time and image quality suppose y i li wi i 1 n 1 in 2d simulation and y i li wi hi in 3d simulation where y i represents the size of the generated image at the i th stage li and wi are the elements of y i respectively meaning the length and width of the generated image at the i th stage hi is the height of the generated image at the i th stage only useful in 3d cases similarly suppose y t i l w in 2d simulation and y t i l w h in 3d simulation where y t i represents the size of the ti l and w are the length and width of the ti and h represents the height of the ti only useful in 3d cases suppose ln wn and hn only useful in 3d cases are respectively the length width and height of the final generated image at stage n which will be specified in advance the size of the generated image at each stage is defined as follows 2 y i y t i m n 1 l o g n log n i 1 i 1 n 1 for 2d simulation m is defined as m s min min l δ w δ 1 n 1 3 w h e r e δ m i n m a x l n w n max l w 1 for 3d simulation m is defined as m s min min l δ w δ h δ 1 n 1 4 w h e r e δ m i n max l n w n h n max l w h 1 where smin represents the minimum value among l 1 w 1 and h 1 meaning l 1 w 1 and h 1 should be specified in advance min and max are respectively the minimizing function and the maximizing function m and δ are the scaling factors note that the generated image x i and the input image xi at each stage have the same size in our method 2 4 the learning rate in the training process a too large learning rate in the lower stage will easily cause overfitting making the generated images extremely close to the ti but a small learning rate leads to the decrease of learning efficiency therefore the way of slowly increasing the learning rate is used in our method by setting a suitable scaling factor λ for the learning rate at stage i the learning rate αi at stage i is formulated as 5 α i α n λ n i where αn represents the learning rate at stage n which will be specified in advance the scaling factor λ is set as 0 1 in our paper 2 5 the loss function of our method in our method each generator gi is coupled with a discriminator di at stage i however since the encoder only exists in the first stage i 1 the loss function is defined as follows 6 l total min m a x g i d i l adv g i d i φ l sim g i l latent i 1 min m a x g i d i l adv g i d i φ l sim g i i 2 3 n where l adv g i d i represents the adversarial loss l sim g i represents the simulation loss φ is the weight of l sim g i and set as 10 by default l latent is a regularization term to make the latent vector lv always fit the gaussian distribution defined as 7 l latent 0 5 1 l g v a r mean 2 e l g v a r l adv is the adversarial loss defined in wgan gp gulrajani et al 2017 which is 8 l adv g i d i e x i p g d x i e x i p real d x i α l gp 9 l gp e x p x x d x 2 1 2 10 x i g z i i 1 g z i x i 1 i 2 3 n where xi is the input image at stage i x i 1 represents the upsampling from stage i 1 x i is the fake image generated by the generator g l gp is an additional gradient penalty x p x means sampling uniformly along straight lines between pairs of points sampled from the distribution of the real data p real and the generator distribution p g gulrajani et al 2017 is the notation for calculating gradient α is the weight of l gp and set to 1 in this paper besides the simulation loss is added as a constraint in eq 6 which is 11 l sim g x i x i 2 2 eq 11 on the one hand can improve the accuracy of simulation but on the other hand it also increases the risk of overfitting so some measures e g the addition of noises to enhance diversity and slowly increasing learning rates have been taken to lower this risk 2 6 the procedure of the proposed method step 1 input the ti of deltas initialize the training model and parameters set the maximum concurrent stage number numcon step 2 calculate the size of the generated images at each stage according to eq 2 step 3 train the model at the current stage and update parameters according to the loss function eq 6 step 4 perform the multi stage concurrent training and update parameters in each stage for each stage its next training stage starts only when the number of current concurrent stages is smaller than numcon repeatedly test whether the number of current concurrent stages is smaller than numcon if so start training the next stage if not the first stage in the training sequence stops step 5 if all the training stages end go to step 6 otherwise go to step 3 step 6 save the training model and output the simulated results of deltas 3 experimental results and discussions to verify the effectiveness of our method for 2d and 3d stochastic simulation of deltas the simulations by consingan singan snesim filtersim gc and our method were compared by the metrics of variogram running time proportions of facies etc the comparisons of six methods can be viewed as the traditional simulation methods snesim filtersim and gc versus deep learning methods consingan singan and our method 3 1 2d categorical simulation of a deltaic image a 2d categorical fan deltaic ti with the size of 250 250 pixels is shown in fig 7 in which the channel is much thicker in the upper left corner and gradually becomes thinner towards the low right corner displaying obvious non stationarity in the whole deltaic region this ti has only two categories 1 for channel and 0 for mudstone 3 1 1 simulated results of 2d categorical images to achieve average performance ten simulations respectively by our method consingan singan gc snesim and filtersim were implemented each row in fig 8 shows three results out of these ten results respectively simulated by these six methods it is seen that consingan singan and our method can generate similar results with the ti but the other three methods fail to reflect the characteristics of the ti in our method the maximum stage number n is 6 so the dimensions of the generated image at each stage are 25 25 33 33 45 45 72 72 158 158 and 250 250 respectively the initial learning rate at stage 6 namely α 6 is set to 0 0005 so the learning rate αi at stage i 1 2 5 can be respectively obtained according to eq 5 3 1 2 discussions about the 2d categorical simulated results a comparison of variogram variogram zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 shows the variability of spatial structure in a certain direction which is defined as 12 γ h 1 2 e z x h z x 2 where e stands for the mathematical expectation z x stands for the attribute value at the position x h is the lag distance between two positions and x h fig 9 is the variogram curves of the ti and the average variogram curves of ten simulated images generated by the above methods it is seen that the variograms of simulated image by our method are closer to those of the ti indicating that the simulation quality of our method is better than other methods to quantitatively measure the difference of variogram curves between the ti and the simulation of each method a difference degree dd is defined as follows 13 d d s i m h 1 n x h x h 2 where sim is the simulation method x h and x h are the variogram values of the ti and the simulated image when the lag distance is h a smaller dd means a smaller difference between the ti and the simulation dds between the ti and the simulations of our method consingan singan gc snesim and filtersim measured by variograms in the x and y directions are shown in table 1 in which the bold numbers are best compared to other statistics it seems that the simulated images by our method are closest to the ti b proportions of each facies in 2d simulations there are only two facies in the 2d ti mudstone and channel the average proportions of each facies calculated from the ten simulations are displayed in table 2 it seems that the proportions of simulation by our method are closest to those of the ti 3 2 2d continuous simulation of a deltaic image different from the categorical ti in section 3 1 a continuous 2d deltaic image called lena delta 250 250 pixels was used as the ti in the experiment as shown in fig 10 3 2 1 simulated results of 2d continuous images since snesim cannot be used for continuous simulation it is not used in continuous comparison to achieve average performance ten simulations respectively by our method consingan singan gc and filtersim were implemented three results out of these ten results are displayed in each row of fig 11 respectively simulated by these five methods it is seen that consingan and our method can generate similar results with the ti but the other methods fail to reflect the characteristics of the ti in our method the maximum stage number n is 5 so the dimensions of the generated image at each stage are 50 50 65 65 92 92 168 168 and 250 250 respectively the initial learning rate at stage 5 namely α 5 is set to 0 0005 3 2 2 discussions about the 2d continuous simulated results as shown in fig 12 the average normalized variograms calculated from ten simulations by each method are shown in the x and y directions it is seen that simulations by our method are closest to the ti in the x and y directions also the dds between the ti and the simulated results are calculated by variograms as shown in table 3 it is seen that the deltas simulated by our method are very close to ti 3 3 3d simulation of a fan deltaic image after the experiments on the 2d categorical and continuous tis the following test will focus on 3d simulation a categorical 3d deltaic ti red channel blue mudstone with the size of 110 160 39 voxels is shown in fig 13 which is a typical fan delta with the characteristics of non stationarity and heterogeneity 3 3 1 simulated results of 3d images ten 3d simulations respectively by our method consingan singan gc filtersim and snesim were implemented fig 14 shows the cross sections the first column x 1 y 160 z 1 the second column x 1 y 160 z 20 the third column x 1 y 160 z 39 of the ti and one result respectively simulated by these methods it is seen that only our method can generate similar results with the ti in our method the maximum stage number n is 5 so the dimensions of the generated image at each stage are 21 30 11 27 39 13 38 57 17 72 106 28 and 110 160 39 respectively the initial learning rate at stage 5 namely α 5 is set to 0 0005 3 3 2 discussions about the 3d simulated results a comparison of variogram the variogram curves of the ti and the average variogram curves calculated from ten simulations by each method are shown in the x y and z directions of fig 15 it is seen that the simulations by our method are closest to the ti in the x y and z directions the dds measured by variogram differences in the x y and z directions between the ti and the simulated results are calculated as shown in table 4 it is seen that the deltas simulated by our method are closest to ti b proportions of each facies in 3d simulations there are only two facies in the 3d ti mudstone and channel the average proportions of each facies calculated from the ten simulations and the ti are displayed in table 5 it seems that the proportions of our method are closest to those of the ti 3 4 discussions about running time and cpu gpu memory usage the experiments were performed using an amd r9 3900x cpu an nvidia geforce rtx 2080 gpu with 8g video memory and 16 gb memory the average cpu gpu memory usage and simulation times for ten 2d and 3d simulations by these 6 methods were recorded as shown in tables 6 8 the simulation time is divided into the time for the first simulation and the time for the other nine simulations because some methods require more training time during their first simulation the traditional simulation methods mostly cannot reuse the extracted statistical information from the first simulation so the same training process is repeatedly performed in each simulation resulting in nearly the equal simulation time for each simulation it can be seen from tables 6 8 that although our method consingan and singan cost much longer time in the first simulation once their first simulations are over the subsequent nine simulations can be quickly realized using the models and parameters saved from the first simulation which is also the advantage of such deep learning methods over the traditional simulation methods such as gc snesim and filtersim compared to consingan and singan our method has shown obvious speed advantage in the first simulation but in the subsequent nine simulations they are almost equally fast 3 5 discussions about some important parameters in our method 3 5 1 the size of the generated image at the first stage according to eq 3 or eq 4 the minimum size of the generated image is the one at the first stage i e l 1 w 1 in 2d cases or l 1 w 1 h 1 in 3d cases which should be specified in advance therefore in the multi stage training the size of the generated image at the first stage called min size is very important since it heavily affects the sizes of generated images at the following stages it is assumed that the scaling factor λ in eq 5 of the learning rate is 0 1 and the total number of stages is set to 6 the min size is set to 15 15 25 25 and 35 35 respectively to generate 2d categorical simulations as shown in fig 16 judging from fig 16 there are more disconnections and evident lower quality in the channel with the increase of min size so a smaller min size is helpful to improve the simulation quality 3 5 2 the number of training stages because our network is a multi stage training process the number of stages is also quite important for the simulation quality and simulation time suppose the number of stages i e n is set to 3 6 and 9 respectively for the experiments as shown in fig 17 each row displays three simulations of a 2d lena delta generally the higher the number of stages the better the image quality however too many stages easily increase the risk of overfitting for example when the number of stages is 9 the phenomena of local overfitting occur for convenience the ti is put under the simulations of n 9 see the white boxes and red ellipses in fig 17 the possible reason is that since there are too many stages in the whole network some features inherited from the previous stage are copied and strengthened multiple times so that the added noises at each stage are not strong enough to diversify the result resulting in local overfitting at the same time simulation time increases sharply with the increase of the total stage number which are 399 s n 3 710 s n 6 and 1600 s n 9 respectively 4 conclusion the modeling or simulation of deltas is meaningful for the development of natural gas and oil industry since understanding the structures of deltas is one of the preconditions to explore and develop reservoir resources in deltaic regions as mentioned previously the traditional methods suffer from the following three problems in deltaic simulation complicated coefficients setting due to the non stationarity in tis e g the rotation angels and affinity ratios in mps possibly insufficient deltaic tis and unavailable reuse of training information vae gan combining the advantages of vae and gan has a strong ability of extracting the features of deltaic training data a multi stage architecture can alleviate the problems of non stationarity since it can perform the whole simulation from low stage simulation to high stage simulation successfully capturing the overall information and local details at different stages meanwhile the multi stage design also generates more tis for simulation at different scales alleviating the problem of insufficient deltaic tis therefore a multi stage concurrent vae gan model is proposed for the stochastic simulation of deltas which can be used as an effective method for the prediction or simulation of deltaic reservoirs riverbed deformation and erosion in deltaic regions our method shows its strong advantages in delta simulations including 1 the concurrent training of adjacent stages increases the interaction between stages and the introduction of s rfb enhances the ability of feature learning both helpful to the generation quality and speed avoiding the complicated settings of transform coefficients like the rotation angels and affinity ratios 2 due to the multi stage training approach only one 2d or 3d ti is required and no other additional training data are required which is very suitable for the situation with few tis in deltaic simulation 3 our method can save and reuse the training model which is established in the first training so that subsequent simulations can be finished in a short time in the case of multiple simulations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china nos 41702148 and 41672114 appendix a main parameters of our method in the structure of our method there are mainly four types of structures including multiple s rfbs an encoder n generators and n discriminators for n stages note that s rfbs exist in the generators and discriminators some parameters and corresponding explanations about the above structures and layers are shown in tables 9 13 some functions are further explained below

3547,the correlation between physical and chemical weathering in mountainous rivers is debatable a reliable geochemical tracer for physical erosion and chemical weathering is necessary to obtain crucial information on the relationship between weathering processes and environmental changes on the earth s surface small mountainous rivers smrs of taiwan are characterized by extremely high physical and chemical weathering and therefore they provide the foremost natural laboratory for studying weathering processes in tectonically active high standing islands in this study water samples collected from the kaoping river the largest river catchment in southern taiwan were analyzed for elemental concentrations as well as for u and li isotopes to understand the weathering processes and to evaluate the use of the 234u 238u activity ratio hereafter 234u 238u as a probe for weathering the average 234u 238u of the kaoping river is significantly higher than that of other rivers worldwide and variations in 234u 238u reflect the degree of physical and chemical weathering the weathering environment corresponds to the weathering limited regime and the mountain area is a natural example of the kinetic limited control on chemical weathering by intense physical erosion high physical erosion predominates in the mountainous region which increases 234u 238u relatively reduces u concentrations and inhibits chemical weathering the decreased 234u 238u and increased na li and δ7li downstream clearly indicate enhanced chemical weathering in the alluvial plain our results demonstrate that dissolved 234u 238u in the smrs of taiwan can reflect the relative contributions of physical and chemical weathering within the river catchment the coupling between chemical weathering and physical erosion can be observed downstream and the relationship becomes less pertinent in the mountain area due to changes in weathering kinetics a positive correlation between 234u 238u and uplift rate in the kaoping river suggests that the riverine 234u 238u is mainly controlled by uplift induced physical erosion which may be influenced by landslide activities in the rapidly eroding mountainous river of taiwan keywords uranium isotopes physical erosion lithium isotopes chemical weathering weathering limited kaoping river 1 introduction rivers are the principal transport pathways for eroded material from continental landmasses to oceans as such they are worthy of research for constraining erosion processes by using geochemical tracers gaillardet et al 1997 vigier et al 2001 tectonic activities influence landscape evolution through relief variation and physical and chemical weathering processes dixon et al 2012 physical denudation and chemical weathering are the predominant mechanisms responsible for the destruction of the continental crust and the cycling of weathered products dosseto et al 2006 gaillardet et al 1997 lee et al 2013 vigier et al 2001 physical denudation directly modifies the surface morphology of the crust and increases the ratio of particle surface area to grain size which can promote chemical reactions physical weathering which is typically associated with the breaking and formation of cracks in minerals and rocks accelerates related geological disintegration processes chemical weathering processes remove various soluble elements from the rock and soil into the surrounding aqueous solution continental chemical weathering through atmospheric carbon dioxide consumption is a crucial moderator of the long term global carbon cycle and is instrumental in regulating global climate change berner et al 1983 walker et al 1981 west et al 2005 both physical and chemical weathering play essential roles in landscape evolution elemental cycling and global climate variation whether chemical weathering rates increase proportionally with physical erosion rates is still debated gaillardet et al 1999 collected data from large rivers worldwide and observed a positive correlation between chemical and physical weathering rates however the modeling relationship between chemical weathering and physical denudation has demonstrated nonlinear correlations dixon et al 2012 ferrier and kirchner 2008 gabet and mudd 2009 west et al 2005 larsen et al 2014 reported that soil chemical weathering increases linearly as physical denudation rises in the western southern alps of new zealand the relationship between physical and chemical weathering is unclear furthermore natural factors such as regional climate tectonics and lithology that control physical and chemical erosion are not completely understood bricker et al 1994 lee et al 2013 vigier et al 2001 west et al 2002 uranium isotopes are considered powerful tools for studying weathering processes because the application of u isotopes on continental weathering avoids interference from source variations occurs all pristine rocks older than 1 ma and without suffering weathering can be assumed to reach a secular equilibrium state 234u 238u 1 depaolo et al 2006 vigier and bourdon 2011 this assumption has been checked from borehole samples in many cases including carbonates bourdon et al 2009 granites noseck et al 2008 and clays pękala et al 2009 which result that for a number of lithologies the assumption of initial secular equilibrium for bulk rocks can be valid vigier and bourdon 2011 this provides a strong constraint that riverine 234u 238u is independent of source rock composition riverine u isotopes have been used to study weathering processes and source mixing in different river systems pogge von strandmann et al 2006 2010 riotte and chabaux 1999 vigier et al 2006 in addition to climate proxy robinson et al 2004b and references therein several researchers have applied u and strontium sr isotopes to trace water sources in river catchments ryu et al 2009 wang and you 2013a u and lithium li isotope systems have been used to investigate the relationship between physical and chemical weathering pogge von strandmann et al 2006 2010 the fractionation of u isotopes is a direct result of physical processes due to the α recoil effect preferential 234u removal from recoil damaged crystal lattice sites in bedrock and soil occurs during water rock interactions or directly ejects 234th 234th subsequently fast decays to 234u into surrounding liquids if the distance to the grain boundary is smaller than the recoil range of 234th 30 nm andersen et al 2009 depaolo et al 2006 dosseto et al 2008 thus water samples commonly exhibit a feature of 234u excesses physical weathering can reduce grain size and expose more fresh particle surface promoting the preferential transfer of 234u into the dissolved phase thus dissolved 234u 238u greater than one is observed in continental surface waters dosseto et al 2008 kigoshi 1971 vigier and bourdon 2011 by contrast congruent chemical weathering tends to lower 234u 238u through rock dissolution 234u 238u 1 pogge von strandmann et al 2010 lee et al 2013 different weathering environments weathering limited or transport limited conditions affect variations in river water chemistry within a catchment area stallard and edmond 1983 stallard et al 1991 in weathering limited regions the weathered material is removed rapidly after production through physical erosion resulting in thin soil development short residence time of weathered material low degree of material weathering and incomplete water solid interaction landslides rockfalls steep slope and other factors that tend to maintain a fresh or slightly weathered rock surface are characteristics of weathering limited areas by contrast the weathering rate exceeds the capacity of the transport process in a transport limited area producing a region characterized by thick soil layers and flat slopes in such areas the residence time of weathered material is relatively long the detritus is highly chemically weathered and a weathering equilibrium results between water and solids pogge von strandmann et al 2010 stallard and edmond 1983 stallard et al 1991 west et al 2005 riverine u isotopes have been applied to study weathering processes under different weathering regimes in transport limited regimes such as the deccan basin high uranium concentration u 0 79 nm and low 234u 238u 1 22 have been reported because of its strong chemical weathering and rock dissolution pogge von strandmann et al 2010 vigier et al 2005 conversely high riverine 234u 238u 1 60 observed in iceland is attributed to physical weathering and glacial extension under extreme weathering limited conditions pogge von strandmann et al 2006 therefore riverine 234u 238u is considered to reflect the balance between physical and chemical weathering pogge von strandmann et al 2006 vigier et al 2006 the intense physical and chemical weathering in taiwan are chiefly due to arc continent collision combined effects of high uplift rate 2 10 mm yr liu and yu 1990 subtropical climatic conditions and monsoon rainfall the high annual precipitation level of 250 cm yr together with typhoon events and frequent earthquakes produces significant physical denudation and chemical weathering throughout the island chung et al 2009 dadson et al 2003 hartshorn et al 2002 li et al 1997 you et al 1988 the ranges of denudation rate estimated from sediment 10be are 0 2 10 mm yr and 0 2 8 8 mm yr for the western and eastern rivers respectively in taiwan derrieux et al 2014 fellin et al 2017 the mean physical denudation rate of taiwan s rivers 13 kg m2 yr is much higher than that of large rivers worldwide such as the yellow river 2 9 kg m2 yr furthermore the chemical weathering rate is higher in taiwanese rivers 0 15 1 14 kg m2 yr compared with that for the asian continent 0 03 kg m2 yr lee et al 2020b li 1976 hung et al 2020 further geochemical studies are necessary to examine physical and chemical weathering in small mountainous rivers smrs which contribute a disproportionate amount of eroded materials to the ocean dadson et al 2003 milliman and farnsworth 2011 this is the first study on weathering processes that used dissolved 234u 238u at the catchment scale in subtropical smrs in taiwan measurements of river water can reveal an integrated weathering signal of large spatial scales that a river flows through in this study seasonal water samples were collected from the kaoping river in southwestern taiwan analyses of major ions trace elements and u isotopic compositions were performed on the samples dissolved li isotopes are generated for the selected water samples to better constrain the intensity of silicate weathering in the kaoping river catchment the main aims of this study were 1 to gain a thorough understanding of elemental distributions and 234u 238u in mountainous river waters of taiwan 2 to examine u isotope variations in a rapidly eroding river catchment and to clarify the linkages of the u isotopic compositions with physical and chemical weathering processes and 3 to assess the potential of 234u 238u in dissolved loads as a weathering tracer in mountain river catchments of an active orogenic belt 2 study area the kaoping river is the largest watershed in southwestern taiwan with a basin area of 3257 km2 and length of 171 km it flows along the steep terrain from the jade

the annual temperature range is 18 c 29 c the mean annual precipitation is approximately 3000 mm and it is characterized by distinctly hydrological seasons wet may to october and dry november to april a high discharge rate occurs during the wet season because of monsoon and typhoons which accounts for 90 of the annual rainfall wang et al 2009 the erosion rate reaches 60 mm yr in the southern

method reported by wang and you 2013b u isotopes were measured via multi collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry mc icp ms thermo fisher scientific neptune the standard sample bracketing ssb approach was employed for correcting mass fractionation during measurements with a precisely calibrated in house u standard solution by crm u005 as the bracketing standard the correction of the tailing effect followed a detailed process described by hiess et al 2012 the long term analytical precision of 234u 238u was obtained from the measurements of the in house u standard and the international seawater standard iapso with the mean 234u 238u values of the u standard solution and iapso being 0 970 0 002 2σ n 35 and 1 144 0 004 2σ n 9 respectively the measured 234u 238u of iapso is consistent with the published value of 1 143 0 004 li et al 2018 and open ocean seawater of 1 147 robinson et al 2004a the estimated total procedural blank was 2 pg u 0 01 u loaded and potential memory effects were negligible a detailed description of u isotope measurement by using mc icp ms is available in wang and you 2013b repeated measurements of the mkp04 involving completely separate processing and analysis of different aliquots yielded the 234u 238u of 1 668 and 1 673 average 1 670 table 1 li purification was conducted using ag 50 w x8 resin 200 400 mesh and the li isotopic ratio was measured using a mc icp ms neptune thermo fisher scientific equipped with an apex ir esi desolvating system through the ssb technique the column chemistry and analytical protocol for li were adapted from huang et al 2010 the resulting 7li 6li ratio can be expressed as δ7li which represents the per mil deviation from the nist l svec standard the external precision of δ7li was 0 12 2σ based on repeated measurements on a series of international reference materials irms including irmm 016 iapso and l svec the measured δ7li of irmm 016 iapso and l svec were 0 05 0 12 n 36 30 88 0 12 n 10 and 0 00 0 12 n 46 respectively all the measured δ7li values of these irms were in excellent agreement with the published results jeffcoate et al 2004 millot et al 2004 because water samples in this study were not sufficient to measure δ7li in duplicate we used samples collected at ln01 in august 2016 and at stations of mkp01 and mkp04 in august 2017 for conducting sample reproducibility repeated measurements of ln01 mkp01 and mkp04 revealed δ7li values of 15 2 0 21 2σ n 3 17 2 0 17 2σ n 3 and 18 3 0 22 2σ n 3 respectively 4 results the concentrations of major and trace elements na ca mg k li u cl and so4 in kaoping river water samples as well as u and li isotope data are summarized in table 1 4 1 major ion concentrations the highest concentrations of cations and anions were recorded in mkp04 table 1 with the exception of mkp04 the average cation concentrations followed the sequence of ca na mg k table 1 ca was the most abundant cation in both dry and wet seasons constituting 32 72 of the total riverine cations the concentrations of ca mg and k were higher in the dry seasons than in the wet seasons except for na which showed similar concentration levels in both seasons the highest mean concentrations for ca na mg and k were observed in december 2009 and january 2010 bicarbonate hco3 concentration ranged between 1 72 and 4 27 mm which represented 36 82 of the total dissolved anions table 1 hco3 was higher in samples collected in december 2009 and january 2010 than in those collected in february 2006 and august 2006 so4 and cl ranges were 0 60 1 81 mm and 0 03 0 57 mm respectively table 1 the average cl concentration was relatively high in august 2006 the total dissolved solids tds were in the range of 240 568 mg l with an average of 395 mg l excluding mkp04 the river waters in december 2009 and january 2010 exhibited the highest mean tds table 1 4 2 u concentrations and u isotopes dissolved u concentration u ranges of samples collected in february 2006 august 2006 and december 2009 and january 2010 were 0 25 4 54 0 19 2 01 and 0 62 2 05 nm respectively table 1 low u was detected at upstream stations with levels increasing downstream to lower catchment fig 2 a the highest u of the three sampling sessions were recorded at mkp04 influenced by seawater except in mkp04 the average u was slightly higher in february 2006 0 79 nm than in august 2006 and january 2010 0 55 nm and 0 48 nm respectively dissolved 234u 238u in the kaoping river was higher upstream and decreased toward the estuary fig 2b with ranges of 1 145 3 572 in february 2006 1 143 3 535 in august 2006 and 1 670 3 318 in december 2009 and january 2010 table 1 mkp04 exhibited the lowest 234u 238u similar to seawater 1 147 andersen et al 2007 robinson et al 2004a furthermore the water samples from the kaoping river catchment have distinctly higher 234u 238u than the seawater 4 3 li concentrations and li isotopes dissolved li concentration ranges were 0 91 18 2 0 90 14 6 and 0 30 2 10 μm in february 2006 august 2006 and december 2009 and january 2010 respectively table 1 during 2006 the highest li concentrations in both wet and dry seasons were recorded at ln t02 on the baolai river possibly related to local hydrothermal inputs this phenomenon was not detected after the typhoon event in 2010 δ7li data were available only for february 2006 specimens varying from 8 21 to 20 30 mkp04 was found to be influenced by seawater with δ7li of 30 00 5 discussion 5 1 major ion distribution of the kaoping river chemistry mkp04 at the shuang yuan bridge close to estuary clearly reveals a mixture of freshwater and seawater the samples had higher major cations and anions than other river waters with a mean na cl ratio of 0 64 which is close to that of seawater 0 86 mkp04 was therefore excluded from the calculation of average chemical compositions of the river waters the chemistry of river water is typically derived from weathering processes occurring in the catchment area stallard et al 1991 although sea salts and local inputs such as hot spring or groundwater may also affect water chemistry the associated elevated no3 concentrations of river water can be used to reflect the degree of pollution due to human activities no3 concentrations of river water from 26 taiwanese rivers were analyzed by lee et al 2020 the no3 concentrations of the kaoping river range from 0 34 to 0 77 mg n l which is the lowest value among the rivers in the western side of taiwan and very close to that of less disturbed rivers from eastern taiwan 0 26 0 73 mg n l lee et al 2020a the main contributions of cl to rivers are sea salts evaporites and pollution burke et al 2018 because no evaporite was reported in our study region of its contribution of cl can be neglected the input of sea salts leads to similar proportions of na and cl a surplus of cl relative to na in river water may be indicative of a polluted river which means that if the na cl cl ratio in river water is 0 1 the river is considered polluted burke et al 2018 the na cl cl ratio was in the range of 0 88 27 9 in our water samples except for mkp04 suggesting the pollution input from human activities is insignificant therefore the potential input from sea salts can be corrected by using the element cl ratio in seawater to determine the contribution of bedrock weathering meybeck 1983 assuming all cl originated from sea salt li et al 1997 average sea salt contributions of na ca mg and k were 22 0 3 3 2 and 7 0 respectively the sea salt corrected na ca mg and k demonstrated that weathered rock sediment and soils are the dominant sources of these major ions the relationship between the sea salt corrected elemental ratios of ca na and mg na in the kaoping river water is depicted in fig 3 a the end member values of silicates carbonates and evaporites are from gaillardet et al 1999 this mixing diagram using the major ion molar ratio of river water can be used to identify possible sources in solute mixing and to analyze trends of silicate and carbonate weathering within a river basin dessert et al 2003 meyer et al 2017 ryu et al 2009 all our river waters fall on a linear relationship between silicate and carbonate end members mixing with a tendency toward the silicate weathering end member thus weathering processes are the most crucial factors controlling the water chemistry the ca na and mg na of samples are slightly higher in the dry seasons than those in the wet seasons the contribution of silicate weathering calculated by two end members mixing accounts for 80 of the chemical weathering with some degree of seasonal variability fig 3a the results from the choshui river and beishih river located in central and northern taiwan respectively are also shown for comparison lee et al 2020b meyer et al 2017 the kaoping river waters contain a similar silicate signature to the choshui river but are lower than the beishih river fig 3a the average tds 395 mg l excluding mkp04 in kaoping river water was significantly higher than that in global rivers 283 mg l gaillardet et al 1999 these tds are low at the upstream stations high elevation and gradually increase toward the estuary representing a continuous weathering process throughout the entire river catchment the plot of tds versus station elevation indicates a potential influence of hot springs in the middle reaches fig 3b at ln t02 the baolai river high tds were observed which are probably related to local hydrothermal inputs this is supported by relatively high dissolved na li and b concentrations table 1 ln t02 also showed low δ11b liu et al 2012 and high radiogenic 87sr 86sr chung et al 2009 two trends were observed in the u versus li concentration plot fig 3c one end member with high u and li concentrations is the marine oriented source and the other with high li indicates the influence of regional hot springs or groundwater shaw and sturchio 1992 tomascak 2004 wang and you 2013a notably this hot spring input most likely is regional and only affects the baolai river fig 3b and c das et al 2012 revealed the dissolution of geogenic so4 in the kaoping river on the basis of sulfur isotopic analyses emphasizing that the so4 source is mainly oxidative weathering of sulfide minerals and minor anthropogenic input weathering processes are the main controlling factors for the water chemistry with insignificant contributions from hot springs and anthropogenic inputs 5 2 u and 234u 238u in the kaoping river dissolved u in the kaoping river was relatively higher than that in other rivers worldwide fig 4 this high u is likely provided by source materials in weathering processes minerals with a high u content e g apatite clay ilmenite and magnetite possibly affect u in the rivers bosia et al 2018 resentini et al 2017 thollon et al 2020 the contribution of dissolved u is mainly controlled by the degree and intensity of chemical weathering in a river basin stallard et al 1991 pogge von strandmann et al 2010 the combined effects of rock dissolution and simultaneous release of 234u and 238u into the dissolved phase in a high chemical weathering environment induce the increased u and reduced 234u 238u pogge von strandmann et al 2008 2010 however our new observations of high 234u 238u in the kaoping river catchment need further explanation a comparison between u and 234u 238u in worldwide rivers is shown in fig 4 the kaoping river specimens are characterized by relatively high u and high 234u 238u only two sites in new zealand have shown such high u activity ratios the average 234u 238u of kaoping river water was 2 696 significantly higher than that of any other river including that of new zealand 2 014 robinson et al 2004b the amazon basin 1 27 dosseto et al 2006 the deccan basin 1 22 vigier et al 2005 china 1 44 jiang et al 2009 and iceland 1 60 and 1 37 pogge von strandmann et al 2006 vigier et al 2006 this u activity ratio must be related to intense physical weathering and the α recoil effect dosseto et al 2008 kigoshi 1971 robinson et al 2004b vigier and bourdon 2011 the high 234u 238u in this study is also consistent with the features of weathering environments weathering and transport limited conditions can be distinguished through the comparison of k na k ratios between river water and bedrocks in silicate rock catchments stallard and edmond 1983 dissolved k na k of rivers is lower than that of bed sediments in weathering limited regions because the relative mobility of na is faster than that of k in river systems hudson 1995 polynov and muir 1937 however the dissolved k na k of the river should be similar to that of the bedload in a transport limited area dissolved k can be influenced by vegetation and organic material in a river but the positive correlation between k li and δ7li fig s1 strongly suggests that the weathering process is the main controlling factor of k in the kaoping river the sea salt corrected k na k in river water ranged from 0 03 to 0 21 with a mean of 0 09 which is much lower than the ratio in bedload sediments 0 64 chen and selvaraj 2008 weathering limited regimes generally occur in mountainous regions chung et al 2009 west et al 2005 and are consistent with geomorphological features in the kaoping river the dissolved 234u 238u and mean basin slope showed a positive correlation and the high 234u 238u is mainly present in the abrupt slope 30 of the upstream catchment fig 2c the sharp gradient topography of mountain areas results from the interplay of tectonic uplift landslide erosion and river incision this suggests that the tectonic uplift and the steep gradient promote the physical erosion in our study area the dramatic decrease in the downstream 234u 238u implies the decline of fresh detritus and increased chemical weathering handley et al 2013 measured 234u 238u of siltstone shale and quartzite bedrock from river basins within the flinders ranges in south australia and the reported range of 234u 238u in these source rocks is 0 912 0 971 the 234u 238u of river water in the strengbach stream which drained sandstones gneisses and granites ranges from 1 00 to 1 18 while the dissolved 234u 238u of the ohmbach stream shows a relatively higher value 1 40 after waters flowed through the carbonates riotte and chabaux 1999 a good correlation between 234u 238u and 87sr 86sr in the strengbach stream waters possibly indicates the lithological control silicate and carbonate rocks on dissolved 234u 238u riotte and chabaux 1999 in contrast a much greater variation of dissolved 234u 238u 1 143 3 572 table 1 is observed in the kaoping river waters which cannot be explained by the lithology of the drainage basin thus the high dissolved 234u 238u mainly reflects intense physical weathering indicating that river water 234u 238u can be used to infer the degree of physical and chemical weathering in mountain rivers of taiwan in addition groundwater might be another factor influencing river weathering and water chemistry deep weathering reaction induced by groundwater contributes to one third of the total silicate weathering flux in the liwu river it may regulate the importance of climate or physical erosion on chemical weathering fluxes calmels et al 2011 weathering processes and fluxes below the soil and saprolite zone must be evaluated in detail when studying the influence of river weathering the 234u 238u of kaoping groundwater falls in the middle of the trend fig 5 and is not distinctive but rather similar to surrounding river water this implies the interaction between river water and shallow groundwater in the plain area wang et al 2003 chiang and wang 2002 studied the recharge sources of groundwater in the pingtung plain which consists of plain areas of the kaoping river donggan river and linbian river by using oxygen and hydrogen isotopes they found that the groundwater of the pingtung plain was recharged from rainwater and river water the shallow aquifer s recharge is 67 from rainwater and 33 from river water this suggests that groundwater is not the primary source of river waters in the plain of the kaoping river furthermore mountainous groundwater in the upstream region revealed different characteristics of major ions compared with nearby river waters in a piper diagram the central geological survey ministry of economic affairs taiwan 2015 the mountainous groundwater of the upstream laonong river and the cishan river is in a typical confined aquifer and the radon 222 concentration is 10 times higher than that of river waters suggesting that mountainous groundwater is unlikely to directly contribute to the kaoping river the variations of 234u 238u in the kaoping river are therefore attributed to weathering processes with negligible groundwater influence 5 3 assessing u isotopes as a probe for weathering processes the variations of 234u 238u observed in water samples are determined by the effect of α recoil and the relative importance between physical and chemical weathering processes the distributions of u and u activity ratio in the kaoping river exhibited systematic variations generally an increase in u and a decrease in 234u 238u toward the lower reaches figs 2 and 5 the different sampling courses exhibited only small variations in 234u 238u but large differences in dissolved u the riverine 234u 238u after the typhoon event had a similar distribution pattern indistinguishable from the normal conditions fig 5 this implies that rainfall has minor effects on the 234u 238u within the catchment studied here the relationship between 234u 238u and u is characterized by two groups of specimens one group with high relatively consistent 234u 238u and low u in mountainous areas and the other group with low 234u 238u and high u content in the alluvial plain fig 5 a marked disparity was observed between the two sampling regions figs 1 and 5 the first group comprised the upstream stations ln01 ln04 ln t02 and cs02 which have high 234u 238u exceeding 3 000 and around 40 variation in u the high dissolved 234u 238u reflects direct 234u release from the solid phase through α recoil and preferential 234u removal from recoil damaged crystal lattices during weathering andersen et al 2009 these processes are principally associated with grain size particle surface area and continuous production of fresh materials by physical erosion the second group consisted of samples that transit through the alluvial plain before being discharged into the ocean fig 1 these samples are characterized by a relatively low 234u 238u and high u toward the estuary fig 5 the influence of seawater can only reach the mkp04 station wang and you 2013a therefore the positive correlation of dissolved 234u 238u and inverse u cannot be interpreted by the mixing of seawater and river water galy and france lanord 1999 indicated that the tendency of increased chemical weathering in the floodplain of the ganges increases soluble elements due to silicate weathering the decreasing trend of 234u 238u is most likely explained by enhanced chemical weathering in the plain regions which promotes more chemical weathering and simultaneously releases 234u and 238u into the water pogge von strandmann et al 2008 2010 robinson et al 2004b this supposition can be inferred from the dissolved δ7li riverine li isotopes can serve as an indicator of silicate weathering intensity dellinger et al 2015 kısakűrek et al 2005 pogge von strandmann et al 2006 vigier et al 2009 the li isotopic composition of rivers provides information on the balance between primary mineral dissolution and secondary mineral formation the elevated δ7li results primarily from preferential 6li uptake during secondary mineral formation where the lighter 6li isotope goes into the solid phase and the heavier 7li is in the solution huh et al 2001 vigier et al 2009 the high secondary mineral formation has been considered at high chemical weathering intensity dellinger et al 2015 pogge von strandmann et al 2017 this process results in heavier δ7li in river water than in suspended sediments and bedloads chan and edmond 1988 huh et al 2001 fig 6 a illustrates the relationship of increased δ7li versus decreased 234u 238u from the upper reaches to downstream of the kaoping river suggesting enhanced chemical weathering in the alluvial plain the higher δ7li in the cishan river than in the kaoping mainstream may relate to different degrees and types of secondary mineral formation the positive correlation between δ7li and na li or k li in dissolved loads fig s1 further supports increased secondary mineral formation during intense chemical weathering pistiner and henderson 2003 vigier et al 2009 na is preferentially removed relative to li during rock dissolution and is not significantly incorporated into secondary minerals and the na li also has been considered to reflect the water rock interaction time dellinger et al 2015 millot et al 2010 in the plot of 234u 238u and na li relatively high na li and low 234u 238u downstream compared with that upstream suggests the decreasing u activity ratio is linked to increased chemical weathering and longer time of interplay between water and rocks sediments fig 6b therefore the negative relationship between 234u 238u and δ7li downstream clearly indicates the enhanced chemical weathering intensity in the alluvial plain of the kaoping catchment fig 6 notably the upstream stations in the mountainous area maintain a high and similar 234u 238u and have decreasing u toward the upstream fig 5 which highlights the relationship of physical erosion with chemical weathering and the weathering kinetics under intense physical weathering the dissolved 234u 238u increases whereas as chemical weathering enhances the u activity ratio decreases thus high and constant 234u 238u as well as low u upstream most likely result from strong physical erosion and limited chemical weathering modeling predictions indicate that chemical weathering primarily increases and later decreases when physical erosion continually enhances and the weathering kinetics shift from supply limitation to kinetic control dixon et al 2012 ferrier and kirchner 2008 chemical weathering extent is relatively sensitive to erosion rates and residence time in a kinetically limited system compared with a supply limited regime because the rocks do not have enough time to be completely weathered rapid physical erosion due to active tectonics in the himalayas is considered a limiting factor for chemical weathering galy and france lanord 1999 a high uplift rate may limit chemical weathering due to reduced sediment residence time and incomplete water solid reactions when physical weathering is greatly enhanced stallard and edmond 1983 west et al 2005 the sediment 10be data support the short material residence time and high denudation in taiwan you et al 1988 derrieux et al 2014 fellin et al 2017 li 1976 observed a nonlinear relationship between the physical and chemical denudation rates of rivers in taiwan particularly under high physical weathering rates estimated by suspended load however the uncertainty of physical erosion rate based on suspended load may be large because of human activity and the deposition in lowland areas gaillardet et al 1999 milliman and meade 1983 the kinetic limited control for silicate weathering in the mountainous area of the kaoping river is consistent with the investigation by gu et al 2020 that the solute flux of mg and k from mineral weathering such as chlorite and illite at a high erosion rate in the fushan experimental watershed is in the kinetic limited regime our observation seems to conform with bufe et al 2021 noticed that silicate weathering is kinetical limited across a large range of erosion rates in the mountains of taiwan 234u 238u and u observed in the upstream region are mainly controlled by intense physical weathering and weak chemical weathering corresponding to the condition of weathering limited environment in the kaoping river catchment the following scenario is proposed to explain the observations high levels of physical denudation dominate in mountainous areas where intense physical weathering causes high 234u 238u and relatively low u enhanced chemical weathering subsequently occurs in the plain region resulting in low 234u 238u and high u this study provides an example of kinetic limited control on chemical weathering by intense physical erosion in the natural system and the riverine 234u 238u can sensitively reflect the combined effect of physical and chemical weathering in rapidly eroding mountains 5 4 other factors controlling 234u 238u in a smr in some mountainous areas the steep topography results from the interplay between active tectonic uplift and stream incision which induce physical erosion in the form of large landslides larsen and montgomery 2012 wang et al 2020 the positive correlation between water 234u 238u and uplift rate in the kaoping river basin suggests that tectonic activity may enhance physical weathering in catchment scale areas fig 7 we used weighted uplift rates sampled at irregular global positioning system gps stations to estimate rates collected on rectangular grids with 10 km spacing intervals from 120 25 e to 121 1 e and 22 4 n to 23 5 n by continuous gps data between 2007 and 2015 hsu et al 2018 table s1 the results of the kaoping river were similar to that observed in eastern new zealand robinson et al 2004b where the high physical erosion rate was most likely driven by landslides due to the rapid uplift rate bull and cooper 1986 emberson et al 2016b ferrier and kirchner 2008 hovius et al 1997 2000 however some differences were observed in the river systems between taiwan and new zealand fig 7 such as a continuous increase in 234u 238u with the uplift in new zealand and taiwan has relatively lower 234u 238u at the same level of uplift in new zealand supply limited weathering may exist at high denudation rates and the riverine 234u 238u is greatly influenced by precipitation larsen et al 2014 robinson et al 2004b which were not true for the rivers of taiwan the seasonal variation of 234u 238u in the kaoping river was rather small fig 5 and thus the short residence time in the kinetic limited environment of taiwan may be the significant factor that influences the 234u 238u in mountainous areas on the other hand the high 234u 238u of the kaoping river must be supported by continued supplies of fresh rocks by physical erosion landslide weathering is likely crucial because bedrock landsliding is a dominant process in taiwan hovius et al 2000 which probably leads to remarkably high 234u 238u in river water emberson et al 2016a reported a correlation between tds and dissolved so4 in river water and landslide seepage from the taimali river in taiwan such high so4 concentration was mainly supplied by the rapid oxidation of pyrite due to the high physical weathering of rocks das et al 2012 the relatively short water residence time in landslide seepage compared with that in a stream system is supported by low na and si concentrations in seepage emberson et al 2016a the characteristics of intense physical erosion and short water residence time upstream may contribute to the observed 234u 238u variations in landslide seepage or surrounding river waters thus field monitoring and sampling in a landslide prone river catchment would help further assess the sensitivity and the potential use of 234u 238u for the landslide activity however small scale 500 m2 landslides may only mobilize debris and soil materials instead of resulting in bedrock weathering emberson et al 2016a in such cases less fresh weathered material is exposed which possibly results in trivial variations in 234u 238u and blurs the signals of landslide weathering apparently the use of 234u 238u as a probe for landslide activity requires more investigations on the landslide prone regions 6 conclusions major and trace element concentrations as well as u and li isotopic ratios were analyzed in river water during three sampling seasons in the kaoping river catchment these results provided a unique opportunity to further our understanding of the weathering processes and conditions as well as to examine the use of 234u 238u as a reliable proxy for weathering processes in the rapidly eroding river catchment this study showed remarkably large variations in 234u 238u of the kaoping river from headwaters in the mountainous regions to the plain area our geochemical and isotopic data are consistent with the characteristics of the weathering limited regime in the kaoping river from the physical erosion dominated mountain area to the plain region where the river water chemistry is primarily influenced by chemical weathering the average 234u 238u of the kaoping river was significantly higher than those of most rivers worldwide the mountain area of the kaoping river is an example of kinetic limited control on chemical weathering through intense physical erosion in natural river systems high levels of physical erosion dominate the upstream region of the river catchment where intense physical weathering causes high 234u 238u with low u and inhibited chemical weathering enhanced chemical weathering subsequently occurs in the plain area resulting in low 234u 238u and relatively high u this is further supported by dissolved δ7li and geochemical data we therefore conclude that in a rapidly eroding mountain catchment of taiwan physical erosion acts as a first order control on u activity ratios and river water 234u 238u can indicate the relative contributions of physical and chemical weathering in the catchment area the observed positive trend between 234u 238u and the uplift rate can be explained by enhanced physical erosions which result from rapid uplift rates in the kaoping river catchment detailed investigations on the landslide prone river catchment are required to better understand the role of landslide weathering in river water

3547,the correlation between physical and chemical weathering in mountainous rivers is debatable a reliable geochemical tracer for physical erosion and chemical weathering is necessary to obtain crucial information on the relationship between weathering processes and environmental changes on the earth s surface small mountainous rivers smrs of taiwan are characterized by extremely high physical and chemical weathering and therefore they provide the foremost natural laboratory for studying weathering processes in tectonically active high standing islands in this study water samples collected from the kaoping river the largest river catchment in southern taiwan were analyzed for elemental concentrations as well as for u and li isotopes to understand the weathering processes and to evaluate the use of the 234u 238u activity ratio hereafter 234u 238u as a probe for weathering the average 234u 238u of the kaoping river is significantly higher than that of other rivers worldwide and variations in 234u 238u reflect the degree of physical and chemical weathering the weathering environment corresponds to the weathering limited regime and the mountain area is a natural example of the kinetic limited control on chemical weathering by intense physical erosion high physical erosion predominates in the mountainous region which increases 234u 238u relatively reduces u concentrations and inhibits chemical weathering the decreased 234u 238u and increased na li and δ7li downstream clearly indicate enhanced chemical weathering in the alluvial plain our results demonstrate that dissolved 234u 238u in the smrs of taiwan can reflect the relative contributions of physical and chemical weathering within the river catchment the coupling between chemical weathering and physical erosion can be observed downstream and the relationship becomes less pertinent in the mountain area due to changes in weathering kinetics a positive correlation between 234u 238u and uplift rate in the kaoping river suggests that the riverine 234u 238u is mainly controlled by uplift induced physical erosion which may be influenced by landslide activities in the rapidly eroding mountainous river of taiwan keywords uranium isotopes physical erosion lithium isotopes chemical weathering weathering limited kaoping river 1 introduction rivers are the principal transport pathways for eroded material from continental landmasses to oceans as such they are worthy of research for constraining erosion processes by using geochemical tracers gaillardet et al 1997 vigier et al 2001 tectonic activities influence landscape evolution through relief variation and physical and chemical weathering processes dixon et al 2012 physical denudation and chemical weathering are the predominant mechanisms responsible for the destruction of the continental crust and the cycling of weathered products dosseto et al 2006 gaillardet et al 1997 lee et al 2013 vigier et al 2001 physical denudation directly modifies the surface morphology of the crust and increases the ratio of particle surface area to grain size which can promote chemical reactions physical weathering which is typically associated with the breaking and formation of cracks in minerals and rocks accelerates related geological disintegration processes chemical weathering processes remove various soluble elements from the rock and soil into the surrounding aqueous solution continental chemical weathering through atmospheric carbon dioxide consumption is a crucial moderator of the long term global carbon cycle and is instrumental in regulating global climate change berner et al 1983 walker et al 1981 west et al 2005 both physical and chemical weathering play essential roles in landscape evolution elemental cycling and global climate variation whether chemical weathering rates increase proportionally with physical erosion rates is still debated gaillardet et al 1999 collected data from large rivers worldwide and observed a positive correlation between chemical and physical weathering rates however the modeling relationship between chemical weathering and physical denudation has demonstrated nonlinear correlations dixon et al 2012 ferrier and kirchner 2008 gabet and mudd 2009 west et al 2005 larsen et al 2014 reported that soil chemical weathering increases linearly as physical denudation rises in the western southern alps of new zealand the relationship between physical and chemical weathering is unclear furthermore natural factors such as regional climate tectonics and lithology that control physical and chemical erosion are not completely understood bricker et al 1994 lee et al 2013 vigier et al 2001 west et al 2002 uranium isotopes are considered powerful tools for studying weathering processes because the application of u isotopes on continental weathering avoids interference from source variations occurs all pristine rocks older than 1 ma and without suffering weathering can be assumed to reach a secular equilibrium state 234u 238u 1 depaolo et al 2006 vigier and bourdon 2011 this assumption has been checked from borehole samples in many cases including carbonates bourdon et al 2009 granites noseck et al 2008 and clays pękala et al 2009 which result that for a number of lithologies the assumption of initial secular equilibrium for bulk rocks can be valid vigier and bourdon 2011 this provides a strong constraint that riverine 234u 238u is independent of source rock composition riverine u isotopes have been used to study weathering processes and source mixing in different river systems pogge von strandmann et al 2006 2010 riotte and chabaux 1999 vigier et al 2006 in addition to climate proxy robinson et al 2004b and references therein several researchers have applied u and strontium sr isotopes to trace water sources in river catchments ryu et al 2009 wang and you 2013a u and lithium li isotope systems have been used to investigate the relationship between physical and chemical weathering pogge von strandmann et al 2006 2010 the fractionation of u isotopes is a direct result of physical processes due to the α recoil effect preferential 234u removal from recoil damaged crystal lattice sites in bedrock and soil occurs during water rock interactions or directly ejects 234th 234th subsequently fast decays to 234u into surrounding liquids if the distance to the grain boundary is smaller than the recoil range of 234th 30 nm andersen et al 2009 depaolo et al 2006 dosseto et al 2008 thus water samples commonly exhibit a feature of 234u excesses physical weathering can reduce grain size and expose more fresh particle surface promoting the preferential transfer of 234u into the dissolved phase thus dissolved 234u 238u greater than one is observed in continental surface waters dosseto et al 2008 kigoshi 1971 vigier and bourdon 2011 by contrast congruent chemical weathering tends to lower 234u 238u through rock dissolution 234u 238u 1 pogge von strandmann et al 2010 lee et al 2013 different weathering environments weathering limited or transport limited conditions affect variations in river water chemistry within a catchment area stallard and edmond 1983 stallard et al 1991 in weathering limited regions the weathered material is removed rapidly after production through physical erosion resulting in thin soil development short residence time of weathered material low degree of material weathering and incomplete water solid interaction landslides rockfalls steep slope and other factors that tend to maintain a fresh or slightly weathered rock surface are characteristics of weathering limited areas by contrast the weathering rate exceeds the capacity of the transport process in a transport limited area producing a region characterized by thick soil layers and flat slopes in such areas the residence time of weathered material is relatively long the detritus is highly chemically weathered and a weathering equilibrium results between water and solids pogge von strandmann et al 2010 stallard and edmond 1983 stallard et al 1991 west et al 2005 riverine u isotopes have been applied to study weathering processes under different weathering regimes in transport limited regimes such as the deccan basin high uranium concentration u 0 79 nm and low 234u 238u 1 22 have been reported because of its strong chemical weathering and rock dissolution pogge von strandmann et al 2010 vigier et al 2005 conversely high riverine 234u 238u 1 60 observed in iceland is attributed to physical weathering and glacial extension under extreme weathering limited conditions pogge von strandmann et al 2006 therefore riverine 234u 238u is considered to reflect the balance between physical and chemical weathering pogge von strandmann et al 2006 vigier et al 2006 the intense physical and chemical weathering in taiwan are chiefly due to arc continent collision combined effects of high uplift rate 2 10 mm yr liu and yu 1990 subtropical climatic conditions and monsoon rainfall the high annual precipitation level of 250 cm yr together with typhoon events and frequent earthquakes produces significant physical denudation and chemical weathering throughout the island chung et al 2009 dadson et al 2003 hartshorn et al 2002 li et al 1997 you et al 1988 the ranges of denudation rate estimated from sediment 10be are 0 2 10 mm yr and 0 2 8 8 mm yr for the western and eastern rivers respectively in taiwan derrieux et al 2014 fellin et al 2017 the mean physical denudation rate of taiwan s rivers 13 kg m2 yr is much higher than that of large rivers worldwide such as the yellow river 2 9 kg m2 yr furthermore the chemical weathering rate is higher in taiwanese rivers 0 15 1 14 kg m2 yr compared with that for the asian continent 0 03 kg m2 yr lee et al 2020b li 1976 hung et al 2020 further geochemical studies are necessary to examine physical and chemical weathering in small mountainous rivers smrs which contribute a disproportionate amount of eroded materials to the ocean dadson et al 2003 milliman and farnsworth 2011 this is the first study on weathering processes that used dissolved 234u 238u at the catchment scale in subtropical smrs in taiwan measurements of river water can reveal an integrated weathering signal of large spatial scales that a river flows through in this study seasonal water samples were collected from the kaoping river in southwestern taiwan analyses of major ions trace elements and u isotopic compositions were performed on the samples dissolved li isotopes are generated for the selected water samples to better constrain the intensity of silicate weathering in the kaoping river catchment the main aims of this study were 1 to gain a thorough understanding of elemental distributions and 234u 238u in mountainous river waters of taiwan 2 to examine u isotope variations in a rapidly eroding river catchment and to clarify the linkages of the u isotopic compositions with physical and chemical weathering processes and 3 to assess the potential of 234u 238u in dissolved loads as a weathering tracer in mountain river catchments of an active orogenic belt 2 study area the kaoping river is the largest watershed in southwestern taiwan with a basin area of 3257 km2 and length of 171 km it flows along the steep terrain from the jade mountain 3952 m to the taiwan strait forming the largest river sea interaction system in taiwan liu et al 2002 with an alluvial plain in between during high tide seawater advances to 10 km upstream

the annual temperature range is 18 c 29 c the mean annual precipitation is approximately 3000 mm and it is characterized by distinctly hydrological seasons wet may to october and dry november to april a high discharge rate occurs during the wet season because of monsoon and typhoons which accounts for 90 of the annual rainfall wang et al 2009 the erosion rate reaches 60 mm yr in the southern western foothills thrust belt this river delivers 63 3 1011 l yr water and 70 8 mt yr sediments to the ocean water resources agency ministry of economic affairs 1999 2004 which is almost 20 of the total suspended sediments 384 mt yr exported from taiwan dadson et al 2003 3 methods 3 1 sampling river samples were collected from the kaoping river catchment in four trips february 2006 august 2006 december 2009 and january 2010 to investigate spatial and seasonal variations in chemistry and to evaluate the influence of climatic variations the december 2009 and january 2010 samples were collected after typhoon morakot which severely damaged the southwestern taiwan in august 2009 waters were collected from the main channels of the kaoping river and its tributaries from upstream to the shuang yuan bridge mkp04 near the estuary fig 1 and table s1 only mkp04 was affected by seawater inputs furthermore ln t02 adjacent to a hot spring on the baolai river was collected for comparison the samples were collected in acid cleaned polypropylene bottles and were filtered through 0 20 or 0 45 μm whatman nylon syringe filters immediately upon return to the laboratory the first 100 ml filtrates were discarded to avoid contamination during the filtration process each sample was separated into two fractions one was acidified with double distilled concentrated nitric acid to ph 2 for cation and isotopic analyses and the other was non acidified for anion analyses all samples were stored at 4 c before the analysis 3 2 chemical analysis waters were analyzed for major and trace elements as well as for u and li isotopes all acids used in the experiments were double distilled using a vycor distillation system and deionized water 18 3 mω was prepared in a milli q element a10 water purification system millipore bedford ma usa all chemical analyses of water samples were performed in the isotope geochemistry laboratory igl at national cheng kung university ncku taiwan the experimental procedures were carried out in a class 1000 clean room with chemical separation processes executed inside an airflow class 10 working bench to reduce any potential contamination 3 2 1

bracketing ssb approach was employed for correcting mass fractionation during measurements with a precisely calibrated in house u standard solution by crm u005 as the bracketing standard the correction of the tailing effect followed a detailed process described by hiess et al 2012 the long term analytical precision of 234u 238u was obtained from the measurements of the in house u standard and the international seawater standard iapso with the mean 234u 238u values of the u standard solution and iapso being 0 970 0 002 2σ n 35 and 1 144 0 004 2σ n 9 respectively the measured 234u 238u of iapso is consistent with the published value of 1 143 0 004 li et al 2018 and open ocean seawater of 1 147 robinson et al 2004a the estimated total procedural blank was 2 pg u 0 01 u loaded and potential memory effects were negligible a detailed description of u isotope measurement by using mc icp ms is available in wang and you 2013b repeated measurements of the mkp04 involving completely separate processing and analysis of different aliquots yielded the 234u 238u of 1 668 and 1 673 average 1 670 table 1 li purification was conducted using ag 50 w x8 resin 200 400 mesh and the li isotopic ratio was measured using a mc icp ms neptune thermo fisher scientific equipped with an apex ir esi desolvating system through the ssb technique the column chemistry and analytical protocol for li were adapted from huang et al 2010 the resulting 7li 6li ratio can be expressed as δ7li which represents the per mil deviation from the nist l svec standard the external precision of δ7li was 0 12 2σ based on repeated measurements on a series of international reference materials irms including irmm 016 iapso and l svec the measured δ7li of irmm 016 iapso and l svec were 0 05 0 12 n 36 30 88 0 12 n 10 and 0 00 0 12 n 46 respectively all the measured δ7li values of these irms were in excellent agreement with the published results jeffcoate et al 2004 millot et al 2004 because water samples in this study were not sufficient to measure δ7li in duplicate we used samples collected at ln01 in august 2016 and at stations of mkp01 and mkp04 in august 2017 for conducting sample reproducibility repeated measurements of ln01 mkp01 and mkp04 revealed δ7li values of 15 2 0 21 2σ n 3 17 2 0 17 2σ n 3 and 18 3 0 22 2σ n 3 respectively 4 results the concentrations of major and trace elements na ca mg k li u cl and so4 in kaoping river water samples as well as u and li isotope data are summarized in table 1 4 1 major ion concentrations the highest concentrations of cations and anions were recorded in mkp04 table 1 with the exception of mkp04 the average cation concentrations followed the sequence of ca na mg k table 1 ca was the most abundant cation in both dry and wet seasons constituting 32 72 of the total riverine cations the concentrations of ca mg and k were higher in the dry seasons than in the wet seasons except for na which showed similar concentration levels in both seasons the highest mean concentrations for ca na mg and k were observed in december 2009 and january 2010 bicarbonate hco3 concentration ranged between 1 72 and 4 27 mm which represented 36 82 of the total dissolved anions table 1 hco3 was higher in samples collected in december 2009 and january 2010 than in those collected in february 2006 and august 2006 so4 and cl ranges were 0 60 1 81 mm and 0 03 0 57 mm respectively table 1 the average cl concentration was relatively high in august 2006 the total dissolved solids tds were in the range of 240 568 mg l with an average of 395 mg l excluding mkp04 the river waters in december 2009 and january 2010 exhibited the highest mean tds table 1 4 2 u concentrations and u isotopes dissolved u concentration u ranges of samples collected in february 2006 august 2006 and december 2009 and january 2010 were 0 25 4 54 0 19 2 01 and 0 62 2 05 nm respectively table 1 low u was detected at upstream stations with levels increasing downstream to lower catchment fig 2 a the highest u of the three sampling sessions were recorded at mkp04 influenced by seawater except in mkp04 the average u was slightly higher in february 2006 0 79 nm than in august 2006 and january 2010 0 55 nm and 0 48 nm respectively dissolved 234u 238u in the kaoping river was higher upstream and decreased toward the estuary fig 2b with ranges of 1 145 3 572 in february 2006 1 143 3 535 in august 2006 and 1 670 3 318 in december 2009 and january 2010 table 1 mkp04 exhibited the lowest 234u 238u similar to seawater 1 147 andersen et al 2007 robinson et al 2004a furthermore the water samples from the kaoping river catchment have distinctly higher 234u 238u than the seawater 4 3 li concentrations and li isotopes dissolved li concentration ranges were 0 91 18 2 0 90 14 6 and 0 30 2 10 μm in february 2006 august 2006 and december 2009 and january 2010 respectively table 1 during 2006 the highest li concentrations in both wet and dry seasons were recorded at ln t02 on the baolai river possibly related to local hydrothermal inputs this phenomenon was not detected after the typhoon event in 2010 δ7li data were available only for february 2006 specimens varying from 8 21 to 20 30 mkp04 was found to be influenced by seawater with δ7li of 30 00 5 discussion 5 1 major ion distribution of the kaoping river chemistry mkp04 at the shuang yuan bridge close to estuary clearly reveals a mixture of freshwater and seawater the samples had higher major cations and anions than other river waters with a mean na cl ratio of 0 64 which is close to that of seawater 0 86 mkp04 was therefore excluded from the calculation of average chemical compositions of the river waters the chemistry of river water is typically derived from weathering processes occurring in the catchment area stallard et al 1991 although sea salts and local inputs such as hot spring or groundwater may also affect water chemistry the associated elevated no3 concentrations of river water can be used to reflect the degree of pollution due to human activities no3 concentrations of river water from 26 taiwanese rivers were analyzed by lee et al 2020 the no3 concentrations of the kaoping river range from 0 34 to 0 77 mg n l which is the lowest value among the rivers in the western side of taiwan and very close to that of less disturbed rivers from eastern taiwan 0 26 0 73 mg n l lee et al 2020a the main contributions of cl to rivers are sea salts evaporites and pollution burke et al 2018 because no evaporite was reported in our study region of its contribution of cl can be neglected the input of sea salts leads to similar proportions of na and cl a surplus of cl relative to na in river water may be indicative of a polluted river which means that if the na cl cl ratio in river water is 0 1 the river is considered polluted burke et al 2018 the na cl cl ratio was in the range of 0 88 27 9 in our water samples except for mkp04 suggesting the pollution input from human activities is insignificant therefore the potential input from sea salts can be corrected by using the element cl ratio in seawater to determine the contribution of bedrock weathering meybeck 1983 assuming all cl originated from sea salt li et al 1997 average sea salt contributions of na ca mg and k were 22 0 3 3 2 and 7 0 respectively the sea salt corrected na ca mg and k demonstrated that weathered rock sediment and soils are the dominant sources of these major ions the relationship between the sea salt corrected elemental ratios of ca na and mg na in the kaoping river water is depicted in fig 3 a the end member values of silicates carbonates and evaporites are from gaillardet et al 1999 this mixing diagram using the major ion molar ratio of river water can be used to identify possible sources in solute mixing and to analyze trends of silicate and carbonate weathering within a river basin dessert et al 2003 meyer et al 2017 ryu et al 2009 all our river waters fall on a linear relationship between silicate and carbonate end members mixing with a tendency toward the silicate weathering end member thus weathering processes are the most crucial factors controlling the water chemistry the ca na and mg na of samples are slightly higher in the dry seasons than those in the wet seasons the contribution of silicate weathering calculated by two end members mixing accounts for 80 of the chemical weathering with some degree of seasonal variability fig 3a the results from the choshui river and beishih river located in central and northern taiwan respectively are also shown for comparison lee et al 2020b meyer et al 2017 the kaoping river waters contain a similar silicate signature to the choshui river but are lower than the beishih river fig 3a the average tds 395 mg l excluding mkp04 in kaoping river water was significantly higher than that in global rivers 283 mg l gaillardet et al 1999 these tds are low at the upstream stations high elevation and gradually increase toward the estuary representing a continuous weathering process throughout the entire river catchment the plot of tds versus station elevation indicates a potential influence of hot springs in the middle reaches fig 3b at ln t02 the baolai river high tds were observed which are probably related to local hydrothermal inputs this is supported by relatively high dissolved na li and b concentrations table 1 ln t02 also showed low δ11b liu et al 2012 and high radiogenic 87sr 86sr chung et al 2009 two trends were observed in the u versus li concentration plot fig 3c one end member with high u and li concentrations is the marine oriented source and the other with high li indicates the influence of regional hot springs or groundwater shaw and sturchio 1992 tomascak 2004 wang and you 2013a notably this hot spring input most likely is regional and only affects the baolai river fig 3b and c das et al 2012 revealed the dissolution of geogenic so4 in the kaoping river on the basis of sulfur isotopic analyses emphasizing that the so4 source is mainly oxidative weathering of sulfide minerals and minor anthropogenic input weathering processes are the main controlling factors for the water chemistry with insignificant contributions from hot springs and anthropogenic inputs 5 2 u and 234u 238u in the kaoping river dissolved u in the kaoping river was relatively higher than that in other rivers worldwide fig 4 this high u is likely provided by source materials in weathering processes minerals with a high u content e g apatite clay ilmenite and magnetite possibly affect u in the rivers bosia et al 2018 resentini et al 2017 thollon et al 2020 the contribution of dissolved u is mainly controlled by the degree and intensity of chemical weathering in a river basin stallard et al 1991 pogge von strandmann et al 2010 the combined effects of rock dissolution and simultaneous release of 234u and 238u into the dissolved phase in a high chemical weathering environment induce the increased u and reduced 234u 238u pogge von strandmann et al 2008 2010 however our new observations of high 234u 238u in the kaoping river catchment need further explanation a comparison between u and 234u 238u in worldwide rivers is shown in fig 4 the kaoping river specimens are characterized by relatively high u and high 234u 238u only two sites in new zealand have shown such high u activity ratios the average 234u 238u of kaoping river water was 2 696 significantly higher than that of any other river including that of new zealand 2 014 robinson et al 2004b the amazon basin 1 27 dosseto et al 2006 the deccan basin 1 22 vigier et al 2005 china 1 44 jiang et al 2009 and iceland 1 60 and 1 37 pogge von strandmann et al 2006 vigier et al 2006 this u activity ratio must be related to intense physical weathering and the α recoil effect dosseto et al 2008 kigoshi 1971 robinson et al 2004b vigier and bourdon 2011 the high 234u 238u in this study is also consistent with the features of weathering environments weathering and transport limited conditions can be distinguished through the comparison of k na k ratios between river water and bedrocks in silicate rock catchments stallard and edmond 1983 dissolved k na k of rivers is lower than that of bed sediments in weathering limited regions because the relative mobility of na is faster than that of k in river systems hudson 1995 polynov and muir 1937 however the dissolved k na k of the river should be similar to that of the bedload in a transport limited area dissolved k can be influenced by vegetation and organic material in a river but the positive correlation between k li and δ7li fig s1 strongly suggests that the weathering process is the main controlling factor of k in the kaoping river the sea salt corrected k na k in river water ranged from 0 03 to 0 21 with a mean of 0 09 which is much lower than the ratio in bedload sediments 0 64 chen and selvaraj 2008 weathering limited regimes generally occur in mountainous regions chung et al 2009 west et al 2005 and are consistent with geomorphological features in the kaoping river the dissolved 234u 238u and mean basin slope showed a positive correlation and the high 234u 238u is mainly present in the abrupt slope 30 of the upstream catchment fig 2c the sharp gradient topography of mountain areas results from the interplay of tectonic uplift landslide erosion and river incision this suggests that the tectonic uplift and the steep gradient promote the physical erosion in our study area the dramatic decrease in the downstream 234u 238u implies the decline of fresh detritus and increased chemical weathering handley et al 2013 measured 234u 238u of siltstone shale and quartzite bedrock from river basins within the flinders ranges in south australia and the reported range of 234u 238u in these source rocks is 0 912 0 971 the 234u 238u of river water in the strengbach stream which drained sandstones gneisses and granites ranges from 1 00 to 1 18 while the dissolved 234u 238u of the ohmbach stream shows a relatively higher value 1 40 after waters flowed through the carbonates riotte and chabaux 1999 a good correlation between 234u 238u and 87sr 86sr in the strengbach stream waters possibly indicates the lithological control silicate and carbonate rocks on dissolved 234u 238u riotte and chabaux 1999 in contrast a much greater variation of dissolved 234u 238u 1 143 3 572 table 1 is observed in the kaoping river waters which cannot be explained by the lithology of the drainage basin thus the high dissolved 234u 238u mainly reflects intense physical weathering indicating that river water 234u 238u can be used to infer the degree of physical and chemical weathering in mountain rivers of taiwan in addition groundwater might be another factor influencing river weathering and water chemistry deep weathering reaction induced by groundwater contributes to one third of the total silicate weathering flux in the liwu river it may regulate the importance of climate or physical erosion on chemical weathering fluxes calmels et al 2011 weathering processes and fluxes below the soil and saprolite zone must be evaluated in detail when studying the influence of river weathering the 234u 238u of kaoping groundwater falls in the middle of the trend fig 5 and is not distinctive but rather similar to surrounding river water this implies the interaction between river water and shallow groundwater in the plain area wang et al 2003 chiang and wang 2002 studied the recharge sources of groundwater in the pingtung plain which consists of plain areas of the kaoping river donggan river and linbian river by using oxygen and hydrogen isotopes they found that the groundwater of the pingtung plain was recharged from rainwater and river water the shallow aquifer s recharge is 67 from rainwater and 33 from river water this suggests that groundwater is not the primary source of river waters in the plain of the kaoping river furthermore mountainous groundwater in the upstream region revealed different characteristics of major ions compared with nearby river waters in a piper diagram the central geological survey ministry of economic affairs taiwan 2015 the mountainous groundwater of the upstream laonong river and the cishan river is in a typical confined aquifer and the radon 222 concentration is 10 times higher than that of river waters suggesting that mountainous groundwater is unlikely to directly contribute to the kaoping river the variations of 234u 238u in the kaoping river are therefore attributed to weathering processes with negligible groundwater influence 5 3 assessing u isotopes as a probe for weathering processes the variations of 234u 238u observed in water samples are determined by the effect of α recoil and the relative importance between physical and chemical weathering processes the distributions of u and u activity ratio in the kaoping river exhibited systematic variations generally an increase in u and a decrease in 234u 238u toward the lower reaches figs 2 and 5 the different sampling courses exhibited only small variations in 234u 238u but large differences in dissolved u the riverine 234u 238u after the typhoon event had a similar distribution pattern indistinguishable from the normal conditions fig 5 this implies that rainfall has minor effects on the 234u 238u within the catchment studied here the relationship between 234u 238u and u is characterized by two groups of specimens one group with high relatively consistent 234u 238u and low u in mountainous areas and the other group with low 234u 238u and high u content in the alluvial plain fig 5 a marked disparity was observed between the two sampling regions figs 1 and 5 the first group comprised the upstream stations ln01 ln04 ln t02 and cs02 which have high 234u 238u exceeding 3 000 and around 40 variation in u the high dissolved 234u 238u reflects direct 234u release from the solid phase through α recoil and preferential 234u removal from recoil damaged crystal lattices during weathering andersen et al 2009 these processes are principally associated with grain size particle surface area and continuous production of fresh materials by physical erosion the second group consisted of samples that transit through the alluvial plain before being discharged into the ocean fig 1 these samples are characterized by a relatively low 234u 238u and high u toward the estuary fig 5 the influence of seawater can only reach the mkp04 station wang and you 2013a therefore the positive correlation of dissolved 234u 238u and inverse u cannot be interpreted by the mixing of seawater and river water galy and france lanord 1999 indicated that the tendency of increased chemical weathering in the floodplain of the ganges increases soluble elements due to silicate weathering the decreasing trend of 234u 238u is most likely explained by enhanced chemical weathering in the plain regions which promotes more chemical weathering and simultaneously releases 234u and 238u into the water pogge von strandmann et al 2008 2010 robinson et al 2004b this supposition can be inferred from the dissolved δ7li riverine li isotopes can serve as an indicator of silicate weathering intensity dellinger et al 2015 kısakűrek et al 2005 pogge von strandmann et al 2006 vigier et al 2009 the li isotopic composition of rivers provides information on the balance between primary mineral dissolution and secondary mineral formation the elevated δ7li results primarily from preferential 6li uptake during secondary mineral formation where the lighter 6li isotope goes into the solid phase and the heavier 7li is in the solution huh et al 2001 vigier et al 2009 the high secondary mineral formation has been considered at high chemical weathering intensity dellinger et al 2015 pogge von strandmann et al 2017 this process results in heavier δ7li in river water than in suspended sediments and bedloads chan and edmond 1988 huh et al 2001 fig 6 a illustrates the relationship of increased δ7li versus decreased 234u 238u from the upper reaches to downstream of the kaoping river suggesting enhanced chemical weathering in the alluvial plain the higher δ7li in the cishan river than in the kaoping mainstream may relate to different degrees and types of secondary mineral formation the positive correlation between δ7li and na li or k li in dissolved loads fig s1 further supports increased secondary mineral formation during intense chemical weathering pistiner and henderson 2003 vigier et al 2009 na is preferentially removed relative to li during rock dissolution and is not significantly incorporated into secondary minerals and the na li also has been considered to reflect the water rock interaction time dellinger et al 2015 millot et al 2010 in the plot of 234u 238u and na li relatively high na li and low 234u 238u downstream compared with that upstream suggests the decreasing u activity ratio is linked to increased chemical weathering and longer time of interplay between water and rocks sediments fig 6b therefore the negative relationship between 234u 238u and δ7li downstream clearly indicates the enhanced chemical weathering intensity in the alluvial plain of the kaoping catchment fig 6 notably the upstream stations in the mountainous area maintain a high and similar 234u 238u and have decreasing u toward the upstream fig 5 which highlights the relationship of physical erosion with chemical weathering and the weathering kinetics under intense physical weathering the dissolved 234u 238u increases whereas as chemical weathering enhances the u activity ratio decreases thus high and constant 234u 238u as well as low u upstream most likely result from strong physical erosion and limited chemical weathering modeling predictions indicate that chemical weathering primarily increases and later decreases when physical erosion continually enhances and the weathering kinetics shift from supply limitation to kinetic control dixon et al 2012 ferrier and kirchner 2008 chemical weathering extent is relatively sensitive to erosion rates and residence time in a kinetically limited system compared with a supply limited regime because the rocks do not have enough time to be completely weathered rapid physical erosion due to active tectonics in the himalayas is considered a limiting factor for chemical weathering galy and france lanord 1999 a high uplift rate may limit chemical weathering due to reduced sediment residence time and incomplete water solid reactions when physical weathering is greatly enhanced stallard and edmond 1983 west et al 2005 the sediment 10be data support the short material residence time and high denudation in taiwan you et al 1988 derrieux et al 2014 fellin et al 2017 li 1976 observed a nonlinear relationship between the physical and chemical denudation rates of rivers in taiwan particularly under high physical weathering rates estimated by suspended load however the uncertainty of physical erosion rate based on suspended load may be large because of human activity and the deposition in lowland areas gaillardet et al 1999 milliman and meade 1983 the kinetic limited control for silicate weathering in the mountainous area of the kaoping river is consistent with the investigation by gu et al 2020 that the solute flux of mg and k from mineral weathering such as chlorite and illite at a high erosion rate in the fushan experimental watershed is in the kinetic limited regime our observation seems to conform with bufe et al 2021 noticed that silicate weathering is kinetical limited across a large range of erosion rates in the mountains of taiwan 234u 238u and u observed in the upstream region are mainly controlled by intense physical weathering and weak chemical weathering corresponding to the condition of weathering limited environment in the kaoping river catchment the following scenario is proposed to explain the observations high levels of physical denudation dominate in mountainous areas where intense physical weathering causes high 234u 238u and relatively low u enhanced chemical weathering subsequently occurs in the plain region resulting in low 234u 238u and high u this study provides an example of kinetic limited control on chemical weathering by intense physical erosion in the natural system and the riverine 234u 238u can sensitively reflect the combined effect of physical and chemical weathering in rapidly eroding mountains 5 4 other factors controlling 234u 238u in a smr in some mountainous areas the steep topography results from the interplay between active tectonic uplift and stream incision which induce physical erosion in the form of large landslides larsen and montgomery 2012 wang et al 2020 the positive correlation between water 234u 238u and uplift rate in the kaoping river basin suggests that tectonic activity may enhance physical weathering in catchment scale areas fig 7 we used weighted uplift rates sampled at irregular global positioning system gps stations to estimate rates collected on rectangular grids with 10 km spacing intervals from 120 25 e to 121 1 e and 22 4 n to 23 5 n by continuous gps data between 2007 and 2015 hsu et al 2018 table s1 the results of the kaoping river were similar to that observed in eastern new zealand robinson et al 2004b where the high physical erosion rate was most likely driven by landslides due to the rapid uplift rate bull and cooper 1986 emberson et al 2016b ferrier and kirchner 2008 hovius et al 1997 2000 however some differences were observed in the river systems between taiwan and new zealand fig 7 such as a continuous increase in 234u 238u with the uplift in new zealand and taiwan has relatively lower 234u 238u at the same level of uplift in new zealand supply limited weathering may exist at high denudation rates and the riverine 234u 238u is greatly influenced by precipitation larsen et al 2014 robinson et al 2004b which were not true for the rivers of taiwan the seasonal variation of 234u 238u in the kaoping river was rather small fig 5 and thus the short residence time in the kinetic limited environment of taiwan may be the significant factor that influences the 234u 238u in mountainous areas on the other hand the high 234u 238u of the kaoping river must be supported by continued supplies of fresh rocks by physical erosion landslide weathering is likely crucial because bedrock landsliding is a dominant process in taiwan hovius et al 2000 which probably leads to remarkably high 234u 238u in river water emberson et al 2016a reported a correlation between tds and dissolved so4 in river water and landslide seepage from the taimali river in taiwan such high so4 concentration was mainly supplied by the rapid oxidation of pyrite due to the high physical weathering of rocks das et al 2012 the relatively short water residence time in landslide seepage compared with that in a stream system is supported by low na and si concentrations in seepage emberson et al 2016a the characteristics of intense physical erosion and short water residence time upstream may contribute to the observed 234u 238u variations in landslide seepage or surrounding river waters thus field monitoring and sampling in a landslide prone river catchment would help further assess the sensitivity and the potential use of 234u 238u for the landslide activity however small scale 500 m2 landslides may only mobilize debris and soil materials instead of resulting in bedrock weathering emberson et al 2016a in such cases less fresh weathered material is exposed which possibly results in trivial variations in 234u 238u and blurs the signals of landslide weathering apparently the use of 234u 238u as a probe for landslide activity requires more investigations on the landslide prone regions 6 conclusions major and trace element concentrations as well as u and li isotopic ratios were analyzed in river water during three sampling seasons in the kaoping river catchment these results provided a unique opportunity to further our understanding of the weathering processes and conditions as well as to examine the use of 234u 238u as a reliable proxy for weathering processes in the rapidly eroding river catchment this study showed remarkably large variations in 234u 238u of the kaoping river from headwaters in the mountainous regions to the plain area our geochemical and isotopic data are consistent with the characteristics of the weathering limited regime in the kaoping river from the physical erosion dominated mountain area to the plain region where the river water chemistry is primarily influenced by chemical weathering the average 234u 238u of the kaoping river was significantly higher than those of most rivers worldwide the mountain area of the kaoping river is an example of kinetic limited control on chemical weathering through intense physical erosion in natural river systems high levels of physical erosion dominate the upstream region of the river catchment where intense physical weathering causes high 234u 238u with low u and inhibited chemical weathering enhanced chemical weathering subsequently occurs in the plain area resulting in low 234u 238u and relatively high u this is further supported by dissolved δ7li and geochemical data we therefore conclude that in a rapidly eroding mountain catchment of taiwan physical erosion acts as a first order control on u activity ratios and river water 234u 238u can indicate the relative contributions of physical and chemical weathering in the catchment area the observed positive trend between 234u 238u and the uplift rate can be explained by enhanced physical erosions which result from rapid uplift rates in the kaoping river catchment detailed investigations on the landslide prone river catchment are required to better understand the role of landslide weathering in river water

investigate the relationship between hydrology and geomorphology and several hydrology indicators pradhan et al 2021 including effective discharge qef bankfull flow qbf overbank flow qobf sub bankfull flow qsf have been major criteria in fluvial geomorphology lópez tarazón and batalla 2014 specifically qef represents the discharge or the narrow range of discharges that maximizes the effectiveness

the transition area between a given channel and its floodplain generally within 1 to 5 year return period leopold et al 1964 reckendorfer and walter 2012 shields et al 2003 it is widely considered as

of the most fragile areas in asia yuanzheng et al 2017 riverine wetlands are widely distributed in ybr consisting of braiding channels vast floodplains and sand bed zhaoyin et al 2014 exhibiting sensitive river morphology responses to hydrology process however studies on the variations in the morphology of yrb are scarce and until now the few morphology studies that have been conducted on yrb have primarily focused around the downstream in india pradhan et al 2021 sarkar et al 2012 sarma 2005 or the middle reaches in china ji et al 2018 zhang 1998 under the impact from human activities understanding the development mechanism of the river morphology in this unique fragile ecosystem are urgent to adopt responding protection strategies but due to the limited previous researches for this area the specific morphology variation and main impact factors are still unclear the objectives of the present study are to i establish a new method to estimate his including qmf qbf and qsf based on the remote sensing and hydrology data ii estimate the effective discharge with suspended sediment load and the relationship with other his iii analyze the impact of different his on temporal river morphology variation siviglia et al analyze the impact of river characteristics on spatially differential of river morphology variation 2 methodology 2 1 study area the ybr is the longest river in tibet and at the junction of the nyang tributary formed the yanni wetland the wetland covers an area of approximately 82 5 km2 fig 1 and is situated immediately upstream of the yarlung zangbo grand canyon geotectonic activities and numerous sedimentation processes developed the wetland with gentle sloping and wide cross section table 1 which provides habitat for approximately 175 species fig 2 b influenced by the plateau temperate subhumid monsoon climate hydrology is characterized by alternating high flow conditions during spring summer and low flow conditions during autumn winter fig 3 a combined with runoff groundwater and snowmelt supply the average annual discharge is 1894 m3 s and the highest value of red ratio of maximum daily discharge to minimum daily discharge is 34 that the hydrology process in the region was relatively stable without extreme floods events compared with the downstream in indian with red over 1482 pradhan et al 2021 the average annual sediment load is 8 6 106 t y with cvs coefficient of variation of suspended sediment concentration equals to 1 21 and the bed sand particle size d50 span a large range from 0 04 to 0 35 mm due to the sand fixing action of vegetation part of the inner bar height is 5 to 8 m fig 1 which accommodate high regime of flow variation 2 2 basic data acquisition and analysis table 2 presents daily discharge daily suspended sediment load and collected satellite images for the yanni wetland the flood frequency curve and daily flow frequency curve are shown in fig 3 b a total of 35 satellite images corresponding to the

imagery data were available as shown in table 2 based on field investigation and satellite data the landscape of the study area was classified as deep water shallow water depth 0 5 m sandy land grass land and shrub land as shown in fig 2b and fig 4 before using the supervised classification method in envi exelis visual information solutions american software to interpret the variations in land types in the study area over the years several pretreatments including radiometric calibration local clipping atmospheric correction and geometric correction were performed please refer to supplementary material for the specific processing in method section the correlation between specific his and mis was presented by pearson correlation coefficient calculated by spss and for clearer understanding the structure and content of this paper the flow chart was shown in supplementary material in fig s1 2 3 hydrology indicators sediment transport and flow scour are the main factors that influence river morphology in this study several his including main channel full flow qmf sub bankfull flow qsf bankfull flow qbf and effective discharge were used to analyze the hydrological effects on river morphology maintaining and reforming the qmf qsf and qbf are the flows that fill the main channel sub channel and the bank respectively in fig 5 a and calculated with the wd c suspended sediments and bedload sediments both have effects on river morphology the latter is significant in gravel rivers lenzi et al 2006 phillips 2010 while the former is more important in flatten sandy rivers as it comprises the maximum portion of total load goodwin 2004 pradhan et al 2021 and is the only sediment load we could get in the study area wang et al 2020 we calculated qef with the suspended sediment concentrations according to eq 1 2 and 3 qef representing the effective discharge based on the wolman and miller approach wolman and miller 1960 while effective discharge based on

the channel and the channel width is used to represent the bank restraint degree on the channels but the expansion contraction of the river courses increases the sensitivity of the ci to representative cross in the study area and we redefined ci as the ratio between the floodplain area and the river area in the different segments and with the widely distribution of shallows in the study area we simplified the eq 4 into eq 5 and eq 6 in which cic represents the confinement of the floodplain to the deep water and ciw represents the confinement of the floodplain to the whole water

and the study area was divided into four segments seg 1 4 with five cross sections sec 1 5 based on the spatial distribution of floodplains as well as river morphology to analysis shown in fig 1 2 5 1 thalweg swing index the tsi as shown in eq 10 is defined as the ratio of the intersection area of the thalweg to its length in two phases for a more accurate determination of the variations in the tsi

represents the length of the river m 2 5 3 curvature this study identified curvature of bend apex by using a 3 point circle in autocad for the main channel in each segment shown in fig 6 if there are multiple bend apexes in a segment this study chooses the larger curvature to represent the whole segment as the greater curvature the higher probability that the river course will be cut off and rerouted with the influence of hydrology 2 5 4 braiding index the bn is defined as the number of branches at baseflow that are separated by bars and some scholars combine sand bars with other braided river characteristic to obtain br as shown in eq 12 which is defined as the ratio of channel length to river length pradhan et al 2021 12 br l l r where l represents the length of channels including sub channels and main channel m and lr represents the length of the river m 3 results all large rivers worldwide are affected by human activities to varying degrees and these activities disrupt the natural development of the morphologies of such rivers clerici et al 2015 the site for this study is characterized by limited human interference thus the river maintains natural hydrology processes as well as its natural channel morphology in this regard it serves as a useful case study for the investigation of the effects of natural hydrology processes on the channel shape of large rivers 3 1 hydrology 3 1 1 main channel flow sub bankfull flow and bankfull flow based on satellite images in tabel 2 we interpretated the water area of the study area with different discharge in fig 7 and got the bn and with the daily discharge corresponded to each image we drew the wd c and bn with increasing flow of the study area in fig 8 a and b we collected all satellite image data in this area but floods were often accompanied with cloudy which greatly reduced the number of effective photos however the existing data also showed interesting variation and well explained the connection and expansion of branches in the river specifically with flow increase the water area growth rate gradually slowed down and tended to zero the water level growth rate also reduced somehow bn increased significantly then merged and maintained two branches over a large flow range finally became one branch these variations were results of the terraced channel cross section formed by geological activity shown in fig 7 with small discharge from 430 to 650 m3 s the flow was restricted to the narrow deep main channel causing slight change in the water area and bn in fig 8 a and b and the water level increased significantly until overflow to the floodplains and sub channel as the discharge continued increasing to 2720 m3 s the streamlines tended to be complicated and rose to the maximum bn with all branches connecting and in the following certain flow range the change of wd c and bn showed an obvious plateau period with the flow greater than 3070 m3 s bn maintained the maximum but the water overflooded from the sub channels to the floodplain with a significant increase in the water area until branches merged as flow in the floodplain connected them with the inner island in the study area flow rose to 7020 m3 s bn continued decreasing to two and although wd c tended to be flat when the flow rate was greater than 8000 there was also an obvious turning point between 9690 and 9820 indicating that the river was in a state of full bank and further inundate both banks and inner island through the variation of water area and branch numbers with discharge considering definitions of his we finally got the qmf as 650 m3 s qsf as 3070 m3 s and qbf as 9690 m3 s the water level in the study area during qmf qsf qbf were calculated with hec ras model based on the measured topography data in 2013 fig s 2 to analysis the accuracy of the his determined by the wd c in fig 8 with remote sensing the small elevation difference between the calculated water levels and the banks elevation showed that qmf qsf and qbf were suitable in the study area 3 1 2 effective discharge computation the relationship between water discharge and sediment load in the study area is shown in fig 3 c the discharge sediment relationship varied inter annual from 2005 to 2013 based on the wolman miller and nash approaches we summarized the effective discharge of suspended sediments in table 3 and fig 3 b same as most research vogel et al 2003 there were significant difference between q1 2 and qef as q1 2 was 4876 m3 s and closed to 1 year flood event but qef was much smaller equal to 2367 m3 s 3 2 river characteristic 3 2 1 confinement index the interpretation of the satellite images fig 9 corresponding to the 1984 2018 period in december showed that during the dry season deep water was distributed in the main channel and shallow water 0 5 m predominantly appeared in the sub channels the ranges of ciw and cic for the four segments within the 1984 2018 period in study area were shown in fig 10 a particularly according to ciw the reach was almost medium or low confinement with part of the years was high confinement in seg 4 however according to cic all the segments in the reach exhibited low confinement the difference between ciw and cic indicated that the shallow area significantly influenced analyzing the confinement of the river bank when the shallow water area accounted for a relatively large ration of the river area the shallow effect had great significance fig 10 b particularly in seg 4 the shallow area significantly increased the degree of restriction of the river channel and leaded to the illusion of high confinement in fact the morphology changes of seg 4 were the most frequent which further indicates that not only the water width but also certain water depth requirements should be considered in the ci especially in floodplain meanwhile the ciw of seg 3 was significantly different from others in fig 10 a causing by the strongly morphology variation and active spatial fluctuation of deep water region on the whole seg 2 and seg 3 had similar ci and so did the seg 1 and seg 4 the result helped to explain the response of channel morphology to hydrology 3 2 2 shoreline ratio and elevation heterogeneity figure 11 a showed the variation of width of the whole floodplain and shoreline ratio sr in the study area seg 1 and seg 2 with small sr and less difference between maximum width average width and minimum width seg 3 was the widest part with large left sr indicating the river bank expansion contraction and the right bank was bound by the mountain with small change the cross section of the seg 4 shrunk causing most significant variation of width in the study area but constrained by the mountains on both sides the sr is relatively small figure 11 b showed the coefficient of variation of cross section elevation cve and elevation difference ed of average cross elevation and lowest elevation along the study area according to the measured topography in 2013 fig s 2 the cve and ed fluctuated along the study area but them in seg 3 and seg 4 were generally low indicating the weak heterogeneity of the cross section elevation part of sections in seg 1 and seg 2 had acute angles with the flow direction causing local small cv and ed 3 3 geomorphological evolution 3 3 1 thalweg swing index the main channel significantly lateral migration over the timeframe in fig 9 and fig 12 showed the variation of tsi during 1984 2018 tsi from 1984 to 1997 fluctuated in small amplitudes as the thalweg swung back and forth from left to right primarily resulting from the formation movement extinction cycle of the bars in seg 4 fig 9 but river bended in the front of seg 3 after years erosion and sedimentation piégay et al 2008 which weaken the resistance to large flood events from 1998 to 2002 the main channel cut off floodplain erosion and tsi variated significant high flow events in 1998 and 1999 scoured the sub channel in the seg 3 and eventually shifted the main channel and floods in 2002 further pushed the new top blunt point to downstream formed in shape of n between seg 3 and seg 4 after a brief trimming in 2001 large flow events in 2002 cut off of river again causing the tsi to vary drastically second only to the change observed in 1998 during 2003 to 2017 the swing of the main channel remained weak and manifested as slow erosion toward the left bank and by this stage shown in fig 9 the change of tsi was mainly due to the adjustment of main channel in seg 3 and seg 4 however tsi changed greatly again in 2018 as can be seen from the fig 9 flow diversion ratios of sub channel and main channel near the inner bar in seg 3 were close in 2017 and large floods in 2018 led to an increasing in the diversion ratio of past sub channel and transiting to the main channel and talweg shifted 3 3 2 sinuosity index the riverbed type changed conspicuously according to the fig 13 a before 1998 it kept moderate meandering with si approximate 1 4 garcía 2015 leopold and wolman 1957 with floods in 1998 to 2002 cutting off of the main channel in seg 3 the si decreased and river bed almost changed into straight type although si slowly increased since then the riverbed was still sinuous type 3 3 3 curvature and flow deflection angle curvature c and flow deflection angle ɑ of segments in the study area showed obvious spatial differences in fig 13 b and c interannual variations of curvature in seg 1 and seg 2 were minor with main channel scouring and the sinuosity of the two segments slightly decreased in fig 12 the ɑ of seg 1 was still stable but that of seg 2 changed with flow direction varied at the outlet section both c and ɑ of seg 3 and seg 4 showed obvious variation during river remodeling period from 1998 to 2002 the newly main channel squeezed the original and formed a short time n shape in 2000 resulting in temporary high c and ɑ and the main channel cut off into straight in 2002 caused low curvature and ɑ in seg 3 and lasting for several years until river bend the c and ɑ of seg 4 varied well followed seg 3 3 3 4 braiding index the branch ratio br for the whole river area was shown in fig 13 a br volatility rose within the range of 2 5 4 5 with sub channel variations and inner bars moving the br from 1984 to 1992 was stable and rose up since 1993 with sub channel increased in seg 4 the river remolding from 1998 to 2002 resulted in continuously high br until gradual stabilization of river morphology decreasing br since 2009 compared with 30 years ago flatted floodplain after river remolding generated more sub channels and the braids of channels increased the bn of the sandy floodplain with wide cross section and flatted terrain were always greater than 2 but different in time and spatiality shown in fig 14 the bn for sec 1 and sec 2 were always 2 the former was restrained by the banks owing to the development of the river morphology the latter was restrained to a lesser extent but exhibiting uniform morphology along the cross width considering that the cross section in seg 3 showed both expansion and contraction fig 5 b the interannual variations of bn in sec 3 and sec 4 were complex comparing fig 9 and fig 14 showed that the bn of seg 3 varied with the main channel changing and the sub channel braiding during 1984 2018 the bn of sec 4 decreased owing to the sub channel merged additionally the bn of sec 5 exhibited complex and unstable variation owing to the shrinking of the river course and the change in the incident angle of main channel 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between his and method uncertainty different from the most research estimated qsf and qbf via the hydraulic analysis of field investigating bankfull geomorphic data such as channel width cross sectional area meander length and pattern and the mean bankfull depth through bourke 2002 kaase and kupfer 2016 savenije 2003 xia et al 2014 we established a new remote sensing based method to calculate them with the frequent revisit time and large spatial coverage of satellites this method is more convenient with reliable accuracy in fig s2 to support the evaluation of hydrology it is suitable for the study of his in wide valley rivers with braiding channels which is difficult to the in situ measure and supplies an innovative method for exploiting satellite observation in hydrological applications han et al 2019 liao et al 2020 but the resolution and quantity of satellite images are crucial to the accuracy of the results in principle the resolution needs to be less than sub channel width as branch numbers are important factor considered in the remote sensing based method and due to the time span of images collected his calculated with this method only represent the average over years especially for qbf according to the method we established the qbf is 5 6 year flood event approximating the moderate floods i e those with recurrence intervals of 1 to 5 years dunne and leopold 1978 williams 1978 that is similar to most hydrologic research brayshaw 2012 chen et al 2021 quader et al 2008 the magnitude of the half load discharge numerically equal to effective discharge with nash approach in this study q1 2 is correlated with the 1 year flood event slightly above the magnitude of the qsf providing additional information concerning the shape and skew of the effectiveness relation brayshaw 2012 vogel et al 2003 qef is smaller and more frequent pradhan et al 2021 than qsf while qmf is only occurs in the dry period the correspondence between the calculated effective discharge and the bankfull discharge also intrigues most geomorphologists brayshaw 2012 chen et al 2021 quader et al 2008 affected by the broad width and braiding channels in the study area qbf occurred only for a short time causing limited sediment transport capacity and significant larger than the computed effective discharge which offered an indication that the new floodplain is forming goodwin 2004 4 2 role of his in river morphology and ecosystem development discharge is a governing variable that controls many processes and geomorphology variation in stream ecosystems this study represents the qmf and qsf as the channel maintaining discharge and qbf as the channel forming discharge most of the morphology adjustments are observed within sub channels in fig 9 which further indicate the importance of moderate floods between the qsf and qbf on geomorphic in braided river qmf is an important hydrological factor that causes the main channel undercut and control of community structure and ecosystem function thorp et al 2006 with water level rises to the floodplain it has the strongest restriction on flow and the highest sediment transport efficiency of main channel main channel erosion cause bank collapsing and river sinuosity and intensifies the heterogeneity of the cross sectional elevation in fig s2 that increasing the diversion ratio of main channel and improving the resistance to floods the importance of qsf on geomorphic change and wetland ecosystem stability has been recognized it affects the exchange of oxygen nutrients etc with channels connection and promotes species diversity by providing rich habitats and improving predator avoidance for terrestrial animals and plants bourke 2002 mosepele et al 2009 thorp et al 2006 tockner et al 2000 but affection process on river morphology variation is still less explained different from qmf qsf probably maintains the sub channel morphology incliding branch numbers and shapes with flow erosion flow greater than qsf causes adjacent sub channels merging and streamline changing in fig 15 and frequent sub channel variation by small and medium floods in fig 9 and fig 14 welled proofed it the effect of qbf on river morphology is obvious in fig 12 and consistent with the results of other regions such as mountain rivers streams alluvial plains brayshaw 2012 chen et al 2021 correlation analysis shows that the variation of tsi in main channel is significantly correlated with the magnitude and duration of floods over qbf in table 4 tiny changes of river morphology in 1988 with floods over qbf indicates that both the flood magnitude and duration are controls on channel reset dean and schmidt 2013 different from the most regions such as gravel bed braided river in italy that large floods causing main channel cutting off directly bertoldi et al 2010 the straighten of main channel in this sandy bed braided river is a cumulative result of several years lasting large floods over qbf and causing increasing of braid ratio and decreasing of curvature in the subsequent adjustment and restoration of the river the amplitude variation of the channels in the study area affects the energy distribution and entropy of the river leopold and langbein 1962 yang 1971 and further affects the river stability but due to the limitation of time accuracy of vertical topographic data this study does not analyze the energy changes to provide a fuller demonstration of the research results 4 3 geomorphological evolution the river morphology changes over the past 35 years occurred in three temporal phases fig 12 and differed spatially in four segments fig 11 during phase 1 from 1984 to 1997 the river was moderate meandering with no significant morphology variation adjustments were mostly observed within sub channels fig 9 the distributary ratio advantage of main channel was obvious from the spatial distribution of deep water and shallow area increasing flood resistance during phase 2 from 1998 to 2002 the river remodeled and geomorphic changed including meander migration curvature decreasing avulsion and floodplain scour these variations leaded to hydraulic condition and vegetation redistribution and reorganization of spatial pattern of habitats for fish birds and other organisms röpke et al 2016 wang et al 2020 during phase 3 from 2003 to 2018 a prevailing trend to main channel bending highlights and flattened floodplain developed a series of furrow and further merged to form the sub channel or disappear the major river morphology variation happened in seg 3 and seg 4 from fig 12 b main channel in seg 3 cut off to straight and bended later further causing the variation in seg 4 with long sequence and high temporal resolution many types of main channel changes occurred in this study including cutting off by floods e g 1998 and 2001 bending with bars erosion and deposition e g 2000 sub channel distributary capacity increasing and transitioning to main channel e g 2014 and common swinging with bank erosion sub channel morphology affected by many factors including inflow angle bar shape river characteristics etc evolved more dramatically and less regular over the years the spatial distribution of channels limited the connectivity of the river especially in dry season which is the important fish spawning period zhou et al 2019 and further affected ecosystem the spatial differences of river morphology variation in fig 9 indicates that evolution is a result of multiple factors including river banks confinement rinaldi et al 2016 cross section expansion contraction doering et al 2007 upstream variation and elevation heterogeneity in cross sections bank confinement or river width is the primary condition for the plateau valley wetland of which banks are mostly composed of mountains or terraces with fixing width and limiting the maximum river variation hundey and ashmore 2009 but the difference of ci is not sensitive for morphology variation within the low confinement river in fig 10 shoreline ratio is deciding conditions in this study the expansion contraction of river width in seg 3 fig 11 causes the flow velocity to decrease and increase partly and affect the sediment carry capacity leading to erosion and deposition dean and schmidt 2013 siviglia et al 2008 the impact of upstream variation on main channel variation was well represented in seg 4 but sub channel evolution is more correlated with the elevation variation in cross section undulated beaches are easier to form stable sub channels while flat beaches are opposite with changeable number and shape of sub channels 5 conclusion in this study we conducted evaluations of the impact of hydrology and river characteristics on morphology variation of yanni wetland for 35 years we used wolman miller approach and nash apporach to calculate the effective discharge qef and q1 2 and established a method to calculate qmf qsf and qbf combined remote sensing with daily discharge data morphology indicators were calculated with satellite images in december each year from 1984 to 2018 the major findings are summarized as follows 1 the qbf of the study area is 9690 m3 s and equals to 5 6 year flood approximately the q1 2 is 4876 m3 s associated with 1 year flood event the qsf qef and qmf are 3070 m3 s 2367 m3 s 650 m3 s respectively the effective discharge with nash approach is more suitable in the study area considering the importance of 1 year flood in ecosystem and river evolution and the method we established to calculate the flow characteristics including qbf qsf qmf is efficiency and convenient with high accuracy and suitable for the study of his in the wide valley river with braiding channels but it also required the frequency and range of basic data and only represent the average state over years qbf especially 2 the results obtained in this study highlight the complexity of landform response particularly river morphology variation to different hydrology indicators qmf is channel maintain discharge scouring the main channel qsf is channel maintaining discharge of great significance in maintaining material and energy connectivity in braiding channels qbf is channel forming discharge that straighten the main channel and reorganized the river morphology with the magnitude and duration small and moderate floods within the qsf and qbf are important as the morphology adjustments are mainly observed in sub channels 3 the river morphology variation in the study area mainly included the main channel cutting off to straight and recovering to bend and sub channels removing and recombination the characteristics of river courses affect the sensitivity to hydrology and lead to the spatial difference in river morphology variation thereinto shoreline ratio and upstream variation are most important factors causing main channel changing and the elevation variation in cross sections use to impact sub channels evolution the evolution of rivers is complex and is influenced by location specific factors as each floodplain system is unique and the concept of hydrology indictors has considerable potential to aid in the analysis and management of stream ecosystems this study showed suitability for the determination of the relationship between

3548,river and floodplains are process response systems that geomorphic states are typically results of hydrologic drivers and geologic setting large sand bed braided rivers geomorphology shows more sensitive dynamic evolution and significant space time difference however few investigations have been focused on it here we show that river characteristics including expansion contraction and elevation heterogeneity of the river cross sections affect erosion and deposition partially and cause spatially differential variation of morphology in the yanni wetland in the middle of yarlung zangbo brahmaputra river ybr and interannual hydrology process is main responsible for temporal river morphology variation as the different impact of each his on river morphology we found the river morphology varied significantly with main channel shifting and branches removing over the past 35 years within his bankfull flow qbf is the channel forming discharge equal to 5 6 year flood approximately the sub bankfull flow qsf and main channel full flow qmf are channel maintaining discharge affected by the broad width main channel straighten was a result of years of large floods over qbf small and moderate floods within the qsf and qbf are also important as the morphology adjustments were mainly observed in sub channels and effective discharges with the nash approach q1 2 are more suitable in braided river compared with wolman miller approach qef our research highlighted complexity response of landform and hydrology to river morphological variations in sand bed braided riverine

and croke 1992 phillips 2010 among them hydrology is the primary influence on sediment transport and channel morphology in alluvial streams doyle et al 2005 many studies have been conducted to investigate the relationship between hydrology and geomorphology and several hydrology indicators pradhan et al 2021 including effective discharge qef bankfull flow qbf overbank flow qobf sub bankfull flow qsf have been major criteria in fluvial geomorphology lópez tarazón and batalla 2014 specifically qef represents the discharge or the narrow range of discharges that maximizes the effectiveness of transport in a stream with time and it is closely conflated with the channel maintaining discharge hassan et al 2014 lenzi et al 2006 wolman and miller 1960 qbf is defined as the flow that reaches the transition area between a given channel and its floodplain generally within 1 to 5 year return period leopold et al 1964 reckendorfer and walter 2012 shields et al 2003 it is widely considered as the dominant mechanism in the floodplain development and evolution resulting in the inundation of entire floodplains lecce and pavlowsky 2004 walling and he 1998 qsf is involved in both instream and floodplain processes and is carried across the floodplain by the networks of depressional features with fewer obstructions bourke 2002 thorp et al 2006 qef is primarily related to sediment and river bed et al whereas qbf qobf and qsf are typically associated with river morphology parameters including channel width slope meander length and pattern bourke 2002 kaase and kupfer 2016 these his are not comprehensive as they ignore the impact of main channel full flow qmf on the dry season of the geo ecosystem in braiding rivers and with widely used of remote sensing in hydrology han et al 2019 liao et al 2020 a new convenient scientific method to estimate his with remote sensing is needed compared with the traditional filed measurements hassan et al 2014 river characteristics as results of geological setting also impact the river morphology variation the bank on both side constrain the lateral width of channel evolution rinaldi et al 2016 and expansion contraction sections cause local reductions in sediment transport capacity and result in significant geomorphological changes dean and schmidt 2013 the river morphology variation including bar construction major et al 2008 meander migration harrison et al 2011 avulsions ashworth et al 2004 and braiding desloges and church 2011 et al are describe by different morphology indicators mis ashmore ashmore 1991 proposed the channel

2010 leys and werritty 1999 mount et al 2005 the sinuosity index is generally defined as the ratio of channel length to valley length gugliotta and saito 2019 schumm 1963 the branch ratio is used to describe the braiding of river pradhan et al 2021 and with the development of computer technology and satellites remotely sensed imageries have been widely used to calculate mis chen et al 2012 liro et al 2020 petts and gurnell 2005 wang et al 2019 the ybr is the longest plateau river in china with high species diversity and influenced by unique cold high altitude climate conditions making it one of the most fragile areas in asia yuanzheng et al 2017 riverine wetlands are widely distributed in ybr consisting of braiding channels vast floodplains and sand bed zhaoyin et al 2014 exhibiting sensitive river morphology responses to hydrology process however studies on the variations in the morphology of yrb are scarce and until now the few morphology studies that have been conducted on yrb have primarily focused around the downstream in india pradhan et al 2021 sarkar et al 2012 sarma 2005 or the middle reaches in china ji et al 2018 zhang 1998 under the impact from human activities understanding the development mechanism of the river morphology in this unique fragile ecosystem are urgent to adopt responding protection strategies but due to the limited previous researches for this area the specific morphology variation and main impact factors are still unclear the objectives of the present study are to i establish a new method to estimate his including qmf qbf and qsf based on the remote sensing and hydrology data ii estimate the effective discharge with suspended sediment load and the relationship with other his iii analyze the impact of different his on temporal river morphology variation siviglia et al analyze the impact of river characteristics on spatially differential of river morphology variation 2 methodology 2 1 study area the ybr is the longest river in tibet and at the junction of the nyang tributary formed the yanni wetland the wetland covers an area of approximately 82 5 km2 fig 1 and is situated immediately upstream of the yarlung zangbo grand canyon geotectonic activities and numerous sedimentation processes developed the wetland with gentle sloping and wide cross section table 1 which provides habitat for approximately 175 species fig 2 b influenced by the plateau temperate subhumid monsoon climate hydrology is characterized by alternating high flow conditions during spring summer and low flow conditions during autumn winter fig 3 a combined with runoff groundwater and snowmelt supply the average annual discharge is 1894 m3 s and the highest value of red ratio of maximum daily discharge to minimum daily discharge is 34 that the hydrology process in the region was relatively stable without extreme floods events compared with the downstream in indian with red over 1482 pradhan et al 2021 the average annual sediment load is 8 6 106 t y with cvs coefficient of variation of suspended sediment concentration equals to 1 21 and the bed sand particle size d50 span a large range from 0 04 to 0 35 mm due to the sand fixing action of vegetation part of the inner bar height is 5 to 8 m fig 1 which accommodate high regime of flow variation 2 2 basic data acquisition and analysis table 2 presents daily discharge daily suspended sediment load and collected satellite images for the yanni wetland the flood frequency curve and daily flow frequency curve are shown in fig 3 b a total of 35 satellite images corresponding to the 1984 2018 period was downloaded from google earth and used to calculate mis and geographic information was preprocessed using arc gis10 2 esir america images collected from the satellites hj 1a hj 1b and landsat 5 8 were used to analyze qmf qbf and qsf by drawing the water area discharge curve wd c however owing to heavy rainfall and cloudy weather during the flood season only limited satellite imagery data were available as shown in table 2 based on field investigation and satellite data the landscape of the study area was classified as deep water shallow water depth 0 5 m sandy land grass land and shrub land as shown in fig 2b and fig 4 before using the supervised classification method in envi exelis visual information solutions american software to interpret the variations in land types in the study area over the years several pretreatments including radiometric calibration local clipping atmospheric correction and geometric correction were performed please refer to supplementary material for the specific processing in method section the correlation between specific his and mis was presented by pearson correlation coefficient calculated by spss and for clearer understanding the structure and content of this paper the flow chart was shown in supplementary material in fig s1 2 3 hydrology indicators sediment transport and flow scour are the main factors that influence river morphology in this study several his including main channel full flow qmf sub bankfull flow qsf bankfull flow qbf and effective discharge were used to analyze the hydrological effects on river morphology maintaining and reforming the qmf qsf and qbf are the flows that fill the main channel sub channel and the bank respectively in fig 5 a and calculated with the wd c suspended sediments and bedload sediments both have effects on river morphology the latter is significant in gravel rivers lenzi et al 2006 phillips 2010 while the former is more important in flatten sandy rivers as it comprises the maximum portion of total load goodwin 2004 pradhan et al 2021 and is the only sediment load we could get in the study area wang et al 2020 we calculated qef with the suspended sediment concentrations according to eq 1 2 and 3 qef representing the effective discharge based on the wolman and miller approach wolman and miller 1960 while effective discharge based on the nash approach nash 1994 is identical to the expression for half load discharge q1 2 introduced by vogel et al 2003 1 q s a q b 2 q ef w o l m a n a n d m i l l e r exp μ b 1 σ 2 3 q 1 2 n a s h e

the fitting parameters 2 4 river characteristics 2 4 1 confinement index according to rinaldi 2016 the confinement index ci in eq 4 which is defined as the ratio between the floodplain width including the channel and the channel width is used to represent the bank restraint degree on the channels but the expansion contraction of the river courses increases the sensitivity of the ci to representative cross in the study area and we redefined ci as the ratio between the floodplain area and the river area in the different segments and with the widely distribution of shallows in the study area we simplified the eq 4 into eq 5 and eq 6 in which cic represents the confinement of the floodplain to the deep water and ciw represents the confinement of the floodplain to the whole water area both deep water and shallow area confinement levels determined for the multithread along the area rinaldi et al 2016 including high confinement with ci in the range 1 1 5 medium confinement with ci in the range 1 5 2 and low confinement with ci greater than 2 4 ci w p w 5 ci c a t a c 6 ci w a t a w where wp represents the floodplain width including the channel w represents the channel width at represents the total area of the floodplain ac represents the area of the deep water area and aw represents the area of the whole water area including the deep water and shallows 2 4 2 shoreline

topography elevation difference ed shown in eq 8 is defined as the elevation different between average elevation and lowest point of each section and concepted in fig 5 b coefficient of variation of cross section elevation cve shown in eq 9 is defined as the coefficient of variation of cross section elevation within the river banks the density and isometric of elevation measurement points were

river energy along its course and is shown as the variation of characteristics such as tsi thalweg swing index si sinuosity index br braided ratio c curvature ɑ flow deflection angle bn branch number and the study area was divided into four segments seg 1 4 with five cross sections sec 1 5 based on the spatial distribution of floodplains as well as river morphology to analysis shown in fig 1 2 5 1 thalweg swing index the tsi as shown in eq 10 is defined as the ratio of the intersection area of the thalweg to its length in two phases for a more accurate determination of the variations in the tsi the swing to the left and right banks were defined as and respectively 10 t s i n 1 2 δ s l n l n 1 where ln represents the length of the thalweg m in the n year and ln 1 represents the length of the

represents the length of the river m 2 5 3 curvature this study identified curvature of bend apex by using a 3 point circle in autocad for the main channel in each segment shown in fig 6 if there are multiple bend apexes in a segment this study chooses the larger curvature to represent the whole segment as the greater curvature the higher probability that the river course will be cut off and rerouted with the influence of hydrology 2 5 4 braiding index the bn is defined as the number of branches at baseflow that are separated by bars and some scholars combine sand bars with other braided river characteristic to obtain br as shown in eq 12 which is defined as the ratio of channel length to river length pradhan et al 2021 12 br l l r where l represents the length of channels including sub channels and main channel m and lr represents the length of the river m 3 results all large rivers worldwide are affected by human activities to varying degrees and these activities disrupt the natural development of the morphologies of such rivers clerici et al 2015 the site for this study is characterized by limited human interference thus the river maintains natural hydrology processes as well as its natural channel morphology in this regard it serves as a useful case study for the investigation of the effects of natural hydrology processes on the channel shape of large rivers 3 1 hydrology 3 1 1 main channel flow sub bankfull flow and bankfull flow based on satellite images in tabel 2 we interpretated the water area of the study area with different discharge in fig 7 and got the bn and with the daily discharge corresponded to each image we drew the wd c and bn with increasing flow of the study area in fig 8 a and b we collected all satellite image data in this area but floods were often accompanied with cloudy which greatly reduced the number of effective photos however the existing data also showed interesting variation and well explained the connection and expansion of branches in the river specifically with flow increase the water area growth rate gradually slowed down and tended to zero the water level growth rate also reduced somehow bn increased significantly then merged and maintained two branches over a large flow range finally became one branch these variations were results of the terraced channel cross section formed by geological activity shown in fig 7 with small discharge from 430 to 650 m3 s the flow was restricted to the narrow deep main channel causing slight change in the water area and bn in fig 8 a and b and the water level increased significantly until overflow to the floodplains and sub channel as the discharge continued increasing to 2720 m3 s the streamlines tended to be complicated and rose to the maximum bn with all branches connecting and in the following certain flow range the change of wd c and bn showed an obvious plateau period with the flow greater than 3070 m3 s bn maintained the maximum but the water overflooded from the sub channels to the floodplain with a significant increase in the water area until branches merged as flow in the floodplain connected them with the inner island in the study area flow rose to 7020 m3 s bn continued decreasing to two and although wd c tended to be flat when the flow rate was greater than 8000 there was also an obvious turning point between 9690 and 9820 indicating that the river was in a state of full bank and further inundate both banks and inner island through the variation of water area and branch numbers with discharge considering definitions of his we finally got the qmf as 650 m3 s qsf as 3070 m3 s and qbf as 9690 m3 s the water level in the study area during qmf qsf qbf were calculated with hec ras model based on the measured topography data in 2013 fig s 2 to analysis the accuracy of the his determined by the wd c in fig 8 with remote sensing the small elevation difference between the calculated water levels and the banks elevation showed that qmf qsf and qbf were suitable in the study area 3 1 2 effective discharge computation the relationship between water discharge and sediment load in the study area is shown in fig 3 c the discharge sediment relationship varied inter annual from 2005 to 2013 based on the wolman miller and nash approaches we summarized the effective discharge of suspended sediments in table 3 and fig 3 b same as most research vogel et al 2003 there were significant difference between q1 2 and qef as q1 2 was 4876 m3 s and closed to 1 year flood event but qef was much smaller equal to 2367 m3 s 3 2 river characteristic 3 2 1 confinement index the interpretation of the satellite images fig 9 corresponding to the 1984 2018 period in december showed that during the dry season deep water was distributed in the main channel and shallow water 0 5 m predominantly appeared in the sub channels the ranges of ciw and cic for the four segments within the 1984 2018 period in study area were shown in fig 10 a particularly according to ciw the reach was almost medium or low confinement with part of the years was high confinement in seg 4 however according to cic all the segments in the reach exhibited low confinement the difference between ciw and cic indicated that the shallow area significantly influenced analyzing the confinement of the river bank when the shallow water area accounted for a relatively large ration of the river area the shallow effect had great significance fig 10 b particularly in seg 4 the shallow area significantly increased the degree of restriction of the river channel and leaded to the illusion of high confinement in fact the morphology changes of seg 4 were the most frequent which further indicates that not only the water width but also certain water depth requirements should be considered in the ci especially in floodplain meanwhile the ciw of seg 3 was significantly different from others in fig 10 a causing by the strongly morphology variation and active spatial fluctuation of deep water region on the whole seg 2 and seg 3 had similar ci and so did the seg 1 and seg 4 the result helped to explain the response of channel morphology to hydrology 3 2 2 shoreline ratio and elevation heterogeneity figure 11 a showed the variation of width of the whole floodplain and shoreline ratio sr in the study area seg 1 and seg 2 with small sr and less difference between maximum width average width and minimum width seg 3 was the widest part with large left sr indicating the river bank expansion contraction and the right bank was bound by the mountain with small change the cross section of the seg 4 shrunk causing most significant variation of width in the study area but constrained by the mountains on both sides the sr is relatively small figure 11 b showed the coefficient of variation of cross section elevation cve and elevation difference ed of average cross elevation and lowest elevation along the study area according to the measured topography in 2013 fig s 2 the cve and ed fluctuated along the study area but them in seg 3 and seg 4 were generally low indicating the weak heterogeneity of the cross section elevation part of sections in seg 1 and seg 2 had acute angles with the flow direction causing local small cv and ed 3 3 geomorphological evolution 3 3 1 thalweg swing index the main channel significantly lateral migration over the timeframe in fig 9 and fig 12 showed the variation of tsi during 1984 2018 tsi from 1984 to 1997 fluctuated in small amplitudes as the thalweg swung back and forth from left to right primarily resulting from the formation movement extinction cycle of the bars in seg 4 fig 9 but river bended in the front of seg 3 after years erosion and sedimentation piégay et al 2008 which weaken the resistance to large flood events from 1998 to 2002 the main channel cut off floodplain erosion and tsi variated significant high flow events in 1998 and 1999 scoured the sub channel in the seg 3 and eventually shifted the main channel and floods in 2002 further pushed the new top blunt point to downstream formed in shape of n between seg 3 and seg 4 after a brief trimming in 2001 large flow events in 2002 cut off of river again causing the tsi to vary drastically second only to the change observed in 1998 during 2003 to 2017 the swing of the main channel remained weak and manifested as slow erosion toward the left bank and by this stage shown in fig 9 the change of tsi was mainly due to the adjustment of main channel in seg 3 and seg 4 however tsi changed greatly again in 2018 as can be seen from the fig 9 flow diversion ratios of sub channel and main channel near the inner bar in seg 3 were close in 2017 and large floods in 2018 led to an increasing in the diversion ratio of past sub channel and transiting to the main channel and talweg shifted 3 3 2 sinuosity index the riverbed type changed conspicuously according to the fig 13 a before 1998 it kept moderate meandering with si approximate 1 4 garcía 2015 leopold and wolman 1957 with floods in 1998 to 2002 cutting off of the main channel in seg 3 the si decreased and river bed almost changed into straight type although si slowly increased since then the riverbed was still sinuous type 3 3 3 curvature and flow deflection angle curvature c and flow deflection angle ɑ of segments in the study area showed obvious spatial differences in fig 13 b and c interannual variations of curvature in seg 1 and seg 2 were minor with main channel scouring and the sinuosity of the two segments slightly decreased in fig 12 the ɑ of seg 1 was still stable but that of seg 2 changed with flow direction varied at the outlet section both c and ɑ of seg 3 and seg 4 showed obvious variation during river remodeling period from 1998 to 2002 the newly main channel squeezed the original and formed a short time n shape in 2000 resulting in temporary high c and ɑ and the main channel cut off into straight in 2002 caused low curvature and ɑ in seg 3 and lasting for several years until river bend the c and ɑ of seg 4 varied well followed seg 3 3 3 4 braiding index the branch ratio br for the whole river area was shown in fig 13 a br volatility rose within the range of 2 5 4 5 with sub channel variations and inner bars moving the br from 1984 to 1992 was stable and rose up since 1993 with sub channel increased in seg 4 the river remolding from 1998 to 2002 resulted in continuously high br until gradual stabilization of river morphology decreasing br since 2009 compared with 30 years ago flatted floodplain after river remolding generated more sub channels and the braids of channels increased the bn of the sandy floodplain with wide cross section and flatted terrain were always greater than 2 but different in time and spatiality shown in fig 14 the bn for sec 1 and sec 2 were always 2 the former was restrained by the banks owing to the development of the river morphology the latter was restrained to a lesser extent but exhibiting uniform morphology along the cross width considering that the cross section in seg 3 showed both expansion and contraction fig 5 b the interannual variations of bn in sec 3 and sec 4 were complex comparing fig 9 and fig 14 showed that the bn of seg 3 varied with the main channel changing and the sub channel braiding during 1984 2018 the bn of sec 4 decreased owing to the sub channel merged additionally the bn of sec 5 exhibited complex and unstable variation owing to the shrinking of the river course and the change in the incident angle of main channel 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between his and method uncertainty different from the most research estimated qsf and qbf via the hydraulic analysis of field investigating bankfull geomorphic data such as channel width cross sectional area meander length and pattern and the mean bankfull depth through bourke 2002 kaase and kupfer 2016 savenije 2003 xia et al 2014 we established a new remote sensing based method to calculate them with the frequent revisit time and large spatial coverage of satellites this method is more convenient with reliable accuracy in fig s2 to support the evaluation of hydrology it is suitable for the study of his in wide valley rivers with braiding channels which is difficult to the in situ measure and supplies an innovative method for exploiting satellite observation in hydrological applications han et al 2019 liao et al 2020 but the resolution and quantity of satellite images are crucial to the accuracy of the results in principle the resolution needs to be less than sub channel width as branch numbers are important factor considered in the remote sensing based method and due to the time span of images collected his calculated with this method only represent the average over years especially for qbf according to the method we established the qbf is 5 6 year flood event approximating the moderate floods i e those with recurrence intervals of 1 to 5 years dunne and leopold 1978 williams 1978 that is similar to most hydrologic research brayshaw 2012 chen et al 2021 quader et al 2008 the magnitude of the half load discharge numerically equal to effective discharge with nash approach in this study q1 2 is correlated with the 1 year flood event slightly above the magnitude of the qsf providing additional information concerning the shape and skew of the effectiveness relation brayshaw 2012 vogel et al 2003 qef is smaller and more frequent pradhan et al 2021 than qsf while qmf is only occurs in the dry period the correspondence between the calculated effective discharge and the bankfull discharge also intrigues most geomorphologists brayshaw 2012 chen et al 2021 quader et al 2008 affected by the broad width and braiding channels in the study area qbf occurred only for a short time causing limited sediment transport capacity and significant larger than the computed effective discharge which offered an indication that the new floodplain is forming goodwin 2004 4 2 role of his in river morphology and ecosystem development discharge is a governing variable that controls many processes and geomorphology variation in stream ecosystems this study represents the qmf and qsf as the channel maintaining discharge and qbf as the channel forming discharge most of the morphology adjustments are observed within sub channels in fig 9 which further indicate the importance of moderate floods between the qsf and qbf on geomorphic in braided river qmf is an important hydrological factor that causes the main channel undercut and control of community structure and ecosystem function thorp et al 2006 with water level rises to the floodplain it has the strongest restriction on flow and the highest sediment transport efficiency of main channel main channel erosion cause bank collapsing and river sinuosity and intensifies the heterogeneity of the cross sectional elevation in fig s2 that increasing the diversion ratio of main channel and improving the resistance to floods the importance of qsf on geomorphic change and wetland ecosystem stability has been recognized it affects the exchange of oxygen nutrients etc with channels connection and promotes species diversity by providing rich habitats and improving predator avoidance for terrestrial animals and plants bourke 2002 mosepele et al 2009 thorp et al 2006 tockner et al 2000 but affection process on river morphology variation is still less explained different from qmf qsf probably maintains the sub channel morphology incliding branch numbers and shapes with flow erosion flow greater than qsf causes adjacent sub channels merging and streamline changing in fig 15 and frequent sub channel variation by small and medium floods in fig 9 and fig 14 welled proofed it the effect of qbf on river morphology is obvious in fig 12 and consistent with the results of other regions such as mountain rivers streams alluvial plains brayshaw 2012 chen et al 2021 correlation analysis shows that the variation of tsi in main channel is significantly correlated with the magnitude and duration of floods over qbf in table 4 tiny changes of river morphology in 1988 with floods over qbf indicates that both the flood magnitude and duration are controls on channel reset dean and schmidt 2013 different from the most regions such as gravel bed braided river in italy that large floods causing main channel cutting off directly bertoldi et al 2010 the straighten of main channel in this sandy bed braided river is a cumulative result of several years lasting large floods over qbf and causing increasing of braid ratio and decreasing of curvature in the subsequent adjustment and restoration of the river the amplitude variation of the channels in the study area affects the energy distribution and entropy of the river leopold and langbein 1962 yang 1971 and further affects the river stability but due to the limitation of time accuracy of vertical topographic data this study does not analyze the energy changes to provide a fuller demonstration of the research results 4 3 geomorphological evolution the river morphology changes over the past 35 years occurred in three temporal phases fig 12 and differed spatially in four segments fig 11 during phase 1 from 1984 to 1997 the river was moderate meandering with no significant morphology variation adjustments were mostly observed within sub channels fig 9 the distributary ratio advantage of main channel was obvious from the spatial distribution of deep water and shallow area increasing flood resistance during phase 2 from 1998 to 2002 the river remodeled and geomorphic changed including meander migration curvature decreasing avulsion and floodplain scour these variations leaded to hydraulic condition and vegetation redistribution and reorganization of spatial pattern of habitats for fish birds and other organisms röpke et al 2016 wang et al 2020 during phase 3 from 2003 to 2018 a prevailing trend to main channel bending highlights and flattened floodplain developed a series of furrow and further merged to form the sub channel or disappear the major river morphology variation happened in seg 3 and seg 4 from fig 12 b main channel in seg 3 cut off to straight and bended later further causing the variation in seg 4 with long sequence and high temporal resolution many types of main channel changes occurred in this study including cutting off by floods e g 1998 and 2001 bending with bars erosion and deposition e g 2000 sub channel distributary capacity increasing and transitioning to main channel e g 2014 and common swinging with bank erosion sub channel morphology affected by many factors including inflow angle bar shape river characteristics etc evolved more dramatically and less regular over the years the spatial distribution of channels limited the connectivity of the river especially in dry season which is the important fish spawning period zhou et al 2019 and further affected ecosystem the spatial differences of river morphology variation in fig 9 indicates that evolution is a result of multiple factors including river banks confinement rinaldi et al 2016 cross section expansion contraction doering et al 2007 upstream variation and elevation heterogeneity in cross sections bank confinement or river width is the primary condition for the plateau valley wetland of which banks are mostly composed of mountains or terraces with fixing width and limiting the maximum river variation hundey and ashmore 2009 but the difference of ci is not sensitive for morphology variation within the low confinement river in fig 10 shoreline ratio is deciding conditions in this study the expansion contraction of river width in seg 3 fig 11 causes the flow velocity to decrease and increase partly and affect the sediment carry capacity leading to erosion and deposition dean and schmidt 2013 siviglia et al 2008 the impact of upstream variation on main channel variation was well represented in seg 4 but sub channel evolution is more correlated with the elevation variation in cross section undulated beaches are easier to form stable sub channels while flat beaches are opposite with changeable number and shape of sub channels 5 conclusion in this study we conducted evaluations of the impact of hydrology and river characteristics on morphology variation of yanni wetland for 35 years we used wolman miller approach and nash apporach to calculate the effective discharge qef and q1 2 and established a method to calculate qmf qsf and qbf combined remote sensing with daily discharge data morphology indicators were calculated with satellite images in december each year from 1984 to 2018 the major findings are summarized as follows 1 the qbf of the study area is 9690 m3 s and equals to 5 6 year flood approximately the q1 2 is 4876 m3 s associated with 1 year flood event the qsf qef and qmf are 3070 m3 s 2367 m3 s 650 m3 s respectively the effective discharge with nash approach is more suitable in the study area considering the importance of 1 year flood in ecosystem and river evolution and the method we established to calculate the flow characteristics including qbf qsf qmf is efficiency and convenient with high accuracy and suitable for the study of his in the wide valley river with braiding channels but it also required the frequency and range of basic data and only represent the average state over years qbf especially 2 the results obtained in this study highlight the complexity of landform response particularly river morphology variation to different hydrology indicators qmf is channel maintain discharge scouring the main channel qsf is channel maintaining discharge of great significance in maintaining material and energy connectivity in braiding channels qbf is channel forming discharge that straighten the main channel and reorganized the river morphology with the magnitude and duration small and moderate floods within the qsf and qbf are important as the morphology adjustments are mainly observed in sub channels 3 the river morphology variation in the study area mainly included the main channel cutting off to straight and recovering to bend and sub channels removing and recombination the characteristics of river courses affect the sensitivity to hydrology and lead to the spatial difference in river morphology variation thereinto shoreline ratio and upstream variation are most important factors causing main channel changing and the elevation variation in cross sections use to impact sub channels evolution the evolution of rivers is complex and is influenced by location specific factors as each floodplain system is unique and the concept of hydrology indictors has considerable potential to aid in the analysis and management of stream ecosystems this study showed suitability for the determination of the relationship between existing geomorphological processes continuous hydrology processes and ecosystem services funding this work was supported by the national nature science foundation of china grant no 91547211

3549,land ocean coordinated management is an important wisdom for environmental protection and pollution prevention of marine and river systems taking liao river and estuarine as an example the pollution characteristics temporal and spatial distribution and change features of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in sediments in recent 20 years were studied from two different analysis perspectives of land and ocean the research showed that the pollution of pahs in the sediments of liao river and estuarine was not optimistic the concentration of σ16pahs was 48 28 000 ng g the carcinogenic risk to humans shouldn t be ignored which could cause the loss of life expectancy 0 03 4 2 years the traceability analysis showed that the use and combustion of fossil fuels were the main sources of pahs in addition the leakage of oil during the intensive transportation of ships in coastal waters might also contribute to pahs the concentrations of pahs had obvious temporal and spatial distribution characteristics spatially estuaries tributaries main streams temporally wet season normal season dry season in liao river whereas the variation of pahs in estuarine sediments was slight in the past 20 years the concentration of pahs in liao river had increased first and then decreased reaching maximum in 2010 however the concentration of pahs seldom decreased in estuarine sediments in which showed a more serious situation of pahs pollution control keywords land ocean coordination pahs liao river estuarine sediments 1 introduction ocean and river systems are connected by water and exchange frequently alvarez et al 2013 they have regional differences at most but not essential shi et al 2020 therefore it is unscientific and impractical to separate each other just because of the division of management responsibilities however since the 1980s in order to solve the pollution problem of environment chinese government separated the environmental protection work on land from the ocean after the environmental protection departments and marine management departments had been established no suspense that this management method was not able to control the environmental pollution effectively li et al 2020 the purpose of pollution prevention and control is not only to reduce the concentration of various pollution factors but also to maintain the health and integrity of watershed and ocean ecosystem sajjad et al 2018 therefore the old concept of treating where it was polluted must be changed the most effective and important means to protect the environment is to carry out a combination prevention and control method between river and marine which must be based on the evolution results of environmental quality shen et al 2016 in 2018 in order to improve the effectiveness of environmental protection and eliminate the boundary between marine and land in environmental management zhang et al 2021 the chinese government had implemented institutional reform and put forward measures for land ocean coordinated pollution prevention and control due to the short implementing time and lack of basic research although the implemented of this policy was a significant progress the specific technical requirements and management methods were all insufficient zhao et al 2021 as is known to all compared with the environmental pollution control of rivers the prevention and recovery of marine pollution is more difficult and longer periodic wang et al 2020 therefore the river and estuarine areas were chose as the study area in this research where the interaction forces of ocean and land were the strongest from the perspective of land ocean coordinated this paper made comprehensive study on the environmental quality and historical evolution trend of environment pollution so as to explore the fundamental cause of poor effectiveness of pollution control measures it provided basic research conclusions technical enlightenment and new ideas for national authorities to more effectively implement environmental pollution prevention and control liao river system and its estuary area were chose as research examples where was located in northeast china 40 00 n 43 00 n 121 00 e 125 00 e china s most important industrial and mining areas were distributed here he et al 2015 however in recent 20 years due to the continuous intensive industrial activities the pollution problem of organic pollutants primarily pahs in the middle and lower reaches of liao river and its estuary had become more and more serious ke et al 2017 since 2008 china s environmental protection departments and marine departments had taken pollution prevention and control measures for many times on the serious pollution of pahs but the treatment results had been not satisfactory zhang et al 2010 in this study the temporal and spatial distribution characteristic and health risk of pahs were evaluated from the perspective of land ocean coordinated in addition combined with historical data the evolution of pahs pollution level in recent 20 years was analyzed pahs have potential toxicity carcinogenicity mutagenicity and bioaccumulation erik et al 2020 which are able to enter the body through ingestion dermal uptake and inhalation wu et al 2011 thus affecting human health timoszczuk et al 2021 in the 1980 s the u s environmental protection agency usepa listed 16 kinds of unbranched pahs as priority pollutants usepa 1979 because pahs have low solubility and hydrophobicity khiari et al 2021 which are often adsorbed on particles sediments turn to be the ultimate destination of most pahs compared with seawater or rivers james et al 1996 however the form of pahs adsorbed on sediment particles is not stable yang et al 2020 once the sediment environment changes such as underwater disturbance strong storm ph and salinity change pahs will be released into the water immediately marko et al 2001 resulting in a secondary pollution liao and yu 2020 therefore it is of great significance for pollution prevention and control to carry out sediment pahs pollution level temporal and spatial distribution characteristics and health risk assessment 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and processing the study area liao river and estuarine was located in northeast china which was one of the seven major rivers in china yang et al 2011 with a total length of 1394 km and a drainage area of 2 0 105 km2 liao river consisted of two main streams one was shuangtaizi river which entered the sea through panshan panjin city with a length of 516 km the other was daliao river with a length of 94 km liao estuarine located at the northernmost of liaodong bay that was one of the largest bays in china where the water exchange capacity was very weak and the diffusion rate of pollutants was very low luo et al 2021 in 2020 183 surface sediment samples were collected from liao river and estuarine at wet season august normal season april and dry season december respectively grab sampler iron was used to get the surface sediment about 0 10 cm samples the coordinates of each sampling station were determined by gps and recorded together with the location information of surrounding factories or sewage outlets for more details of sampling station information please see figure 1 4 samples were collected at each sample station mixed wrapped with tin foil and then brought back to the laboratory at low temperature 18 all samples were freeze dried vacuum freeze dryer 24 h and ground 180 μm after removal of impurities then 1000 g of each sample was taken out and stored in brown glass bottles at 4 preparing for analysis 2 2 sample purification about 15 0 g of the dry sediment samples was weighed and added with 15 0 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate 3 0 g of copper powder 100 ml of extraction solution acetone n hexane v v 1 1 and recovery indicators d8 p p ddt cb155 cb65 and tbb the samples were reflux extracted for 24 h through soxhlet apparatus the extract was evaporated to about 2 ml by rotary evaporation and stored in a collection bottle zhang et al 2021 all samples were separated and purified by chromatography on a silica gel alumina column using n hexane 80 ml for pre elution and then drained it off the 7 3 v v dichloromethane n hexane 100 ml was used for elution the eluate was concentrated to 200 μl by high purity nitrogen and spiked with terphenyl d14 10 μl 10 0 μg ml as the internal standard the spiked sample was then stored at 20 until analysis pouch et al 2021 2 3 instrumental analysis the following 16 pahs

the method sun et al 2021 all reported data have already subtracted the blank the limit of detection lod was set as 10 times the standard deviation of the spiked minimum concentration blank 10 sd for the concentration volume was 200 μl the lod was 0 05 ng g dry weight for sediment 2 5 the use of historical data in order to make an exploration on the time evolution characteristic of pahs in the sediments of liao river and estuarine in recent 20 years this paper not only used the measured data in 2020 but also gathered the historical data of pahs in the sediments of this area there were two main sources almost all of the historical data used in this paper was measured by our research group cheng et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 as for supplement the bulletin on the environmental quality of liaoning province epd china 2010 and the research conclusions of international scholars in this region from 1999 to 2010 was taken into consideration ma et al 2014 wang et al 2011 2 6 pahs toxicity analysis by ingestion dermal uptake and inhalation pahs can enter the body and spread to various organs such as brain muscle fat liver and kidney through alveoli digestive system and blood bocskay et al 2005 stading et al 2021 although pahs such as bap dba and baa are considered to be highly active carcinogens in fact they are not direct carcinogens until be activated by oxidase which is produced in cell microsomes after that a series of active metabolites of dihydrodiol epoxides such as benzo a pyrene 7 8 dihydrodiol 9 10 epoxides are generated under the action of environmental enzymes these products have strong affinity and can form more stable adducts with dna double strand covalent bonds in human cells resulting in the reduction of dna replication accuracy with the occurrence of point mutations one after another canceration occurs when such mutations accumulate and cannot be repaired by the organism itself therefore in essence the mutagenicity of pahs is closely related to the occurrence of carcinogenesis which is the molecular basis of carcinogenesis to a certain extent wang et al 2017 the us environmental protection agency method was used to estimate incremental lifetime cancer risks ilcrs to allow potential health risks to humans posed by pahs in sediment the ilcrs for the ingestion dermal uptake and inhalation these pathways were calculated using the equations 1 teq

pahs concentrations and patterns 3 1 1 concentration and composition sixteen priority pahs identified by usepa were all detected in this study area the 7 carcinogenic pahs baa chr bbf bkf bap icdp and dba σ7pahs defined by usepa and other individual pahs us environmental protection agency 16 priority pah in the sediment samples were shown in table 3 for ease of expression the following σ16pahs was abbreviated as σpahs as was shown in table 3 the concentration of σpahs was 2 520 average value range 75 0 17 200 ng g dry weight the concentration of σ7pahs was 1 130 average value range 33 6 8 510 ng g dry weight contributing about 8 4 57 4 of the concentration of σpahs among all the concentration of individual species of pahs the concentration of pyr was 577 average value range 1 28 3 090 ng g dry weight which was relative higher the concentration of any was 41 average value range 2 08 380 ng g dry weight which was relative lower in liao river sediments tetracyclic and pentacyclic pahs were dominated accounting for 42 3 and 22 7 of the σpahs respectively bicyclic and tricyclic pahs accounted for 6 82 and 15 9 of the σpahs respectively hexacyclic pahs accounted for about 12 3 of the σpahs the percentage of pahs in liao estuarine was basically the same as that in liao river specifically tetracyclic and pentacyclic pahs were dominated accounting for 47 3 and 20 8 of the σpahs bicyclic and tricyclic pahs accounted for 5 07 and 16 7 of the σpahs and hexacyclic pahs accounted for about 10 2 of the σpahs compared with liao river the percentage of tetracyclic pahs in estuarine was slightly higher figure 2 bap is a kind of pahs posing a great threat to human health which is often used as an important index for equivalent evaluation of pahs pollution level liu et al 2009 bap was detected in all sediment samples of which the concentration was 135 average range 0 69 928 ng g dry weight accounting for 0 13 6 67 of σpahs the total concentration of other six carcinogenic pahs was 28 6 7 780 ng g dry weight which accounted for 13 7 34 1 of σpahs the individual concentrations of baa flt pyr chr bbf and dba were relatively higher in total accounting for 48 7 average range 38 7 72 4 of σpahs the concentration of σpahs in liao estuarine sediment was much lower than that of liao river for more information please see figure 3 3 1 2 pollution level of pahs the concentration of σpahs in liao river and estuarine sediments was 48 28 000 ng g dry weight in order to expound the pahs pollution level in the study area the pahs concentrations in the sediments of typical rivers and estuaries in the world were compared and analyzed table 4 the results showed that the concentration of pahs in the sediments of the study area was in middle high level specifically the concentration here was higher than that of taihu lake and haihe river basin in china chen et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 algoa bay in south africa adeniji et al 2019 east harbor island in usa neira et al 2017 urban rivers in kinshasa drc kilunga et al 2017 it was in the same level with huangpu river in china huang et al 2017 san francisco bay in usa nilsen et al 2015 estuarine in chennai in india goswami et al 2016 it was lower than guanabara bay in brazil wagener et al 2012 musa estuary in persian gulf rastegari mehr et al 2020 compared with algoa bay taihu lake and east harbor island there were many sewage factories located at liao river and estuarine so the pollutant emission was very intense resulting in a higher pollution level of pahs luo et al 2021 3 2 traceability analysis of pahs determining the source of pahs in the environment is very important to evaluate the migration and fate of pahs in the environment mark et al 2002 the quotient of flt flt pyr was set as the x axis flt flt pyr less than 0 3 mainly due to volatilization or leakage of petroleum substances and 0 3 flt flt pyr less than 0 5 mainly due to petroleum refining and flt flt pyr 0 5 mainly due to the combustion of solid fossil fuels such as vegetation or coal meanwhile the quotients of phe phe ant baa baa chr bap bap bpe and icdp bpy icdp were set as the y axis separately for more details please see figure 4 although the sediments in liao river and estuarine belong to the same water system the results of source analysis were different from the x axis analysis results the quotient of flt flt pyr was mostly distributed between 0 2 and 0 65 indicating that the sources of pahs in the study area were mainly oil refining refining and combustion of solid fossil fuels from the results of y axis analysis the quotient of phe phe ant was 5 15 and baa baa chr was 0 2 0 7 indicating two aspects firstly the amount of pahs produced by fossil fuels was more than waste incineration secondly the use and refining of fossil fuels was an important source of pahs bap bap bpe of estuary was slightly different from river where the quotient of estuary was higher than 0 5 and the quotient of river was less than 0 5 indicating that the pahs of traffic in the ocean had extensive sources this might be related to the numerous distributions of ports and frequent navigation in estuarine icdp bpy icdp of estuaries and rivers were much more differentiated first the estuary icdp bpy icdp was 0 1 0 5 while the river was 0 1 0 7 indicating that pahs produced by oil volatilization and leakage may be more common in estuarine than in river this was because liao estuarine was located in the northern of liaodong bay where the navigations distributed intensively and the leakage of petroleum hydrocarbons during transportation was likely to be the main reason for the increase of pahs concentration in addition the aquaculture in estuarine was developed so there were many fishing vessels which would also contribute some pahs to the sediments in general the main sources of pahs in the study area were closely related to the industrial activities heavy industry petrochemical industry and port industry were densely distributed could be the causes why a large number of medium high rings pahs were produced in addition the leakage of ships with transporting oil intensively might be another source of pahs in estuarine sediments 3 3 health risk assessment of pahs the ilcr method mentioned in section 2 6 was used to evaluate the health risk caused by pahs the ilcr parameters used in the equation were shown in tables 1 2 5 i l c r ilcr ingestion i l c r dermal ilcr inhalation the ilcr value was divided into three levels according to the u s environmental protection agency s guidelines on health risk assessment of pahs when the ilcr value less than 10 6 it indicated that the health risk was low or negligible and when the ilcr value was between 10 6 10 4 it indicated a potential carcinogenic risk and when the ilcr value 10 4 it indicated a high carcinogenic risk meanwhile 10 6 was set as a carcinogenic risk unit in order to estimate the possible loss of life expectancy due to carcinogenesis the calculating equation was used as follows mundo et al 2020 6 ll l e f σ i l c r 10 6 where ll was the expected life loss y lef was the expected life loss coefficient unitless and its value was usually obtained by fitting analysis the value of lef had been set as 42 16 in this research which was quoted from the research results he et al 2020 in northern liaodong bay according to the calculation results the value of σilcr in liao river sediments was 10 9 10 7 while the value of σilcr in estuarine sediments was 10 11 10 8 it could be seen that pahs in liao river sediments posed a greater threat to human health than estuarine specifically the values of ilcringestion ilcrdermal and ilcrinhalation of pahs were 10 8 10 7 10 9 10 7 and 10 9 10 8 respectively the increased cancer risk of pahs through ingestion and dermal uptake was much higher than that of respiratory inhalation about 25 70 times higher according to the calculation results the expected life loss of pahs in the sediments of liao river and estuary was 0 03 4 2 years this might be a very adverse impact on the residents living around liao river which showed that the health risk of pahs ought to be given a higher concern 3 4 temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of pahs 3 4 1 spatial distribution characteristics of pahs the distribution figures of pahs in liao river and estuarine sediments were drawn figure 5 overall the concentration of 4 rings pahs was much higher than others and the concentrations of 2 rings and 3 rings pahs were relatively low three distribution characteristics of σpahs were demonstrated firstly compared with liao river the concentration of pahs in estuarine was relatively low in estuarine the closer was to the offshore the higher the concentration of pahs secondly the concentration of pahs in different tributaries was obviously different the concentration of pahs in the upper reaches of the liao river was lower than that in the middle and lower reaches the concentration of pahs in the main stream was higher than that in the tributaries the upstream of liao river were able to maintain a good environmental quality because relatively fewer factories and sewage outlets located in the upper reaches where were affected by human activities slightly see figure 1 on the contrary the industrial activities in the middle and lower reaches of the liao river were frequent with a large number of industrial sewage and wastewater discharged into the rivers resulting in a high level of pahs pollution thirdly comparing the two main streams of liao river shuangtaizi river and hun river the concentration of pahs in hun river was much higher than that of shuangtaizi river with the largest heavy industry park in northeast china located in hun river basin zhang et al 2010 the heavy industry metallurgy mining and petrochemical industry were distributed intensively result in a serious pollution level of pahs in the sediment 3 4 2 temporal distribution characteristics of pahs in order to explore the seasonal variation of pahs concentration in sediments of liao river and estuarine this study carried out comparative analysis in wet season normal season and dry season figure 6 result showed that the concentration of pahs in liao river sediments changed seasonally that wet season normal season dry season usually the pahs emission rate of pollution sources such as sewage outlets sewage enterprises etc should be basically the same however due to the influence of rainfall and runoff great differences of pahs in sediments were caused research showed that the weather in wet season was always humid and hot higher water temperature could improve the water solubility and volatility of pahs which led the reduction of pahs in river sediments from another aspect sun et al 2021 the concentration of pahs in the sediment of estuarine changed little with seasons which was in sharp contrast to the seasonal difference of liao river this was mainly caused by two reasons firstly estuarine ocean has a vast area far beyond rivers in addition with the force of ocean tide estuarine had a higher pollutant capacity therefore during a short period the variation of pahs concentration in estuarine sediments was imperceptible here the word short period was used because we must realize that the capacity of ocean are not endless if the pollutants were continuously released with high intensity and the measures of pollution prevented and controlled were ineffective for a long time the marine environment would have been deteriorating without stop cheng et al 2021 secondly according to the china industrial statistics yearbook national bureau of statistics 2021 the pollutants discharge amount of each factory was basically stable every month therefore no matter in wet or dry season the total amount of pahs discharged into environment was almost the same although the abundant precipitation in wet season diluted the concentration of pahs in river all the pahs would converge into the ocean finally which the pollutant discharge pressures the ocean taking on was the same as usual pouch et al 2021 3 4 3 evolution characteristics of pahs in recent 20 years according to our previous monitoring data and research conclusions cheng et al zhang et al 2021 ma et al 2014 wang et al 2011 in the past 20 years the average concentration of pahs in liao river sediments had increased from 6 500 to 12 000 ng g dry weight in less than 10 years and reached the maximum in 2010 liaoning provincial environmental protection department 2010 after 2010 the concentration of pahs began to decrease which was reduced to about 7 200 ng g dry weight compared with liao river the variation of pahs concentration in liao estuarine was relatively slight figure 7 in the past 20 years it kept increasing slowly from 350 to 600 ng g the concentration of pahs in estuarine was not as much as that in liao river it seemed that the pollution situation of pahs in estuaries was more optimistic however the truth was exactly opposite since 2012 the chinese government had put a lot of resources into pollution control and prevention of marine and rivers organic pollutants including pahs ke et al 2017 however the status of marine environmental quality had not improved little which might not be a satisfactory result for marine environmental protection what about liao river although the pollution of pahs was serious it had shown an obvious positive development trend as a consequence it was still a severe situation to put the marine pollution prevention and control into effect the reasons this phenomenon caused mainly included the following three aspects firstly was for the complexity of marine environment in estuary area the estuarine area was a typical land ocean intersection area with a large amount of land based substances input through runoff every year including pahs with the complex process of mixing exchanging and adsorbing pahs finally settle in the sediments of the estuarine area which was easy to promote the accumulation cheng et al 2021 secondly was for the particularity of liao estuarine previous research showed that the liao estuarine was located in the top of liaodong bay where the hydrodynamic conditions were very weak resulting in the natural shortage of water exchange capacity luo et al 2021 thirdly was for imperfect management measures as was known the ocean was the final sink of most rivers most of the substances in rivers would be gathered into the marine environment finally which bought a very thorny problem to management james et al 1996 as for rivers polluted management a maximum allowable pahs discharge amount would be set for each plant or each sewage outlet of course the impact on rivers were acceptable in short term however with the continuous pollutant discharging into the rivers the amount of pollutants released into the ocean from rivers would be increasing more and more inevitably as a result the marine environment would be overwhelmed jia et al 2021 considering the differences between marine and rivers here was a suggestion in order to improve the marine environmental quality it is very important to establish an integrated land ocean pollutant prevention and control measures the evolution trend of marine environmental quality is significant for formulating institution that the total amount of pollutants allowed to be discharged which the pollutant emission limits of each pollutant discharge factory or outlet could be made explicitly this may be regarded as a new idea of land ocean coordination management and worthy of reference in the process of environmental pollution prevention and control around the world supplementary materials 4 conclusion the concentration of σpahs in liao river and estuarine sediments was 48 28 000 ng g dry weight the amount of tetracyclic and pentacyclic pahs was dominant the individual concentration of pyr was the highest compared with liao river the concentration of σpahs in estuarine was lower the concentration of pahs in the study area was at a moderate high pollution level worldwide the value of σilcr in liao river sediments was 10 9 10 7 while the value of estuarine was 10 11 10 8 pahs in liao river sediments posed a greater threat to human health the maximum expected life loss caused by pahs was 4 2 years therefore it might be a very adverse impact on the residents living around liao river which the carcinogenic risk should not be ignored spatial the concentration of pahs in estuarine was lower than that in river the concentration of pahs in upper reaches was lower than the middle and lower reaches and the main stream was higher than the tributaries temporally the concentration of pahs in liao river sediments had a seasonal distribution characteristics of wet period normal period dry period different from the river the concentration of pahs in estuarine changed slightly with seasons in the past 20 years the concentration of pahs in liao river sediments increased firstly and then decreased and reached the maximum in 2010 the variation of pahs in estuarine sediments was relatively small but showing an increasing trend in the past 20 years based on the evolution trend of marine environmental quality formulating the institution that the total amount of pollutants allowed to be discharged may be regarded as a new idea of land ocean coordination management for pollution prevention and control credit authorship

3549,land ocean coordinated management is an important wisdom for environmental protection and pollution prevention of marine and river systems taking liao river and estuarine as an example the pollution characteristics temporal and spatial distribution and change features of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in sediments in recent 20 years were studied from two different analysis perspectives of land and ocean the research showed that the pollution of pahs in the sediments of liao river and estuarine was not optimistic the concentration of σ16pahs was 48 28 000 ng g the carcinogenic risk to humans shouldn t be ignored which could cause the loss of life expectancy 0 03 4 2 years the traceability analysis showed that the use and combustion of fossil fuels were the main sources of pahs in addition the leakage of oil during the intensive transportation of ships in coastal waters might also contribute to pahs the concentrations of pahs had obvious temporal and spatial distribution characteristics spatially estuaries tributaries main streams temporally wet season normal season dry season in liao river whereas the variation of pahs in estuarine sediments was slight in the past 20 years the concentration of pahs in liao river had increased first and then decreased reaching maximum in 2010 however the concentration of pahs seldom decreased in estuarine sediments in which showed a more serious situation of pahs pollution control keywords land ocean coordination pahs liao river estuarine sediments 1 introduction ocean and river systems are connected by water and exchange frequently alvarez et al 2013 they have regional differences at most but not essential shi et al 2020 therefore it is unscientific and impractical to separate each other just because of the division of management responsibilities however since the 1980s in order to solve the pollution problem of environment chinese government separated the environmental protection work on land from the ocean after the environmental protection departments and marine management departments had been established no suspense that this management method was not able to control the environmental pollution effectively li et al 2020 the purpose of pollution prevention and control is not only to reduce the concentration of various pollution factors but also to maintain the health and integrity of watershed and ocean ecosystem sajjad et al 2018 therefore the old concept of treating where it was polluted must be changed the most effective and important means to protect the environment is to carry out a combination prevention and control method between river and marine which must be based on the evolution results of environmental quality shen et al 2016 in 2018 in order to improve the effectiveness of environmental protection and eliminate the boundary between marine and land in environmental management zhang et al 2021 the chinese government had implemented institutional reform and put forward measures for land ocean coordinated pollution prevention and control due to the short implementing time and lack of basic research although the implemented of this policy was a significant progress the specific technical requirements and management methods were all insufficient zhao et al 2021 as is known to all compared with the environmental pollution control of rivers the prevention and recovery of marine pollution is more difficult and longer periodic wang et al 2020 therefore the river and estuarine areas were chose as the study area in this research where the interaction forces of ocean and land were the strongest from the perspective of land ocean coordinated this paper made comprehensive study on the environmental quality and historical evolution trend of environment pollution so as to explore the fundamental cause of poor effectiveness of pollution control measures it provided basic research conclusions technical enlightenment and new ideas for national authorities to more effectively implement environmental pollution prevention and control liao river system and its estuary area were chose as research examples where was located in northeast china 40 00 n 43 00 n 121 00 e 125 00 e china s most important industrial and mining areas were distributed here he et al 2015 however in recent 20 years due to the continuous intensive industrial activities the pollution problem of organic pollutants primarily pahs in the middle and lower reaches of liao river and its estuary had become more and more serious ke et al 2017 since 2008 china s environmental protection departments and marine departments had taken pollution prevention and control measures for many times on the serious pollution of pahs but the treatment results had been not satisfactory zhang et al 2010 in this study the temporal and spatial distribution characteristic and health risk of pahs were evaluated from the perspective of land ocean coordinated in addition combined with historical data the evolution of pahs pollution level in recent 20 years was analyzed pahs have potential toxicity carcinogenicity mutagenicity and bioaccumulation erik et al 2020 which are able to enter the body through ingestion dermal uptake and inhalation wu et al 2011 thus affecting human health timoszczuk et al 2021 in the 1980 s the u s environmental protection agency usepa listed 16 kinds of unbranched pahs as priority pollutants usepa 1979 because pahs have low solubility and hydrophobicity khiari et al 2021 which are often adsorbed on particles sediments turn to be the ultimate destination of most pahs compared with seawater or rivers james et al 1996 however the form of pahs adsorbed on sediment particles is not stable yang et al 2020 once the sediment environment changes such as underwater disturbance strong storm ph and salinity change pahs will be released into the water immediately marko et al 2001 resulting in a secondary pollution liao and yu 2020 therefore it is of great significance for pollution prevention and control to carry out sediment pahs pollution level temporal and spatial distribution characteristics and health risk assessment 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and processing the study area liao river and estuarine was located in northeast china which was one of the seven major rivers in china yang et al 2011 with a total length of 1394 km and a drainage area of 2 0 105 km2 liao river consisted of two main streams one was shuangtaizi river which entered the sea through panshan panjin city with a length of 516 km the other was daliao river with a length of 94 km liao estuarine located at the northernmost of liaodong bay that was one of the largest bays in china where the water exchange capacity was very weak and the diffusion rate of pollutants was very low luo et al 2021 in 2020 183 surface sediment samples were collected from liao river and estuarine at wet season august normal season april and dry season december respectively grab sampler iron was used to get the surface sediment about 0 10 cm samples the coordinates of each sampling station were determined by gps and recorded together with the location information of surrounding factories or sewage outlets for more details of sampling station information please see figure 1 4 samples were collected at each sample station mixed wrapped with tin foil and then brought back to the laboratory at low temperature 18 all samples were freeze dried vacuum freeze dryer 24 h and ground 180 μm after removal of impurities then 1000 g of each sample was taken out and stored in brown glass bottles at 4 preparing for analysis 2 2 sample purification about 15 0 g of the dry sediment samples was weighed and added with 15 0 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate 3 0 g of copper powder 100 ml of extraction solution acetone n hexane v v 1 1 and recovery indicators d8 p p ddt cb155 cb65 and tbb the samples were reflux extracted for 24 h through soxhlet apparatus the extract was evaporated to about 2 ml by rotary evaporation and stored in a collection bottle zhang et al 2021 all samples were separated and purified by chromatography on a silica gel alumina column using n hexane 80 ml for pre elution and then drained it off the 7 3 v v dichloromethane n hexane 100 ml was used for elution the eluate was concentrated to 200 μl by high purity nitrogen and spiked with terphenyl d14 10 μl 10 0 μg ml as the internal standard the spiked sample was then stored at 20 until analysis pouch et al 2021 2 3 instrumental analysis the following 16 pahs

the concentration volume was 200 μl the lod was 0 05 ng g dry weight for sediment 2 5 the use of historical data in order to make an exploration on the time evolution characteristic of pahs in the sediments of liao river and estuarine in recent 20 years this paper not only used the measured data in 2020 but also gathered the historical data of pahs in the sediments of this area there were two main sources almost all of the historical data used in this paper was measured by our research group cheng et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 as for supplement the bulletin on the environmental quality of liaoning province epd china 2010 and the research conclusions of international scholars in this region from 1999 to 2010 was taken into consideration ma et al 2014 wang et al 2011 2 6 pahs toxicity analysis by ingestion dermal uptake and inhalation pahs can enter the body and spread to various organs such as brain muscle fat liver and kidney through alveoli digestive system and blood bocskay et al 2005 stading et al 2021 although pahs such as bap dba and baa are considered to be highly active carcinogens in fact they are not direct carcinogens until be activated by oxidase which is produced in cell microsomes after that a series of active metabolites of dihydrodiol epoxides such as benzo a pyrene 7 8 dihydrodiol 9 10 epoxides are generated under the action of environmental enzymes these products have strong affinity and can form more stable adducts with dna double strand covalent bonds in human cells resulting in the reduction of dna replication accuracy with the occurrence of point mutations one after another canceration occurs when such mutations accumulate and cannot be repaired by the organism itself therefore in essence the mutagenicity of pahs is closely related to the occurrence of carcinogenesis which is the molecular basis of carcinogenesis to a certain extent wang et al 2017 the us environmental protection agency method was used to estimate incremental lifetime cancer risks ilcrs to allow potential health risks to humans posed by pahs in sediment the ilcrs for the ingestion dermal uptake and inhalation these pathways were calculated using the equations 1 teq

dry weight which was relative higher the concentration of any was 41 average value range 2 08 380 ng g dry weight which was relative lower in liao river sediments tetracyclic and pentacyclic pahs were dominated accounting for 42 3 and 22 7 of the σpahs respectively bicyclic and tricyclic pahs accounted for 6 82 and 15 9 of the σpahs respectively hexacyclic pahs accounted for about 12 3 of the σpahs the percentage of pahs in liao estuarine was basically the same as that in liao river specifically tetracyclic and pentacyclic pahs were dominated accounting for 47 3 and 20 8 of the σpahs bicyclic and tricyclic pahs accounted for 5 07 and 16 7 of the σpahs and hexacyclic pahs accounted for about 10 2 of the σpahs compared with liao river the percentage of tetracyclic pahs in estuarine was slightly higher figure 2 bap is a kind of pahs posing a great threat to human health which is often used as an important index for equivalent evaluation of pahs pollution level liu et al 2009 bap was detected in all sediment samples of which the concentration was 135 average range 0 69 928 ng g dry weight accounting for 0 13 6 67 of σpahs the total concentration of other six carcinogenic pahs was 28 6 7 780 ng g dry weight which accounted for 13 7 34 1 of σpahs the individual concentrations of baa flt pyr chr bbf and dba were relatively higher in total accounting for 48 7 average range 38 7 72 4 of σpahs the concentration of σpahs in liao estuarine sediment was much lower than that of liao river for more information please see figure 3 3 1 2 pollution level of pahs the concentration of σpahs in liao river and estuarine sediments was 48 28 000 ng g dry weight in order to expound the pahs pollution level in the study area the pahs concentrations in the sediments of typical rivers and estuaries in the world were compared and analyzed table 4 the results showed that the concentration of pahs in the sediments of the study area was in middle high level specifically the concentration here was higher than that of taihu lake and haihe river basin in china chen et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 algoa bay in south africa adeniji et al 2019 east harbor island in usa neira et al 2017 urban rivers in kinshasa drc kilunga et al 2017 it was in the same level with huangpu river in china huang et al 2017 san francisco bay in usa nilsen et al 2015 estuarine in chennai in india goswami et al 2016 it was lower than guanabara bay in brazil wagener et al 2012 musa estuary in persian gulf rastegari mehr et al 2020 compared with algoa bay taihu lake and east harbor island there were many sewage factories located at liao river and estuarine so the pollutant emission was very intense resulting in a higher pollution level of pahs luo et al 2021 3 2 traceability analysis of pahs determining the source of pahs in the environment is very important to evaluate the migration and fate of pahs in the environment mark et al 2002 the quotient of flt flt pyr was set as the x axis flt flt pyr less than 0 3 mainly due to volatilization or leakage of petroleum substances and 0 3 flt flt pyr less than 0 5 mainly due to petroleum refining and flt flt pyr 0 5 mainly due to the combustion of solid fossil fuels such as vegetation or coal meanwhile the quotients of phe phe ant baa baa chr bap bap bpe and icdp bpy icdp were set as the y axis separately for more details please see figure 4 although the sediments in liao river and estuarine belong to the same water system the results of source analysis were different from the x axis analysis results the quotient of flt flt pyr was mostly distributed between 0 2 and 0 65 indicating that the sources of pahs in the study area were mainly oil refining refining and combustion of solid fossil fuels from the results of y axis analysis the quotient of phe phe ant was 5 15 and baa baa chr was 0 2 0 7 indicating two aspects firstly the amount of pahs produced by fossil fuels was more than waste incineration secondly the use and refining of fossil fuels was an important source of pahs bap bap bpe of estuary was slightly different from river where the quotient of estuary was higher than 0 5 and the quotient of river was less than 0 5 indicating that the pahs of traffic in the ocean had extensive sources this might be related to the numerous distributions of ports and frequent navigation in estuarine icdp bpy icdp of estuaries and rivers were much more differentiated first the estuary icdp bpy icdp was 0 1 0 5 while the river was 0 1 0 7 indicating that pahs produced by oil volatilization and leakage may be more common in estuarine than in river this was because liao estuarine was located in the northern of liaodong bay where the navigations distributed intensively and the leakage of petroleum hydrocarbons during transportation was likely to be the main reason for the increase of pahs concentration in addition the aquaculture in estuarine was developed so there were many fishing vessels which would also contribute some pahs to the sediments in general the main sources of pahs in the study area were closely related to the industrial activities heavy industry petrochemical industry and port industry were densely distributed could be the causes why a large number of medium high rings pahs were produced in addition the leakage of ships with transporting oil intensively might be another source of pahs in estuarine sediments 3 3 health risk assessment of pahs the ilcr method mentioned in section 2 6 was used to evaluate the health risk caused by pahs the ilcr parameters used in the equation were shown in tables 1 2 5 i l c r ilcr ingestion i l c r dermal ilcr inhalation the ilcr value was divided into three levels according to the u s environmental protection agency s guidelines on health risk assessment of pahs when the ilcr value less than 10 6 it indicated that the health risk was low or negligible and when the ilcr value was between 10 6 10 4 it indicated a potential carcinogenic risk and when the ilcr value 10 4 it indicated a high carcinogenic risk meanwhile 10 6 was set as a carcinogenic risk unit in order to estimate the possible loss of life expectancy due to carcinogenesis the calculating equation was used as follows mundo et al 2020 6 ll l e f σ i l c r 10 6 where ll was the expected life loss y lef was the expected life loss coefficient unitless and its value was usually obtained by fitting analysis the value of lef had been set as 42 16 in this research which was quoted from the research results he et al 2020 in northern liaodong bay according to the calculation results the value of σilcr in liao river sediments was 10 9 10 7 while the value of σilcr in estuarine sediments was 10 11 10 8 it could be seen that pahs in liao river sediments posed a greater threat to human health than estuarine specifically the values of ilcringestion ilcrdermal and ilcrinhalation of pahs were 10 8 10 7 10 9 10 7 and 10 9 10 8 respectively the increased cancer risk of pahs through ingestion and dermal uptake was much higher than that of respiratory inhalation about 25 70 times higher according to the calculation results the expected life loss of pahs in the sediments of liao river and estuary was 0 03 4 2 years this might be a very adverse impact on the residents living around liao river which showed that the health risk of pahs ought to be given a higher concern 3 4 temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of pahs 3 4 1 spatial distribution characteristics of pahs the distribution figures of pahs in liao river and estuarine sediments were drawn figure 5 overall the concentration of 4 rings pahs was much higher than others and the concentrations of 2 rings and 3 rings pahs were relatively low three distribution characteristics of σpahs were demonstrated firstly compared with liao river the concentration of pahs in estuarine was relatively low in estuarine the closer was to the offshore the higher the concentration of pahs secondly the concentration of pahs in different tributaries was obviously different the concentration of pahs in the upper reaches of the liao river was lower than that in the middle and lower reaches the concentration of pahs in the main stream was higher than that in the tributaries the upstream of liao river were able to maintain a good environmental quality because relatively fewer factories and sewage outlets located in the upper reaches where were affected by human activities slightly see figure 1 on the contrary the industrial activities in the middle and lower reaches of the liao river were frequent with a large number of industrial sewage and wastewater discharged into the rivers resulting in a high level of pahs pollution thirdly comparing the two main streams of liao river shuangtaizi river and hun river the concentration of pahs in hun river was much higher than that of shuangtaizi river with the largest heavy industry park in northeast china located in hun river basin zhang et al 2010 the heavy industry metallurgy mining and petrochemical industry were distributed intensively result in a serious pollution level of pahs in the sediment 3 4 2 temporal distribution characteristics of pahs in order to explore the seasonal variation of pahs concentration in sediments of liao river and estuarine this study carried out comparative analysis in wet season normal season and dry season figure 6 result showed that the concentration of pahs in liao river sediments changed seasonally that wet season normal season dry season usually the pahs emission rate of pollution sources such as sewage outlets sewage enterprises etc should be basically the same however due to the influence of rainfall and runoff great differences of pahs in sediments were caused research showed that the weather in wet season was always humid and hot higher water temperature could improve the water solubility and volatility of pahs which led the reduction of pahs in river sediments from another aspect sun et al 2021 the concentration of pahs in the sediment of estuarine changed little with seasons which was in sharp contrast to the seasonal difference of liao river this was mainly caused by two reasons firstly estuarine ocean has a vast area far beyond rivers in addition with the force of ocean tide estuarine had a higher pollutant capacity therefore during a short period the variation of pahs concentration in estuarine sediments was imperceptible here the word short period was used because we must realize that the capacity of ocean are not endless if the pollutants were continuously released with high intensity and the measures of pollution prevented and controlled were ineffective for a long time the marine environment would have been deteriorating without stop cheng et al 2021 secondly according to the china industrial statistics yearbook national bureau of statistics 2021 the pollutants discharge amount of each factory was basically stable every month therefore no matter in wet or dry season the total amount of pahs discharged into environment was almost the same although the abundant precipitation in wet season diluted the concentration of pahs in river all the pahs would converge into the ocean finally which the pollutant discharge pressures the ocean taking on was the same as usual pouch et al 2021 3 4 3 evolution characteristics of pahs in recent 20 years according to our previous monitoring data and research conclusions cheng et al zhang et al 2021 ma et al 2014 wang et al 2011 in the past 20 years the average concentration of pahs in liao river sediments had increased from 6 500 to 12 000 ng g dry weight in less than 10 years and reached the maximum in 2010 liaoning provincial environmental protection department 2010 after 2010 the concentration of pahs began to decrease which was reduced to about 7 200 ng g dry weight compared with liao river the variation of pahs concentration in liao estuarine was relatively slight figure 7 in the past 20 years it kept increasing slowly from 350 to 600 ng g the concentration of pahs in estuarine was not as much as that in liao river it seemed that the pollution situation of pahs in estuaries was more optimistic however the truth was exactly opposite since 2012 the chinese government had put a lot of resources into pollution control and prevention of marine and rivers organic pollutants including pahs ke et al 2017 however the status of marine environmental quality had not improved little which might not be a satisfactory result for marine environmental protection what about liao river although the pollution of pahs was serious it had shown an obvious positive development trend as a consequence it was still a severe situation to put the marine pollution prevention and control into effect the reasons this phenomenon caused mainly included the following three aspects firstly was for the complexity of marine environment in estuary area the estuarine area was a typical land ocean intersection area with a large amount of land based substances input through runoff every year including pahs with the complex process of mixing exchanging and adsorbing pahs finally settle in the sediments of the estuarine area which was easy to promote the accumulation cheng et al 2021 secondly was for the particularity of liao estuarine previous research showed that the liao estuarine was located in the top of liaodong bay where the hydrodynamic conditions were very weak resulting in the natural shortage of water exchange capacity luo et al 2021 thirdly was for imperfect management measures as was known the ocean was the final sink of most rivers most of the substances in rivers would be gathered into the marine environment finally which bought a very thorny problem to management james et al 1996 as for rivers polluted management a maximum allowable pahs discharge amount would be set for each plant or each sewage outlet of course the impact on rivers were acceptable in short term however with the continuous pollutant discharging into the rivers the amount of pollutants released into the ocean from rivers would be increasing more and more inevitably as a result the marine environment would be overwhelmed jia et al 2021 considering the differences between marine and rivers here was a suggestion in order to improve the marine environmental quality it is very important to establish an integrated land ocean pollutant prevention and control measures the evolution trend of marine environmental quality is significant for formulating institution that the total amount of pollutants allowed to be discharged which the pollutant emission limits of each pollutant discharge factory or outlet could be made explicitly this may be regarded as a new idea of land ocean coordination management and worthy of reference in the process of environmental pollution prevention and control around the world supplementary materials 4 conclusion the concentration of σpahs in liao river and estuarine sediments was 48 28 000 ng g dry weight the amount of tetracyclic and pentacyclic pahs was dominant the individual concentration of pyr was the highest compared with liao river the concentration of σpahs in estuarine was lower the concentration of pahs in the study area was at a moderate high pollution level worldwide the value of σilcr in liao river sediments was 10 9 10 7 while the value of estuarine was 10 11 10 8 pahs in liao river sediments posed a greater threat to human health the maximum expected life loss caused by pahs was 4 2 years therefore it might be a very adverse impact on the residents living around liao river which the carcinogenic risk should not be ignored spatial the concentration of pahs in estuarine was lower than that in river the concentration of pahs in upper reaches was lower than the middle and lower reaches and the main stream was higher than the tributaries temporally the concentration of pahs in liao river sediments had a seasonal distribution characteristics of wet period normal period dry period different from the river the concentration of pahs in estuarine changed slightly with seasons in the past 20 years the concentration of pahs in liao river sediments increased firstly and then decreased and reached the maximum in 2010 the variation of pahs in estuarine sediments was relatively small but showing an increasing trend in the past 20 years based on the evolution trend of marine environmental quality formulating the institution that the total amount of pollutants allowed to be discharged may be regarded as a new idea of land ocean coordination management for pollution prevention and control credit authorship
