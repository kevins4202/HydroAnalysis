19630,gas permeable membranes coupled with low rate aeration is useful to recover ammonia nh4 from livestock effluents in this study the role of inorganic carbon bicarbonate hco3 to enhance the n recovery process was evaluated using synthetic effluents with various nh4 to hco3 molar ratios of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 the study also evaluated the effect of increased organic matter on the nh4 recovery using humic acids 3000 6000 mg l 1 and the n recovery from high strength swine manure the release of hydroxide from the hco3 with aeration increased the wastewater ph and promoted gaseous ammonia formation and membrane uptake at the same time the recovery of gaseous ammonia nh3 through the membrane acidified the wastewater therefore an abundant inorganic carbon supply in balance with the nh4 is needed for a successful operation of the technology nh4 removal efficiencies 96 were obtained with nh4 to hco3 ratios 1 however higher molar ratios inhibited the n recovery process resulting in lower efficiencies 65 fortunately most swine manures contain ample supply of endogenous inorganic carbon and the process can be used to more economically recover the ammonia using the natural inorganic carbon instead of expensive alkali chemicals in 4 days the recovered nh4 from swine manure contained 48 000 mg l 1 finally it was found the process was not inhibited by the increasing levels of organic matter in the wastewater evaluated graphical abstract image keywords ammonia recovery ammonia capture gas permeable membranes livestock wastewater ammonia emissions control 1 introduction ammoniacal nitrogen is one of the main contaminants of domestic and industrial waste the concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen varies from 10 to 200 mg l 1 in urban wastewater from 5 to 1000 mg l 1 in industrial wastewater such as those generated by the production of chemical fertilizers and from about 400 to 5000 mg l 1 in livestock effluents lema and suarez 2017 usda 2008 some of the environmental problems that have been cited from ammoniacal nitrogen in wastewater and liquid wastes include the reduction of the dissolved oxygen concentration the toxic effects on fish the reduction of disinfection efficiencies and metal corrosion lauterböck et al 2012 hence its removal is necessary in order to protect both natural resources and public health traditionally organic waste from livestock production has been a source of nutrients which was added to agricultural soils intensive livestock farming in certain geographical areas in europe has made this type of waste a problem since it has caused the contamination of aquifers and soils furthermore in 2015 the eu 28 agricultural sector emitted into the air a total of 3751 kilotonnes of ammonia and was responsible for 94 of total ammonia emissions across the region they mainly occur as a result of volatilisation from livestock excreta eea 2017 while this happens the global consumption of synthetic fertilizers grows heffer and prud homme 2013 therefore the capture and recovery of ammonia from livestock farming and its transfer to areas suffering shortages is necessary in this way reducing the environmental impact while at the same time replacing commercial fertilizers and opening new economic perspectives keyzer 2010 szogi et al 2015 vanotti et al 2017 the different techniques to remove the nitrogen content can be classified into biological chemical and physical processes the biological processes include nitrification denitrification vanotti et al 2009 anammox magri et al 2012a or microbial fuel cells kuntke et al 2012 the chemical and physical processes include struvite precipitation nelson et al 2003 ammonia stripping bonmatí and flotats 2003 reverse osmosis masse et al 2010 nanofiltration kertesz et al 2010 ion exchange milan et al 1997 evaporation fuchs and drogs 2013 and recently the treatment using gas permeable membranes vanotti and szogi 2015 garcía gonzález and vanotti 2015 among numerous applications the treatment with gas permeable membranes has been used to retrieve ammonium from liquid manures garcía gonzález et al 2015 garcía and vanotti 2015 this process requires augmenting the ph of the solution to be treated so as to favor the transformation of ammoniacal nitrogen nh4 into the un ionized gaseous ammonia nh3 g eq 1 enabling it to cross a microporous hydrophobic membrane where an acidic solution circulates fig 1 with a ph 2 the acidic solution dissolves the nh3 in the form of ammonium 1 n h 4 o h n h 3 g h 2 o the studies of garcía gonzález et al 2015 and vanotti and szogi 2015 have proposed using nitrification inhibitors and introducing low rate aeration to obtain a higher ph without the need of adding alkaline chemical elements in this way reducing the economic and environmental costs of ammonia treatment during aeration of the manure carbonate alkalinity is consumed and oh is instantly released increasing the ph and reducing the bicarbonate in the wastewater environment according to eq 2 and enhancing both the formation of nh3 as defined in eq 1 and the nh3 uptake via the gas permeable membrane vanotti et al 2017 for the purpose of the enhancement of the recovery of nh3 n recovery using gas permeable membranes the term low rate aeration was defined as an aeration rate that is less than about 5 of the aeration rate used for biological ammonia removal nitrification vanotti et al 2017 2 h c o 3 a i r c o 2 o h however according to eq 3 the recovery of nh3 g through the gas permeable membrane causes an increase of acidity in the wastewater environment being treated as the h does not permeate the hydrophobic membrane therefore it is necessary to continually raise the ph levels in order to maintain the efficiency of the recovery garcía gonzález and vanotti 2015 3 n h 4 n h 3 g h the aeration effect is double on one hand the increase in ph and on the other hand the increase in the concentration of free ammonia which allows active permeation of nh3 through the membrane garcía gonzález et al 2015 the implementation of this type of physical chemical treatment versus other types of nitrogen recovery systems has been discussed in several essays such as those of garcía gonzález et al 2015 zarebska et al 2015 and dube et al 2016 zarebska et al 2015 indicated that the energy consumption of recovering the nitrogen is among the lowest 0 18 kw h kg 1nh3 compared in a review of six methods it was also noted that the main economic drawback from gas permeable membrane systems was the addition of reactive alkaline chemical elements garcía gonzález et al 2015 demonstrated the positive effect of low rate aeration on the use of gas permeable membranes for the purpose of nh4 recovery with the aeration approach applied to waste effluents from raw liquid swine manures the nh4 recovered was 98 of the quantity initially present the ammonia emission losses were less than 1 5 and the operational cost of ammonia recovery was reduced by 57 with respect to the alternative approach using naoh addition to increase ph garcía gonzález et al 2015 the study of dube et al 2016 showed that the nh4 recovery with the low rate aeration was between 5 and 6 times faster than the treatment without aeration reducing treatment costs by 70 in swine manure anaerobic digester effluent although the process was proven to work in several experiments with livestock effluents the mechanism is difficult to understand when working with complex effluents with total alkalinities that may be comprised of inorganic carbon carbonate bicarbonate plus hydroxide and phosphate compounds for this reason there is a need to reconstruct the process using simple solutions to understand the role of the inorganic carbon in this n recovery process the objective of this research was to determine the role of inorganic carbon bicarbonate on the effectiveness of ammonia removal using gas permeable membranes and low rate aeration a series of experiments were carried out using synthetic solutions containing various carbonate to ammonia ratios on the efficiency of the process further the effect of organic matter content on ammonia capture was assessed using humic acids lastly the technology was applied to liquid swine manures from farm areas for fattening pigs with various high solids strengths to evaluate the behavior of the variables in the study and their impact on the efficiency of ammonium removal and recovery 2 materials and methods 2 1 analytical methods total solids volatile solids and ammoniacal nitrogen determinations were performed according to apha standard methods 1998 total solids ts were determined after drying to constant weight at 105 c 2540b method and volatile solids vs were determined after further ignition at 550 c for 1 h 2540e method the ammonium analysis was performed with distillation 2100 kjeltec distillation unit capture of distillate in borate buffer and subsequent titration with 0 10n h2so4 4500b and c methods in experiment 2 the ammonium analysis was done by colorimetry 4500 nh3 g alkalinity was determined with an automatic titrator titroline easy schott instruments by measuring the amount of 0 01 m hydrochloric acid required to reach an end point ph of 4 5 and was reported as mg caco3 l 1 total alkalinity 2320 b method total carbon and inorganic carbon were measured with a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu brand toc5000 model density of the semi solid manure was measured gravimetrically using buckets of known volume and density of the diluted

separation reactor batch experiments were performed using the ammonium separation reactor and protocol of dube et al 2016 fig 2 it consisted of wastewater vessels made of pet with an effective volume of 2 l fitted with a submerged gas permeable membrane connected with a stripping solution reservoir that contained 200 ml acidic solution made with 0 5 m h2so4 the acidic solution was recirculated with a peristaltic pump watson marlow brand 120s model at a rate of 5 8 l day 1 this solution flowed inside the tubular membranes and returned to the stripping solution reservoir completing a closed loop the gas permeable membrane used to capture nh3 was tubular and made of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene eptfe phillips scientific inc rock hill sc the length of the tubular membrane was of 0 6 m and its characteristics are shown in table 1 aeration was performed with aquarium pumps sera brand air 110 plus model and porous plate that provided fine bubbles the aeration rate was 0 24 l air per l of wastewater per minute garcía gonzález et al 2015 it was about 4 times lower than aeration rates used by magri et al 2012 that greatly inhibited nitrite production activity in experiments of partial nitritation of swine wastewater 0 9 l air l liquid 1min 1 even so 10 mg l 1 of n allylthiourea 98 were added as a nitrification inhibitor following strategies presented in other essays vanotti and szogi 2015 2 3 experimental design four sets of experiments were carried out using the experimental device for nh4 capture shown in fig 2 experiments 1 3 and 4 were done in alicante spain and experiment 2 in south carolina usa in the first experiment the effect of nh4 hco3 molar ratios on n removal was evaluated the ph evolution and nh4 elimination were determined using synthetic wastewaters that were prepared with four different ratios of nh4 hco3 four treatments by varying the nh4 concentration and keeping the hco3 concentration constant four complete experimental reactor modules were tested simultaneously using the ammonia separator reactor described in section 2 2 the trials were carried out in single reactors target nh4 hco3 molar ratios were 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 the synthetic wastewaters were prepared with the addition of nh4no3 chemical to reach concentrations of 1000 2000 3000 and 4000 mg nh4 l 1 56 111 167 and 222 mmol nh4 l 1 and the same addition of 9660 mg l 1 nahco3 in all treatments 115 mmol l 1 of bicarbonate or 5750 mg l 1 carbonate alkalinity the second experiment evaluated the effect of inorganic carbon on n recovery from synthetic wastewaters by varying the amounts of hco3 while keeping the nh4 concentration constant the experiment included three treatments based on results of the first experiment regarding nh4 hco3 ratios and n removal the first treatment was an ideal synthetic solution in terms of the balance of inorganic carbon and nh4 it contained about 15 more hco3 than the amount needed to remove all the nh4 by the gas permeable membrane process nh4 hco3 molar ratio 0 87 the second treatment was a deficient synthetic solution also made of nh4 and inorganic carbon but containing half the hco3 used in treatment 1 nh4 hco3 molar ratio 1 74 the third treatment was a control made only with nh4 without the inorganic carbon the synthetic wastewaters in treatments 1 2 and 3 were prepared with the addition of 6 900 3450 and 0 mg l 1 nahco3 respectively 82 41 and 0 mmol l 1 bicarbonate or 4100 2050 and 0 mg l 1 carbonate alkalinity and the same amount of nh4cl 3820 mg l 1 in all cases that provided a constant nh4 n concentration across treatments 1000 mg l 1 nh4 n or 71 4 mmol nh4 l 1 the ph of the freshly made control solution nh4cl without inorganic carbon was lower ph 5 2 than the initial ph of treatments 1 and 2 ph 7 8 7 9 and for this reason it was adjusted from 5 2 to 7 8 with the addition of a small amount of naoh 1 5 mmol naoh l 1 the experiment used the set up of dube et al 2016 with aeration rate of 0 12 l air per l of wastewater per minute 1 5 l effective reactor volume 60 cm tubular membrane length same membrane described in section 2 2 4 ml min acid circulation rate and 250 ml 0 5 m h2so4 in the acid tank the room temperature was constant 20 9 1 0 c the trials were carried out in duplicate reactors results of treatment 1 were compared in regards to alkalinity consumption and nh4 removal with results obtained by other authors using a variety of digested and raw manures the third experiment evaluated the effect that organic matter content in wastewater could have on the flow of nh3 through the membrane and the n recovery three synthetic wastewaters were prepared containing different concentrations of humic acids three treatments 3000 4500 and 6000 mg l 1 added humic acid sodium salt sigma aldrich ref h16752 all treatments contained 1000 mg l 1 of nh4 778 mg nh4 n l 1 using nh4no3 chemical and 9660 mg l 1 nahco3 nh4 hco3 molar ratio 0 5 that provided a non limited inorganic carbon supply the trials were carried out in single reactors using the ammonia separator reactor and conditions described in section 2 2 the fourth experiment used real manure samples of high to very high strength from a swine farm located in santomera murcia spain using the ammonia separator reactor described in section 2 2 representative composite samples were taken from vessels containing a semisolid manure from the fattening production stage samples 10 were collected at 3 points of the vessel from the top 1 50 m depth using 5 l sampling jars and combined the composite manure sample was transported to the laboratory it was a semisolid material 14 6 ts for the n recovery experiments the thick manure was diluted with water 1 3 liquid swine manure 1 and 1 5 liquid swine manure 2 table 2 water used for dilution was farm well water simulating the effect of cleaning as a usual farm practice the farm water contained a high level of bicarbonate 249 mg hco3 l 1 204 mg alkalinity l 1 other characteristics of the fam water were ph 8 0 0 1 ec ms cm 0 80 6 calcium 68 9 13 ammonia n mg l 1 0 05 14 co3 2 3 12 the strengths of swine manure have been classified based on ts concentration low 0 4 0 8 medium 0 8 1 7 and high 1 7 3 2 garcía gonzález and vanotti 2015 accordingly the strength of liquid manure 1 having 3 65 ts was very high and that of liquid manure 2 with 2 42 ts was high the trials were carried out in duplicate reactors 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of the ratio nh4 hco3 on nh4 removal and recovery fig 3 shows ph evolution in the four treatments in the first experiment using wastewater with varied nh4 hco3 molar ratios of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 measurements were performed approximately every 20 min during the first hour of the experiment and from that moment on every 24 h in all the events we observed an increase in the ph of about 0 5 0 6 in the first hour the ph increase at 24 h varied among treatment in the two samples with lower nh4 hco3 ratios 0 5 and 1 0 the ph increases were 0 91 1 15 reaching ph levels between 8 8 and 9 1 units this contrasted with the lower ph increases about 0 6 in the other two samples with higher nh4 hco3 ratios 1 5 and 2 reaching ph levels at 24 h of 8 3 8 5 precisely in all the cases and in this same 1 d period the highest rates of nh4 removal were attained fig 4 a the ph increases obtained with synthetic solution and low rate aeration are consistent with ph increases of 1 1 8 36 9 47 obtained by vanotti et al 2017 for anaerobically digested swine wastewater treated with the same technique nevertheless from the first day onwards the ph decreased in all the treatments except for the one with the lowest nh4 hco3 molar ratio of 0 5 where it rose reaching a final value at day 4 of around 9 5 units and a net ph increase of 1 5 at the same time the percentage of nh4 removal grew to values of 98 table 3 and fig 4b for the treatment with nh4 hco3 molar ratio of 1 the decrease in the ph level from day 1 to 4 was small from 8 8 to 8 5 units obtaining a net ph increase of 0 6 and a high nh4 removal of 96 similar to the first treatment regarding the treatments where higher nh4 hco3 molar ratios were used 1 5 and 2 the ph fall was sharp after 1 day fig 3 with final ph values averaging 4 5 units and percentages of nh4 removal under 65 table 3 these results indicate that the applied na2co3 which provided a carbonate alkalinity concentration of 5750 mg l 1 in each of the experiments was enough for handling nh4 concentrations not to exceed 2000 mg l 1 1556 mg nh4 n l 1 this suggested that to obtain high removal efficiencies by this process the carbonate alkalinity concentration initially present in wastewater should at least exceed 3 7 the initial nh4 n concentration with lower carbonate alkalinity to ammonia ratios higher nh4 hco3 molar ratio the carbonate was used up quickly in the process of n recovery that generates acidity eq 3 and this caused a decrease in the ph of the wastewater environment pushing the equilibrium of eq 1 towards the left inhibiting nh 4 removal by the gas permeable membrane system as observed in fig 4 by analyzing the four treatments the maximum concentration of ammonium ion that was removed approximately 106 115 mmol l 1 of nh4 1800 1950 mg nh4 l 1 just matches the concentration of bicarbonate initially added 115 mmol l 1 therefore approximately 1 mmol of nh4 was removed by the process per 1 mmol of hco3 initially present in the solution the percentages of nh4 recovery as nh4 2so4 ratio of nh4 recovered in the acidic solution to the nh4 removed from wastewater were high 84 in all treatments these results indicate that the bottleneck in the process was the availability of gaseous nh3 and this availability was positively affected by the relative abundance of inorganic carbon the difference between the nh4 that was removed from wastewater and the nh4 that was recovered in the acidic solution is an unaccounted mass fraction table 3 the unaccounted fraction was similar in percentage approximately 10 of the influent irrespective of the nh4 hco3 molar ratio it is concluded that there are two distinct and interconnected mechanisms affecting the recovery of nh4 using gas permeable membranes and low rate aeration in the presence of inorganic carbon one mechanism is the release of oh from the natural carbonates that does not remove total alkalinity but increases the wastewater ph eq 2 which in turn promotes nh3 formation eq 1 and n recovery by the membrane system the other mechanism is the release of acidity and consumption of alkalinity in the wastewater environment by the continuous passage of n through the gas permeable membrane eq 3 as shown in this experiment treatments 3 and 4 in figs 3 and 4 and table 4 this acidification of the wastewater due to an imbalance in the nh4 hco3 ratio can completely halt the n recovery process by inhibiting the formation of unionized ammonia nh3 therefore an abundant inorganic carbon supply in balance with the nh4 is needed for a successful operation of the process without addition of alkali chemicals 3 2 effect of inorganic carbon on nh4 removal and recovery based on the foregoing study a synthetic wastewater with abundant inorganic carbon content in balance with the nh4 was designed and tested with the gas permeable membrane process with low rate aeration this ideal wastewater contained about 15 more hco3 than needed to remove all the nh4 by the gas permeable membrane process it was prepared with nahco3 and nh4cl and contained 4100 mg l 1 alkalinity and 1000 mg l 1 nh4 n 82 mmol hco3 l 1 and 71 4 mmol nh4 l 1 with an nh4 hco3 molar ratio 0 87 the ideal wastewater was compared with a carbon deficient synthetic wastewater containing the same nh4 n content but half the hco3 41 mmol hco3 l 1 and 71 4 mmol nh4 l 1 with an nh4 hco3 molar ratio 1 74 a control treatment without inorganic carbon was also included in the trials 0 mmol hco3 l 1 and 71 4 mmol nh4 l 1 fig 5 a shows the observed changes in wastewater n concentration in the all three treatments and the simultaneous n concentration increase in the acid tank while fig 5b shows the cumulative n mass removed from the separation tank and the n mass recovered in the acid tank over a period of 7 days the treatment that used wastewater with abundant inorganic carbon content in balance with the nh4 content nh4 hco3 ratio 0 87 removed 97 of the nh4 with 93 of it recovered in the acid tank table 4 the nh4 n concentration in wastewater followed a negative exponential curve nh4 n 939 e 0 0271 hours r2 0 999 with daily decreases of 52 however when inorganic carbon was deficient nh4 hco3 ratio 1 74 the n removals by the membrane systems were significantly less 57 when the carbonate was absent control the n removal by this system collapsed 6 fig 5c and d shows the evolution of ph and alkalinity of the three treatments over the same period in the treatment with nh4 hco3 ratio of 0 87 the ph rose from 7 9 to 8 7 the first day and it was maintained high till the end of treatment ph 8 9 at day 7 when only 3 of the n remained in the separation tank the initial fa concentration in the wastewater calculated using eq 4 was 39 mg n l 1 the fa increased to 101 mg n l 1 the first day as a result of the higher ph even though the nh4 in wastewater was reduced 52 the first day subsequently days 4 7 fa decreased from 62 to 7 mg n l 1 as n was being depleted the initial alkalinity 3913 mg l 1 was significantly consumed 87 during the n recovery process leaving a residual alkalinity of 490 mg l 1 fig 5d with deficient inorganic carbon relative to ammonia nh4 hco3 ratio 1 74 the ph of wastewater 7 9 increased 0 6 units the first day and afterwards declined steadily to ph 5 5 a net ph decrease over initial of 2 4 units the initial alkalinity 2310 mg l 1 was exhausted 98 reduction by day 4 fig 5d at the same time the wastewater ph declined to 6 9 fig 5a and the n recovery process stopped leaving 43 of the nh4 in the effluent fig 5b c the fa concentrations in the wastewater were 94 mg n l 1 at day 1 with the higher ph 2 0 mg n l 1 at day 4 when the recovery stopped and 0 2 afterwards in the control without inorganic carbon the small initial alkalinity of 80 due to naoh addition was eliminated the first day the initial ph 7 8 decreased to 6 1 the first day and to 5 07 at day 5 corresponding fa concentrations were nil 0 7 and 0 06 mg n l therefore it is concluded that the n uptake by the membrane could be greatly affected when the inorganic carbonate level is deficient relative to the nh4 this was evident in treatment 2 when alkalinity was consumed and the ph decreased below about 7 that halted the n uptake by the gas permeable membrane system it is also concluded from results obtained in this experiment that abundant inorganic carbon in relation to the nh4 is needed to sustain high n removal efficiencies by this gas permeable membrane and low rate aeration process table 5 shows the alkalinity consumption in the ideal synthetic wastewater treatment 1 compared with results obtained with manures of various origins by other authors dube et al 2016 and garcía gonzález et al 2015 using the synthetic wastewater made with inorganic carbon and nh4 approximately 3 7 g of carbonate alkalinity was consumed per g of nh4 n removed by the process this consumption approaches the theoretical ratio of 3 57 when 1 mmol of hco3 is destroyed per mmol of nh4 removed the comparison with other manures reveals that the ratio for alkalinity consumption to nh4 n removal of 3 7 obtained in the synthetic wastewater with only inorganic carbon and nh4 was similar than the alkalinity consumption obtained with the three manures average 4 1 and that this ratio varied little 3 99 4 12 among manures of varied characteristics the data in table 5 also reveal that all the manures contained an ample supply of alkalinity approximately 33 higher than minimal needs to sustain the n recovery process with gas permeable membranes and low rate aeration so as to be able to extract all the nh4 without the need of supplemental alkali chemicals liquid manure is a mixture of urine water and feces livestock urine contains 55 of the excreted n of which more than 70 is in the form of urea sommer and husted 1995 urea in combination with water and urease enzyme produces nh4 and carbonate as described in eq 5 5 co nh 2 2 2 h 2 o 2 n h 4 c o 3 2 therefore a substantial part of the inorganic carbon in manure is produced during decomposition of organic compounds that provide a balanced effluent for the membrane n recovery process 3 3 the effect of organic matter humic acids on nh4 recovery fig 6 a shows the evolution of the ph with time for the three concentrations of humic acids evaluated 3000 4500 and 6000 mg l 1 with wastewater having an nh4 hco3 molar ratio of 0 5 the ph increase due to the low rate aeration was consistent among treatments it increased about 1 unit most 0 8 units in the first day reaching a final ph of around 9 2 units the modified wastewater environment conditions were optimal for n recovery by the gas permeable membrane process fig 6b shows the corresponding evolution of nh4 concentration in the wastewater in all three organic matter treatments the concentration of nh4 in wastewater was consistently decreased about 80 at 1 5 days and 95 at the end of the run 3 days the nh4 recovery efficiencies were also high 87 and not affected by the organic matter treatments table 6 therefore the presence of organic matter humic acids did not affect the ammonium removal rate and efficiency these results indicate that while inorganic carbon in wastewater is critical the organic matter in the concentrations evaluated do not inhibit the process of n recovery with gas permeable membranes 3 4 nh4 recovery from swine manure fig 7 a shows the evolution of ph during the experiment that treated two liquid swine manures of very high and high strength swine manure 1 ts 36 500 mg l 1 and swine manure 2 ts 24 300 mg l 1 they were 1 3 and 1 5 dilutions of the collected semisolid manure table 2 the experiment set up and operating conditions were the same as experiment 1 the ph increased as expected approximately 0 5 0 7 units in one day the ph of manure 1 was about 0 2 units higher probably due to the lower dilution and higher strength the higher ph environment obtained in the manure undoubtedly benefited the n removal and recovery process the manure nh4 contained in the separation tanks decreased at a steady state while the nh4 in the concentrator tanks acid tanks increased accordingly fig 7b the final level of nh4 obtained in the acid tanks after 4 days of treatment was 37 400 4200 mg nh4 n l 1 in the first treatment manure 1 and 25 000 2800 mg nh4 n l 1 in the second treatment manure 2 table 7 shows the corresponding nh4 mass balances during the short time frame of the experiment the system removed 65 and 85 of the ammonia initially present in manure 1 and 2 respectively the nh4 recovery rate was improved with the higher strength manure the recovery rate of treatment 1 was about 1720 mg n day 1 compared with 1340 mg n day 1 in treatment 2 table 7 corresponding ammonia fluxes were 8 90 and 7 11 mg n per cm2 of membrane per day the results obtained with manures showed that the amounts of nh4 recovered in the acidic solution were higher than the amount removed from the liquid manure providing nh4 recovery efficiencies of 107 and 115 table 7 this is probably due to mineralization of organic nitrogen during the 4 d treatment contributing additional nh4 to the recovered nh4 pool in any case the results with fresh manures showed that the low rate aeration increased ph of the manure resulting in an active nh4 uptake by the gas permeable membrane that gave quantitative recoveries of the nh4 and that the overall n recovery was thus optimized 4 conclusions this research determined the role of inorganic carbon bicarbonate alkalinity on the effectiveness of ammonia recovery using gas permeable membranes and low rate aeration there were two distinct and interconnected mechanisms in this new approach one was the release of oh from the natural carbonates that increased the wastewater ph and promoted gaseous ammonia formation and membrane uptake the other was the release of acidity and consumption of alkalinity by the n recovery this acidification of the wastewater can completely halt the n recovery process therefore an abundant inorganic carbon supply in balance with the nh4 is needed for a successful operation of the technology fortunately most swine manures contain ample supply of endogenous inorganic carbon and the process can be used to more economically recover ammonia using this endogenous natural inorganic carbon instead of expensive alkali chemicals finally we found that the process was not inhibited by

19630,gas permeable membranes coupled with low rate aeration is useful to recover ammonia nh4 from livestock effluents in this study the role of inorganic carbon bicarbonate hco3 to enhance the n recovery process was evaluated using synthetic effluents with various nh4 to hco3 molar ratios of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 the study also evaluated the effect of increased organic matter on the nh4 recovery using humic acids 3000 6000 mg l 1 and the n recovery from high strength swine manure the release of hydroxide from the hco3 with aeration increased the wastewater ph and promoted gaseous ammonia formation and membrane uptake at the same time the recovery of gaseous ammonia nh3 through the membrane acidified the wastewater therefore an abundant inorganic carbon supply in balance with the nh4 is needed for a successful operation of the technology nh4 removal efficiencies 96 were obtained with nh4 to hco3 ratios 1 however higher molar ratios inhibited the n recovery process resulting in lower efficiencies 65 fortunately most swine manures contain ample supply of endogenous inorganic carbon and the process can be used to more economically recover the ammonia using the natural inorganic carbon instead of expensive alkali chemicals in 4 days the recovered nh4 from swine manure contained 48 000 mg l 1 finally it was found the process was not inhibited by the increasing levels of organic matter in the wastewater evaluated graphical abstract image keywords ammonia recovery ammonia capture gas permeable membranes livestock wastewater ammonia emissions control 1 introduction ammoniacal nitrogen is one of the main contaminants of domestic and industrial waste the concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen varies from 10 to 200 mg l 1 in urban wastewater from 5 to 1000 mg l 1 in industrial wastewater such as those generated by the production of chemical fertilizers and from about 400 to 5000 mg l 1 in livestock effluents lema and suarez 2017 usda 2008 some of the environmental problems that have been cited from ammoniacal nitrogen in wastewater and liquid wastes include the reduction of the dissolved oxygen concentration the toxic effects on fish the reduction of disinfection efficiencies and metal corrosion lauterböck et al 2012 hence its removal is necessary in order to protect both natural resources and public health traditionally organic waste from livestock production has been a source of nutrients which was added to agricultural soils intensive livestock farming in certain geographical areas in europe has made this type of waste a problem since it has caused the contamination of aquifers and soils furthermore in 2015 the eu 28 agricultural sector emitted into the air a total of 3751 kilotonnes of ammonia and was responsible for 94 of total ammonia emissions across the region they mainly occur as a result of volatilisation from livestock excreta eea 2017 while this happens the global consumption of synthetic fertilizers grows heffer and prud homme 2013 therefore the capture and recovery of ammonia from livestock farming and its transfer to areas suffering shortages is necessary in this way reducing the environmental impact while at the same time replacing commercial fertilizers and opening new economic perspectives keyzer 2010 szogi et al 2015 vanotti et al 2017 the different techniques to remove the nitrogen content can be classified into biological chemical and physical processes the biological processes include nitrification denitrification vanotti et al 2009 anammox magri et al 2012a or microbial fuel cells kuntke et al 2012 the chemical and physical processes include struvite precipitation nelson et al 2003 ammonia stripping bonmatí and flotats 2003 reverse osmosis masse et al 2010 nanofiltration kertesz et al 2010 ion exchange milan et al 1997 evaporation fuchs and drogs 2013 and recently the treatment using gas permeable membranes vanotti and szogi 2015 garcía gonzález and vanotti 2015 among numerous applications the treatment with gas permeable membranes has been used to retrieve ammonium from liquid manures garcía gonzález et al 2015 garcía and vanotti 2015 this process requires augmenting the ph of the solution to be treated so as to favor the transformation of ammoniacal nitrogen nh4 into the un ionized gaseous ammonia nh3 g eq 1 enabling it to cross a microporous hydrophobic membrane where an acidic solution circulates fig 1 with a ph 2 the acidic solution dissolves the nh3 in the form of ammonium 1 n h 4 o h n h 3 g h 2 o the studies of garcía gonzález et al 2015 and vanotti and szogi 2015 have proposed using nitrification inhibitors and introducing low rate aeration to obtain a higher ph without the need of adding alkaline chemical elements in this way reducing the economic and environmental costs of ammonia treatment during aeration of the manure carbonate alkalinity is consumed and oh is instantly released increasing the ph and reducing the bicarbonate in the wastewater environment according to eq 2 and enhancing both the formation of nh3 as defined in eq 1 and the nh3 uptake via the gas permeable membrane vanotti et al 2017 for the purpose of the enhancement of the recovery of nh3 n recovery using gas permeable membranes the term low rate aeration was defined as an aeration rate that is less than about 5 of the aeration rate used for biological ammonia removal nitrification vanotti et al 2017 2 h c o 3 a i r c o 2 o h however according to eq 3 the recovery of nh3 g through the gas permeable membrane causes an increase of acidity in the wastewater environment being treated as the h does not permeate the hydrophobic membrane therefore it is necessary to continually raise the ph levels in order to maintain the efficiency of the recovery garcía gonzález and vanotti 2015 3 n h 4 n h 3 g h the aeration effect is double on one hand the increase in ph and on the other hand the increase in the concentration of free ammonia which allows active permeation of nh3 through the membrane garcía gonzález et al 2015 the implementation of this type of physical chemical treatment versus other types of nitrogen recovery systems has been discussed in several essays such as those of garcía gonzález et al 2015 zarebska et al 2015 and dube et al 2016 zarebska et al 2015 indicated that the energy consumption of recovering the nitrogen is among the lowest 0 18 kw h kg 1nh3 compared in a review of six methods it was also noted that the main economic drawback from gas permeable membrane systems was the addition of reactive alkaline chemical elements garcía gonzález et al 2015 demonstrated the positive effect of low rate aeration on the use of gas permeable membranes for the purpose of nh4 recovery with the aeration approach applied to waste effluents from raw liquid swine manures the nh4 recovered was 98 of the quantity initially present the ammonia emission losses were less than 1 5 and the operational cost of ammonia recovery was reduced by 57 with respect to the alternative approach using naoh addition to increase ph garcía gonzález et al 2015 the study of dube et al 2016 showed that the nh4 recovery with the low rate aeration was between 5 and 6 times faster than the treatment without aeration reducing treatment costs by 70 in swine manure anaerobic digester effluent although the process was proven to work in several experiments with livestock effluents the mechanism is difficult to understand when working with complex effluents with total alkalinities that may be comprised of inorganic carbon carbonate bicarbonate plus hydroxide and phosphate compounds for this reason there is a need to reconstruct the process using simple solutions to understand the role of the inorganic carbon in this n recovery process the objective of this research was to determine the role of inorganic carbon bicarbonate on the effectiveness of ammonia removal using gas permeable membranes and low rate aeration a series of experiments were carried out using synthetic solutions containing various carbonate to ammonia ratios on the efficiency of the process further the effect of organic matter content on ammonia capture was assessed using humic acids lastly the technology was applied to liquid swine manures from farm areas for fattening pigs with various high solids strengths to evaluate the behavior of the variables in the study and their impact on the efficiency of ammonium removal and recovery 2 materials and methods 2 1 analytical methods total solids volatile solids and ammoniacal nitrogen

separation reactor batch experiments were performed using the ammonium separation reactor and protocol of dube et al 2016 fig 2 it consisted of wastewater vessels made of pet with an effective volume of 2 l fitted with a submerged gas permeable membrane connected with a stripping solution reservoir that contained 200 ml acidic solution made with 0 5 m h2so4 the acidic solution was recirculated with a peristaltic pump watson marlow brand 120s model at a rate of 5 8 l day 1 this solution flowed inside the tubular membranes and returned to the stripping solution reservoir completing a closed loop the gas permeable membrane used to capture nh3 was tubular and made of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene eptfe phillips scientific inc rock hill sc the length of the tubular membrane was of 0 6 m

nitritation of swine wastewater 0 9 l air l liquid 1min 1 even so 10 mg l 1 of n allylthiourea 98 were added as a nitrification inhibitor following strategies presented in other essays vanotti and szogi 2015 2 3 experimental design four sets of experiments were carried out using the experimental device for nh4 capture shown in fig 2 experiments 1 3 and 4 were done in alicante spain and experiment 2 in south carolina usa in the first experiment the effect of nh4 hco3 molar ratios on n removal was evaluated the ph evolution and nh4 elimination were determined using synthetic wastewaters that were prepared with four different ratios of nh4 hco3 four treatments by varying the nh4 concentration and keeping the hco3 concentration constant four complete experimental reactor modules were tested simultaneously using the ammonia separator reactor described in section 2 2 the trials were carried out in single reactors target nh4 hco3 molar ratios were 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 the synthetic wastewaters were prepared with the addition of nh4no3 chemical to reach concentrations of 1000 2000 3000 and 4000 mg nh4 l 1 56 111 167 and 222 mmol nh4 l 1 and the same addition of 9660 mg l 1 nahco3 in all treatments 115 mmol l 1 of bicarbonate or 5750 mg l 1 carbonate alkalinity the second experiment evaluated the effect of inorganic carbon on n recovery from synthetic wastewaters by varying the amounts of hco3 while keeping the nh4 concentration constant the experiment included three treatments based on results of the first experiment regarding nh4 hco3 ratios and n removal the first treatment was an ideal synthetic solution in terms of the balance of inorganic carbon and nh4 it contained about 15 more hco3 than the amount needed to remove all the nh4 by the gas permeable membrane process nh4 hco3 molar ratio 0 87 the second treatment was a deficient synthetic solution also made of nh4 and inorganic carbon but containing half the hco3 used in treatment 1 nh4 hco3 molar ratio 1 74 the third treatment was a control made only with nh4 without the inorganic carbon the synthetic wastewaters in treatments 1 2 and 3 were prepared with the addition of 6 900 3450 and 0 mg l 1 nahco3 respectively 82 41 and 0 mmol l 1 bicarbonate or 4100 2050 and 0 mg l 1 carbonate alkalinity and the same amount of nh4cl 3820 mg l 1 in all cases that provided a constant nh4 n concentration across treatments 1000 mg l 1 nh4 n or 71 4 mmol nh4 l 1 the ph of the freshly made control solution nh4cl without inorganic carbon was lower ph 5 2 than the initial ph of treatments 1 and 2 ph 7 8 7 9 and for this reason it was adjusted from 5 2 to 7 8 with the addition of a small amount of naoh 1 5 mmol naoh l 1 the experiment used the set up of dube et al 2016 with aeration rate of 0 12 l air per l of wastewater per minute 1 5 l effective reactor volume 60 cm tubular membrane length same membrane described in section 2 2 4 ml min acid circulation rate and 250 ml 0 5 m h2so4 in the acid tank the room temperature was constant 20 9 1 0 c the trials were carried out in duplicate reactors results of treatment 1 were compared in regards to alkalinity consumption and nh4 removal with results obtained by other authors using a variety of digested and raw manures the third experiment evaluated the effect that organic matter content in wastewater could have on the flow of nh3 through the membrane and the n recovery three synthetic wastewaters were prepared containing different concentrations of humic acids three treatments 3000 4500 and 6000 mg l 1 added humic acid sodium salt sigma aldrich ref h16752 all treatments contained 1000 mg l 1 of nh4 778 mg nh4 n l 1 using nh4no3 chemical and 9660 mg l 1 nahco3 nh4 hco3 molar ratio 0 5 that provided a non limited inorganic carbon supply the trials were carried out in single reactors using the ammonia separator reactor and conditions described in section 2 2 the fourth experiment used real manure samples of high to very high strength from a swine farm located in santomera murcia spain using the ammonia separator reactor described in section 2 2 representative composite samples were taken from vessels containing a semisolid manure from the fattening production stage samples 10 were collected at 3 points of the vessel from the top 1 50 m depth using 5 l sampling jars and combined the composite manure sample was transported to the laboratory it was a semisolid material 14 6 ts for the n recovery experiments the thick manure was diluted with water 1 3 liquid swine manure 1 and 1 5 liquid swine manure 2 table 2 water used for dilution was farm well water simulating the effect of cleaning as a usual farm practice the farm water contained a high level of bicarbonate 249 mg hco3 l 1 204 mg alkalinity l 1 other characteristics of the fam water were ph 8 0 0 1 ec ms cm 0 80 6 calcium 68 9 13 ammonia n mg l 1 0 05 14 co3 2 3 12 the strengths of swine manure have been classified based on ts concentration low 0 4 0 8 medium 0 8 1 7 and high 1 7 3 2 garcía gonzález and vanotti 2015 accordingly the strength of liquid manure 1 having 3 65 ts was very high and that of liquid manure 2 with 2 42 ts was high the trials were carried out in duplicate reactors 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of the ratio nh4 hco3 on nh4 removal and recovery fig 3 shows ph evolution in the four treatments in the first experiment using wastewater with varied nh4 hco3 molar ratios of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 measurements were performed approximately every 20 min during the first hour of the experiment and from that moment on every 24 h in all the events we observed an increase in the ph of about 0 5 0 6 in the first hour the ph increase at 24 h varied among treatment in the two samples with lower nh4 hco3 ratios 0 5 and 1 0 the ph increases were 0 91 1 15 reaching ph levels between 8 8 and 9 1 units this contrasted with the lower ph increases about 0 6 in the other two samples with higher nh4 hco3 ratios 1 5 and 2 reaching ph levels at 24 h of 8 3 8 5 precisely in all the cases and in this same 1 d period the highest rates of nh4 removal were attained fig 4 a the ph increases obtained with synthetic solution and low rate aeration are consistent with ph increases of 1 1 8 36 9 47 obtained by vanotti et al 2017 for anaerobically digested swine wastewater treated with the same technique nevertheless from the first day onwards the ph decreased in all the treatments except for the one with the lowest nh4 hco3 molar ratio of 0 5 where it rose reaching a final value at day 4 of around 9 5 units and a net ph increase of 1 5 at the same time the percentage of nh4 removal grew to values of 98 table 3 and fig 4b for the treatment with nh4 hco3 molar ratio of 1 the decrease in the ph level from day 1 to 4 was small from 8 8 to 8 5 units obtaining a net ph increase of 0 6 and a high nh4 removal of 96 similar to the first treatment regarding the treatments where higher nh4 hco3 molar ratios were used 1 5 and 2 the ph fall was sharp after 1 day fig 3 with final ph values averaging 4 5 units and percentages of nh4 removal under 65 table 3 these results indicate that the applied na2co3 which provided a carbonate alkalinity concentration of 5750 mg l 1 in each of the experiments was enough for handling nh4 concentrations not to exceed 2000 mg l 1 1556 mg nh4 n l 1 this suggested that to obtain high removal efficiencies by this process the carbonate alkalinity concentration initially present in wastewater should at least exceed 3 7 the initial nh4 n concentration with lower carbonate alkalinity to ammonia ratios higher nh4 hco3 molar ratio the carbonate was used up quickly in the process of n recovery that generates acidity eq 3 and this caused a decrease in the ph of the wastewater environment pushing the equilibrium of eq 1 towards the left inhibiting nh 4 removal by the gas permeable membrane system as observed in fig 4 by analyzing the four treatments the maximum concentration of ammonium ion that was removed approximately 106 115 mmol l 1 of nh4 1800 1950 mg nh4 l 1 just matches the concentration of bicarbonate initially added 115 mmol l 1 therefore approximately 1 mmol of nh4 was removed by the process per 1 mmol of hco3 initially present in the solution the percentages of nh4 recovery as nh4 2so4 ratio of nh4 recovered in the acidic solution to the nh4 removed from wastewater were high 84 in all treatments these results indicate that the bottleneck in the process was the availability of gaseous nh3 and this availability was positively affected by the relative abundance of inorganic carbon the difference between the nh4 that was removed from wastewater and the nh4 that was recovered in the acidic solution is an unaccounted mass fraction table 3 the unaccounted fraction was similar in percentage approximately 10 of the influent irrespective of the nh4 hco3 molar ratio it is concluded that there are two distinct and interconnected mechanisms affecting the recovery of nh4 using gas permeable membranes and low rate aeration in the presence of inorganic carbon one mechanism is the release of oh from the natural carbonates that does not remove total alkalinity but increases the wastewater ph eq 2 which in turn promotes nh3 formation eq 1 and n recovery by the membrane system the other mechanism is the release of acidity and consumption of alkalinity in the wastewater environment by the continuous passage of n through the gas permeable membrane eq 3 as shown in this experiment treatments 3 and 4 in figs 3 and 4 and table 4 this acidification of the wastewater due to an imbalance in the nh4 hco3 ratio can completely halt the n recovery process by inhibiting the formation of unionized ammonia nh3 therefore an abundant inorganic carbon supply in balance with the nh4 is needed for a successful operation of the process without addition of alkali chemicals 3 2 effect of inorganic carbon on nh4 removal and recovery based on the foregoing study a synthetic wastewater with abundant inorganic carbon content in balance with the nh4 was designed and tested with the gas permeable membrane process with low rate aeration this ideal wastewater contained about 15 more hco3 than needed to remove all the nh4 by the gas permeable membrane process it was prepared with nahco3 and nh4cl and contained 4100 mg l 1 alkalinity and 1000 mg l 1 nh4 n 82 mmol hco3 l 1 and 71 4 mmol nh4 l 1 with an nh4 hco3 molar ratio 0 87 the ideal wastewater was compared with a carbon deficient synthetic wastewater containing the same nh4 n content but half the hco3 41 mmol hco3 l 1 and 71 4 mmol nh4 l 1 with an nh4 hco3 molar ratio 1 74 a control treatment without inorganic carbon was also included in the trials 0 mmol hco3 l 1 and 71 4 mmol nh4 l 1 fig 5 a shows the observed changes in wastewater n concentration in the all three treatments and the simultaneous n concentration increase in the acid tank while fig 5b shows the cumulative n mass removed from the separation tank and the n mass recovered in the acid tank over a period of 7 days the treatment that used wastewater with abundant inorganic carbon content in balance with the nh4 content nh4 hco3 ratio 0 87 removed 97 of the nh4 with 93 of it recovered in the acid tank table 4 the nh4 n concentration in wastewater followed a negative exponential curve nh4 n 939 e 0 0271 hours r2 0 999 with daily decreases of 52 however when inorganic carbon was deficient nh4 hco3 ratio 1 74 the n removals by the membrane systems were significantly less 57 when the carbonate was absent control the n removal by this system collapsed 6 fig 5c and d shows the evolution of ph and alkalinity of the three treatments over the same period in the treatment with nh4 hco3 ratio of 0 87 the ph rose from 7 9 to 8 7 the first day and it was maintained high till the end of treatment ph 8 9 at day 7 when only 3 of the n remained in the separation tank the initial fa concentration in the wastewater calculated using eq 4 was 39 mg n l 1 the fa increased to 101 mg n l 1 the first day as a result of the higher ph even though the nh4 in wastewater was reduced 52 the first day subsequently days 4 7 fa decreased from 62 to 7 mg n l 1 as n was being depleted the initial alkalinity 3913 mg l 1 was significantly consumed 87 during the n recovery process leaving a residual alkalinity of 490 mg l 1 fig 5d with deficient inorganic carbon relative to ammonia nh4 hco3 ratio 1 74 the ph of wastewater 7 9 increased 0 6 units the first day and afterwards declined steadily to ph 5 5 a net ph decrease over initial of 2 4 units the initial alkalinity 2310 mg l 1 was exhausted 98 reduction by day 4 fig 5d at the same time the wastewater ph declined to 6 9 fig 5a and the n recovery process stopped leaving 43 of the nh4 in the effluent fig 5b c the fa concentrations in the wastewater were 94 mg n l 1 at day 1 with the higher ph 2 0 mg n l 1 at day 4 when the recovery stopped and 0 2 afterwards in the control without inorganic carbon the small initial alkalinity of 80 due to naoh addition was eliminated the first day the initial ph 7 8 decreased to 6 1 the first day and to 5 07 at day 5 corresponding fa concentrations were nil 0 7 and 0 06 mg n l therefore it is concluded that the n uptake by the membrane could be greatly affected when the inorganic carbonate level is deficient relative to the nh4 this was evident in treatment 2 when alkalinity was consumed and the ph decreased below about 7 that halted the n uptake by the gas permeable membrane system it is also concluded from results obtained in this experiment that abundant inorganic carbon in relation to the nh4 is needed to sustain high n removal efficiencies by this gas permeable membrane and low rate aeration process table 5 shows the alkalinity consumption in the ideal synthetic wastewater treatment 1 compared with results obtained with manures of various origins by other authors dube et al 2016 and garcía gonzález et al 2015 using the synthetic wastewater made with inorganic carbon and nh4 approximately 3 7 g of carbonate alkalinity was consumed per g of nh4 n removed by the process this consumption approaches the theoretical ratio of 3 57 when 1 mmol of hco3 is destroyed per mmol of nh4 removed the comparison with other manures reveals that the ratio for alkalinity consumption to nh4 n removal of 3 7 obtained in the synthetic wastewater with only inorganic carbon and nh4 was similar than the alkalinity consumption obtained with the three manures average 4 1 and that this ratio varied little 3 99 4 12 among manures of varied characteristics the data in table 5 also reveal that all the manures contained an ample supply of alkalinity approximately 33 higher than minimal needs to sustain the n recovery process with gas permeable membranes and low rate aeration so as to be able to extract all the nh4 without the need of supplemental alkali chemicals liquid manure is a mixture of urine water and feces livestock urine contains 55 of the excreted n of which more than 70 is in the form of urea sommer and husted 1995 urea in combination with water and urease enzyme produces nh4 and carbonate as described in eq 5 5 co nh 2 2 2 h 2 o 2 n h 4 c o 3 2 therefore a substantial part of the inorganic carbon in manure is produced during decomposition of organic compounds that provide a balanced effluent for the membrane n recovery process 3 3 the effect of organic matter humic acids on nh4 recovery fig 6 a shows the evolution of the ph with time for the three concentrations of humic acids evaluated 3000 4500 and 6000 mg l 1 with wastewater having an nh4 hco3 molar ratio of 0 5 the ph increase due to the low rate aeration was consistent among treatments it increased about 1 unit most 0 8 units in the first day reaching a final ph of around 9 2 units the modified wastewater environment conditions were optimal for n recovery by the gas permeable membrane process fig 6b shows the corresponding evolution of nh4 concentration in the wastewater in all three organic matter treatments the concentration of nh4 in wastewater was consistently decreased about 80 at 1 5 days and 95 at the end of the run 3 days the nh4 recovery efficiencies were also high 87 and not affected by the organic matter treatments table 6 therefore the presence of organic matter humic acids did not affect the ammonium removal rate and efficiency these results indicate that while inorganic carbon in wastewater is critical the organic matter in the concentrations evaluated do not inhibit the process of n recovery with gas permeable membranes 3 4 nh4 recovery from swine manure fig 7 a shows the evolution of ph during the experiment that treated two liquid swine manures of very high and high strength swine manure 1 ts 36 500 mg l 1 and swine manure 2 ts 24 300 mg l 1 they were 1 3 and 1 5 dilutions of the collected semisolid manure table 2 the experiment set up and operating conditions were the same as experiment 1 the ph increased as expected approximately 0 5 0 7 units in one day the ph of manure 1 was about 0 2 units higher probably due to the lower dilution and higher strength the higher ph environment obtained in the manure undoubtedly benefited the n removal and recovery process the manure nh4 contained in the separation tanks decreased at a steady state while the nh4 in the concentrator tanks acid tanks increased accordingly fig 7b the final level of nh4 obtained in the acid tanks after 4 days of treatment was 37 400 4200 mg nh4 n l 1 in the first treatment manure 1 and 25 000 2800 mg nh4 n l 1 in the second treatment manure 2 table 7 shows the corresponding nh4 mass balances during the short time frame of the experiment the system removed 65 and 85 of the ammonia initially present in manure 1 and 2 respectively the nh4 recovery rate was improved with the higher strength manure the recovery rate of treatment 1 was about 1720 mg n day 1 compared with 1340 mg n day 1 in treatment 2 table 7 corresponding ammonia fluxes were 8 90 and 7 11 mg n per cm2 of membrane per day the results obtained with manures showed that the amounts of nh4 recovered in the acidic solution were higher than the amount removed from the liquid manure providing nh4 recovery efficiencies of 107 and 115 table 7 this is probably due to mineralization of organic nitrogen during the 4 d treatment contributing additional nh4 to the recovered nh4 pool in any case the results with fresh manures showed that the low rate aeration increased ph of the manure resulting in an active nh4 uptake by the gas permeable membrane that gave quantitative recoveries of the nh4 and that the overall n recovery was thus optimized 4 conclusions this research determined the role of inorganic carbon bicarbonate alkalinity on the effectiveness of ammonia recovery using gas permeable membranes and low rate aeration there were two distinct and interconnected mechanisms in this new approach one was the release of oh from the natural carbonates that increased the wastewater ph and promoted gaseous ammonia formation and membrane uptake the other was the release of acidity and consumption of alkalinity by the n recovery this acidification of the wastewater can completely halt the n recovery process therefore an abundant inorganic carbon supply in balance with the nh4 is needed for a successful operation of the technology fortunately most swine manures contain ample supply of endogenous inorganic carbon and the process can be used to more economically recover ammonia using this endogenous natural inorganic carbon instead of expensive alkali chemicals finally we found that the process was not inhibited by

different landuse patterns correlations between diversity environmental parameters and land use patterns were analyzed and significant correlations were highlighted overall the majority 65 5 of the annotated virome belonged to bacteriophages the percentage of caudovirales was higher in reservoirs whereas the percentages of dicistroviridae microviridae and circoviridae were higher in tributaries reservoirs showed a higher shannon index virome diversity compared to upstream tributaries land use urbanized agriculture and parkland areas influenced the characteristics of the virome distribution

the overall virome distribution and diversity in diverse freshwater ecosystems reservoirs tributaries in a tropical environment 2 compare the virome community based on the different land use patterns 3 assess the extent of human related pathogenic viruses in surface waters especially emerging zoonotic and human related viruses which may have been undetected before 2 materials and methods 2 1 site

sequencing data were trimmed to remove adaptors low quality reads primer b sequences which were used for random amplification and phix reads following the bbtools instruction version 35 43 reads were then de novo assembled into contigs by clc genomics version 8 0 3 through cross assembly strategy the assembly setting in clc genomics is minimum contig length of 1000 bp and similarity fraction 0 95 contigs were then uploaded into the metavir2 and virsorter pipeline briefly metavir2 pipeline will first extract open reading frames orfs from contigs through the metageneannotator all predicted orfs were then compared to the national centre for biotechnology information ncbi refseqvirus protein database 2015 01 05 using a reference dependent taxonomic analysis with the threshold of 50 bit score and an e value cut off of 10 3 after getting the best blast hit affiliation of each predicted gene annotation of each contig was made based on the lowest common ancestor roux et al 2014 in addition metavir2 pipeline will compute the genes affiliated to the pfam database for function analysis virsorter identified category 1 viral signal pretty sure and category 2 viral signal quite sure from the assembled sequence and the viral signal included bacterial and archaeal viruses roux et al 2015 in particular human related viruses were extracted from metavir2 results and further examined to search against ncbi non redundant nucleotide database downloaded in june 2016 through blastn search for nucleotide similarity and query coverage e value 1e 5 2 6 1 quantification of virome in order to quantify the relative abundance of each contig within different libraries reads were remapped to contigs using novoalign hercus 2012 this absolute matrix was used for quantifying the relative abundance of taxonomy assignment since every contig has its weight in quantifying virus concentration to standardize and quantify every contig s relative abundance between each library rpkm reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads was used after remapping trimmed reads to each contig across different libraries mortazavi et al 2008 reyes et al 2015 rpkm was calculated as followed r

index were calculated for each sample using macqiime version 1 9 1 with the iteration set at 10 2 6 3 pcoa analysis multivariate analysis of viral community composition under different treatments e g landuse reservoir tributaries monsoon inter monsoon season was conducted using anosim in primerv7 and permanova the similarity of each pair of samples in terms of biotic characteristics was calculated using bray curtis similarity rpkm of the total contigs and of the virsorter category 1 and 2 phages were log plus one transformed before inputting into primerv7 for pcoa and correlation analyses 2 6 4 mapping reads to reference genome all the reference genomes of qpcr rt qpcr viral targets were downloaded from ncbi and accession numbers are detailed in table s5 mapping was performed using the clc

high 90 95 or 99 three levels table s5 the threshold of three levels could represent the nucleotide variation within groups of these viral targets de graaf et al 2016 doceul et al 2016 the proportion of mapping reads equals the number of mapping reads in each library divided by the total reads in the library 2 7 geospatial analyses all geospatial analyses were performed using arcgis v 10 esri aylesbury uk and the percentage of different land use in different reservoirs and their tributaries are detailed in table 1 land use shape files were obtained from the singapore land authority and pub singapore s national water agency four different layers of map were used for analysis i catchment land use shape files ii river shape files iii sub catchment shape files and iv drain line maps wgs

quality and land use classification environmental parameters of the study sites i e reservoirs and tributaries points are illustrated in table s2 the temperature remained relatively stable for all the sampling points ranging from 27 to 29 4 c with a mean value 28 6 c ph ranged from 6 5 to 8 5 with a mean value 7 6 other environmental parameters varied more including conductivity 139 5 545 5 μs cm

mm and 4 45 mm respectively during the inter monsoon apr table 1 summarizes the land use percentage and the population density for the 7 reservoir catchments to better evaluate land use impacts on the viral community the sampling sites were classified into three categories urbanized areas agriculture areas and parkland areas sites 1 2 and 3 included approximately 65 90 residential and urban land use and as such can be regarded as urbanized areas site 4 had less than 30 of residential and urban areas with about 33 84 green and 11 67 agricultural areas site 4 was the only sampling location with a reasonable percentage of agriculture area therefore site 4 was considered as agricultural site 5 and site 7 had similar land use percentage with more than 95 of the land covered with green areas thus it was considered as parkland site 6 included 80 of residential and urban categories however unlike sites 1 4 there was no drain directly connected to the reservoir at this site and hence the chance for possible viral contamination was relatively small therefore site 6 was classified as parkland areas as well as site 5 and site 7 the land use category clustering of the seven different sites illustrated the reasonability of our land use category classification fig s1 the population density was obtained from the singapore department of statistics among the sample locations sites 1 2 and 6 had the highest population densities 5000 people km 2 while sites 4 5 and 7 had the lowest 10 people km2 3 2 overall virome description a total of 1 156 hundred million high quality hiseq sequencing reads of 38 samples were obtained from different reservoirs and their tributaries in singapore during the monsoon and inter monsoon periods table s6 these were assembled across different libraries and 156 706 contigs were generated with an average length of 2035bp n50 2020bp on average 58 67 12 7 reads mapped back to the assembled contigs per library min 34 20 max 85 67 of the 156 706 contigs 65 598 contigs were annotated using metavir2 pipeline based on the absolute reads matrix the number of reads mapped to each family in each sample and the metavir2 annotation result on average 58 6 was annotated and a total of 66 families were identified fig 1 the majority 38 4 of these reads belonged to the caudovirales myoviridae siphoviridae and podoviridae this was followed by reads for phycodnaviridae and mimiviridae whose hosts belong to algae and amoeba which were retrieved at percentages of 3 0 and 2 5 respectively apart from these major viral families other families such as dicistrovidae microviridae circoviridae iridoviridae and poxviridae were also present in our study 7 8 were unclassified viral sequences and more than 40 were unassigned na sequences function analysis of the 156 706 viral contigs identified 483 461 genes and 185 519 38 4 of the genes encoded hypothetical proteins or conserved hypothetical proteins the 30 most retrieved pfam annotations showed that phage terminase enzyme phage portal and phage integrase were responsible for the phage function table s7 3 3 taxonomy assignment of virome in both reservoirs and their tributaries fig 2 a shows the taxonomic percentage of virome in 3 reservoirs and their tributaries sites 1 2 and 4 fluctuation could be observed within tributaries at the same sampling site in contrast virome composition in reservoirs was similar across several sampling points in singapore and shows a more stable pattern than the tributaries fig 2b on average caudovirales accounts for 59 8 among all the annotated viruses in all the tributaries sites 1 2 and 4 with a proportion of 58 1 and 61 7 in jan and apr respectively for the reservoirs caudovirales comprises an average of 70 65 among all the annotated viruses with a proportion of 72 9 and 67 8 in jan and apr respectively note that the percentage of caudovirales was higher in all the reservoirs than in all the tributaries in contrast the percentage of dicistroviridae was higher in tributaries 11 8 than in reservoirs 1 1 in jan tables s8 and s9 the percentage of microviridae and circoviridae in tributaries was approximately 4 6 reservoirs 0 34 and 3 2 0 21 respectively the shift in composition was observed as the percentage of caudovirales decreased while the percentage of dicistroviridae microviridae and circoviridae subsequently increased as locations changed from reservoirs to tributaries viral communities in different reservoirs in terms of land use impact were compared and the majority of viral communities were largely conserved and stable at the family level with myoviridae siphoviridae and podoviridae as the main family level and small differences observed in dicistroviridae and other families fig 2b 3 4 α diversity and its correlation with environmental parameters and land use both the richness and diversity observed species and shannon diversity was calculated on the taxonomically affiliated viruses from the subsampled absolute reads matrix the species richness of viral samples from reservoirs with tributaries comprising mostly agriculture and urbanized areas had a similar amount of species while those from parkland areas showed lower viral richness which was reasonable as parkland areas would generally receive less viral contamination it was also noted that the viral species richness from tributaries was also lower than their corresponding reservoirs the average shannon diversity of reservoirs and tributaries was computed as 10 4 and 8 4 respectively and a one way anova test showed that the shannon diversity of tributaries was significantly smaller than those from reservoirs p 0 05 this indicated that tributaries were more likely to be dominated by selected species compared to the reservoirs fig s2 and this may be related to the viral host s presence e g bacteria archaea algae insects plants animals future studies could explore this further a spearman rank correlation was carried out between richness and diversity observed species and shannon index calculated by macqiime environmental parameters and the land use pattern table 2 the correlation coefficient showed that the richness index of observed species was significantly positively correlated with rainfall and agriculture while the shannon index was negatively correlated with ph 3 5 β diversity and its correlation with land use impacts when looking at the β diversity of the microbial community 0 22 μm structure the distribution of rpkm 0 22 μm microbial community varied significantly between land use permanova p 0 0001 pseudo f 3 29 and between reservoirs and tributaries permanova p 0 0002 pseudo f 3 35 however no significant difference was observed between monsoon and inter monsoon periods permanova p 0 0923 pseudo f 1 47 and there was no significant cross linking between the three factors table s10 to further evaluate the influence of land use category urban agriculture and parkland areas in shaping the viral community anosim global test r 0 45 significance level 0 1 pairwise tests in the anosim test showed that the major differences were between urban and parkland r 0 765 significance level 0 1 and between agriculture and parkland r 0 811 significance level 2 however the microbial community 0 22 μm from the urbanized category appeared to have a similar structure to that of the agriculture category r 0 051 significant level 35 7 pcoa analysis suggested that land use had an impact on both microbial community 0 22 μm composition and the virsorter category 1 and 2 phage community both shared similar patterns where parkland samples grouped together while samples from urbanized and agricultural areas were dispersed in the left corner fig 3 a and b this pattern was consistent with the bacterial community geospatial distribution fig 3e and f mimiviridae phycodnaviridae podoviridae and siphoviridae were enriched in parkland areas spearman r 0 36 0 52 to pco1 whereas dicistroviridae and microviridae were enriched in urbanized areas spearman r 0 37 to pco1 fig 3a acidobacteria actinobacteria and verrucomicrobia were enriched in parkland areas spearman r 0 70 to 0 90 to pco1 cyanobacteria were enriched in agricultural areas r 0 75 to pco2 whereas proteobacteria were enriched in urbanized and agricultural areas spearman r 0 90 to pco1 fig 3e comparable to a recent study conducted in singapore showing that proteobacteria were enriched in horticultural and residential samples nshimyimana et al 2017 the microbial community 0 22 μm and virsorter category 1 and 2 phage community in the seven reservoirs both showed distinctly different distributions within reservoirs tributaries and within different sites fig 3c and d different sampling points of reservoirs at sites 5 and 6 did not show any difference for sites 1 3 and 4 the microbial community shared a similar contig profile even though they did not share the same land use pattern i e sites 1 and 3 urbanized area site 4 agriculture area noticeably urbanized area site 2 showed a slightly different pattern when compared with the other three reservoirs perhaps due to potential different viral host communities site 2 is near the construction sites the microbial community in the tributaries for sites 1 2 and 4 were much more variable spatially and temporally compared to the reservoir microbial community 3 6 human and plant related viruses in our study 7 contigs were affiliated to human picobirnaviruses and 2 contigs were affiliated to cycloviruses they had a higher relative abundance in the urbanized and agricultural reservoirs and all the tributaries fig 4 possible viral contamination could be from urban drains including those from housing estates sewer leakage and construction sites although previous studies have detected enteric viruses in urban catchments in singapore aw and gin 2011 aw et al 2009 liang et al 2015 rezaeinejad et al 2014 our metagenomics sequencing was unable to find contigs assigned to the enteric viruses commonly detected in singapore surface waters e g norovirus gi norovirus gii adenovirus rotavirus however several fecal indicators including pmmov frnagi ms2 and frnagiii qbeta were detected in our samples interestingly in our study the 6 pmmov affiliated contigs had a higher nucleotide similarity 97 25 99 82 with the average query coverage of 98 5 table 3 suggesting that pmmov is a highly conserved virus with a lower evolution rate in the surface water environment this result is similar with a recent study where pmmov detected in 85 of surface water samples shared 99 100 nucleotide identity with pmmov reference genome rosiles gonzález et al 2017 3 7 correlation of metagenomics data with molecular assays for selected viral targets qpcr rt qpcr was conducted to detect and quantify the concentration of the common enteric and zoonotic viruses in the surveyed communities 14 viral targets 9 viral pathogens 4 f male specific coliphages and 1 plant virus were measured and the detection frequency was between 0 and 65 79 across all the samples table s5 the 9 viral pathogens detected in this study using qpcr rt qpcr included enteric viruses adenovirus astrovirus rotavirus norovirus gi norovirus gii enterovirus and aichi virus and other zoonotic viruses e g hepatitis e virus saporo virus reads mapping to human infective viruses were rare and were not observed to assemble into contigs high quality reads from different libraries were aligned to the viral pathogen database vipr ird and mapped to viral reference genomes in ncbi table s5 few reads 1 9 reads per library were assigned to the human infective viruses norovirus and saporo virus using both vip pipeline and standalone pipeline results not shown li et al 2016 and 0 23 reads per library were mapped to human viral pathogens reference genome at the 90 99 nucleotide similarity level no significant correlations were observed between qpcr measurements and read mapping for these viruses these results suggest that metagenomics is less sensitive at detecting low abundance viral pathogens against a background of a large proportion of bacteriophages a total of 3 targets were found in both the metagenomics contigs and qpcr data of these pmmov showed a good spearman rank correlation p 0 05 table 4 spearman rank correlation was carried out between the pmmov molecular results and the corresponding metagenomics data in terms of contigs level and reads level table 5 in terms of contigs level all 6 pmmov affiliated contigs showed a significant good correlation between molecular results and metagenomics data 0 588 r 0 795 p 0 05 in terms of reads level out of the 38 libraries 23 libraries 60 5 had reads mapping to the pmmov reference genome nc 003630 1 with 99 identity to the reference genome based on all the 38 samples the spearman rank correlation coefficient was 0 879 p 0 05 table 5 4 discussion this study is the first to correlate land use impact with freshwater water viromes in an urban tropical environment using illumina hiseq sequencing it is noteworthy that metagenomics of dna viruses and rna viruses have been often considered separately and that studies of dna viruses are far more than rna virome analysis this disparity is largely a result of technical challenges presented by rna metagenomics as rna is fragile and needs to be reverse transcribed into dna thus up till now the majority of the virome metagenomics papers studied either dna or rna but not both moreover the amplification protocol reported in these earlier studies may have influenced the final outcome lópez bueno et al 2009 rodriguez brito et al 2010 for dna viruses the genomiphi kit ge healthcare has been used for amplification through dna polymerase phi29 but it was discovered that it has a bias towards single stranded circular dna viruses for rna virome analysis random priming mediated sequence independent single primer amplification rp sispa was used in lake needwood maryland djikeng et al 2009 wang et al 2002 developed a protocol capable of amplifying dna and rna viruses simultaneously this was subsequently tested in reclaimed water plasma samples wastewater and ballast water bibby and peccia 2013 kim et al 2015 rosario et al 2009 wylie et al 2012 rna viruses account for more than 70 of the viral pathogens due to their adaptive abilities mutations recombinations or reassortments to infect novel hosts easily temmam et al 2014 in our study 92 3 of viruses are dna viruses whereas 7 6 are rna viruses among annotated viral families among all the viral pathogens detected by metagenomics 10 contigs affiliated to human picobirnaviruses are dna viruses whereas 2 contigs affiliated to cyclovirus are rna viruses the simultaneous application of combining both dna and rna metagenomics enabled the identification of a much larger numbers of viral sequences especially for human related viruses this was the approach taken in our study here 4 1 geospatial distribution of virome in this geospatial metagenomics study we identified virome abundance and diversity in different reservoirs and tributaries due to insufficient viral genome sequencing information in the ncbi 41 4 of the virome genome had no significant hits and bacteriophages were the most abundant organisms in the matrix which is in agreement with previous studies of surface water viromes mohiuddin and schellhorn 2015 skvortsov et al 2016 tseng et al 2013 phages considered to be the most abundant and diverse biological entities on earth play an important role in shaping biological and geochemical processes at the global scale díaz muñoz and koskella 2014 they may also be responsible for human health in spite of the fact that they do not infect humans this is because some phages can convey new properties of coding for toxin production to the host bacteria thus converting harmless bacteria into pathogens grabow 2001 for example the shiga toxin converting phages have been known to change the pathogenicity of e coli o157 h7 muniesa and jofre 2000 tributaries were found to have a higher proportion of microviridae and dicistroviridae the hosts of microviridae belonged to enterobacteriaceae and obligate parasitic bacteria roux et al 2012 most of the enterobacteriaceae taxa strains are pathogenic for example virulent strains of e coli and klebsiella pneumonia enterobacteriaceae occurred more in tributaries which may contribute to the distribution and abundance of microviridae in tributaries the hosts of dicistroviridae are soil inhabiting invertebrates e g aphids and ants which are common in tropical singapore thus the fact that tributaries harbor the viral hosts indicate that the viruses may be released from catchments and be washed into the tributary periodically the smaller spatial variation pattern of larger reservoirs compared with tributaries was not surprising as reservoirs tend to be more resilient to urban and storm water runoff than their tributaries in previous studies freshwater microbial communities have been found to be resilient to natural disturbances tseng et al 2013 4 2 influence of environmental parameters land use and human activities on α diversity and community structure when correlating α diversity with environmental parameters and land use factors it was found that ph had a significant correlation among all the environmental parameters r 0 399 p 0 05 ph is a key factor in determining virus infectivity where low ph ph 4 has been found to significantly reduce phage survivability 70 100 jurczak kurek et al 2016 even though the ph range in this study is relatively small 6 185 8 78 it is likely that these differences could make a difference in viral α diversity in our study a moderate correlation with rainfall r 0 329 p 0 05 was observed which could be due to heavy rainfall flushing terrestrial bacteria viruses and nutrients to the reservoir tseng et al 2013 precipitation was found to be the major factor affecting the microbial community in a subtropical reservoir in taiwan tseng et al 2013 singapore is characterized by two main monsoon seasons the northeast monsoon december march and southwest monsoon season june september 24 hour rainfall during the sampling times during the monsoon and inter monsoon season showed a significant difference between january 2015 9 69 mm and april 2015 1 42 mm one way anova f 3 018 p value 0 091 which could have contributed to the characterization of the virome composition based on land use category observed species were also found to be significantly correlated with agriculture land use r 0 342 p 0 05 this could be expected as intensive agriculture has been reported to bring nutrients and agricultural chemicals to the water cycle foley et al 2005 which in turn disturbs the microbial community indirectly tseng et al 2013 agricultural intensification has been associated with pathogen emergence transmission between wildlife and domestic animal populations and human populations which in turn could increase the species of zoonotic viruses pulliam et al 2012 jones et al 2008 concluded that agricultural practices are one of the socioeconomic drivers in the spatial distribution of emerging infectious diseases however the non significant correlation between diversity and other land use types does not necessarily suggest weak connections between the viral community and land use factor since α diversity indices shannon diversity and observed species are just one aspect of characterizing the viral community and does not necessarily represent a complete view β diversity analysis indicated that mimiviridae phycodnaviridae siphoviridae and podoviridae were enriched in reservoirs of parkland areas while dicistroviridae and microviridae were enriched in tributaries of urban areas fig 3a siphoviridae podoviridae and microviridae belong to bacteriophage which may be associated with parkland and urban enriched bacteria i e actinobacteria verrucomicrobia chloroflexi acidobacteria and proteobacteria in our study fig 3e overall viral diversity in the surveyed reservoirs 8 h 12 was higher than that reported in a subtropical reservoir in taiwan 5 1 h 7 0 tseng et al 2013 these differences could be due to the geographical latitudinal gradient differences in microbial diversity as low latitude tropical ecosystems tend to lead to higher biological diversity chown and convey 2007 fuhrman et al 2008 kim et al 2016 reported that viruses had higher richness near the equator and lower richness at higher latitude similar to human pathogen species guernier et al 2004 however these comparisons between the diversity in freshwater virome studies need further confirmation due to different indices used chao1 simpson index shannon index and observed species and diverse calculation methods applied e g phaccs qiime catchall by using phaccs based on the contig spectra generated by circonspect tseng et al 2013 derived a shannon diversity h range from 5 1 to 7 and from 7 8k to 21 8k viral genotypes in one subtropical freshwater reservoir which was lower than the ocean s virome shannon diversity in british columbia the gulf of mexico and the sargasso sea h of 10 8 8 21 and 7 74 respectively angly et al 2009 the difference in methods used in published papers makes it difficult to draw comparable conclusions a standard pipeline in deriving the viral diversity in ecology is required in order to make comparisons of viral diversity across diverse aquatic ecosystems from different studies the graphs of pcoa analysis in both reservoirs and tributaries indicated that the land use pattern around the surveyed areas had an important impact on characterizing the virome community even though the viral communities at the family level were conserved across different reservoirs the pcoa plots suggested a dynamic shift in differences between contig levels of the viral community in terms of land use the geospatial distribution patterns in the surface water environment could have resulted from both direct and indirect factors on the one hand the different land use patterns could also introduce foreign viral contamination into water bodies directly through urban agriculture runoff precipitation leaking sewers etc while the viral community itself can be indirectly changed and characterized by the relationship to their hosts in specific environments the runoff from the surrounding areas can also bring specific bacteria or other vectors and nutrients into the reservoirs and the tributaries tseng et al 2013 even though previous studies have shown the correlation between land use and water borne viral pathogens corsi et al 2014 lenaker et al 2017 ours is the first study correlating land use cover with the whole viral community thus overcoming the limitations of investigating specific viruses and providing comprehensive information on the community structure with the relationship of land use cover 4 3 human plant related viruses and correlations between qpcr rt qpcr and metagenomics viral pathogens could be introduced into reservoirs and tributaries through urban and storm water runoff although enteric viruses e g adenovirus norovirus rotavirus enterovirus etc could not be detected with viral metagenomics in our study past studies have shown that they are prevalent in tributaries using qpcr and thus need to be carefully monitored for quantifying risk assessment and providing guidelines for water recreational activities aw and gin 2011 aw et al 2009 vergara et al 2016 quantified illness risks of norovirus in an urban catchment in singapore by using quantitative microbial risk assessment the finding reported mean probability of illness associated with norovirus were 0 0061 and 0 0089 in the scenario of primary contact recreation of adults and children which is below the usepa guideline value of 0 036 usepa 2012 in addition other potential emerging viral pathogens e g hepatitis e virus coronavirus cyclovirus bird flu virus which may originate from wildlife and indigenous animals in tropical forests or animal parks can also spread to neighboring tributaries potentially causing disease to humans according to jones et al 2008 the emerging infectious diseases are dominated by zoonoses 60 3 and the majority of these are from wildlife 71 8 with an increasing trend and more hotspots concentrated in lower latitude developing countries in this study we observed sequences related to the human infective virus human picobirnavirus and the emerging zoonotic virus cyclovirus human picobirnavirus a bi segmented double stranded rna virus has been detected in both healthy and unhealthy human beings it has also been found to be prevalent 100 detection frequency in raw sewage samples collected in the united states symonds et al 2009 the pathogenicity of human picobirnaviruses has not been established and it has been suggested as an opportunistic pathogen which might cause diarrhea giordano et al 1999 grohmann et al 1993 as metagenomics can only provide relative abundance further studies are needed using qpcr in order to determine absolute concentrations and to better evaluate health risks viruses belonging to the circoviridae approximately 0 6 of the virome may be involved in disease in vertebrate animals and plants a large proportion was found to belong to swan circoviruses 59 and circoviridae 2 ldmd 2013 30 two contigs found in the present study were assigned to the suggested cyclovirus vn which originated from human samples in vietnam garigliany et al 2014 indeed cyclovirus vn was initially reported to be restricted to central and southern vietnam but was subsequently detected in both farm animals and human clinical samples from africa indicating their geographic transmission capacity garigliany et al 2014 van doorn et al 2013 in singapore human cyclovirus vs5700009 cycv vs5700009 was previously found in singapore harbor water by using a metagenomics approach kim et al 2016 the contig 89154 shared a 97 79 nucleotide similarity with human cyclovirus vn kf031466 with a query coverage of 98 15 the discovery of cyclovirus vn in freshwater tributaries in the densely populated area of site 2 in our study indicates a possible transmission of the emerging human cyclovirus in the singapore urban water cycle further risk assessment of host populations should be conducted for these water environments van doorn et al 2013 samples from sites 5 6 and 7 had lower occurrence rate both rpkm and absolute reads matrix and concentration of human picobirnavirus and cyclovirus affiliated viruses consistent with lower human population density 10 people km2 except for reservoir 6 the exception of reservoir 6 explained in results 3 1 suggested that drainage points could also be significant drivers in shaping the viral communities as well as land use cover and population density higher population density could result in high occurrence of human related viruses lenaker et al 2017 here the population density to some extent could reflect the hotspots of human related viruses limitation of using population density to quantify human activities and human related viral hosts in our study exists as the population density referred to is the resident population however the mobile population such as those associated with modern transportation tourism business travel and immigration could also contribute to dissemination of these high impact pathogens arguin et al 2009 in addition public holidays could introduce variation in population numbers to commercial and recreational areas based on lifestyle choices thereafter more detailed data will be needed in order to track and investigate the human related virus transmission patterns through virus host interaction in our sequencing data the absence of the majority of enteric viruses in surface waters is reasonable a potentially relatively low abundance of human related viruses in our surface water system and insufficient sequencing coverage could have resulted in rare sequences not being assembled into contigs for further downstream analysis in contrast with our freshwater ecosystem a previous study of sewage sludge samples revealed a large number of human viral pathogens unveiling 43 types of human viruses bibby and peccia 2013 this result is expected as the sludge matrix harbors large amounts of human related viruses and the concentrations of viral pathogens are much higher in our study a good spearman rank correlation 0 588 r 0 795 p 0 05 for the indicator virus pmmov was discovered as the qpcr rt qpcr concentrations of this target are relatively higher pmmov geomean 958 45gc l this suggests that viral metagenomics to some extent is a conservative estimate of the true viral abundance based on validation of rt qpcr data with rpkm in relative abundance of contigs especially for contigs with a higher qpcr concentration similar results were also obtained in a previous study where a significant correlation p 0 0001 between qpcr and rpkm across viral taxa in clinical samples was obtained graf et al 2016 overall viral metagenomics has its advantage in the simultaneous discovery of the entire set of targets in the community in spite of the intrinsic limitation of downstream bioinformatics i e assembly efficiency and database bias it can pave the way in finding emerging zoonotic viruses and alternative plausible fecal indicators in predicting viral pathogens in the future after zooming into the specific and desired targets using high throughput sequencing gene specific pcr or qpcr e g cyclovirus vn could be further investigated to confirm the presence of these potential viral pathogens and zoonotic viruses to reveal the epidemiology or transmission patterns of these viral pathogens kim et al 2015 5 conclusion this study has shed light on the diversity of the viral communities in tropical reservoirs and their tributaries with different land use correlations between the diversity index physical chemical parameters and land use patterns showed that environmental parameters i e ph and precipitation and spatial factors e g reservoirs tributaries land use are the main drivers of the viral community structure although enteric viruses were not detected by viral metagenomics human related viruses including emerging zoonotic viruses were detected in our samples indicating the importance of continued monitoring of these environments where specific hosts could be harbored in addition the links between qpcr rt qpcr and metagenomics were shown using both contigs and reads confirming that our metagenomics quantification path is reliable and scientific even though metagenomics sequencing technology cannot replace qpcr rt qpcr due to its relatively low sensitivity in detecting gene specific viral pathogens its wide coverage of viral targets could add valuable information such as detecting new emerging zoonotic viruses and finding alternative fecal indicators or markers of contamination acknowledgements this research grant is supported by the

19631,this study seeks to understand the general distribution of virome abundance and diversity in tropical freshwater ecosystems in singapore and the geospatial distribution of the virome under different landuse patterns correlations between diversity environmental parameters and land use patterns were analyzed and significant correlations were highlighted overall the majority 65 5 of the annotated virome belonged to bacteriophages the percentage of caudovirales was higher in reservoirs whereas the percentages of dicistroviridae microviridae and circoviridae were higher in tributaries reservoirs showed a higher shannon index virome diversity compared to upstream tributaries land use urbanized agriculture and parkland areas influenced the characteristics of the virome distribution pattern dicistroviridae and microviridae were enriched in urbanized tributaries while mimiviridae phycodnaviridae siphoviridae and podoviridae were enriched in parkland reservoirs several sequences closely related to the emerging zoonotic virus cyclovirus and the human related virus human picobirnavirus were also detected in addition the relative abundance of pmmov pepper mild mottle virus sequences was significantly correlated with rt qpcr measurements 0 588 r 0 879 p 0 05 this study shows that spatial factors e g reservoirs tributaries land use are the main drivers of the viral community structure in tropical freshwater ecosystems graphical abstract image 1 keywords virome land use geospatial distribution diversity human related viruses freshwater ecosystems 1 introduction viruses are the most abundant living entities on earth and all living entities are associated with at least one virus which can control microbial communities ackermann 2003 viral metagenomics have been reported widely in water cycles especially marine waters to evaluate the role of viruses in microbial diversity and biogeochemical cycling angly et al 2006 breitbart et al 2002 cassman et al 2012 culley et al 2006 determining the factors in constructing the viral community is important for both understanding and manipulating ecosystems dinsdale et al 2008 factors shaping the viral community in freshwater ecosystems can include temporal factors geospatial factors natural disturbances e g typhoon and human activities djikeng et al 2009 emerson et al 2012 fancello et al 2013 ge et al 2013 hwang et al 2017 lópez bueno et al 2009 skvortsov et al 2016 tseng et al 2013 among all the factors land use activities is a major factor in shaping waterborne viromes land use changes are the primary drivers of the viral community and a range of associated infectious waterborne disease outbreaks patz et al 2004 2008 in the water cycle agriculture brings excess nutrients and agricultural chemicals to surface waters causing oxygen depletion and increasing algal blooms foley et al 2005 urbanization degrades water quality through surface runoff and human pathogenic viruses have been detected more frequently in watersheds with dominant urban and agricultural land cover corsi et al 2014 lenaker et al 2017 furthermore human expansion into wildlife habitats or construction of zoos and animal parks provide opportunities for human wildlife interactions thus increasing the risk for the possible transmission of zoonotic viruses to human populations patz et al 2008 these different anthropogenic activities harbor diverse and distinct viral hosts including bacteria plants wild animals and humans it is hypothesized that the environment surrounding these reservoirs may favor distinct viral predators and further change the viral community characterization however up till now studies of land use impacts on the virome community in freshwater ecosystems are still limited as they mainly rely on traditional methodology culture based method or qpcr rt qpcr which focuses on limited human virus targets without considering the whole picture of the viral community in the water environment corsi et al 2014 lenaker et al 2017 to date there is no systematic report focusing on the geospatial distribution and diversity of viromes in natural surface waters and how they may be impacted by human activities and the effect of different land use in addition emerging viral pathogens of zoonotic origin could also be discovered through viral metagenomics for which information is very limited singapore is a highly urbanized island located in the tropics with an area of 719 1 km2 and a population of 5 61 million in 2016 department of statistics singapore 2016 water is a scarce resource in this country and a total of 17 reservoirs are used to collect rainwater and surface waters for potable water supplies increasingly selected reservoirs are being used as focal points for sporting events kayaking and dragon boating and recreational activities so that the public can enjoy and appreciate water resources as such good water quality is needed to protect recreational users of these water bodies previous studies have detected waterborne viral pathogens e g norovirus gi gii adenovirus rotavirus and astrovirus in singapore water bodies using qpcr rt qpcr aw and gin 2011 aw et al 2009 rezaeinejad et al 2014 thus continued surveillance of these viral targets as well as a broader range of viral targets expanded to the virome community coupled with land use information could provide important data and new dimensions for managing the safety of water resources for these reasons understanding the geospatial distribution of viromes is needed in this study seven tropical reservoirs with diverse upstream land use functions i e urbanized agricultural and parkland areas were examined the viral community structure and virome populations specific to each of these environments were systematically investigated together with the characteristics of the watershed by conducting a complete virome analysis of these freshwater ecosystems especially viral pathogens and fecal viral indicators a comprehensive picture of the links between the virome community structure and specific land use activities could be elucidated and thus used to conduct risk assessment of associated waterborne disease this information would be important for environmental management at a macroscopic level to protect public health thus the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the overall virome distribution and diversity in diverse freshwater ecosystems reservoirs tributaries in a tropical environment 2 compare the virome community based on the different land use patterns 3 assess the extent of human related pathogenic viruses in surface waters especially emerging zoonotic and human related viruses which may have been undetected before 2 materials and methods 2 1 site

then de novo assembled into contigs by clc genomics version 8 0 3 through cross assembly strategy the assembly setting in clc genomics is minimum contig length of 1000 bp and similarity fraction 0 95 contigs were then uploaded into the metavir2 and virsorter pipeline briefly metavir2 pipeline will first extract open reading frames orfs from contigs through the metageneannotator all predicted orfs were then compared to the national centre for biotechnology information ncbi refseqvirus protein database 2015 01 05 using a reference dependent taxonomic analysis with the threshold of 50 bit score and an e value cut off of 10 3 after getting the best blast hit affiliation of each predicted gene annotation of each contig was made based on the lowest common ancestor roux et al 2014 in addition metavir2 pipeline will compute the genes affiliated to the pfam database for function analysis virsorter identified category 1 viral signal pretty sure and category 2 viral signal quite sure from the

quantify the relative abundance of each contig within different libraries reads were remapped to contigs using novoalign hercus 2012 this absolute matrix was used for quantifying the relative abundance of taxonomy assignment since every contig has its weight in quantifying virus concentration to standardize and quantify every contig s relative abundance between each library rpkm reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads was used after remapping trimmed reads to each contig across different libraries mortazavi et al 2008 reyes et al 2015 rpkm was calculated as followed r

quality and land use classification environmental parameters of the study sites i e reservoirs and tributaries points are illustrated in table s2 the temperature remained relatively stable for all the sampling points ranging from 27 to 29 4 c with a mean value 28 6 c ph ranged from 6 5 to 8 5 with a mean value 7 6 other environmental parameters varied more including conductivity 139 5 545 5 μs cm

mm and 4 45 mm respectively during the inter monsoon apr table 1 summarizes the land use percentage and the population density for the 7 reservoir catchments to better evaluate land use impacts on the viral community the sampling sites were classified into three categories urbanized areas agriculture areas and parkland areas sites 1 2 and 3 included approximately 65 90 residential and urban land use and as such can be regarded as urbanized areas site 4 had less than 30 of residential and urban areas with about 33 84 green and 11 67 agricultural areas site 4 was the only sampling location with a reasonable percentage of agriculture area therefore site 4 was considered as agricultural site 5 and site 7 had similar land use percentage with more than 95 of the land covered with green areas thus it was considered as parkland site 6 included 80 of residential and urban categories however unlike sites 1 4 there was no drain directly connected to the reservoir at this site and hence the chance for possible viral contamination was relatively small therefore site 6 was classified as parkland areas as well as site 5 and site 7 the land use category clustering of the seven different sites illustrated the reasonability of our land use category classification fig s1 the population density was obtained from the singapore department of statistics among the sample locations sites 1 2 and 6 had the highest population densities 5000 people km 2 while sites 4 5 and 7 had the lowest 10 people km2 3 2 overall virome description a total of 1 156 hundred million high quality hiseq sequencing reads of 38 samples were obtained from different reservoirs and their tributaries in singapore during the monsoon and inter monsoon periods table s6 these were assembled across different libraries and 156 706 contigs were generated with an average length of 2035bp n50 2020bp on average 58 67 12 7 reads mapped back to the assembled contigs per library min 34 20 max 85 67 of the 156 706 contigs 65 598 contigs were annotated using metavir2 pipeline based on the absolute reads matrix the number of reads mapped to each family in each sample and the metavir2 annotation result on average 58 6 was annotated and a total of 66 families were identified fig 1 the majority 38 4 of these reads belonged to the caudovirales myoviridae siphoviridae and podoviridae this was followed by reads for phycodnaviridae and mimiviridae whose hosts belong to algae and amoeba which were retrieved at percentages of 3 0 and 2 5 respectively apart from these major viral families other families such as dicistrovidae microviridae circoviridae iridoviridae and poxviridae were also present in our study 7 8 were unclassified viral sequences and more than 40 were unassigned na sequences function analysis of the 156 706 viral contigs identified 483 461 genes and 185 519 38 4 of the genes encoded hypothetical proteins or conserved hypothetical proteins the 30 most retrieved pfam annotations showed that phage terminase enzyme phage portal and phage integrase were responsible for the phage function table s7 3 3 taxonomy assignment of virome in both reservoirs and their tributaries fig 2 a shows the taxonomic percentage of virome in 3 reservoirs and their tributaries sites 1 2 and 4 fluctuation could be observed within tributaries at the same sampling site in contrast virome composition in reservoirs was similar across several sampling points in singapore and shows a more stable pattern than the tributaries fig 2b on average caudovirales accounts for 59 8 among all the annotated viruses in all the tributaries sites 1 2 and 4 with a proportion of 58 1 and 61 7 in jan and apr respectively for the reservoirs caudovirales comprises an average of 70 65 among all the annotated viruses with a proportion of 72 9 and 67 8 in jan and apr respectively note that the percentage of caudovirales was higher in all the reservoirs than in all the tributaries in contrast the percentage of dicistroviridae was higher in tributaries 11 8 than in reservoirs 1 1 in jan tables s8 and s9 the percentage of microviridae and circoviridae in tributaries was approximately 4 6 reservoirs 0 34 and 3 2 0 21 respectively the shift in composition was observed as the percentage of caudovirales decreased while the percentage of dicistroviridae microviridae and circoviridae subsequently increased as locations changed from reservoirs to tributaries viral communities in different reservoirs in terms of land use impact were compared and the majority of viral communities were largely conserved and stable at the family level with myoviridae siphoviridae and podoviridae as the main family level and small differences observed in dicistroviridae and other families fig 2b 3 4 α diversity and its correlation with environmental parameters and land use both the richness and diversity observed species and shannon diversity was calculated on the taxonomically affiliated viruses from the subsampled absolute reads matrix the species richness of viral samples from reservoirs with tributaries comprising mostly agriculture and urbanized areas had a similar amount of species while those from parkland areas showed lower viral richness which was reasonable as parkland areas would generally receive less viral contamination it was also noted that the viral species richness from tributaries was also lower than their corresponding reservoirs the average shannon diversity of reservoirs and tributaries was computed as 10 4 and 8 4 respectively and a one way anova test showed that the shannon diversity of tributaries was significantly smaller than those from reservoirs p 0 05 this indicated that tributaries were more likely to be dominated by selected species compared to the reservoirs fig s2 and this may be related to the viral host s presence e g bacteria archaea algae insects plants animals future studies could explore this further a spearman rank correlation was carried out between richness and diversity observed species and shannon index calculated by macqiime environmental parameters and the land use pattern table 2 the correlation coefficient showed that the richness index of observed species was significantly positively correlated with rainfall and agriculture while the shannon index was negatively correlated with ph 3 5 β diversity and its correlation with land use

shared similar patterns where parkland samples grouped together while samples from urbanized and agricultural areas were dispersed in the left corner fig 3 a and b this pattern was consistent with the

and microviridae were enriched in urbanized areas spearman r 0 37 to pco1 fig 3a acidobacteria actinobacteria and verrucomicrobia were enriched in parkland areas spearman r 0 70 to 0 90 to pco1 cyanobacteria were enriched in agricultural areas r 0 75 to pco2 whereas proteobacteria were enriched in urbanized and agricultural areas spearman r 0 90 to pco1 fig 3e comparable to a recent study conducted in singapore showing that proteobacteria were enriched in horticultural and residential samples nshimyimana et al 2017 the microbial community 0 22 μm and virsorter category 1 and 2 phage community in the seven reservoirs both showed distinctly different distributions within reservoirs tributaries and within different sites fig 3c and d different sampling points of reservoirs at sites 5 and 6 did not show any difference for sites 1 3 and 4 the microbial community shared a similar contig profile even though they did not share the same land use pattern i e sites 1 and 3 urbanized area site 4 agriculture area noticeably urbanized area site 2 showed a slightly different pattern when compared with the other three reservoirs perhaps due to potential different viral host communities site 2 is near the construction sites the microbial community in the tributaries for sites 1 2 and 4 were much more variable spatially and temporally compared to the reservoir microbial community 3 6 human and plant related viruses in our study 7 contigs were affiliated to human picobirnaviruses and 2 contigs were affiliated to cycloviruses they had a higher relative abundance in the urbanized and agricultural reservoirs and all the tributaries fig 4 possible viral contamination could be from urban drains including those from housing estates sewer leakage and construction sites although previous studies have detected enteric viruses in urban catchments in singapore aw and gin 2011 aw et al 2009 liang et al 2015 rezaeinejad et al 2014 our metagenomics sequencing was unable to find contigs assigned to the enteric viruses commonly detected in singapore surface waters e g norovirus gi norovirus gii adenovirus rotavirus however several fecal indicators including pmmov frnagi ms2 and frnagiii qbeta were detected in our samples interestingly in our study the 6 pmmov affiliated contigs had a higher nucleotide similarity 97 25 99 82 with the average query coverage of 98 5 table 3 suggesting that pmmov is a highly conserved virus with a lower evolution rate in the surface water environment this result is similar with a recent study where pmmov detected in 85 of surface water samples shared 99 100 nucleotide identity with pmmov reference genome rosiles gonzález et al 2017 3 7 correlation of metagenomics data with molecular assays for selected viral targets qpcr rt qpcr was conducted to detect and quantify the concentration of the common enteric and zoonotic viruses in the surveyed communities 14 viral targets 9 viral pathogens 4 f male specific coliphages and 1 plant virus were measured and the detection frequency was between 0 and 65 79 across all the samples table s5 the 9 viral pathogens detected in this study using qpcr rt qpcr included enteric viruses adenovirus astrovirus rotavirus norovirus gi norovirus gii enterovirus and aichi virus and other zoonotic viruses e g hepatitis e virus saporo virus reads mapping to human infective viruses were rare and were not observed to assemble into contigs high quality reads from different libraries were aligned to the viral pathogen database vipr ird and mapped to viral reference genomes in ncbi table s5 few reads 1 9 reads per library were assigned to the human infective viruses norovirus and saporo virus using both vip pipeline and standalone pipeline results not shown li et al 2016 and 0 23 reads per library were mapped to human viral pathogens reference genome at the 90 99 nucleotide similarity level no significant correlations were observed between qpcr measurements and read mapping for these viruses these results suggest that metagenomics is less sensitive at detecting low abundance viral pathogens against a background of a large proportion of bacteriophages a total of 3 targets were found in both the metagenomics contigs and qpcr data of these pmmov showed a good spearman rank correlation p 0 05 table 4 spearman rank correlation was carried out between the pmmov molecular results and the corresponding metagenomics data in terms of contigs level and reads level table 5 in terms of contigs level all 6 pmmov affiliated contigs showed a significant good correlation between molecular results and metagenomics data 0 588 r 0 795 p 0 05 in terms of reads level out of the 38 libraries 23 libraries 60 5 had reads mapping to the pmmov reference genome nc 003630 1 with 99 identity to the reference genome based on all the 38 samples the spearman rank correlation coefficient was 0 879 p 0 05 table 5 4 discussion this study is the first to correlate land use impact with freshwater water viromes in an urban tropical environment using illumina hiseq sequencing it is noteworthy that metagenomics of dna viruses and rna viruses have been often considered separately and that studies of dna viruses are far more than rna virome analysis this disparity is largely a result of technical challenges presented by rna metagenomics as rna is fragile and needs to be reverse transcribed into dna thus up till now the majority of the virome metagenomics papers studied either dna or rna but not both moreover the amplification protocol reported in these earlier studies may have influenced the final outcome lópez bueno et al 2009 rodriguez brito et al 2010 for dna viruses the genomiphi kit ge healthcare has been used for amplification through dna polymerase phi29 but it was discovered that it has a bias towards single stranded circular dna viruses for rna virome analysis random priming mediated sequence independent single primer amplification rp sispa was used in lake needwood maryland djikeng et al 2009 wang et al 2002 developed a protocol capable of amplifying dna and rna viruses simultaneously this was subsequently tested in reclaimed water plasma samples wastewater and ballast water bibby and peccia 2013 kim et al 2015 rosario et al 2009 wylie et al 2012 rna viruses account for more than 70 of the viral pathogens due to their adaptive abilities mutations recombinations or reassortments to infect novel hosts easily temmam et al 2014 in our study 92 3 of viruses are dna viruses whereas 7 6 are rna viruses among annotated viral families among all the viral pathogens detected by metagenomics 10 contigs affiliated to human picobirnaviruses are dna viruses whereas 2 contigs affiliated to cyclovirus are rna viruses the simultaneous application of combining both dna and rna metagenomics enabled the identification of a much larger numbers of viral sequences especially for human related viruses this was the approach taken in our study here 4 1 geospatial distribution of virome in this geospatial metagenomics study we identified virome abundance and diversity in different reservoirs and tributaries due to insufficient viral genome sequencing information in the ncbi 41 4 of the virome genome had no significant hits and bacteriophages were the most abundant organisms in the matrix which is in agreement with previous studies of surface water viromes mohiuddin and schellhorn 2015 skvortsov et al 2016 tseng et al 2013 phages considered to be the most abundant and diverse biological entities on earth play an important role in shaping biological and geochemical processes at the global scale díaz muñoz and koskella 2014 they may also be responsible for human health in spite of the fact that they do not infect humans this is because some phages can convey new properties of coding for toxin production to the host bacteria thus converting harmless bacteria into pathogens grabow 2001 for example the shiga toxin converting phages have been known to change the pathogenicity of e coli o157 h7 muniesa and jofre 2000 tributaries were found to have a higher proportion of microviridae and dicistroviridae the hosts of microviridae belonged to enterobacteriaceae and obligate parasitic bacteria roux et al 2012 most of the enterobacteriaceae taxa strains are pathogenic for example virulent strains of e coli and klebsiella pneumonia enterobacteriaceae occurred more in tributaries which may contribute to the distribution and abundance of microviridae in tributaries the hosts of dicistroviridae are soil inhabiting invertebrates e g aphids and ants which are common in tropical singapore thus the fact that tributaries harbor the viral hosts indicate that the viruses may be released from catchments and be washed into the tributary periodically the smaller spatial variation pattern of larger reservoirs compared with tributaries was not surprising as reservoirs tend to be more resilient to urban and storm water runoff than their tributaries in previous studies freshwater microbial communities have been found to be resilient to natural disturbances tseng et al 2013 4 2 influence of environmental parameters land use and human activities on α diversity and community structure when correlating α diversity with environmental parameters and land use factors it was found that ph had a significant correlation among all the environmental parameters r 0 399 p 0 05 ph is a key factor in determining virus infectivity where low ph ph 4 has been found to significantly reduce phage survivability 70 100 jurczak kurek et al 2016 even though the ph range in this study is relatively small 6 185 8 78 it is likely that these differences could make a difference in viral α diversity in our study a moderate correlation with rainfall r 0 329 p 0 05 was observed which could be due to heavy rainfall flushing terrestrial bacteria viruses and nutrients to the reservoir tseng et al 2013 precipitation was found to be the major factor affecting the microbial community in a subtropical reservoir in taiwan tseng et al 2013 singapore is characterized by two main monsoon seasons the northeast monsoon december march and southwest monsoon season june september 24 hour rainfall during the sampling times during the monsoon and inter monsoon season showed a significant difference between january 2015 9 69 mm and april 2015 1 42 mm one way anova f 3 018 p value 0 091 which could have contributed to the characterization of the virome composition based on land use category observed species were also found to be significantly correlated with agriculture land use r 0 342 p 0 05 this could be expected as intensive agriculture has been reported to bring nutrients and agricultural chemicals to the water cycle foley et al 2005 which in turn disturbs the microbial community indirectly tseng et al 2013 agricultural intensification has been associated with pathogen emergence transmission between wildlife and domestic animal populations and human populations which in turn could increase the species of zoonotic viruses pulliam et al 2012 jones et al 2008 concluded that agricultural practices are one of the socioeconomic drivers in the spatial distribution of emerging infectious diseases however the non significant correlation between diversity and other land use types does not necessarily suggest weak connections between the viral community and land use factor since α diversity indices shannon diversity and observed species are just one aspect of characterizing the viral community and does not necessarily represent a complete view β diversity analysis indicated that mimiviridae phycodnaviridae siphoviridae and podoviridae were enriched in reservoirs of parkland areas while dicistroviridae and microviridae were enriched in tributaries of urban areas fig 3a siphoviridae podoviridae and microviridae belong to bacteriophage which may be associated with parkland and urban enriched bacteria i e actinobacteria verrucomicrobia chloroflexi acidobacteria and proteobacteria in our study fig 3e overall viral diversity in the surveyed reservoirs 8 h 12 was higher than that reported in a subtropical reservoir in taiwan 5 1 h 7 0 tseng et al 2013 these differences could be due to the geographical latitudinal gradient differences in microbial diversity as low latitude tropical ecosystems tend to lead to higher biological diversity chown and convey 2007 fuhrman et al 2008 kim et al 2016 reported that viruses had higher richness near the equator and lower richness at higher latitude similar to human pathogen species guernier et al 2004 however these comparisons between the diversity in freshwater virome studies need further confirmation due to different indices used chao1 simpson index shannon index and observed species and diverse calculation methods applied e g phaccs qiime catchall by using phaccs based on the contig spectra generated by circonspect tseng et al 2013 derived a shannon diversity h range from 5 1 to 7 and from 7 8k to 21 8k viral genotypes in one subtropical freshwater reservoir which was lower than the ocean s virome shannon diversity in british columbia the gulf of mexico and the sargasso sea h of 10 8 8 21 and 7 74 respectively angly et al 2009 the difference in methods used in published papers makes it difficult to draw comparable conclusions a standard pipeline in deriving the viral diversity in ecology is required in order to make comparisons of viral diversity across diverse aquatic ecosystems from different studies the graphs of pcoa analysis in both reservoirs and tributaries indicated that the land use pattern around the surveyed areas had an important impact on characterizing the virome community even though the viral communities at the family level were conserved across different reservoirs the pcoa plots suggested a dynamic shift in differences between contig levels of the viral community in terms of land use the geospatial distribution patterns in the surface water environment could have resulted from both direct and indirect factors on the one hand the different land use patterns could also introduce foreign viral contamination into water bodies directly through urban agriculture runoff precipitation leaking sewers etc while the viral community itself can be indirectly changed and characterized by the relationship to their hosts in specific environments the runoff from the surrounding areas can also bring specific bacteria or other vectors and nutrients into the reservoirs and the tributaries tseng et al 2013 even though previous studies have shown the correlation between land use and water borne viral pathogens corsi et al 2014 lenaker et al 2017 ours is the first study correlating land use cover with the whole viral community thus overcoming the limitations of investigating specific viruses and providing comprehensive information on the community structure with the relationship of land use cover 4 3 human plant related viruses and correlations between qpcr rt qpcr and metagenomics viral pathogens could be introduced into reservoirs and tributaries through urban and storm water runoff although enteric viruses e g adenovirus norovirus rotavirus enterovirus etc could not be detected with viral metagenomics in our study past studies have shown that they are prevalent in tributaries using qpcr and thus need to be carefully monitored for quantifying risk assessment and providing guidelines for water recreational activities aw and gin 2011 aw et al 2009 vergara et al 2016 quantified illness risks of norovirus in an urban catchment in singapore by using quantitative microbial risk assessment the finding reported mean probability of illness associated with norovirus were 0 0061 and 0 0089 in the scenario of primary contact recreation of adults and children which is below the usepa guideline value of 0 036 usepa 2012 in addition other potential emerging viral pathogens e g hepatitis e virus coronavirus cyclovirus bird flu virus which may originate from wildlife and indigenous animals in tropical forests or animal parks can also spread to neighboring tributaries potentially causing disease to humans according to jones et al 2008 the emerging infectious diseases are dominated by zoonoses 60 3 and the majority of these are from wildlife 71 8 with an increasing trend and more hotspots concentrated in lower latitude developing countries in this study we observed sequences related to the human infective virus human picobirnavirus and the emerging zoonotic virus cyclovirus human picobirnavirus a bi segmented double stranded rna virus has been detected in both healthy and unhealthy human beings it has also been found to be prevalent 100 detection frequency in raw sewage samples collected in the united states symonds et al 2009 the pathogenicity of human picobirnaviruses has not been established and it has been suggested as an opportunistic pathogen which might cause diarrhea giordano et al 1999 grohmann et al 1993 as metagenomics can only provide relative abundance further studies are needed using qpcr in order to determine absolute concentrations and to better evaluate health risks viruses belonging to the circoviridae approximately 0 6 of the virome may be involved in disease in vertebrate animals and plants a large proportion was found to belong to swan circoviruses 59 and circoviridae 2 ldmd 2013 30 two contigs found in the present study were assigned to the suggested cyclovirus vn which originated from human samples in vietnam garigliany et al 2014 indeed cyclovirus vn was initially reported to be restricted to central and southern vietnam but was subsequently detected in both farm animals and human clinical samples from africa indicating their geographic transmission capacity garigliany et al 2014 van doorn et al 2013 in singapore human cyclovirus vs5700009 cycv vs5700009 was previously found in singapore harbor water by using a metagenomics approach kim et al 2016 the contig 89154 shared a 97 79 nucleotide similarity with human cyclovirus vn kf031466 with a query coverage of 98 15 the discovery of cyclovirus vn in freshwater tributaries in the densely populated area of site 2 in our study indicates a possible transmission of the emerging human cyclovirus in the singapore urban water cycle further risk assessment of host populations should be conducted for these water environments van doorn et al 2013 samples from sites 5 6 and 7 had lower occurrence rate both rpkm and absolute reads matrix and concentration of human picobirnavirus and cyclovirus affiliated viruses consistent with lower human population density 10 people km2 except for reservoir 6 the exception of reservoir 6 explained in results 3 1 suggested that drainage points could also be significant drivers in shaping the viral communities as well as land use cover and population density higher population density could result in high occurrence of human related viruses lenaker et al 2017 here the population density to some extent could reflect the hotspots of human related viruses limitation of using population density to quantify human activities and human related viral hosts in our study exists as the population density referred to is the resident population however the mobile population such as those associated with modern transportation tourism business travel and immigration could also contribute to dissemination of these high impact pathogens arguin et al 2009 in addition public holidays could introduce variation in population numbers to commercial and recreational areas based on lifestyle choices thereafter more detailed data will be needed in order to track and investigate the human related virus transmission patterns through virus host interaction in our sequencing data the absence of the majority of enteric viruses in surface waters is reasonable a potentially relatively low abundance of human related viruses in our surface water system and insufficient sequencing coverage could have resulted in rare sequences not being assembled into contigs for further downstream analysis in contrast with our freshwater ecosystem a previous study of sewage sludge samples revealed a large number of human viral pathogens unveiling 43 types of human viruses bibby and peccia 2013 this result is expected as the sludge matrix harbors large amounts of human related viruses and the concentrations of viral pathogens are much higher in our study a good spearman rank correlation 0 588 r 0 795 p 0 05 for the indicator virus pmmov was discovered as the qpcr rt qpcr concentrations of this target are relatively higher pmmov geomean 958 45gc l this suggests that viral metagenomics to some extent is a conservative estimate of the true viral abundance based on validation of rt qpcr data with rpkm in relative abundance of contigs especially for contigs with a higher qpcr concentration similar results were also obtained in a previous study where a significant correlation p 0 0001 between qpcr and rpkm across viral taxa in clinical samples was obtained graf et al 2016 overall viral metagenomics has its advantage in the simultaneous discovery of the entire set of targets in the community in spite of the intrinsic limitation of downstream bioinformatics i e assembly efficiency and database bias it can pave the way in finding emerging zoonotic viruses and alternative plausible fecal indicators in predicting viral pathogens in the future after zooming into the specific and desired targets using high throughput sequencing gene specific pcr or qpcr e g cyclovirus vn could be further investigated to confirm the presence of these potential viral pathogens and zoonotic viruses to reveal the epidemiology or transmission patterns of these viral pathogens kim et al 2015 5 conclusion this study has shed light on the diversity of the viral communities in tropical reservoirs and their tributaries with different land use correlations between the diversity index physical chemical parameters and land use patterns showed that environmental parameters i e ph and precipitation and spatial factors e g reservoirs tributaries land use are the main drivers of the viral community structure although enteric viruses were not detected by viral metagenomics human related viruses including emerging zoonotic viruses were detected in our samples indicating the importance of continued monitoring of these environments where specific hosts could be harbored in addition the links between qpcr rt qpcr and metagenomics were shown using both contigs and reads confirming that our metagenomics quantification path is reliable and scientific even though metagenomics sequencing technology cannot replace qpcr rt qpcr due to its relatively low sensitivity in detecting gene specific viral pathogens its wide coverage of viral targets could add valuable information such as detecting new emerging zoonotic viruses and finding alternative fecal indicators or markers of contamination acknowledgements this research grant is supported by the

19632,hydroxyl radical oh based advanced oxidation technologies aots are effective for removing non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids during water treatment in this study we systematically investigated the degradation kinetics of naproxen nap a representative nsaid with a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches the second order rate constant k of oh oxidation of nap was measured to be 4 32 0 04 109 m 1 s 1 which was in a reasonable agreement with transition state theory calculated k value 1 08 109 m 1 s 1 at smd m05 2x 6 311 g m05 2x 6 31 g level of theory the calculated result revealed that the dominant reaction intermediate is 2 5 hydroxy 6 methoxynaphthalen 2 yl propanoic acid hmnpa formed via radical adduct formation pathway in which oh addition onto the ortho site of the methoxy substituted benzene ring is the most favorable pathway for the nap oxidation we further investigated the subsequent oh oxidation of hmnpa via a kinetic modelling technique the k value of the reaction of hmnpa and oh was determined to be 2 22 109 m 1 s 1 exhibiting a similar reactivity to the parent nap this is the first study on the kinetic and mechanistic aspects of nap and its reaction intermediates the current results are valuable in future study evaluating and extending the application of oh based aots to degrade nap and other nsaids of concern in water treatment plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydroxyl radical naproxen reaction intermediate dft kinetic modelling 1 introduction non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are widely used in relieving pain reducing fever and inhibiting inflammation kosjek et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 they have been frequently detected in influent of municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp benitez et al 2011 naproxen nap one of the best selling nsaids is a propionic acid derivative with a naphthalene ring and methoxy group it was found with concentrations ranging from 0 1 ng l 1 to 7 69 μg l 1 in the wwtp effluents and 0 1 0 25 μg l 1 in surface water benotti et al 2008 boyd et al 2005 despite such low measured concentrations from ng l 1 to μg l 1 in water environment their potential threat to aquatic organisms cannot be ignored luo et al 2017a zhou et al 2017 the toxicological studies demonstrate that nap exhibits adverse effects on aquatic organisms with an ec50 of 21 2 μg l 1 on vibrio fischeri balakrishna et al 2017 in addition ingestion of trace amounts of nap for long periods of time can cause humans to suffer a higher risk of heart attack manrique moreno et al 2010 however these compounds cannot be completely removed by activated sludge based wastewater treatment technology due to their low bioavailability and biodegradability they reach surface and ground waters though wastewater effluent discharge lapworth et al 2012 therefore it is urgent to develop an effective removal technology for these contaminants in wastewater treatment processes the removal of nap ranging from 1 4 to 4 8 μg l 1 was not effective by the means of traditional sedimentation and adsorption as it was shown no significant reduction in nap concentrations in a municipal wastewater treatment plant carballa et al 2004 tang et al 2014 investigated the removal efficiency of nap in the presence of activated sludge under aerobic conditions the removal efficiency was only 14 8 26 0 for the initial concentrations of 10 200 μg l 1 with 1 h of contact time by comparison advanced oxidation technologies aots that form free radicals e g hydroxyl radical oh or sulfate radical so 4 at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure were demonstrated to be effective for removal of those organic contaminants in waters ghernaout 2013 xiao et al 2017 hydroxyl radical attacks most of the organic compounds with high second order rate constants k a key factor to estimate degradation kinetics and removal efficiency buxton et al 1988 although aots for removal of nap have been reported feng et al 2013 huber et al 2005 little is known about mechanistic aspects of nap degradation particularly the contribution of each reaction pathway i e radical adduct formation raf hydrogen atom transfer hat and single electron transfer set to the overall degradation further it remains challenging to obtain this kind of mechanistic evidence from experiments due to the lack of analytical methods that enable comprehensive characterization of the reaction intermediates the density functional theory dft approach features many advantages in calculating thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors in biomolecular reactions between radical and non radical species luo et al 2017b yang et al 2016 ye et al 2017 mounting evidences show that dft designed for thermochemical kinetics represents a good balance between computational cost and performance galano and alvarez idaboy 2013 xiao et al 2014 2015a for example xiao et al 2017 investigated the k value between oh and bisphenol a bpa based on a combination of experimental and computational methods at m05 2x level of theory the hat pathway accounted for 85 7 of the overall k value in oh oxidation reaction of bpa they concluded that the quinone of monohydroxylated bpa was the dominant reaction intermediate which has been verified by many studies dai et al 2016 sharma et al 2016 it should be noted that more and more studies indicate that reaction intermediates play an important role during the aot process an et al 2013 du et al 2006 for example du et al 2006 investigated the reaction intermediates in the degradation of 4 chlorophenol 4 nitrophenol and phenol by fenton reaction the hydroquinone like reaction intermediates quenched competed for oh and thus were considered to be an important process in controlling the overall removal rate of target contaminants therefore understanding formation kinetics of reaction intermediates will enhance our knowledge of mechanisms on oh oxidation of organic contaminants and practically guide the application of aots in this study experimental theoretical and kinetic modelling approaches were combined to investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics of oh oxidation of nap and its dominant intermediate first the relative rate method was used to experimentally determine the k value for the reaction of oh and nap in the following theoretical calculation the energy profiles of raf hat and set reaction pathways between nap and oh were investigated by the dft approach further a kinetic modelling technique was used to simulate concentration evolution of nap and its dominant intermediate through the course of reaction the k value between the reaction intermediate and oh was reported and compared with the experimental measurement this study shed light on the mechanisms of oh oxidation of nap and the role of degradation intermediates in the oh based aots in advanced water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials naproxen nap 99 h3po4 85 90 na2hpo4

grade were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent china h3po4 na2hpo4 and nah2po4 were used as buffer system h2o2 was used as precursor to generate oh under uv irradiation h2so4 kmno4 and na2c2o4 were used for average light intensity per volume i 0 and optical path l measurements acp was chosen as a reference compound to determine the k value of oh oxidation of nap based on our previous studies xiao et al 2017 yang et al 2017 the physicochemical properties of nap are listed in table a1 see supplemental information all solutions were prepared using deionized di water from a molecular water system molresearc 1010a the s220 ph meter mettler toledo was used to measure solution ph 2 2 photochemical experiments the degradation kinetic experiments were performed in a merry go round photochemical reactor which was greatly modified from a commercial reactor xpa 7 xujiang technology co ltd nanjing china fig a1 a 10 w low pressure uv lamp gph212t5l 4 heraeus in a quartz trap was centered in 50 ml quartz reaction tubes these reaction tubes were immersed in constant temperature tank at 20 1 c maintained by a water cooling system sc150 a25b thermo fisher scientific the solutions in reaction tubes were continuously stirred by a teflon magnetic bar the initial concentrations of nap acp and h2o2 in the uv h2o2 system were prepared at 10 μm 10 μm and 100 μm respectively solution ph was buffered at ph 3 0 in a 10 mm phosphate buffer system the majority i e 93 5 of nap species is in its neutral form at ph 3 based on its acid dissociation constant pk a 4 15 broséus et al 2009 the sample of 0 6 ml was taken from the reactors using a 2 5 ml glass syringe gastight 1001 hamilton the i 0 and l were determined using potassium permanganate titration and uv spectrophotometry respectively xiao et al 2017 the molar absorption coefficients ε m 1 cm 1 and quantum yield φ mol einstein 1 are the key factors to determine direct photolysis at a given wavelength chuang et al 2016 zepp 1978 the ε and φ values reflect the capability of a compound to utilize photon based on the beer lambert law the initial rate of direct photolysis of nap r uv m min 1 can be determined as 1 r uv d c dt φ i 0 1 10 ε l c where i 0 is the lamp irradiance which was measured to be 1 89 10 6 einstein l 1 s 1 in this study l is the effective optical path length 1 04 cm c is concentration of nap m and ε is the molar absorption coefficient m 1 cm 1 which can be calculated from the total absorbance a cm 1 measured by spectrophotometer at 254 nm 2 ε a b c where b is the path length of quartz cuvette 1 cm the ε value in our system was determined to be 4500 m 1 cm 1 at 254 nm fig a2 the value was similar to the reported values by pereira et al 2007 4900 m 1 cm 1 and marotta et al 2013 4180 m 1 cm 1 the φ value of nap was calculated according to eqn 3 3 φ r uv i 0 1 10 ε l c the relative rate technique was used to determine the second order rate constant k value of the reaction between nap and oh the acp has been successfully used as a reference compound in a uv h2o2 system to determine the k values for various organic pollutants packer et al 2003 the k acp value of nap reacting with oh was reported to be 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 at ph 3 buxton et al 1988 but its degradation kinetics of uv direct photolysis was slow the acp is neither acidic nor basic and does not protonate deprotonate with ph thus it is applicable in a wide ph range further the k value 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 is at the level of the same order of magnitude with the k values of some drugs reacting with oh yang et al 2017 k nap value was calculated according to eqn 4 4 k nap k acp ln nap t nap 0 ln nap t nap 0 uv ln acp t acp 0 ln acp t acp 0 uv ln nap t nap 0 k nap uv ln acp t acp 0 k acp uv where k nap uv and k acp uv are the first order rate constants min 1 of uv direct photolysis of nap and acp respectively all photolysis experiments were carried out in duplicate 2 3 analytical methods quantitative analysis of nap and acp was performed using an ultra performance liquid chromatography waters acquity h class with beh c18 column 1 7 μm 50 2 1 mm waters the column temperature was set at 35 c and sample injection volume was 5 μl the mobile phase with a flow rate of 0 3 ml min 1 consisted of 35 acetonitrile and 65 phosphoric buffer 20 mm at ph 3 the absorption wavelengths of nap and acp were set at 229 nm and 255 nm respectively the absorption spectrum of nap was measured by a uv 1800 spectrometer shimadzu japan from 200 to 400 nm to determine the maximum absorption 2 4 theoretical computational methods the dft approach was used to calculate the energetics of different reaction pathways between oh and nap first the global minimum energy geometry of nap was located by a

frequency see table a2 a15 for coordinates dreuw 2005 the energies of all the species were calculated at the m05 2x 6 311 g level of theory with the solvation model of density smd continuum solvation model zhao et al 2006 the smd model is considered to be a reliable solvation model due to its applicability to both charged and uncharged solutes in water marenich et al 2009 the distribution of highest occupied molecular orbital homo and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo characterizes the chemical reactivity and charge transfer interaction in the molecule sethi et al 2017 the

modelling kinetic modelling has been successfully used to model kinetics of oh oxidation of organic contaminants and were elaborated in previous studies in detail chuang et al 2016 lian et al 2017 the relevant reactions occurred in the uv h2o2 system are listed in table 1 among the 26 reactions 23 k values were obtained from literature the formation rate s 1 of oh in our system was measured the k values for rxn abbreviation for reaction 25 i e oh oxidation of nap and 26 i e oh oxidation of the dominant intermediate and their concentration evolution were fit by the kinetic model the k value fitting was derived from the mass balance of the target species chuang et al 2016 tonelli 2014 the kinetic model was built with matlab version 8 0 and kintecus version 6 0 ianni 2017 briefly in order to roughly estimate the range of k values of rxn 25 and 26 the matlab program was first used to solve the system of differential equations to simulate nap concentration evolution based on the experimental observation the range of k values of rxn 25 and 26 were determined to be approximately 5 109 1010 m 1 s 1 in addition to the input information of reactions such as interval time h2o2 concentration etc the estimated k values were fed to kintecus to simultaneously optimize k values and nap concentration evolution the kintecus program offers a combination of five types of optimization algorithms mead nelder powerll levenberg marquardt simulated annealing and complex method and three comparison operators relative least squares standard least squares and ianni function to fit the kinetic data ianni 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 uv direct photolysis of nap uv direct photolysis was first monitored to evaluate its influence on total degradation of nap the r uv of nap was measured to be 2 32 0 12 10 7 m min 1 at the initial concentration of 10 μm the φ was measured to be 1 13 0 12 10 2 mol einstein 1 at 254 nm which was consistent with the study by marotta et al 2013 1 3 0 12 10 2 mol einstein 1 it should be noted that the direct photolysis of nap is limited due to the very high energy requirements for the π π and σ σ or σ π transitions this is due to two factors first that the aromatic ring requires a high energy to produce π π transition and second the saturated alkane chain ch ch3 requires a high energy to produce σ σ or σ π transition only minor dissociation of c cooh bond occurs readily under the current uv irradiation marotta et al 2013 which likely leads to a decarboxylation reaction 3 2 oh mediated degradation of nap the r uv of nap was measured to be 2 32 0 12 10 7 m min 1 and only 43 6 of nap was removed after 25 min irradiation the dark control result showed that nap does not exhibit degradation in the presence of h2o2 within 24 h fig 1 upon uv irradiation h2o2 is decomposed into oh with the quantum yield of 1 0 mol einstein 1 in ph 3 condition table 1 legrini et al 1993 thus the apparent degradation rate k s 1 of nap in the uv h2o2 system includes the direct photolysis and oh oxidation eqn 8 8 d c dt k c k uv k oh c 9 k uv r uv c where k oh is the rate constant of oh oxidation of nap the k uv and k oh were fit to a pseudo first order kinetic model r 2 0 95 fig 1 demonstrated the degradation rate was significantly enhanced in the presence of 100 μm h2o2 the k value was determined to be 0 112 min 1 and oh mediated oxidation accounted for 83 of the nap degradation kinetics in our uv h2o2 system the second order rate constant k value of oh oxidation of nap was determined to be 4 32 0 04 109 m 1 s 1 at 298 k using relative rate method the experimental k value was in a good agreement with the reported value by feng et al 2013 however our measured value is lower than that reported by huber et al 2005 which is due to the fact that the dominant species was neutral in our system ph 3 and deprotonated nap in their system ph 7 many studies reported that neutral ionized species exhibited different reactivity with oh adak et al 2015 the deprotonated species can form hydrogen bonding with h2o thus significantly lowering the activation energy of the reactions and ultimately higher k values canonica et al 2008 luo et al 2018a 3 3 theoretical thermodynamics and kinetics three reaction pathways namely set hat and raf were shown in fig 2 all possible reactions of oh oxidation of nap are tabulated in table a16 with calculated enthalpy change δ h r kcal mol 1 gibbs free energy change δ g r kcal mol 1 activation energy δ g kcal mol 1 imaginary frequencies cm 1 second order rate constants k m 1 s 1 and contribution ratio of each pathway in overall k value θ for the oh oxidation of nap calculated at smd m05 2x 6 311 g m05 2x 6 31 g level of theory the free energy profile for the reactions is depicted in fig 3 as shown in table a16 the set pathway is thermodynamically unfavorable with positive δ g r 41 1 kcal mol 1 for the hat pathways δ h r ranges from 35 1 to 17 9 kcal mol 1 and δ g r ranges from 36 1 to 19 9 kcal mol 1 fig 3a indicating that the h atoms on ch h7 ch3 h11 o ch3 h12 and cooh h14 sites can be abstracted by oh the δ g values of hat pathways range from 9 84 to 33 5 kcal mol 1 for raf pathways δ h r values range from 28 0 to 0 54 kcal mol 1 and δ g r values range from 18 5 to 5 07 kcal mol 1 fig 3b all the reactions are thermodynamically favorable processes δ g r 0 except for the addition processes on c13 δ g r 8 85 kcal mol 1 and c14 δ g r 5 07 kcal mol 1 this is within expectation since addition at these sites would lead to the loss of aromaticity in nap the δ g values range from 1 76 to 15 1 kcal mol 1 since the electron donating ability of o ch3 is higher than that of ch ch3 cooh the δ g values of oh addition onto the benzene ring with o ch3 substitution i e c5 c6 c7 c8 are lower than the corresponding sites of benzene ring with ch ch3 cooh substitution i e c1 c2 c3 c4 it should be noted that the δ g values of hat pathways are significantly higher than those of raf pathways by an average of 17 5 kcal mol 1 the δ g of raf reaction of c5 site ortho to the electron donating methoxy group is significantly lower than other reaction pathways indicating a primary reaction channel the k values of the hat pathways are from 3 33 10 11 to 2 08 106 m 1 s 1 calculated with the eckart s method for raf pathways their k values are from 9 68 106 to 8 69 109 m 1 s 1 these results indicated that the hat pathways were almost negligible as compared to the raf pathways where c5 site was the dominate reaction in oh oxidation of nap the overall k value 1 08 1010 m 1 s 1 determined by the model is slightly higher than the k value 4 32 0 04 109 m 1 s 1 measured experimentally it should be noted that the eckart s potential in general provides an accurate representation of the barrier miller 1979 the γ values of raf pathway range from 1 01 to 1 49 which is not large due to the low barriers however for hat pathway with activation energy barriers ranging from 9 84 to 33 5 kcal mol 1 the γ values were from 2 76 to 9 80 3 4 mechanistic interpretation for nap degradation the unfavorability of the set reaction is expected to some extent because the methoxy o ch3 and ethidene ch ch3 groups on nap molecule are moderate and weak in electron donating abilities respectively luo et al 2017b 2018b systematically investigated the set reactions between oh and 76 aromatic compounds the set reaction is thermodynamically favorable for aromatic compounds with strong electron donating moieties such as oxide secondary tertiary amine and hydroxyl functional groups the oh can abstract a h atom from o ch3 ch ch3 cooh and ch3 groups forming h2o and nap radical nap the hat on o ch3 or ch3 site forms an unstable methyl radical ch 2 an unfavorable high energy process which results in the lower reactivity xiao et al 2017 the reaction with the acidic hydrogen on cooh group is more complex the acid group can be involved in hydrogen bonding which can stabilize the ts complex however loss of the hydrogen atom generates a carboxylate radical which is susceptible to a rapid decarboxylation reaction generating a stable benzylic type carbon radical this reaction pathway has been seen in the observed reaction producing p3 p4 p5 and p6 table 2 loss of h7 the benzylic hydrogen atom leads to a stable benzylic carbon radical which can then react with an additional oh in a radical coupling reaction to form the hydroxyl compound seen in reaction product p2 table 2 decarboxylation and dehydration of p2 leads to p3 while decarboxylation and oxidation of p2 leads to p4 the homo and lumo provide insight into the mechanism of the raf pathway the homo and lumo reflect the π bonding orbital and anti bonding π orbital respectively minakata et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 minakata et al 2015 indicated that the lumo represents the favorability of oh addition pathway fig a3 a and b show that the homo and lumo are localized on the naphthalene ring the similarity between homo and lumo indicates that these electron rich regions naphthalene ring are more likely attacked by an electrophilic radical oh dematteo et al 2005 thus the c4 c5 and c8 sites are more reactive to oh with δ g values of 5 07 1 76 and 5 22 kcal mol 1 respectively the preferred reaction at c5 is due to the electron donating ability of the methoxy group which increases the electron density on the ring carbons ortho and para to it i e c5 and c7 the para position at c14 has very low reactivity since addition here will result in the loss of aromaticity in the compound the c5 addition is favored over c7 because the other benzene ring can also act as an electron donating group to c5 these effects result in the very low δ g seen for c5 and the major reaction pathway was raf pathway in formation of 2 5 hydroxy 6 methoxynaphthalen 2 yl propanoic acid hmnpa 3 5 kinetics modelling and degradation intermediates although several reaction intermediates have been identified by high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrum hplc ms technique from previous studies table 2 dulova et al 2017 gao et al 2017 the ms information cannot explicitly determine which intermediate is favorable to form and its influence on subsequent oh oxidation steps an et al 2013 du et al 2006 this study builds upon the previous work aiming to answer this fundamental question based on the theoretical study the major dominant reaction intermediate was the hmnpa p1 see table 2 therefore we used this dominant reaction intermediate as an example to elucidate the interplay between parent nap and formed intermediate during oh oxidation process we speculated that hmnpa exhibits a similar reactivity with oh as compared to parent nap this was based on the extended homo and lumo distribution of hmnpa see fig a3 c d especially for lumo distributions in carboxylic acid group since experimentally measuring the k value for the reaction of oh and hmnpa provided some challenges due to the high cost of synthesis and the extreme complexity of the reaction system a kinetics modelling technique was used in this study to answer this question fig 4 demonstrated the nap and hmnpa concentration evolutions the fit nap concentration over time red line agreed with the measured ones red dots the best model fitting of the kinetics was achieved by applying mead nelder optimization algorithms and standard least squares comparison operator because this combination produced good description of evolution of nap concentration and reasonable k value the determination coefficient r 2 between observed and predicted concentrations of nap during the experimental was 0 993 and the estimated standard deviations of the modelling error was determined to be 3 12 10 7 m 6 59 the modeled concentration of hmnpa increased in the first 15 min and then decreased indicating that oh oxidized nap first followed by hmnpa that starts to compete for oh in the system with an increase of time the modeled k value for the reaction between oh and nap was 2 53 109 m 1 s 1 the k value of oh oxidation of hmnpa was modeled to be 2 22 109 m 1 s 1 the homo and lumo distributions of hmnpa fig a3 c d are different compared to those of nap the energy gap in lumo and homo of hmnpa 6 15 ev was lower than nap 6 65 ev indicating that hmnpa exhibits a higher reactivity than nap minakata et al 2015 xiao et al 2015b this is likely due to the strong electron donating properties of the hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring in addition the lumo distribution of hmnpa was extended to carboxylic acid group compared to nap suggesting that cooh group becomes more reactive and could be subject to decarboxylation it should be noted that we did not calculate the k value of oh oxidation of hmnpa with the dft method due to failure of the optimization of their tss with m05 2x functional 4 conclusion in this study we combined experimental theoretical and kinetic modelling approaches to investigate the oh oxidation of nap and reaction intermediates in aqueous solution the uv direct photolysis rate and the k value of oh oxidation of nap were measured the measured k value 4 32 0 04 109 m 1 s 1 was in good agreement with previous reports the thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors of the initial step reaction pathways were calculated at the smd m05 2x 6 311 g m05 2x 6 31 g level of theory the calculated k value 1 08 1010 m 1 s 1 was higher than the experimentally determined value in addition the calculated result shows that the activation barrier of raf is lower than hat and oh addition at c5 site dominates the reaction further we provided an insight into reaction mechanisms based on electronic properties of group activation energy and the homo lumo distribution finally a kinetics modelling technique was used to fit the k values and concentration evolution of oh oxidation of nap and dominant intermediate hmnpa the modelling result is in good agreement with experimental values and suggests that hmnpa exhibits a similar oh reactivity as compared to nap thereby affecting oh oxidation of nap these results can provide further understanding of the salient mechanisms of degradation of nap using oh based aots and provide guidance in future studies for the removal of nsaids and other contaminants of concern by aots when such technologies are considered in water and

19632,hydroxyl radical oh based advanced oxidation technologies aots are effective for removing non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids during water treatment in this study we systematically investigated the degradation kinetics of naproxen nap a representative nsaid with a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches the second order rate constant k of oh oxidation of nap was measured to be 4 32 0 04 109 m 1 s 1 which was in a reasonable agreement with transition state theory calculated k value 1 08 109 m 1 s 1 at smd m05 2x 6 311 g m05 2x 6 31 g level of theory the calculated result revealed that the dominant reaction intermediate is 2 5 hydroxy 6 methoxynaphthalen 2 yl propanoic acid hmnpa formed via radical adduct formation pathway in which oh addition onto the ortho site of the methoxy substituted benzene ring is the most favorable pathway for the nap oxidation we further investigated the subsequent oh oxidation of hmnpa via a kinetic modelling technique the k value of the reaction of hmnpa and oh was determined to be 2 22 109 m 1 s 1 exhibiting a similar reactivity to the parent nap this is the first study on the kinetic and mechanistic aspects of nap and its reaction intermediates the current results are valuable in future study evaluating and extending the application of oh based aots to degrade nap and other nsaids of concern in water treatment plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydroxyl radical naproxen reaction intermediate dft kinetic modelling 1 introduction non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are widely used in relieving pain reducing fever and inhibiting inflammation kosjek et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 they have been frequently detected in influent of municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp benitez et al 2011 naproxen nap one of the best selling nsaids is a propionic acid derivative with a naphthalene ring and methoxy group it was found with concentrations ranging from 0 1 ng l 1 to 7 69 μg l 1 in the wwtp effluents and 0 1 0 25 μg l 1 in surface water benotti et al 2008 boyd et al 2005 despite such low measured concentrations from ng l 1 to μg l 1 in water environment their potential threat to aquatic organisms cannot be ignored luo et al 2017a zhou et al 2017 the toxicological studies demonstrate that nap exhibits adverse effects on aquatic organisms with an ec50 of 21 2 μg l 1 on vibrio fischeri balakrishna et al 2017 in addition ingestion of trace amounts of nap for long periods of time can cause humans to suffer a higher risk of heart attack manrique moreno et al 2010 however these compounds cannot be completely removed by activated sludge based wastewater treatment technology due to their low bioavailability and biodegradability they reach surface and ground waters though wastewater effluent discharge lapworth et al 2012 therefore it is urgent to develop an effective removal technology for these contaminants in wastewater treatment processes the removal of nap ranging from 1 4 to 4 8 μg l 1 was not effective by the means of traditional sedimentation and adsorption as it was shown no significant reduction in nap concentrations in a municipal wastewater treatment plant carballa et al 2004 tang et al 2014 investigated the removal efficiency of nap in the presence of activated sludge under aerobic conditions the removal efficiency was only 14 8 26 0 for the initial concentrations of 10 200 μg l 1 with 1 h of contact time by comparison advanced oxidation technologies aots that form free radicals e g hydroxyl radical oh or sulfate radical so 4 at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure were demonstrated to be effective for removal of those organic contaminants in waters ghernaout 2013 xiao et al 2017 hydroxyl radical attacks most of the organic compounds with high second order rate constants k a key factor to estimate degradation kinetics and removal efficiency buxton et al 1988 although aots for removal of nap have been reported feng et al 2013 huber et al 2005 little is known about mechanistic aspects of nap degradation particularly the contribution of each reaction pathway i e radical adduct formation raf hydrogen atom transfer hat and single electron transfer set to the overall degradation further it remains challenging to obtain this kind of mechanistic evidence from experiments due to the lack of analytical methods that enable comprehensive characterization of the reaction intermediates the density functional theory dft approach features many advantages in calculating thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors in biomolecular reactions between radical and non radical species luo et al 2017b yang et al 2016 ye et al 2017 mounting evidences show that dft designed for thermochemical kinetics represents a good balance between computational cost and performance galano and alvarez idaboy 2013 xiao et al 2014 2015a for example xiao et al 2017 investigated the k value between oh and bisphenol a bpa based on a combination of experimental and computational methods at m05 2x level of theory the hat pathway accounted for 85 7 of the overall k value in oh oxidation reaction of bpa they concluded that the quinone of monohydroxylated bpa was the dominant reaction intermediate which has been verified by many studies dai et al 2016 sharma et al 2016 it should be noted that more and more studies indicate that reaction intermediates play an important role during the aot process an et al 2013 du et al 2006 for example du et al 2006 investigated the reaction intermediates in the degradation of 4 chlorophenol 4 nitrophenol and phenol by fenton reaction the hydroquinone like reaction intermediates quenched competed for oh and thus were considered to be an important process in controlling the overall removal rate of target contaminants therefore understanding formation kinetics of reaction intermediates will enhance our knowledge of mechanisms on oh oxidation of organic contaminants and practically guide the application of aots in this study experimental theoretical and kinetic modelling approaches were combined to investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics of oh oxidation of nap and its dominant intermediate first the relative rate method was used to experimentally determine the k value for the reaction of oh and nap in the following theoretical calculation the energy profiles of raf hat and set reaction pathways between nap and oh were investigated by the dft approach further a kinetic modelling technique was used to simulate concentration evolution of nap and its dominant intermediate through the course of reaction the k value between the reaction intermediate and oh was reported and compared with the experimental measurement this study shed light on the mechanisms of oh oxidation of nap and the role of degradation intermediates in the oh based aots in advanced water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials naproxen nap 99 h3po4 85 90 na2hpo4

were used for average light intensity per volume i 0 and optical path l measurements acp was chosen as a reference compound to determine the k value of oh oxidation of nap based on our previous studies xiao et al 2017 yang et al 2017 the physicochemical properties of nap are listed in table a1 see supplemental information all solutions were prepared using deionized di water from a molecular water system molresearc 1010a the s220 ph meter mettler toledo was used to measure solution ph 2 2 photochemical experiments the degradation kinetic experiments were performed in a merry go round photochemical reactor which was greatly modified from a commercial reactor xpa 7 xujiang technology co ltd nanjing china fig a1 a 10 w low pressure uv lamp gph212t5l 4 heraeus in a quartz trap was centered in 50 ml quartz reaction tubes these reaction tubes were immersed in constant temperature tank at 20 1 c maintained by a water cooling system sc150 a25b thermo fisher scientific the solutions in reaction tubes were continuously stirred by a teflon magnetic bar the initial concentrations of nap acp and h2o2 in the uv h2o2 system were prepared at 10 μm 10 μm and 100 μm respectively solution ph was buffered at ph 3 0 in a 10 mm phosphate buffer system the majority i e 93 5 of nap species is in its neutral form at ph 3 based on its acid dissociation constant pk a 4 15 broséus et al 2009 the sample of 0 6 ml was taken from the reactors using a 2 5 ml glass syringe gastight 1001 hamilton the i 0 and l were determined using potassium permanganate titration and uv spectrophotometry respectively xiao et al 2017 the molar absorption coefficients ε m 1 cm 1 and quantum yield φ mol einstein 1 are the key factors to determine direct photolysis at a given wavelength chuang et al 2016 zepp 1978 the ε and φ values reflect the capability of a compound to utilize photon based on the beer lambert law the initial rate of direct photolysis of nap r uv m min 1 can be determined as 1 r uv

cuvette 1 cm the ε value in our system was determined to be 4500 m 1 cm 1 at 254 nm fig a2 the value was similar to the reported values by pereira et al 2007 4900 m 1 cm 1 and marotta et al 2013 4180 m 1 cm 1 the φ value of nap was calculated according to eqn 3 3 φ r uv i 0 1 10 ε l c the relative rate technique was used to determine the second order rate constant k value of the reaction between nap and oh the acp has been successfully used as a reference compound in a uv h2o2 system to determine the k values for various organic pollutants packer et al 2003 the k acp value of nap reacting with oh was reported to be 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 at ph 3 buxton et al 1988 but its degradation kinetics of uv direct photolysis was slow the acp is neither acidic nor basic and does not protonate deprotonate with ph thus it is applicable in a wide ph range further the k value 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 is at the level of the same order of magnitude with the k values of some drugs reacting with oh yang et al 2017 k nap value was calculated according to eqn 4 4 k nap k acp ln nap t nap 0 ln nap t nap 0 uv ln acp t acp 0 ln acp t acp 0 uv ln nap t nap 0 k nap uv ln acp t acp 0 k acp uv where k nap uv and k acp uv are the first order rate constants min 1 of uv direct photolysis of nap and acp respectively all photolysis experiments were carried out in duplicate 2 3 analytical methods quantitative analysis of nap and acp was performed using an ultra performance liquid chromatography waters acquity h class with beh c18 column 1 7 μm 50 2 1 mm waters the column temperature was set at 35 c and sample injection volume was 5 μl the mobile phase with a flow rate of 0 3 ml min 1 consisted of 35 acetonitrile and 65 phosphoric buffer 20 mm at ph 3 the absorption wavelengths of nap and acp were set at 229 nm and 255 nm respectively the absorption spectrum of nap was measured by a uv 1800 spectrometer shimadzu japan from 200 to 400 nm to determine the maximum absorption 2 4 theoretical computational methods the dft approach was used to calculate the energetics of different reaction pathways between oh and nap first the global minimum energy geometry of nap was located by a conformation search with mmff force field using the spartan 10 program tonelli 2014 the geometries of the reactants products and transition state ts were then optimized using gaussian 09 revision a 01

modelling kinetic modelling has been successfully used to model kinetics of oh oxidation of organic contaminants and were elaborated in previous studies in detail chuang et al 2016 lian et al 2017 the relevant reactions occurred in the uv h2o2 system are listed in table 1 among the 26 reactions 23 k values were obtained from literature the formation rate s 1 of oh in our system was measured the k values for rxn abbreviation for reaction 25 i e oh oxidation of nap and 26 i e oh oxidation of the dominant intermediate and their concentration evolution were fit by the kinetic model the k value fitting was derived from the mass balance of the target species chuang et al 2016 tonelli 2014 the kinetic model was built with matlab version 8 0 and kintecus version 6 0 ianni 2017 briefly in order to roughly estimate the range of k values of rxn 25 and 26 the matlab program was first used to solve the system of differential equations to simulate nap concentration evolution based on the experimental observation the range of k values of rxn 25 and 26 were determined to be approximately 5 109 1010 m 1 s 1 in addition to the input information of reactions such as interval time h2o2 concentration etc the estimated k values were fed to kintecus to simultaneously optimize k values and nap concentration evolution the kintecus program offers a combination of five types of optimization algorithms mead nelder powerll levenberg marquardt simulated annealing and complex method and three comparison operators relative least squares standard least squares and ianni function to fit the kinetic data ianni 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 uv direct photolysis of nap uv direct photolysis was first monitored to evaluate its influence on total degradation of nap the r uv of nap was measured to be 2 32 0 12 10 7 m min 1 at the initial concentration of 10 μm the φ was measured to be 1 13 0 12 10 2 mol einstein 1 at 254 nm which was consistent with the study by marotta et al 2013 1 3 0 12 10 2 mol einstein 1 it should be noted that the direct photolysis of nap is limited due to the very high energy requirements for the π π and σ σ or σ π transitions this is due to two factors first that the aromatic ring requires a high energy to produce π π transition and second the saturated alkane chain ch ch3 requires a high energy to produce σ σ or σ π transition only minor dissociation of c cooh bond occurs readily under the current uv irradiation marotta et al 2013 which likely leads to a decarboxylation reaction 3 2 oh mediated degradation of nap the r uv of nap was measured to be 2 32 0 12 10 7 m min 1 and only 43 6 of nap was removed after 25 min irradiation the dark control result showed that nap does not exhibit degradation in the presence of h2o2 within 24 h fig 1 upon uv irradiation h2o2 is decomposed into oh with the quantum yield of 1 0 mol einstein 1 in ph 3 condition table 1 legrini et al 1993 thus the apparent degradation rate k s 1 of nap in the uv h2o2 system includes the direct photolysis and oh oxidation eqn 8 8 d c dt k c k uv k oh c 9 k uv r uv c where k oh is the rate constant of oh oxidation of nap the k uv and k oh were fit to a pseudo first order kinetic model r 2 0 95 fig 1 demonstrated the degradation rate was significantly enhanced in the presence of 100 μm h2o2 the k value was determined to be 0 112 min 1 and oh mediated oxidation accounted for 83 of the nap degradation kinetics in our uv h2o2 system the second order rate constant k value of oh oxidation of nap was determined to be 4 32 0 04 109 m 1 s 1 at 298 k using relative rate method the experimental k value was in a good agreement with the reported value by feng et al 2013 however our measured value is lower than that reported by huber et al 2005 which is due to the fact that the dominant species was neutral in our system ph 3 and deprotonated nap in their system ph 7 many studies reported that neutral ionized species exhibited different reactivity with oh adak et al 2015 the deprotonated species can form hydrogen bonding with h2o thus significantly lowering the activation energy of the reactions and ultimately higher k values canonica et al 2008 luo et al 2018a 3 3 theoretical thermodynamics and kinetics three reaction pathways namely set hat and raf were shown in fig 2 all possible reactions of oh oxidation of nap are tabulated in table a16 with calculated enthalpy change δ h r kcal mol 1 gibbs free energy change δ g r kcal mol 1 activation energy δ g kcal mol 1 imaginary frequencies cm 1 second order rate constants k m 1 s 1 and contribution ratio of each pathway in overall k value θ for the oh oxidation of nap calculated at smd m05 2x 6 311 g m05 2x 6 31 g level of theory the free energy profile for the reactions is depicted in fig 3 as shown in table a16 the set pathway is thermodynamically unfavorable with positive δ g r 41 1 kcal mol 1 for the hat pathways δ h r ranges from 35 1 to 17 9 kcal mol 1 and δ g r ranges from 36 1 to 19 9 kcal mol 1 fig 3a indicating that the h atoms on ch h7 ch3 h11 o ch3 h12 and cooh h14 sites can be abstracted by oh the δ g values of hat pathways range from 9 84 to 33 5 kcal mol 1 for raf pathways δ h r values range from 28 0 to 0 54 kcal mol 1 and δ g r values range from 18 5 to 5 07 kcal mol 1 fig 3b all the reactions are thermodynamically favorable processes δ g r 0 except for the addition processes on c13 δ g r 8 85 kcal mol 1 and c14 δ g r 5 07 kcal mol 1 this is within expectation since addition at these sites would lead to the loss of aromaticity in nap the δ g values range from 1 76 to 15 1 kcal mol 1 since the electron donating ability of o ch3 is higher than that of ch ch3 cooh the δ g values of oh addition onto the benzene ring with o ch3 substitution i e c5 c6 c7 c8 are lower than the corresponding sites of benzene ring with ch ch3 cooh substitution i e c1 c2 c3 c4 it should be noted that the δ g values of hat pathways are significantly higher than those of raf pathways by an average of 17 5 kcal mol 1 the δ g of raf reaction of c5 site ortho to the electron donating methoxy group is significantly lower than other reaction pathways indicating a primary reaction channel the k values of the hat pathways are from 3 33 10 11 to 2 08 106 m 1 s 1 calculated with the eckart s method for raf pathways their k values are from 9 68 106 to 8 69 109 m 1 s 1 these results indicated that the hat pathways were almost negligible as compared to the raf pathways where c5 site was the dominate reaction in oh oxidation of nap the overall k value 1 08 1010 m 1 s 1 determined by the model is slightly higher than the k value 4 32 0 04 109 m 1 s 1 measured experimentally it should be noted that the eckart s potential in general provides an accurate representation of the barrier miller 1979 the γ values of raf pathway range from 1 01 to 1 49 which is not large due to the low barriers however for hat pathway with activation energy barriers ranging from 9 84 to 33 5 kcal mol 1 the γ values were from 2 76 to 9 80 3 4 mechanistic interpretation for nap degradation the unfavorability of the set reaction is expected to some extent because the methoxy o ch3 and ethidene ch ch3 groups on nap molecule are moderate and weak in electron donating abilities respectively luo et al 2017b 2018b systematically investigated the set reactions between oh and 76 aromatic compounds the set reaction is thermodynamically favorable for aromatic compounds with strong electron donating moieties such as oxide secondary tertiary amine and hydroxyl functional groups the oh can abstract a h atom from o ch3 ch ch3 cooh and ch3 groups forming h2o and nap radical nap the hat on o ch3 or ch3 site forms an unstable methyl radical ch 2 an unfavorable high energy process which results in the lower reactivity xiao et al 2017 the reaction with the acidic hydrogen on cooh group is more complex the acid group can be involved in hydrogen bonding which can stabilize the ts complex however loss of the hydrogen atom generates a carboxylate radical which is susceptible to a rapid decarboxylation reaction generating a stable benzylic type carbon radical this reaction pathway has been seen in the observed reaction producing p3 p4 p5 and p6 table 2 loss of h7 the benzylic hydrogen atom leads to a stable benzylic carbon radical which can then react with an additional oh in a radical coupling reaction to form the hydroxyl compound seen in reaction product p2 table 2 decarboxylation and dehydration of p2 leads to p3 while decarboxylation and oxidation of p2 leads to p4 the homo and lumo provide insight into the mechanism of the raf pathway the homo and lumo reflect the π bonding orbital and anti bonding π orbital respectively minakata et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 minakata et al 2015 indicated that the lumo represents the favorability of oh addition pathway fig a3 a and b show that the homo and lumo are localized on the naphthalene ring the similarity between homo and lumo indicates that these electron rich regions naphthalene ring are more likely attacked by an electrophilic radical oh dematteo et al 2005 thus the c4 c5 and c8 sites are more reactive to oh with δ g values of 5 07 1 76 and 5 22 kcal mol 1 respectively the preferred reaction at c5 is due to the electron donating ability of the methoxy group which increases the electron density on the ring carbons ortho and para to it i e c5 and c7 the para position at c14 has very low reactivity since addition here will result in the loss of aromaticity in the compound the c5 addition is favored over c7 because the other benzene ring can also act as an electron donating group to c5 these effects result in the very low δ g seen for c5 and the major reaction pathway was raf pathway in formation of 2 5 hydroxy 6 methoxynaphthalen 2 yl propanoic acid hmnpa 3 5 kinetics modelling and degradation intermediates although several reaction intermediates have been identified by high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrum hplc ms technique from previous studies table 2 dulova et al 2017 gao et al 2017 the ms information cannot explicitly determine which intermediate is favorable to form and its influence on subsequent oh oxidation steps an et al 2013 du et al 2006 this study builds upon the previous work aiming to answer this fundamental question based on the theoretical study the major dominant reaction intermediate was the hmnpa p1 see table 2 therefore we used this dominant reaction intermediate as an example to elucidate the interplay between parent nap and formed intermediate during oh oxidation process we speculated that hmnpa exhibits a similar reactivity with oh as compared to parent nap this was based on the extended homo and lumo distribution of hmnpa see fig a3 c d especially for lumo distributions in carboxylic acid group since experimentally measuring the k value for the reaction of oh and hmnpa provided some challenges due to the high cost of synthesis and the extreme complexity of the reaction system a kinetics modelling technique was used in this study to answer this question fig 4 demonstrated the nap and hmnpa concentration evolutions the fit nap concentration over time red line agreed with the measured ones red dots the best model fitting of the kinetics was achieved by applying mead nelder optimization algorithms and standard least squares comparison operator because this combination produced good description of evolution of nap concentration and reasonable k value the determination coefficient r 2 between observed and predicted concentrations of nap during the experimental was 0 993 and the estimated standard deviations of the modelling error was determined to be 3 12 10 7 m 6 59 the modeled concentration of hmnpa increased in the first 15 min and then decreased indicating that oh oxidized nap first followed by hmnpa that starts to compete for oh in the system with an increase of time the modeled k value for the reaction between oh and nap was 2 53 109 m 1 s 1 the k value of oh oxidation of hmnpa was modeled to be 2 22 109 m 1 s 1 the homo and lumo distributions of hmnpa fig a3 c d are different compared to those of nap the energy gap in lumo and homo of hmnpa 6 15 ev was lower than nap 6 65 ev indicating that hmnpa exhibits a higher reactivity than nap minakata et al 2015 xiao et al 2015b this is likely due to the strong electron donating properties of the hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring in addition the lumo distribution of hmnpa was extended to carboxylic acid group compared to nap suggesting that cooh group becomes more reactive and could be subject to decarboxylation it should be noted that we did not calculate the k value of oh oxidation of hmnpa with the dft method due to failure of the optimization of their tss with m05 2x functional 4 conclusion in this study we combined experimental theoretical and kinetic modelling approaches to investigate the oh oxidation of nap and reaction intermediates in aqueous solution the uv direct photolysis rate and the k value of oh oxidation of nap were measured the measured k value 4 32 0 04 109 m 1 s 1 was in good agreement with previous reports the thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors of the initial step reaction pathways were calculated at the smd m05 2x 6 311 g m05 2x 6 31 g level of theory the calculated k value 1 08 1010 m 1 s 1 was higher than the experimentally determined value in addition the calculated result shows that the activation barrier of raf is lower than hat and oh addition at c5 site dominates the reaction further we provided an insight into reaction mechanisms based on electronic properties of group activation energy and the homo lumo distribution finally a kinetics modelling technique was used to fit the k values and concentration evolution of oh oxidation of nap and dominant intermediate hmnpa the modelling result is in good agreement with experimental values and suggests that hmnpa exhibits a similar oh reactivity as compared to nap thereby affecting oh oxidation of nap these results can provide further understanding of the salient mechanisms of degradation of nap using oh based aots and provide guidance in future studies for the removal of nsaids and other contaminants of concern by aots when such technologies are considered in water and

19633,degradation of three lipid regulators i e gemfibrozil bezafibrate and clofibric acid by a uv chlorine treatment was systematically investigated the chlorine oxide radical clo played an important role in the degradation of gemfibrozil and bezafibrate with second order rate constants of 4 2 0 3 108 m 1 s 1 and 3 6 0 1 107 m 1 s 1 respectively whereas uv photolysis and the hydroxyl radical ho mainly contributed to the degradation of clofibric acid the first order rate constants k for the degradation of gemfibrozil and bezafibrate increased linearly with increasing chlorine dosage primarily due to the linear increase in the clo concentration the k values for gemfibrozil bezafibrate and clofibric acid degradation decreased with increasing ph from 5 0 to 8 4 however the contribution of the reactive chlorine species rcs increased degradation of gemfibrozil and bezafibrate was enhanced in the presence of br whereas it was inhibited in the presence of natural organic matter nom the presence of ammonia at a chlorine ammonia molar ratio of 1 1 resulted in decreases in the k values for gemfibrozil and bezafibrate of 69 7 and 7 respectively but led to an increase in that for clofibric acid of 61 8 degradation of gemfibrozil by clo was initiated by hydroxylation and chlorine substitution on the benzene ring then subsequent hydroxylation bond cleavage and chlorination reactions led to the formation of more stable products three chlorinated intermediates were identified during clo oxidation process formation of the chlorinated disinfection by products chloral hydrate and 1 1 1 trichloropropanone was enhanced relative to that of other by products the acute toxicity of gemfibrozil to vibrio fischeri increased significantly when subjected to direct uv photolysis whereas it decreased when oxidized by clo this study is the first to report the transformation pathway of a micropollutant by clo graphical abstract image 1 keywords lipid regulator uv chlorine reactive chlorine species chlorine oxide radical advanced oxidation process water treatment 1 introduction lipid regulators such as gemfibrozil gfrz bezafibrate bzf and clofibric acid ca are widely used as hypolipidemic and triglyceride lowering drugs the excess drugs are excreted and discharged into the environment primarily via wastewater effluents gfrz was detected in surface water and wastewater at concentrations of 0 5 4 76 μg l daughton and ternes 1999 sanderson et al 2003 bzf was detected at levels of 1 μg l in wastewater effluents and ca was detected at concentrations of 0 03 0 55 μg l isidori et al 2007 these lipid regulators showed acute toxicity to bacteria rotifers and crustaceans at the mg l level and gfrz also exhibited genotoxicity to escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium isidori et al 2007 several processes have been employed to control lipid regulators traditional water treatment processes such as biological treatments adsorption and coagulation filtration cannot completely remove lipid regulators from water huerta fontela et al 2011 sui et al 2011 however ozonation and uv photolysis can be applied to degrade lipid regulators selectively andreozzi et al 2003 benitez et al 2013 broséus et al 2009 carlson et al 2015 dantas et al 2007 gfrz can be slowly oxidized by chlorination to form several chlorine containing intermediates krkosek et al 2011 hydroxyl radical ho based advanced oxidation processes aops can efficiently degrade gfrz bzf and ca with rate constants of 1 00 0 06 1010 8 0 0 22 109 and 6 98 0 12 109 m 1 s 1 respectively for the reaction with ho razavi et al 2009 however ho based aops are highly influenced by water matrix components and high chemical dosages and energy inputs are required for practical water treatment applications sichel et al 2011 wols et al 2013 thus alternative technologies for effectively removing lipid regulators from water should be investigated the uv chlorine process has received increasing attention because it can efficiently degrade various micropollutants such as polyvinyl alcohol ye et al 2017 atrazine kong et al 2016 and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps guo et al 2017 huang et al 2017 qin et al 2014 sichel et al 2011 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2016 xiang et al 2016 yang et al 2016 primary ho and chlorine cl radicals and secondary chlorine oxide clo and dichloride anion cl2 radicals are formed in this system as shown in eqs 1 4 fang et al 2014 watts and linden 2007 1 hocl ocl hv ho o cl 2 hocl ocl ho clo h2o oh k 2 0 109 m 1 s 1 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 3 hocl ocl cl clo cl k 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 8 2 109 m 1 s 1 4 cl cl cl2 k 6 5 109 m 1 s 1 the ho and reactive chlorine species rcs i e cl clo and cl2 work together to degrade micropollutants compared to ho rcs preferentially react with contaminants containing electron rich moieties guo et al 2017 wu et al 2016 it was reported that ho was the predominant radical in the degradation of ibuprofen xiang et al 2016 and ronidazole qin et al 2014 by uv chlorine whereas rcs were found to play an important role in the degradation of trimethoprim wu et al 2016 and benzoic acid fang et al 2014 by uv chlorine the radical mechanisms for the removal of different micropollutants depend on the reactivities of the micropollutants with the specific radicals in the uv chlorine system guo et al 2017 recently it was revealed that clo which has a reduction potential e0 vs nhe of 1 5 1 8 v at 21 1 c alfassi et al 1988 played an important role in the degradation of trimethoprim by uv chlorine wu et al 2016 furthermore the concentration of clo was reported to be several orders of magnitude higher than those of ho and cl in the uv chlorine process wu et al 2017 and the rate constants for the reactions between this radical and some pollutants are relatively high 107 109 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2017 however the kinetics and radical mechanism of the degradation of lipid regulators by uv chlorine and the role of clo in particular have not been elucidated and should be investigated the transformation pathways and changes in the toxicities of some micropollutants in the uv chlorine process were investigated in several studies kong et al 2016 pan et al 2017 wu et al 2016 xiang et al 2016 rcs were shown to transform ibuprofen by chlorine substitution on the benzene ring xiang et al 2016 furthermore rcs reacted with trimethoprim much faster than chlorine to form chlorinated products wu et al 2016 the olefin structure and aromatic ring in carbamazepine are also susceptible to rcs attack to form chlorine containing intermediates pan et al 2017 in contrast the oxidation of atrazine by rcs did not result in the formation of any chlorinated products kong et al 2016 meanwhile disinfection by product dbp formation during the oxidation of organic substances by uv chlorine is also a concern sharma et al 2017 the formation of some known dbps during the oxidation of ibuprofen trimethoprim and natural organic matter nom was significantly enhanced when the uv chlorine process was employed wang et al 2017 wu et al 2016 xiang et al 2016 similarly the formation of halonitromethanes was enhanced during the degradation of chloramphenicol and amines by uv chlorine deng et al 2014 dong et al 2017 however the uv chlorine treatment decreased the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of a drinking water compared to chlorination alone plewa et al 2012 meanwhile the acute toxicity of trimethoprim to vibrio fischeri was lower when the uv chlorine process was employed than when only chlorination was used to achieve the same trimethoprim removal rate wu et al 2016 however in those studies the transformation pathways and changes in the toxicity induced by rcs in the uv chlorine process were determined for total rcs including cl clo and cl2 and ho some recent studies showed that clo is important in the degradation kinetics of some micropollutants sun et al 2016 wu et al 2016 however the transformation pathways of micropollutants by clo alone and the corresponding changes in their toxicities have not been elucidated thus the purposes of this work were to investigate 1 the degradation kinetics of typical lipid regulators i e gfrz bzf and ca by uv chlorine 2 the radical chemistry controlling the degradation kinetics under different conditions and 3 the clo mediated transformation pathways and toxicity changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all solutions were prepared using reagent grade chemicals and milli q water 18 2 mω cm gfrz 98 5 bzf 98 5

were conducted under magnetic stirring in a cylindrical borosilicate glass reactor with a quartz tube in the centre of it a low pressure mercury lamp heraeus gph212t5l 4 10 w was placed inside the quartz tube the temperature was maintained at 25 0 2 c the uv photon flux i 0 entering the solution was determined to be 0 43 μeinstein s by iodide iodate chemical actinometry bolton and stefan 2011 the corresponding average uv fluence rate ep 0 was estimated to be 0 80 mw cm2 wu et al 2016 a 700 ml test solution spiked with 5 μm bzf gfrz or ca 1 μm nb and 2 mm of phosphate buffer was dosed with naocl and simultaneously exposed to uv irradiation samples were withdrawn after a given reaction time and quenched with excess nh4cl in addition a set of similar tests were conducted by spiking the solution with certain concentrations of nom nahco3 nacl nabr and nh4cl to study the effects of the water matrix components on the degradation of the lipid regulators radical scavenging tests were conducted by adding hco3 100 mm and tba 2 mm at ph 8 4 due to their specific reactivities with the radicals in the uv chlorine system wu et al 2017 control tests were performed by a similar method in the absence of chlorine and uv light to determine the degradation of the lipid regulators by direct uv photolysis and dark chlorination respectively for comparison an additional test was conducted in the same manner with an h2o2 dosage of 50 μm at ph 7 0 to identify the degradation intermediates products and quantify the concentrations of dbps during gfrz degradation by clo higher initial concentrations of gfrz 50 μm and chlorine 200 μm were used for each run a 500 ml sample was collected after a given reaction time and quenched with nh4cl then the sample was subjected to solid phase extraction spe to obtain a 1 ml concentrate for ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc qtof ms analysis all the tests were conducted at least twice all the data plots show the averages of the experimental data of the two tests 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of gfrz bzf ca nb and dmob were measured using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc instrument agilent 1260 usa equipped with a c18 column poroshell 4 6 50 mm 2 7 μm and diode array detector dad set to 276 nm 227 nm 230 nm 266 nm and 224 nm respectively a sample volume of 100 μl was injected the eluent consisted of a water and methanol mixture with different ratios for the quantification of gfrz bzf ca nb and dmob and the flow rate was 1 0 ml min the intermediates of gfrz degradation were identified by uplc qtof ms waters synapt g2 si h hdms using a waters acquity beh c18 column 1 7 μm a sample volume of 0 4 μl was injected and the eluent flow

over 12 min and then maintained at this ratio for 2 min the composition was subsequently returned to 95 5 over 0 2 min and then maintained at that ratio for 1 8 min the main parameters of esi were as follows a collision energy of 10 ev scan range m z of 100 600 amu capillary voltage of 2 5 kv sampling cone of 30 v trap collision energy of 4 ev and transfer collision energy of 2 ev 2 4 determination of the rate constants for the reaction of clo with gfrz bzf and ca the second order rate constants for the reaction of clo with gfrz bzf and ca were determined by competition kinetics using dmob as the reference compound to create a scenario for clo the uv chlorine system was spiked with 100 mm hco3 at ph 8 4 under these conditions ho cl and cl2 were scavenged by hco3 and only clo and co3 were available to react guo et al 2017 it should be noted that the reactivity of co3 with the lipid regulators was negligible text s1 and fig s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of the degradation of the lipid regulators by uv chlorine fig 1 compares the degradation of gfrz bzf and ca by uv photolysis uv chlorine uv h2o2 chlorine and h2o2 the degradation of gfrz bzf and ca by either chlorine or h2o2 was negligible after 60 min degradation by uv uv chlorine and uv h2o2 followed first order kinetics fig s2 degradation by uv photolysis was selective the observed first order rate constant k for ca degradation by uv photolysis was 0 517 min 1 which was much higher than those for gfrz 0 0129 min 1 and bzf 0 0075 min 1 degradation degradation by uv photolysis occurred via uv absorbance followed by photolysis the molar absorption coefficients of gfrz bzf and ca at 254 nm were determined to be 370 7901 and 237 m 1 cm 1 respectively and their quantum yields were 0 024 0 0037 and 0 71 respectively table 1 and fig s3 the k values for gfrz and bzf degradation by uv chlorine were higher than those for their degradation by uv h2o2 whereas the k values for ca degradation by uv chlorine and uv h2o2 were similar the k values for gfrz bzf and ca degradation by uv chlorine were 0 32 0 096 and 0 086 min 1 respectively and those for their degradation by uv h2o2 were 0 06 0 03 and 0 095 min 1 respectively the higher degradation rates of gfrz bzf and ca by uv chlorine and uv h2o2 compared to those by uv photolysis were attributed to the radicals formed in both of the former systems specifically ho and rcs including cl clo and cl2 are formed in the uv chlorine system whereas ho is formed in the uv h2o2 system 3 2 role of the radicals in the degradation of the lipid regulators by the uv chlorine process 3 2 1 role of the radicals determined using nitrobenzene as a probe compound the k values for the degradation reaction between ho and gfrz bzf and ca in the uv chlorine and uv h2o2 systems were determined using nb as a ho probe xiang et al 2016 as shown in fig 2 the degradation of gfrz and bzf was primarily due to rcs and then ho in the uv chlorine process whereas the degradation of ca was due to uv photolysis and ho in the uv chlorine process the contributions of rcs to the k values for gfrz and bzf were 80 2 and 70 0 respectively whereas their contribution to the k value for ca was negligible 2 3 in the uv h2o2 process ho contributed 78 8 85 6 and 46 0 to the k values for gfrz bzf and ca respectively the differences in the contributions of ho and rcs to the k values for gfrz bzf and ca degradation by uv chlorine were attributed to the different reactivities of ho and rcs with gfrz bzf and ca the second order rate constants for the reactions of gfrz bzf and ca with ho were previously reported to be 1 00 0 06 1010 8 0 0 22 109 and 6 98 0 12 109 m 1 s 1 respectively razavi et al 2009 wols and hofman caris 2012 wols et al 2013 the corresponding values for the reactions with rcs have not been reported in the literature 3 2 2 effects of radical scavengers on the kinetics of the uv chlorine process to further confirm the specific contributions of rcs the radical scavengers tba and hco3 were utilized the reaction rate constants for the reactions of tba and hco3 with ho cl clo and cl2 are shown in table s1 hco3 can scavenge ho cl and cl2 but not clo whereas tba can scavenge ho cl and clo but not cl2 wu et al 2017 fig 3 shows the inhibition effects of tba and hco3 on the k values for gfrz bzf and ca degradation by uv chlorine the k values for gfrz and bzf decreased from 0 2 min 1 to 0 16 min 1 and from 0 064 min 1 to 0 043 min 1 respectively in the presence of 100 mm hco3 meanwhile these k values decreased significantly to 0 07 and 0 018 min 1 respectively in the presence of 2 mm tba the significant rate inhibition by tba but slight rate inhibition by hco3 for gfrz and bzf indicated that clo was the primary radical responsible for their degradation for ca the k value for the degradation by the radicals was completely inhibited in the presence of either tba or hco3 due to their efficient scavenging of ho thus the rate constants for the reaction of clo with gfrz bzf and ca were further investigated 3 2 3 role of clo fig s4 shows the competition kinetics of gfrz bzf and ca degradation by clo with dmob as the reference compound the second order rate constants for the reaction of clo with gfrz and bzf were determined to be 4 2 0 3 108 and 3 6 0 1 107 m 1 s 1 respectively whereas that for the reaction with ca was negligible table 1 the relatively high reactivities of gfrz and bzf with clo confirmed that clo was the main rcs causing in their degradation 3 3 effects of the chlorine dosage ph and water matrix components 3 3 1 effects of the chlorine dosage fig 4 shows the effects of the chlorine dosage on the specific k values for the degradation of gfrz bzf and ca by uv ho and rcs in the uv chlorine system at ph 7 0 the k values for gfrz and bzf increased linearly with increasing chlorine dosage whereas that for ca increased slightly fig s5 the k values for gfrz and bzf increased from 0 11 min 1 to 0 71 min 1 and from 0 057 min 1 to 0 25 min 1 respectively as the chlorine dosage was increased from 25 to 200 μm the k rcs values for gfrz and bzf increased linearly from 0 052 min 1 to 0 66 min 1 and from 0 027 min 1 to 0 22 min 1 respectively whereas the k ho values varied slightly the corresponding contributions of rcs to the k values for gfrz and bzf increased from 46 0 to 92 5 and from 46 8 to 87 2 respectively although the amounts of ho and cl formed increased with increasing chlorine dosage they were scavenged by excess chlorine to form clo eqs 2 and 3 wu et al 2017 the linear increases in the k values for gfrz and bzf degradation by uv chlorine with increasing chlorine dosage were primarily attributed to the increase in the amount of clo formed 3 3 2 effects of the ph fig 5 shows the effects of the ph on the specific k values for the degradation of gfrz bzf and ca by uv ho and rcs in the uv chlorine system the k and k ho values for gfrz bzf and ca decreased with increasing ph from 5 0 to 8 4 specifically the k values for gfrz bzf and ca decreased by 74 1 71 4 and 76 7 respectively with increasing ph in this range the k ho values for gfrz bzf and ca decreased significantly from 0 291 min 1 to 0 0219 min 1 from 0 164 min 1 to 0 00418 min 1 and from 0 202 min 1 to 0 0125 min 1 respectively meanwhile the k rcs value for gfrz decreased from 0 433 to 0 157 min 1 whereas the k rcs value for bzf varied slightly and the k rcs value for ca was negligible accordingly the contributions of rcs to the k values for gfrz and bzf increased from 58 8 to 81 8 and from 21 4 to 81 3 respectively as the ph was increased from 5 0 to 8 4 the higher contributions of rcs to the degradation of gfrz and bzf at higher phs were likely due to the important role of clo in their degradation although the concentration of clo varied slightly with increasing ph those of ho and cl decreased significantly wu et al 2017 3 3 3 effects of the water matrix components the presence of water matrix components such as nom bicarbonate and chloride ions in surface water and wastewater is inevitable additionally bromide ions and ammonia are widely found in water particularly in wastewater and can significantly affect the chlorine chemistry heeb et al 2014 wu et al 2017 fig 6 shows the effects of these water matrix components on the specific k values for the degradation of gfrz bzf and ca by uv ho and reactive halogen species rhs including rcs and reactive bromine species rbs some interesting results were observed 1 the k values for gfrz and bzf declined appreciably by 50 3 and 36 2 respectively in the presence of 1 mg l nom but that for ca changed slightly 2 the k values for gfrz and bzf increased by 45 9 and 17 3 respectively in the presence of 5 μm br but that for ca remained unchanged and 3 the k values for gfrz and bzf decreased by 66 3 and 7 1 respectively whereas that for ca increased by 37 1 in the presence of 50 μm ammonia the molar ratio of ammonia to chlorine 1 1 chloride ions and hco3 did not affect the degradation significantly and all the k values for gfrz bzf and ca decreased by less than 20 in the presence of 5 mm chloride or 1 mm hco3 the second order rate constants for the reaction of nom with ho cl and clo are 2 5 104 1 3 104 and 4 5 104 mg l 1 s 1 respectively fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 lee et al 2007 thus it preferentially scavenged clo in these experiments which led to decreases in the k values for gfrz and bzf in the uv chlorine system bromide ions form free bromine lyon et al 2012 and rbs such as br bro br2 broh and clbr due to the photolysis of bromine and the interactions among bromide bromine and br oh and cl and these species contribute to the fast oxidation of some organic compounds fang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 the k rhs values for gfrz and bzf increased by 25 7 and 8 4 respectively in the presence of br due to the contributions of the rbs in addition bromine but not chlorine reacted with gfrz fig s6 because the reactivity of bromine with organic compounds through electrophilic substitution is higher than that of chlorine heeb et al 2014 the contribution of bromine to the k value for gfrz was determined to be 18 fig 6 thus the enhancement in the degradation of gfrz and bzf in the presence of bromide was attributed to rbs bromine and rbs respectively nh3 reacts with chlorine to form monochloramine with a rate constant of 4 17 106 m 1 s 1 eq 5 vikesland et al 2001 5 nh3 hocl nh2cl h2o k 4 17 106 m 1 s 1 the reactive species in a uv monochloramine system were reported to be ho cl and cl2 chuang et al 2017 patton et al 2017 the concentration of ho was found to increase in the presence of nh4 in the uv chlorine process whereas that of clo decreased wu et al 2017 therefore in this study the krcs values for gfrz and bzf decreased by 96 and 39 2 respectively in the presence of nh4 due to the decrease in the clo concentration meanwhile the kho values for gfrz bzf and ca increased from 0 052 min 1 to 0 079 min 1 from 0 021 min 1 to 0 04 min 1 and from 0 032 min 1 to 0 086 min 1 respectively due to the increase in ho formation in the presence of ammonia as expected the k values for gfrz and bzf decreased whereas that for ca increased 3 4 proposed pathways for the degradation of gfrz by clo as discussed previously clo was the primary radical that degraded gfrz and bzf the mineralization of gfrz by clo was low fig s7 indicating that gfrz was transformed into intermediates products these intermediates products of gfrz degradation by clo were determined by uplc esi qtof ms three chlorine containing intermediates and eleven non chlorine containing intermediates were identified table s2 fig 7 a shows the time dependent evolution of the major products for the three chlorine containing products the abundance of m z 283 was much higher than those of m z 185 and m z 155 the abundances of products m z 145 m z 137 m z 135 m z 263 and m z 297 exhibited similar evolution trends they increased with increasing reaction time and were relatively high the abundances of products m z 159 m z 283 m z 265 i ii and m z 151 initially increased with time before decreasing the abundances of products m z 281 and m z 279 were lower than those of the previously listed products and products m z 155 and m z 185 had the lowest abundances the proposed structures of the intermediates products were based on mass spectrograms obtained by qtof ms the proposed pathways for gfrz transformation by clo based on the identified intermediates and products are shown in scheme 1 hydroxylation and cyclization were observed during the initial stages of gfrz degradation by clo which is similar to that by ho razavi et al 2009 chlorine substitution was also observed products m z 265 i and 265 ii and m z 263 were initially formed by hydroxylation and cyclization respectively further hydroxylation of the aromatic ring of product m z 265 i led to the formation of products m z 281 and m z 297 whereas attack of the c o group in the side chain led to the formation of products m z 137 and m z 145 further oxidation of products m z 137 and m z 281 resulted in the formation of quinone products m z 135 and m z 279 further hydroxylation of the c o group in the side chain of product m z 279 resulted in products m z 145 and m z 151 regarding the formation of the chlorine containing products the monochlorine intermediate m z 284 was initially formed by the chlorine substitution of gfrz then attack of the c o group in the side chain led to the formation of product m z 155 product m z 185 was formed by the chlorine substitution of product m z 151 in addition four chlorinated disinfection by products trichloromethane tcm chloral hydrate ch 1 1 dichloropropanone 1 1 dcp and 1 1 1 trichloropropanone 1 1 1 tcp were detected during gfrz degradation by clo after 13 min the concentrations of ch and 1 1 1 tcp were 1 2 and 12 μg l respectively which were higher than those of tcm and 1 1 dcp less than 1 μg l fig 7b clo is a newly identified rcs in the uv chlorine process and water treatment processes this study elucidated the pathway of gfrz degradation by clo both chlorine substitution and hydroxylation occurred through clo oxidation which is different from the mechanism of the cl process chlorine substitution on the benzene ring of ibuprofen was determined to be the dominant pathway for cl xiang et al 2016 alfassi et al 1988 reported that clo reacted with methoxybenzenes and phenols by a one electron transfer process thus the transformation of gfrz by clo initially involved the transfer of one electron from gfrz to clo which then led to the formation of a carbon centred radical the carbon centred radical subsequently reacted with chlorine to form hydroxylated and chlorinated products wu et al 2016 3 5 toxicity changes induced by clo fig 8 shows the change in the acute toxicity of gfrz to vibrio fischeri during its degradation by clo and uv and by uv alone it should be noted that the degradation of gfrz by chlorination was negligible under the experimental conditions in this study fig s8 thus the change in the toxicity should be negligible gfrz showed no acute toxicity to vibrio fischeri the inhibition percentage of vibrio fischeri increased when the samples were treated by clo and uv and by uv alone unexpectedly the inhibition increased obviously with increasing uv irradiation time and was higher than that observed after the clo and uv treatment when the clo and uv treatment was applied the inhibition increased with increasing reaction time from 0 to 5 min and then remained nearly constant as the reaction time increased from 5 to 13 min the inhibition by uv 31 3 was much higher than that by the clo and uv treatment 14 7 after 13 min although the removal rate of gfrz by the former treatment 13 was much lower than that of the latter 80 fig s8 the acute toxicity of gfrz was undetectable data not shown thus the variations in the acute toxicity were attributed to the intermediates products formed during the clo and uv treatment chlorine containing products were reported to correlate with changes in the toxicity during the degradation of trimethoprim by uv chlorine wu et al 2016 in this study the concentrations of the chlorine containing intermediates such as product m z 283 peaked at 10 min whereas those of the dbps increased monotonically with increasing reaction time however the toxicity changed slightly with increasing reaction time from 5 min to 13 min thus the evolution of the chlorine containing products did not correlate with the toxicity probably due to the increased toxicity induced by uv irradiation these results indicated that clo oxidation can decrease the acute toxicity of the solution caused by direct uv photolysis the increased acute toxicity induced by the uv photolysis of gfrz was unexpected and the mechanism should be investigated in future work 4 conclusions and practical implications three lipid regulators gfrz bzf and ca were efficiently degraded by the ho and rcs formed during the uv chlorine process degradation of gfrz and bzf was primarily due to the rcs whereas ca was mainly degraded by the ho and uv photolysis clo played a very important role in the degradation of gfrz and bzf and the second order rate constants for the reactions were 4 2 0 3 108 and 3 6 0 1 107 m 1 s 1 respectively the chlorine dosage ph and water matrix components such as nom bromide ions and ammonia affected the degradation of gfrz bzf and ca differently due to their specific impacts on the radical chemistry in the uv chlorine process degradation of gemfibrozil by clo was initiated by hydroxylation and chlorine substitution which were followed by cleavage and hydroxylation reactions to form more stable products the oxidation of gfrz and its degradation intermediates by clo decreased its acute toxicity relative to that observed after direct uv photolysis the uv chlorine process is an attractive aop for the degradation of many micropollutants and has good potential for use in drinking water treatment water reuse and swimming pool water treatment sun et al 2016 wang et al 2015 clo is a newly identified radical in the uv chlorine process that plays an important role in the degradation of some micropollutants wu et al 2016 in this study the contribution of clo to the degradation of lipid regulators was revealed for the first time and the transformation pathways dbp formation and changes in the toxicity during the degradation of gfrz by clo were elucidated clo also plays important roles in the transformations of nom and other micropollutants such as caffeine and carbamazepine in the uv chlorine process guo et al 2017 wu et al 2017 and their associated transformation pathways should also be investigated acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the natural

19633,degradation of three lipid regulators i e gemfibrozil bezafibrate and clofibric acid by a uv chlorine treatment was systematically investigated the chlorine oxide radical clo played an important role in the degradation of gemfibrozil and bezafibrate with second order rate constants of 4 2 0 3 108 m 1 s 1 and 3 6 0 1 107 m 1 s 1 respectively whereas uv photolysis and the hydroxyl radical ho mainly contributed to the degradation of clofibric acid the first order rate constants k for the degradation of gemfibrozil and bezafibrate increased linearly with increasing chlorine dosage primarily due to the linear increase in the clo concentration the k values for gemfibrozil bezafibrate and clofibric acid degradation decreased with increasing ph from 5 0 to 8 4 however the contribution of the reactive chlorine species rcs increased degradation of gemfibrozil and bezafibrate was enhanced in the presence of br whereas it was inhibited in the presence of natural organic matter nom the presence of ammonia at a chlorine ammonia molar ratio of 1 1 resulted in decreases in the k values for gemfibrozil and bezafibrate of 69 7 and 7 respectively but led to an increase in that for clofibric acid of 61 8 degradation of gemfibrozil by clo was initiated by hydroxylation and chlorine substitution on the benzene ring then subsequent hydroxylation bond cleavage and chlorination reactions led to the formation of more stable products three chlorinated intermediates were identified during clo oxidation process formation of the chlorinated disinfection by products chloral hydrate and 1 1 1 trichloropropanone was enhanced relative to that of other by products the acute toxicity of gemfibrozil to vibrio fischeri increased significantly when subjected to direct uv photolysis whereas it decreased when oxidized by clo this study is the first to report the transformation pathway of a micropollutant by clo graphical abstract image 1 keywords lipid regulator uv chlorine reactive chlorine species chlorine oxide radical advanced oxidation process water treatment 1 introduction lipid regulators such as gemfibrozil gfrz bezafibrate bzf and clofibric acid ca are widely used as hypolipidemic and triglyceride lowering drugs the excess drugs are excreted and discharged into the environment primarily via wastewater effluents gfrz was detected in surface water and wastewater at concentrations of 0 5 4 76 μg l daughton and ternes 1999 sanderson et al 2003 bzf was detected at levels of 1 μg l in wastewater effluents and ca was detected at concentrations of 0 03 0 55 μg l isidori et al 2007 these lipid regulators showed acute toxicity to bacteria rotifers and crustaceans at the mg l level and gfrz also exhibited genotoxicity to escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium isidori et al 2007 several processes have been employed to control lipid regulators traditional water treatment processes such as biological treatments adsorption and coagulation filtration cannot completely remove lipid regulators from water huerta fontela et al 2011 sui et al 2011 however ozonation and uv photolysis can be applied to degrade lipid regulators selectively andreozzi et al 2003 benitez et al 2013 broséus et al 2009 carlson et al 2015 dantas et al 2007 gfrz can be slowly oxidized by chlorination to form several chlorine containing intermediates krkosek et al 2011 hydroxyl radical ho based advanced oxidation processes aops can efficiently degrade gfrz bzf and ca with rate constants of 1 00 0 06 1010 8 0 0 22 109 and 6 98 0 12 109 m 1 s 1 respectively for the reaction with ho razavi et al 2009 however ho based aops are highly influenced by water matrix components and high chemical dosages and energy inputs are required for practical water treatment applications sichel et al 2011 wols et al 2013 thus alternative technologies for effectively removing lipid regulators from water should be investigated the uv chlorine process has received increasing attention because it can efficiently degrade various micropollutants such as polyvinyl alcohol ye et al 2017 atrazine kong et al 2016 and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps guo et al 2017 huang et al 2017 qin et al 2014 sichel et al 2011 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2016 xiang et al 2016 yang et al 2016 primary ho and chlorine cl radicals and secondary chlorine oxide clo and dichloride anion cl2 radicals are formed in this system as shown in eqs 1 4 fang et al 2014 watts and linden 2007 1 hocl ocl hv ho o cl 2 hocl ocl ho clo h2o oh k 2 0 109 m 1 s 1 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 3 hocl ocl cl clo cl k 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 8 2 109 m 1 s 1 4 cl cl cl2 k 6 5 109 m 1 s 1 the ho and reactive chlorine species rcs i e cl clo and cl2 work together to degrade micropollutants compared to ho rcs preferentially react with contaminants containing electron rich moieties guo et al 2017 wu et al 2016 it was reported that ho was the predominant radical in the degradation of ibuprofen xiang et al 2016 and ronidazole qin et al 2014 by uv chlorine whereas rcs were found to play an important role in the degradation of trimethoprim wu et al 2016 and benzoic acid fang et al 2014 by uv chlorine the radical mechanisms for the removal of different micropollutants depend on the reactivities of the micropollutants with the specific radicals in the uv chlorine system guo et al 2017 recently it was revealed that clo which has a reduction potential e0 vs nhe of 1 5 1 8 v at 21 1 c alfassi et al 1988 played an important role in the degradation of trimethoprim by uv chlorine wu et al 2016 furthermore the concentration of clo was reported to be several orders of magnitude higher than those of ho and cl in the uv chlorine process wu et al 2017 and the rate constants for the reactions between this radical and some pollutants are relatively high 107 109 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2017 however the kinetics and radical mechanism of the degradation of lipid regulators by uv chlorine and the role of clo in particular have not been elucidated and should be investigated the transformation pathways and changes in the toxicities of some micropollutants in the uv chlorine process were investigated in several studies kong et al 2016 pan et al 2017 wu et al 2016 xiang et al 2016 rcs were shown to transform ibuprofen by chlorine substitution on the benzene ring xiang et al 2016 furthermore rcs reacted with trimethoprim much faster than chlorine to form chlorinated products wu et al 2016 the olefin structure and aromatic ring in carbamazepine are also susceptible to rcs attack to form chlorine containing intermediates pan et al 2017 in contrast the oxidation of atrazine by rcs did not result in the formation of any chlorinated products kong et al 2016 meanwhile disinfection by product dbp formation during the oxidation of organic substances by uv chlorine is also a concern sharma et al 2017 the formation of some known dbps during the oxidation of ibuprofen trimethoprim and natural organic matter nom was significantly enhanced when the uv chlorine process was employed wang et al 2017 wu et al 2016 xiang et al 2016 similarly the formation of halonitromethanes was enhanced during the degradation of chloramphenicol and amines by uv chlorine deng et al 2014 dong et al 2017 however the uv chlorine treatment decreased the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of a drinking water compared to chlorination alone plewa et al 2012 meanwhile the acute toxicity of trimethoprim to vibrio fischeri was lower when the uv chlorine process was employed than when only chlorination was used to achieve the same trimethoprim removal rate wu et al 2016 however in those studies the transformation pathways and changes in the toxicity induced by rcs in the uv chlorine process were determined for total rcs including cl clo and cl2 and ho some recent studies showed that clo is important in the degradation kinetics of some micropollutants sun et al 2016 wu et al 2016 however the transformation pathways of micropollutants by clo alone and the corresponding changes in their toxicities have not been elucidated thus the purposes of this work were to investigate 1 the degradation kinetics of typical lipid regulators i e gfrz bzf and ca by uv chlorine 2 the radical chemistry controlling the degradation kinetics under different conditions and 3 the clo mediated transformation pathways and toxicity changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all solutions were prepared using reagent grade chemicals and milli q water 18 2 mω cm gfrz 98 5 bzf 98 5

were conducted under magnetic stirring in a cylindrical borosilicate glass reactor with a quartz tube in the centre of it a low pressure mercury lamp heraeus gph212t5l 4 10 w was placed inside the quartz tube the temperature was maintained at 25 0 2 c the uv photon flux i 0 entering the solution was determined to be 0 43 μeinstein s by iodide iodate chemical actinometry bolton and stefan 2011 the corresponding average uv fluence rate ep 0 was estimated to be 0 80 mw cm2 wu et al 2016 a 700 ml test solution spiked with 5 μm bzf gfrz or ca 1 μm nb and 2 mm of phosphate buffer was dosed with naocl and simultaneously exposed to uv irradiation samples were withdrawn after a given reaction time and quenched with excess nh4cl in addition a set of similar tests were conducted by spiking the solution with certain concentrations of nom nahco3 nacl nabr and nh4cl to study the effects of the water matrix components on the degradation of the lipid regulators radical scavenging tests were conducted by adding hco3 100 mm and tba 2 mm at ph 8 4 due to their specific reactivities with the radicals in the uv chlorine system wu et al 2017 control tests were performed by a similar method in the absence of chlorine and uv light to determine the degradation of the lipid regulators by direct uv photolysis and dark chlorination respectively for comparison an additional test was conducted in the same manner with an h2o2 dosage of 50 μm at ph 7 0 to identify the degradation intermediates products and quantify the concentrations of dbps during gfrz degradation by clo higher initial concentrations of gfrz 50 μm and chlorine 200 μm were used for each run a 500 ml sample was collected after a given reaction time and quenched with nh4cl then the sample was subjected to solid phase extraction spe to obtain a 1 ml concentrate for ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc qtof ms analysis all the tests were conducted at least twice all the data plots show the averages of the experimental data of the two tests 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of gfrz bzf ca nb and dmob were measured using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc instrument agilent 1260 usa equipped with a c18 column poroshell 4 6 50 mm 2 7 μm and diode array detector dad set to 276 nm 227 nm 230 nm 266 nm and 224 nm respectively a sample volume of 100 μl was injected the eluent consisted of a water and methanol mixture with different ratios for the quantification of gfrz bzf ca nb and dmob and the flow rate was 1 0 ml min the intermediates of gfrz degradation were identified by uplc qtof ms waters synapt g2 si h hdms using a waters acquity beh c18 column 1 7 μm a sample volume of 0 4 μl was injected and the eluent flow

over 12 min and then maintained at this ratio for 2 min the composition was subsequently returned to 95 5 over 0 2 min and then maintained at that ratio for 1 8 min the main parameters of esi were as follows a collision energy of 10 ev scan range m z of 100 600 amu capillary voltage of 2 5 kv sampling cone of 30 v trap collision energy of 4 ev and transfer collision energy of 2 ev 2 4 determination of the rate constants for the reaction of clo with gfrz bzf and ca the second order rate constants for the reaction of clo with gfrz bzf and ca were determined by competition kinetics using dmob as the reference compound to create a scenario for clo the uv chlorine system was spiked with 100 mm hco3 at ph 8 4 under these conditions ho cl and cl2 were scavenged by hco3 and only clo and co3 were available to react guo et al 2017 it should be noted that the reactivity of co3 with the lipid regulators was negligible text s1 and fig s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of the degradation of the lipid regulators by uv chlorine fig 1 compares the degradation of gfrz bzf and ca by uv photolysis uv chlorine uv h2o2 chlorine and h2o2 the degradation of gfrz bzf and ca by either chlorine or h2o2 was negligible after 60 min degradation by uv uv chlorine and uv h2o2 followed first order kinetics fig s2 degradation by uv photolysis was selective the observed first order rate constant k for ca degradation by uv photolysis was 0 517 min 1 which was much higher than those for gfrz 0 0129 min 1 and bzf 0 0075 min 1 degradation degradation by uv photolysis occurred via uv absorbance followed by photolysis the molar absorption coefficients of gfrz bzf and ca at 254 nm were determined to be 370 7901 and 237 m 1 cm 1 respectively and their quantum yields were 0 024 0 0037 and 0 71 respectively table 1 and fig s3 the k values for gfrz and bzf degradation by uv chlorine were higher than those for their degradation by uv h2o2 whereas the k values for ca degradation by uv chlorine and uv h2o2 were similar the k values for gfrz bzf and ca degradation by uv chlorine were 0 32 0 096 and 0 086 min 1 respectively and those for their degradation by uv h2o2 were 0 06 0 03 and 0 095 min 1 respectively the higher degradation rates of gfrz bzf and ca by uv chlorine and uv h2o2 compared to those by uv photolysis were attributed to the radicals formed in both of the former systems specifically ho and rcs including cl clo and cl2 are formed in the uv chlorine system whereas ho is formed in the uv h2o2 system 3 2 role of the radicals in the degradation of the lipid regulators by the uv chlorine process 3 2 1 role of the radicals determined using nitrobenzene as a probe compound the k values for the degradation reaction between ho and gfrz bzf and ca in the uv chlorine and uv h2o2 systems were determined using nb as a ho probe xiang et al 2016 as shown in fig 2 the degradation of gfrz and bzf was primarily due to rcs and then ho in the uv chlorine process whereas the degradation of ca was due to uv photolysis and ho in the uv chlorine process the contributions of rcs to the k values for gfrz and bzf were 80 2 and 70 0 respectively whereas their contribution to the k value for ca was negligible 2 3 in the uv h2o2 process ho contributed 78 8 85 6 and 46 0 to the k values for gfrz bzf and ca respectively the differences in the contributions of ho and rcs to the k values for gfrz bzf and ca degradation by uv chlorine were attributed to the different reactivities of ho and rcs with gfrz bzf and ca the second order rate constants for the reactions of gfrz bzf and ca with ho were previously reported to be 1 00 0 06 1010 8 0 0 22 109 and 6 98 0 12 109 m 1 s 1 respectively razavi et al 2009 wols and hofman caris 2012 wols et al 2013 the corresponding values for the reactions with rcs have not been reported in the literature 3 2 2 effects of radical scavengers on the kinetics of the uv chlorine process to further confirm the specific contributions of rcs the radical scavengers tba and hco3 were utilized the reaction rate constants for the reactions of tba and hco3 with ho cl clo and cl2 are shown in table s1 hco3 can scavenge ho cl and cl2 but not clo whereas tba can scavenge ho cl and clo but not cl2 wu et al 2017 fig 3 shows the inhibition effects of tba and hco3 on the k values for gfrz bzf and ca degradation by uv chlorine the k values for gfrz and bzf decreased from 0 2 min 1 to 0 16 min 1 and from 0 064 min 1 to 0 043 min 1 respectively in the presence of 100 mm hco3 meanwhile these k values decreased significantly to 0 07 and 0 018 min 1 respectively in the presence of 2 mm tba the significant rate inhibition by tba but slight rate inhibition by hco3 for gfrz and bzf indicated that clo was the primary radical responsible for their degradation for ca the k value for the degradation by the radicals was completely inhibited in the presence of either tba or hco3 due to their efficient scavenging of ho thus the rate constants for the reaction of clo with gfrz bzf and ca were further investigated 3 2 3 role of clo fig s4 shows the competition kinetics of gfrz bzf and ca degradation by clo with dmob as the reference compound the second order rate constants for the reaction of clo with gfrz and bzf were determined to be 4 2 0 3 108 and 3 6 0 1 107 m 1 s 1 respectively whereas that for the reaction with ca was negligible table 1 the relatively high reactivities of gfrz and bzf with clo confirmed that clo was the main rcs causing in their degradation 3 3 effects of the chlorine dosage ph and water matrix components 3 3 1 effects of the chlorine dosage fig 4 shows the effects of the chlorine dosage on the specific k values for the degradation of gfrz bzf and ca by uv ho and rcs in the uv chlorine system at ph 7 0 the k values for gfrz and bzf increased linearly with increasing chlorine dosage whereas that for ca increased slightly fig s5 the k values for gfrz and bzf increased from 0 11 min 1 to 0 71 min 1 and from 0 057 min 1 to 0 25 min 1 respectively as the chlorine dosage was increased from 25 to 200 μm the k rcs values for gfrz and bzf increased linearly from 0 052 min 1 to 0 66 min 1 and from 0 027 min 1 to 0 22 min 1 respectively whereas the k ho values varied slightly the corresponding contributions of rcs to the k values for gfrz and bzf increased from 46 0 to 92 5 and from 46 8 to 87 2 respectively although the amounts of ho and cl formed increased with increasing chlorine dosage they were scavenged by excess chlorine to form clo eqs 2 and 3 wu et al 2017 the linear increases in the k values for gfrz and bzf degradation by uv chlorine with increasing chlorine dosage were primarily attributed to the increase in the amount of clo formed 3 3 2 effects of the ph fig 5 shows the effects of the ph on the specific k values for the degradation of gfrz bzf and ca by uv ho and rcs in the uv chlorine system the k and k ho values for gfrz bzf and ca decreased with increasing ph from 5 0 to 8 4 specifically the k values for gfrz bzf and ca decreased by 74 1 71 4 and 76 7 respectively with increasing ph in this range the k ho values for gfrz bzf and ca decreased significantly from 0 291 min 1 to 0 0219 min 1 from 0 164 min 1 to 0 00418 min 1 and from 0 202 min 1 to 0 0125 min 1 respectively meanwhile the k rcs value for gfrz decreased from 0 433 to 0 157 min 1 whereas the k rcs value for bzf varied slightly and the k rcs value for ca was negligible accordingly the contributions of rcs to the k values for gfrz and bzf increased from 58 8 to 81 8 and from 21 4 to 81 3 respectively as the ph was increased from 5 0 to 8 4 the higher contributions of rcs to the degradation of gfrz and bzf at higher phs were likely due to the important role of clo in their degradation although the concentration of clo varied slightly with increasing ph those of ho and cl decreased significantly wu et al 2017 3 3 3 effects of the water matrix components the presence of water matrix components such as nom bicarbonate and chloride ions in surface water and wastewater is inevitable additionally bromide ions and ammonia are widely found in water particularly in wastewater and can significantly affect the chlorine chemistry heeb et al 2014 wu et al 2017 fig 6 shows the effects of these water matrix components on the specific k values for the degradation of gfrz bzf and ca by uv ho and reactive halogen species rhs including rcs and reactive bromine species rbs some interesting results were observed 1 the k values for gfrz and bzf declined appreciably by 50 3 and 36 2 respectively in the presence of 1 mg l nom but that for ca changed slightly 2 the k values for gfrz and bzf increased by 45 9 and 17 3 respectively in the presence of 5 μm br but that for ca remained unchanged and 3 the k values for gfrz and bzf decreased by 66 3 and 7 1 respectively whereas that for ca increased by 37 1 in the presence of 50 μm ammonia the molar ratio of ammonia to chlorine 1 1 chloride ions and hco3 did not affect the degradation significantly and all the k values for gfrz bzf and ca decreased by less than 20 in the presence of 5 mm chloride or 1 mm hco3 the second order rate constants for the reaction of nom with ho cl and clo are 2 5 104 1 3 104 and 4 5 104 mg l 1 s 1 respectively fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 lee et al 2007 thus it preferentially scavenged clo in these experiments which led to decreases in the k values for gfrz and bzf in the uv chlorine system bromide ions form free bromine lyon et al 2012 and rbs such as br bro br2 broh and clbr due to the photolysis of bromine and the interactions among bromide bromine and br oh and cl and these species contribute to the fast oxidation of some organic compounds fang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 the k rhs values for gfrz and bzf increased by 25 7 and 8 4 respectively in the presence of br due to the contributions of the rbs in addition bromine but not chlorine reacted with gfrz fig s6 because the reactivity of bromine with organic compounds through electrophilic substitution is higher than that of chlorine heeb et al 2014 the contribution of bromine to the k value for gfrz was determined to be 18 fig 6 thus the enhancement in the degradation of gfrz and bzf in the presence of bromide was attributed to rbs bromine and rbs respectively nh3 reacts with chlorine to form monochloramine with a rate constant of 4 17 106 m 1 s 1 eq 5 vikesland et al 2001 5 nh3 hocl nh2cl h2o k 4 17 106 m 1 s 1 the reactive species in a uv monochloramine system were reported to be ho cl and cl2 chuang et al 2017 patton et al 2017 the concentration of ho was found to increase in the presence of nh4 in the uv chlorine process whereas that of clo decreased wu et al 2017 therefore in this study the krcs values for gfrz and bzf decreased by 96 and 39 2 respectively in the presence of nh4 due to the decrease in the clo concentration meanwhile the kho values for gfrz bzf and ca increased from 0 052 min 1 to 0 079 min 1 from 0 021 min 1 to 0 04 min 1 and from 0 032 min 1 to 0 086 min 1 respectively due to the increase in ho formation in the presence of ammonia as expected the k values for gfrz and bzf decreased whereas that for ca increased 3 4 proposed pathways for the degradation of gfrz by clo as discussed previously clo was the primary radical that degraded gfrz and bzf the mineralization of gfrz by clo was low fig s7 indicating that gfrz was transformed into intermediates products these intermediates products of gfrz degradation by clo were determined by uplc esi qtof ms three chlorine containing intermediates and eleven non chlorine containing intermediates were identified table s2 fig 7 a shows the time dependent evolution of the major products for the three chlorine containing products the abundance of m z 283 was much higher than those of m z 185 and m z 155 the abundances of products m z 145 m z 137 m z 135 m z 263 and m z 297 exhibited similar evolution trends they increased with increasing reaction time and were relatively high the abundances of products m z 159 m z 283 m z 265 i ii and m z 151 initially increased with time before decreasing the abundances of products m z 281 and m z 279 were lower than those of the previously listed products and products m z 155 and m z 185 had the lowest abundances the proposed structures of the intermediates products were based on mass spectrograms obtained by qtof ms the proposed pathways for gfrz transformation by clo based on the identified intermediates and products are shown in scheme 1 hydroxylation and cyclization were observed during the initial stages of gfrz degradation by clo which is similar to that by ho razavi et al 2009 chlorine substitution was also observed products m z 265 i and 265 ii and m z 263 were initially formed by hydroxylation and cyclization respectively further hydroxylation of the aromatic ring of product m z 265 i led to the formation of products m z 281 and m z 297 whereas attack of the c o group in the side chain led to the formation of products m z 137 and m z 145 further oxidation of products m z 137 and m z 281 resulted in the formation of quinone products m z 135 and m z 279 further hydroxylation of the c o group in the side chain of product m z 279 resulted in products m z 145 and m z 151 regarding the formation of the chlorine containing products the monochlorine intermediate m z 284 was initially formed by the chlorine substitution of gfrz then attack of the c o group in the side chain led to the formation of product m z 155 product m z 185 was formed by the chlorine substitution of product m z 151 in addition four chlorinated disinfection by products trichloromethane tcm chloral hydrate ch 1 1 dichloropropanone 1 1 dcp and 1 1 1 trichloropropanone 1 1 1 tcp were detected during gfrz degradation by clo after 13 min the concentrations of ch and 1 1 1 tcp were 1 2 and 12 μg l respectively which were higher than those of tcm and 1 1 dcp less than 1 μg l fig 7b clo is a newly identified rcs in the uv chlorine process and water treatment processes this study elucidated the pathway of gfrz degradation by clo both chlorine substitution and hydroxylation occurred through clo oxidation which is different from the mechanism of the cl process chlorine substitution on the benzene ring of ibuprofen was determined to be the dominant pathway for cl xiang et al 2016 alfassi et al 1988 reported that clo reacted with methoxybenzenes and phenols by a one electron transfer process thus the transformation of gfrz by clo initially involved the transfer of one electron from gfrz to clo which then led to the formation of a carbon centred radical the carbon centred radical subsequently reacted with chlorine to form hydroxylated and chlorinated products wu et al 2016 3 5 toxicity changes induced by clo fig 8 shows the change in the acute toxicity of gfrz to vibrio fischeri during its degradation by clo and uv and by uv alone it should be noted that the degradation of gfrz by chlorination was negligible under the experimental conditions in this study fig s8 thus the change in the toxicity should be negligible gfrz showed no acute toxicity to vibrio fischeri the inhibition percentage of vibrio fischeri increased when the samples were treated by clo and uv and by uv alone unexpectedly the inhibition increased obviously with increasing uv irradiation time and was higher than that observed after the clo and uv treatment when the clo and uv treatment was applied the inhibition increased with increasing reaction time from 0 to 5 min and then remained nearly constant as the reaction time increased from 5 to 13 min the inhibition by uv 31 3 was much higher than that by the clo and uv treatment 14 7 after 13 min although the removal rate of gfrz by the former treatment 13 was much lower than that of the latter 80 fig s8 the acute toxicity of gfrz was undetectable data not shown thus the variations in the acute toxicity were attributed to the intermediates products formed during the clo and uv treatment chlorine containing products were reported to correlate with changes in the toxicity during the degradation of trimethoprim by uv chlorine wu et al 2016 in this study the concentrations of the chlorine containing intermediates such as product m z 283 peaked at 10 min whereas those of the dbps increased monotonically with increasing reaction time however the toxicity changed slightly with increasing reaction time from 5 min to 13 min thus the evolution of the chlorine containing products did not correlate with the toxicity probably due to the increased toxicity induced by uv irradiation these results indicated that clo oxidation can decrease the acute toxicity of the solution caused by direct uv photolysis the increased acute toxicity induced by the uv photolysis of gfrz was unexpected and the mechanism should be investigated in future work 4 conclusions and practical implications three lipid regulators gfrz bzf and ca were efficiently degraded by the ho and rcs formed during the uv chlorine process degradation of gfrz and bzf was primarily due to the rcs whereas ca was mainly degraded by the ho and uv photolysis clo played a very important role in the degradation of gfrz and bzf and the second order rate constants for the reactions were 4 2 0 3 108 and 3 6 0 1 107 m 1 s 1 respectively the chlorine dosage ph and water matrix components such as nom bromide ions and ammonia affected the degradation of gfrz bzf and ca differently due to their specific impacts on the radical chemistry in the uv chlorine process degradation of gemfibrozil by clo was initiated by hydroxylation and chlorine substitution which were followed by cleavage and hydroxylation reactions to form more stable products the oxidation of gfrz and its degradation intermediates by clo decreased its acute toxicity relative to that observed after direct uv photolysis the uv chlorine process is an attractive aop for the degradation of many micropollutants and has good potential for use in drinking water treatment water reuse and swimming pool water treatment sun et al 2016 wang et al 2015 clo is a newly identified radical in the uv chlorine process that plays an important role in the degradation of some micropollutants wu et al 2016 in this study the contribution of clo to the degradation of lipid regulators was revealed for the first time and the transformation pathways dbp formation and changes in the toxicity during the degradation of gfrz by clo were elucidated clo also plays important roles in the transformations of nom and other micropollutants such as caffeine and carbamazepine in the uv chlorine process guo et al 2017 wu et al 2017 and their associated transformation pathways should also be investigated acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the natural

19634,the photochemical conversion and microbial transformation of pollutants mediated by dissolved organic matter dom including 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 are often accompanied in natural water however there are few studies to explore the connection and mechanism between the two processes this research aims to investigate the mechanism of dom after electrochemically modification mediated ee2 combining photodegradation and biodegradation in the environment and it want to explain the natural phenomena of dom after electrochemical advanced treatment entering the water environment mediated ee2 natural degradation the results showed that combining photodegradation with biodegradation rates of ee2 mediated by dom and electrochemically modified dom e dom were promoted obviously the efficiency of ee2 biodegradation was shown to be strongly correlated with electron accepting capacity eac of dom electrochemical modification can increase the eac of dom leading to ee2 biodegradation accelerated and it also can form more triplet state dom moieties to promote the ee2 photodegradation in irradiation conditions due to the increasing of quinone type structures in dom moreover cell polymeric secretion cps secreted from the microorganism could be stimulated to an excited state by irradiation and that also accelerated ee2 degradation photolysis combined with biochemical degradation yielded less toxic degradation products this study shows that the emission of dom in wastewater after electrochemical treatment could accelerate estrogen degradation and play a positive

an endocrine disrupting chemical used as the active agent of many contraceptive pills resulting in its continuous release into the aquatic environment maes et al 2014 it is an anthropogenic pollutant with high resistance to degradation processes which tends to bind with organic compounds leading to bio accumulation and bio magnification karim et al 2017 aris et al 2014 it induces developmental anomalies in wildlife such as feminizing male fish barr et al 2012 owing to ee2 s potential adverse effects on human health it is currently listed on the us epa s candidate contaminant list 3 anonymous 2013 according to the various fates of environmental ee2 biodegradation has been identified as one of predominant pathway for removing ee2 from natural waters and sediments however ee2 biodegradation is usually time consuming and inefficient furthermore lower biodegradation rates are observed for the synthetic estrogen ee2 than for the natural estrogens estrone e1 and 17β estradiol e2 ziels et al 2014 ternes et al 1999 it has however been reported that e2 biodegradation under anaerobic conditions can be accelerated by quinone groups present in dissolved organic matter dom gu et al 2016 dom is normally redox active and capable of mediating biogeochemical redox reactions including reversible electron transfer from and to dom depending on its electron accepting capacity eac and electron donating capacity edc bauer et al 2007 yuan et al 2012 thus dom can transfer electrons from microorganisms e g fe iii reducing bacteria to poorly accessible oxidized metals such as fe iii mn

et al 2008 heitmann and blodau 2006 dom s redox activity is primarily owing to quinone moieties wolf et al 2009 yuan et al 2013 which are widely presented in dom and released into soils by plants and microorganisms ratasuk and nanny 2007 recently extensive studies have assessed the catalytic effect of redox mediators on the reduction of heavy metals and organic contaminants by quinone reducing bacteria including shewanella oneidensis lovley et al 2004 cao et al 2013 pearce et al 2006 so the shewanella oneidensis mr 1 s oneidensis mr 1 strain purchased from china s center for industrial culture collection in beijing was selected for our research besides biodegradation photochemical reactions are also responsible for removing ee2 ee2 has a photodegradation half life of two days in natural water less than that in ultrapure water due to indirect photodegradation by photosensitizers in dom with quinone type and aromatic ketone structures ren et al 2017b golanoski et al 2012 dom can absorb light to reach excited states generating reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals ho singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 zhang et al 2014 previous work in our own laboratory and elsewhere has shown that dom mainly its humic acids has and fulvic acids fas can significantly accelerate the photochemical degradation of ee2 grzybowski and szydłowski 2014 ren et al 2016 zuo et al 2013 but under anaerobic conditions dom can also promote microbial degradation of ee2 zhang et al 2014 in the aquatic environment there would be a synergistic degradation of pollutants by light and microorganisms kot wasik et al 2004 the fractions of dom such as quinone type structures active in electron transfer are also responsible for its photosensitizing behavior but there is currently a lack of knowledge about any coupling of ee2 photodegradation and biodegradation in the presence of dom in addition the phenol catechol and hydroquinone type moieties in dom can be transformed into quinone type structures by oxidative treatment as in chlorine chlorine dioxide oxidation or in ozonation wenk et al 2013 chon et al 2015 this suggests that the fraction of quinone type structures in dom could be increased by electrochemical oxidation leading to faster ee2 photodegradation and biodegradation dom has a wide molecular weight mw distribution due to its complex chemical composition and structure dom fractions of different mw also have different redox properties and electron shuttling capacities yuan et al 2013 dom fractions of different mw mediated the process of ee2 photodegradation and biodegradation also should be investigated this study was designed to explore ee2 photodegradation and biodegradation under anaerobic conditions and the dom fractions involved the dom was characterized in terms of its functional groups uv absorption fluorescence edc and eac were measured by potentiometric titration uv vis spectroscopy fluorescence spectrophotometer and electrochemical instrument respectively anaerobic ee2 biodegradation by s oneidensis mr 1 was investigated in the presence of different types of dom furthermore the contribution of triplet state dom 3dom to ee2 photodegradation was explored with different types of dom the coupling of photodegradation and biodegradation was another topic explored along with the effects of cell polymeric secretion cps ultimately the toxicity of ee2 degradation products was detected using the typical in vitro model mcf 7 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and microorganisms ee2 sorbic acid sa tert butyl

inorganic reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from china s sinopharm chemical reagent co mcf 7 cells were obtained from american type culture collection manassas va usa milli q water electrical resistance 18 0 mω was used throughout this work after four 5 day subculture cycles with increasing concentrations of ee2 0 2 0 5 0 8 and 1 0 mg l under anaerobic conditions the domestication of the s oneidensis mr 1 was terminated when the ee2 removal was reached 50 the culture was then stored until use at 80 c in a 1 4 v v glycerol solution in ultrapure water 2 2 experiments 2 2 1 fractionation and electrochemical modification of the dom the ha fa and sha samples were ultra filtered into two fractions of different mw using an amicon ultra 15 centrifugal filter merck corporation usa with 3 kda hydrophilic ultrafiltration membranes the low molecular weight material 3 kda of ha fa and sha fractions obtained from the fractionation were termed lha lfa and lsha l dom the higher molecular weight material 3 kda was termed hha hfa and hsha h dom the total organic carbon toc concentration uv absorbance fluorescence and functional group breakdown of each fraction was measured the electrochemical modification of the dom was carried out in an open and undivided batch of electrolytic cells 50 60 100 mm in a glass tank containing 100 ml of hha hfa or hsha solution with concentration of 100 0 mgc l and 0 1 mol l kcl 0 1 mol l nah2po4 under galvanostatic conditions using a dc power supply the anodes were 150 50 mm ti sb sno2 plates with an active surface area of 20 cm2 after coating with sn and sb using techniques previously reported he et al 2016 the carbon polytetrafluoroethylene c ptfe cathodes measured 80 40 0 3 mm which used in the zhan s report zhan et al 2016 the dom modification process lasted 90 min at magnetic stirring and aerobic condition with the values of ph 7 0 and the distance between electrodes is 10 0 cm the electrochemically modified materials designated eha efa and esha e dom were stored at 4 c for two weeks 2 2 2 cps extraction the extraction of polymeric secretions from the cells applied the procedures reported by jianguo zhao in 2014 zhao et al 2014 s oneidensis mr 1 cells were cultivated in 250 ml of a solution containing 10 g l nacl 5 g l of yeast extract and 10 g l peptone over 12 h the resulting liquid was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min to separate out the microorganisms after being washed three times using 0 1 mol l naoh the microorganisms were injected into an inorganic salt medium with 1000 mg l of nacl 800 mg l nh4cl 500 mg l kh2po4 600 mg l k2hpo4 200 mg l mgcl2 6h2o and 50 mg l cacl2 2h2o and left to incubate for three days a 20 khz ultrasound probe was then used to deliver 480 w ultrasound at a depth of 5 cm in the mixed liquor over a period of 10 min that disrupted the cultured cells releasing polymeric secretions after that dowex resin 50 80 na form 20 50 mesh was scattered into the mixed liquor the suspension was stirred in a conical flask for 2 h at 4 c and 200 rpm the cps was then separated by centrifugation at 15 000 rpm for 20 min at 4 c the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm glass fiber filter and the filtered liquor was stored at 4 c for one week 2 2 3 degradation experiments the following degradation experiments were conducted exploring the influence of different molecular weight fractions and of electrochemical modification of dom on ee2 degradation 1 the s oneidensis mr 1 2 9 109 1 4 108 cfu ml was used to degrade a 0 5 mg l solution of ee2 in the presence of 5 0 mgc l of lha lfa lsha hha hfa hsha eha efa or esha or 1 mmol l aqs in the inorganic salts medium under anaerobic conditions at ph 7 while being shaken in an incubator over 132 h 2 i 45 ml of ee2 0 5 mg l was irradiated in milli q water or inorganic salts medium within the presence of 5 0 mgc l lfa ii ee2 0 5 mg l in the inorganic salts medium was irradiated in the presence of 5 0 mgc l of lha lfa lsha hha hfa hsha eha efa or esha or 1 mmol l aqs iii ee2 0 5 mg l was irradiated in the inorganic salts medium with 5 0 mgc l dom and 20 μmol l sa to explore the contribution of 3dom in the ee2 photodegradation in all of these experiments the photoreactor was a 50 ml cylindrical quartz tube 15 mm in diameter with a 150 rpm magnetic stirrer the irradiation was provided by a 300 w medium pressure hg lamp with 290 nm cut off filters ren et al 2017b the lamp was cooled by recirculating cooling water and stabilized for 30 min prior to the experiments the initial ph values of all the tested solutions were controlled at 8 0 0 1 using 1 mol l naoh and 1 mol l h2so4 the samples were maintained at 25 0 5 c in a recirculating cooling water bath and anaerobic conditions were maintained by sparging with n2 3 the coupled biodegradation and photodegradation experiments were conducted in the same photoreactor with the s oneidensis mr 1 ee2 0 5 mg l in the inorganic salts medium was irradiated with 5 0 mgc l of lha lfa lsha hha hfa hsha eha efa or esha or with 1 mmol l aqs in the presence of 2 9 109 cfu ml of s oneidensis mr 1 the reaction conditions were the same as those used in the second set of experiments 4 ee2 photodegradation mediated by different cps concentrations 0 1 0 2 0 5 0 or 10 0 mgc l was explored in the same way 20 μmol l sa 30 mmol l tba or 40 μmol l ffa were tested with 0 5 mg l ee2 and 10 0 mgc l cps in the inorganic salts medium to quantify the contribution of triplet state cps hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen to ee2 photodegradation at anaerobic condition all of the experiments were carried out in triplicate to assess reproducibility 2 3 cell proliferation assay for ee2 degradation products the ee2 degradation products were collected through solid phase extraction as previously reported huang et al 2015 the ee2 standard was also obtained through solid phase extraction from the 0 5 mg l ee2 solution at the same volume of photolysis and combining system solutions then the mcf 7 cells were treated with serial concentrations of ee2 standard 10 5 10 6 and 10 7 mol l or ee2 degradation products the dilution ratios were the same with ee2 standard 10 5 10 6 and 10 7 mol l for 72 h subsequently 20 μl of 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 5 3 carboxymethoxyphenyl 2 4 sulfophenyl 2h tetrazolium mts solution was added to each well and incubated for another 3 h at 37 c and then the absorbance was measured at 490 nm using a microplate reader spectra max m5 molecular devices usa cell viability was calculated using the equation 1 1 c e l l v i a b i l i t y a t a c 100 where at and ac represent the absorbance in the treated and control cultures respectively feng et al 2017 2 4 analysis methods 2 4 1 the detection of dom potentiometric titration was used to quantify the amount of carboxyl group and phenolic hydroxyl group as previously reported ma et al 2001 the procedure used for quinone determination was the same as that described by rashid 1972 the quinone groups present in 30 ml of dom suspension 50 0 mgc l were first reduced with freshly prepared 1 mmol l sncl2 solution at ph6 0 the samples were then heated in closed ampoules for 4 h in an 80 c bath the mixture was filtered washed brought up to a volume of 50 ml and the excess sncl2 was detected immediately using a uv spectrophotometer at 460 nm with the addition of sodium molybdenate and potassium thiocyanate blank experiments were also performed and the amount of stannous chloride consumed in the reaction with the quinone groups was calculated by difference because it contains aromatic chromophores and or other organic compounds dom absorbs strongly in the uv visible uv vis range 200 800 nm particularly in the uv region 200 380 nm lu et al 2015 therefore uv vis spectroscopy was used for preliminary characterization of the dom in this study dom 30 0 mgc l was dissolved in 0 01 mol l kcl at ph6 0 and scanned over the range 200 700 nm with uv 2600 uv vis spectrometer shimadzu japan the same solutions were also scanned using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan with a bandpass slit width of 5 nm for both excitation and emission the scanning ranges were 200 600 nm for excitation and 200 600 nm for emission readings were collected at intervals of 5 nm for excitation with 5 nm for emission at a scanning speed of 1200 nm min the dom s eac and edc are the moles of electrons that can be transferred eac to or withdrawn edc from dom normalized to the toc concentration at a given potential they were quantified using a chi660e electrochemical workstation chenhua shanghai china with a conventional three electrode cell at ambient temperature lu et al 2015 yuan et al 2013 the electrochemical experiments were performed with a graphite plate with a projected surface area of 5 cm2 as the working electrode pt mesh was the counter electrode and ag agcl served as the reference electrode the eac and edc were measured by the electrochemical method chronoamperometry at the potential of 0 6 v and 0 5 v vs ag agcl respectively 2 4 2 ee2 s oneidensis and dom concentrations the ee2 concentration during each reaction was monitored using an agilent 1260 series liquid chromatograph with a silicagel c18 waters 5 μm with inner dimensions of 250 mm 4 6 mm the details have previously been described he et al 2016 the concentrations of s oneidensis mr 1 were measured by uv vis spectroscopy at 600 nm od600 the dom and cps concentrations were computed using the total organic carbon content which was determined with a toc analyzer elementar vario germany 3 results and discussion 3 1 the analysis of dom fractions 3 1 1 the carboxyl group phenolic hydroxyl group and quinone group results from the potentiometric titration results summarized in fig 1 the content of carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups in the dom were calculated the calculation results suggested that l dom contributed much more to the carboxyl group content and less to the phenolic hydroxyl group content than h dom as shown in table 1 similar results have been reported previously yuan et al 2013 the l dom also had much higher quinone group content after electrochemical modification 13 8 of the hfa 8 0 the hha and 6 3 of the hsha had been broken down into lower molecular weight species as characterized by the toc after ultrafiltration the electrochemical modification decreased the level of carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups in the h dom but quinone groups were increased the fa fraction contained much more carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups than the ha fraction but less quinone groups 3 1 2 uv vis and fluorescence spectroscopy results for dom suva254 is defined as the uv absorbance at 254 nm in inverse meters m 1 divided by the toc concentration measured in milligrams per liter mg l as in equation 2 suva254 is a good indicator of the dom s humic fraction which has been used as a surrogate measurement for dom aromaticity traina et al 1990 the value of δlgk is also used as a measurement for dom oxidation and aromaticity it is calculated using equation 3 chen et al 2012 2 s u v a 254 a 254 t o c 3 δ l g k l g a 400 l g a 600 the fluorescence index fi is also used as a measure of dom aromaticity it is calculated using equation 4 there is an inverse relationship between fi and dom aromaticity birdwell and engel 2010 4 f i f e m e x 450 370 f e m e x 550 370 the humification index hix is defined as the ratio of the area of the upper quarter of the fluorescence emission spectrum in response to 254 nm excitation the portion from 435 to 450 nm to the area of the lower usable quarter 300 345 nm bi et al 2013 the hix is an indicator of humic substance content or the extent of humification it was calculated according to equation 5 higher values indicate greater humification hansen et al 2016 5 h i x f e m e x 435 450 254 f e m e x 300 345 254 the suva254 data presented in fig 2 and table 2 show that the aromaticity of the h dom was greater than that of the l dom and that the aromaticity of the ha was also greater than that of the fa the values of δlgk show the same results table 2 the dom s aromaticity decreased after the electrochemical modification that could be explained by the powerful oxidative ability of the electrochemical process which could have destroyed aromatic structures in the dom fig 3 presents the dom s three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectra the components of fa ha and sha before and after electrochemical modification have no obvious difference as well as the l dom and h dom fa contains the fulvic acid and fulvic acid like components ha contains the fulvic acid humic acid and humic acid like components sha contains humic acid and humic acid like components as shown in fig 3 which were analyzed by the previous study chen et al 2003 the dom aromaticity results by fluorescence spectroscopy table 2 agree with the results by uv vis spectroscopy they also show that the h dom had greater humification than the l dom or e dom and that the ha had greater humification than the fa 3 1 3 the electron donating and accepting capacity of the dom eacs and edcs for dom from peat bauer et al 2007 forest soil bi et al 2013 and sewage sludge yuan et al 2011 have been determined using electrochemical workstations table 3 and fig 4 a present the qeac values where q was the transferred amount of electrons determined in this study all of the eacs were measured at a potential of 0 6 v vs ag agcl aeschbacher has reported aeschbacher et al 2010 qeacs for dom of aquatic and terrestrial origin ranging from 493 to 1961 μmole g c using electrochemical methods the lower eac values obtained in this study could be attributed to the differences in the specific experimental conditions and the dom used the qedc values table 3 and fig 4b were calculated by integrating the oxidation current at 0 5 v vs ag agcl the results showed that the lfa and lha fractions had greater eac than the hfa and hha but the eac of the lsha was less than that of the hsha the electron transfer capacity of the fas was much greater than that of the has nurmi and tratnyek have previously reported nurmi and tratnyek 2002 that the fractions rich in polyphenolic moieties and quinones are the primary determinants of a dom s redox properties differences in the structures and components of the dom fractions probably led to the variations in eac and edc observed in this research the eacs and edcs of eha efa and esha were however dramatically increased after electrochemical modification probably because carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups in the dom were destroyed in the electrochemical process but quinone groups were increased as shown in table 1 and fig s1 3 2 ee2 biodegradation by s oneidensis mr 1 in the presence of dom and aqs as shown in fig 5 a anaerobic ee2 biodegradation by s oneidensis mr 1 was mediated by 1 mmol l aqs ee2 degradation efficiencies were calculated based on the differences with the addition of dom fractions or aqs the highest ee2 removal efficiency 41 6 after 132 h was observed in the presence of lfa as shown in fig 5b ee2 removal efficiencies increased with addition of efa eha and esha probably resulting from the eac increasing after electrochemical modification fig 5d related the observed ee2 biodegradation efficiencies with the eacs of the dom fractions the relationship was approximately linear with a correlation coefficient r 2 0 90 these results agree with those reported from a previous study yuan et al 2013 which concluded that dom can act as a redox buffer by accepting electrons from microbial respiration under anoxic conditions and by donating electrons to oxygen to be re oxidized upon re aeration fig 5b shows that toc removal was much greater in the presence of l dom fractions than that in presence of h dom e dom also showed greater toc removal efficiency the reason could be that e dom and l dom are more easily used by s oneidensis mr 1 in its growth and metabolism as described in fig 5c the ee2 degradation rate also improved with the addition of aqs but aqs cannot promote s oneidensis mr 1 metabolism leading to the low toc removal efficiency to summarize l dom and e dom fractions promote ee2 removal by s oneidensis mr 1 more effectively than h dom resulting from their greater eacs and better bioavailability 3 3 ee2 photolysis with dom and aqs fig 6 illustrates the effect of lfa on ee2 photolysis in an inorganic salts medium the kinetics can be represented by a pseudo first order model without lfa the ee2 photodegradation rate was not significantly different in the inorganic salts medium and in ultrapure water but the rate 0 446 h 1 was much higher with 5 0 mg c l of lfa present these results suggested that the ions in the inorganic salts medium could promote dom aggregation to increase ee2 photolysis aggregation would promote interactions between functional groups such as phenolic and enolic hydroxyl groups on different dom molecules that protect 3dom as kimberly has reported parker et al 2013 fig 7 a presents the result of anoxic ee2 photolysis over 5 h mediated by 1 mmol l aqs or in the presence of different molecular weight fractions of electrochemically modified dom 5 mg c l the results suggested that ee2 photolysis was promoted by the various dom fractions except hsha and by aqs furthermore ee2 photolysis proceeded faster in the presence of l dom than that with h dom fas also accelerated ee2 photolysis better than has as summarized in table 4 l dom and fas contained more chromophoric and quinone groups as shown in fig 3 and table 1 leading to the production of more 3dom these results are also consistent with previously published findings ren et al 2017a the rate of 0 159 h 1 with aqs mediation could also explain the results reported by kelli golanoski et al 2012 fig 7a and table 4 also illustrate that ee2 photolysis is more effectively promoted by e dom moieties compared with h dom compounds to obtain a more detailed understanding of 3dom s contribution to ee2 photolysis ee2 photodegradation with various dom fractions and 20 μmol l sa was explored with the results shown in fig 7b the phenomenon of 3dom contribution on ee2 photolysis was similar to the ee2 photolysis rate in presence of different dom which was in order of l dom h dom and e dom h dom as calculated in table 4 it showed that the 3dom contribution to ee2 photolysis was increased after electrochemical modification due to increase in chromophoric and quinone groups the obvious differences between ha and sha in terms of the photolysis rate and 3dom s contribution resulted from source and structural group differences 3 4 coupled photolysis and biodegradation of ee2 the anaerobic conditions of an aquatic bottom zone with illumination were simulated to explore ee2 degradation mediated by dom in more natural settings the presence of dom or aqs was found to promote coupled photolysis and microbial degradation under such conditions as shown in fig 8 a equation 6 was used to quantify the improvement resulting from combining photodegradation with biodegradation 6 i m p r o v e m e n t i n e f f i c i e n c y k o b s p h o t o s k o b s p h o t o k o b s p h o t o 100 k obs photo here is the ee2 degradation rate constant attributable to photolysis alone k obs photo s is the constant for combined photodegradation and biodegradation assuming pseudo first order kinetics the results summarized in table 4 show that lsha hsha and esha are the dom fractions most effective in promoting ee2 combined degradation aqs also improves the rate in an aquatic environment furthermore the ee2 degradation rate was improved markedly with the addition of electrochemically modified dom due to the increasing of quinone groups the toc removal efficiency in photolysis was in order l dom h dom e dom h dom and ha fa as shown in the fig 8b however the toc removal efficiency in the combined system was observably less in the presence of dom probably resulting from an optical shielding effect of the s oneidensis mr 1 and incomplete dom degradation the fig 8c implied that the s oneidensis mr 1 survived the illumination 290 nm well when dom except for hha was present the s oneidensis mr 1 had a better growth in the combined system in the presence of e dom compared with h dom except for hfa in other research joint effects of photolysis and biodegradation in accelerating the removal of contaminants have been demonstrated in water gan et al 2014 and in our study dom can be used as an electronic shuttle to participate in ee2 biodegradation meanwhile dom also can be stimulated to become the 3dom leading to the ee2 photodegradation accelerated so the joint effect of biodegradation and photodegradation mediated by dom could accelerate ee2 degradation 3 5 the effect of cps on ee2 photolysis ee2 photodegradation in the presence of various cps concentrations was also explored under anaerobic conditions to clarify whether or not such material from s oneidensis mr 1 might promote ee2 photolysis as shown in fig 9 a the ee2 removal rate increased with the increase of cps concentration in order to explore the contribution of radical substances quenching experiments were conducted involving the addition of sa tba and ffa from fig 9b it indicated that triplet state cps contributed about 51 9 of the observed photodegradation hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen contributed about 17 6 and 10 7 respectively the predominant contribution of triplet state cps indicates that it contains some photosensitive substances which can be stimulated to a triplet state resulting in accelerating ee2 degradation 3 6 toxicity of ee2 degradation products in vivo studies involving animal models have suggested that endocrine disrupting chemicals can adversely affect their physiological characteristics but animal models imperfectly represent human subjects in some respects in vitro model systems using cultured cells treated with endocrine disrupting chemicals may be more suitable for evaluating any adverse effects on humans or animals xu et al 2017 mcf 7 was selected as a typical in vitro model and used to evaluate the toxicity of ee2 s degradation products from photolysis and from the combined system columns s 5 s 6 and s 7 in fig 10 showed that the inhibition of cell viability was promoted with the increasing of ee2 concentration cell viability was less affected by the products of the combined system compared with the effect of photolysis products at 10 6 mol l which was closed to the experimental ee2 aquatic concentration with 0 5 mg l these results imply that the products of ee2 photolysis or of the combined system are relatively less toxic and that the degradation products from the combined system pose less environmental risk compared with that from photolysis products 4 conclusions combining photodegradation with biodegradation rates of ee2 mediated by dom were promoted obviously especially in the presence of e dom the efficiency of ee2 biodegradation in presence of dom strongly correlates with the dom s eac electrochemical modification of dom can increase its eac probably because carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups in the h dom were destroyed in the electrochemical process but quinone groups were increased ee2 photolysis is also promoted in the presence of e dom as a result of its tendency to generate 3dom radicals cps as a photosensitive substance secreted from s oneidensis mr 1 can be stimulated to a triplet state which also accelerates ee2 degradation the degradation products from the combined system pose less environmental risk than that from photolysis alone the emission of dom in wastewater after electrochemical treatment could accelerate estrogen degradation and play a positive role on the pollutant transformation in the environment acknowledgement this research was sponsored by the national natural science foundation of china grant number 41761092 41401558 and 21567014 and yunnan provincial fund

19634,the photochemical conversion and microbial transformation of pollutants mediated by dissolved organic matter dom including 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 are often accompanied in natural water however there are few studies to explore the connection and mechanism between the two processes this research aims to investigate the mechanism of dom after electrochemically modification mediated ee2 combining photodegradation and biodegradation in the environment and it want to explain the natural phenomena of dom after electrochemical advanced treatment entering the water environment mediated ee2 natural degradation the results showed that combining photodegradation with biodegradation rates of ee2 mediated by dom and electrochemically modified dom e dom were promoted obviously the efficiency of ee2 biodegradation was shown to be strongly correlated with electron accepting capacity eac of dom electrochemical modification can increase the eac of dom leading to ee2 biodegradation accelerated and it also can form more triplet state dom moieties to promote the ee2 photodegradation in irradiation conditions due to the increasing of quinone type structures in dom moreover cell polymeric secretion cps secreted from the microorganism could be stimulated to an excited state by irradiation and that also accelerated ee2 degradation photolysis combined with biochemical degradation yielded less toxic degradation products this study shows that the emission of dom in wastewater after electrochemical treatment could accelerate estrogen degradation and play a positive

an endocrine disrupting chemical used as the active agent of many contraceptive pills resulting in its continuous release into the aquatic environment maes et al 2014 it is an anthropogenic pollutant with high resistance to degradation processes which tends to bind with organic compounds leading to bio accumulation and bio magnification karim et al 2017 aris et al 2014 it induces developmental anomalies in wildlife such as feminizing male fish barr et al 2012 owing to ee2 s potential adverse effects on human health it is currently listed on the us epa s candidate contaminant list 3 anonymous 2013 according to the various fates of environmental ee2 biodegradation has been identified as one of predominant pathway for removing ee2 from natural waters and sediments however ee2 biodegradation is usually time consuming and inefficient furthermore lower biodegradation rates are observed for the synthetic estrogen ee2 than for the natural estrogens estrone e1 and 17β estradiol e2 ziels et al 2014 ternes et al 1999 it has however been reported that e2 biodegradation under anaerobic conditions can be accelerated by quinone groups present in dissolved organic matter dom gu et al 2016 dom is normally redox active and capable of mediating biogeochemical redox reactions including reversible electron transfer from and to dom depending on its electron accepting capacity eac and electron donating capacity edc bauer et al 2007 yuan et al 2012 thus dom can transfer electrons from microorganisms e g fe iii reducing bacteria to poorly accessible oxidized metals such as fe iii mn iv cr vi and u vi lu et al 2015 sunda and kieber 1994 deiana et al 2010 gu and chen 2003 or from abiotic reductants e g h2s to organic pollutants e g nitroaromatics and substituted nitrobenzenes colón et al 2008 heitmann and blodau 2006 dom s redox activity is primarily owing to quinone moieties wolf et al 2009 yuan et al 2013 which are widely presented in dom and released into soils by plants and microorganisms ratasuk and nanny 2007 recently extensive studies have assessed the catalytic effect of redox mediators on the reduction of heavy metals and organic contaminants by quinone reducing bacteria including shewanella oneidensis lovley et al 2004 cao et al 2013 pearce et al 2006 so the shewanella oneidensis mr 1 s oneidensis mr 1 strain purchased from china s center for industrial culture collection in beijing was selected for our research besides biodegradation photochemical reactions are also responsible for removing ee2 ee2 has a photodegradation half life of two days in natural water less than that in ultrapure water due to indirect photodegradation by photosensitizers in dom with quinone type and aromatic ketone structures ren et al 2017b golanoski et al 2012 dom can absorb light to reach excited states generating reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals ho singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 zhang et al 2014 previous work in our own laboratory and elsewhere has shown that dom mainly its humic acids has and fulvic acids fas can significantly accelerate the photochemical degradation of ee2 grzybowski and szydłowski 2014 ren et al 2016 zuo et al 2013 but under anaerobic conditions dom can also promote microbial degradation of ee2 zhang et al 2014 in the aquatic environment there would be a synergistic degradation of pollutants by light and microorganisms kot wasik et al 2004 the fractions of dom such as quinone type structures active in electron transfer are also responsible for its photosensitizing behavior but there is currently a lack of knowledge about any coupling of ee2 photodegradation and biodegradation in the presence of dom in addition the phenol catechol and hydroquinone type moieties in dom can be transformed into quinone type structures by oxidative treatment as in chlorine chlorine dioxide oxidation or in ozonation wenk et al 2013 chon et al 2015 this suggests that the fraction of quinone type structures in dom could be increased by electrochemical oxidation leading to faster ee2 photodegradation and biodegradation dom has a wide molecular weight mw distribution due to its complex chemical composition and structure dom fractions of different mw also have different redox properties and electron shuttling capacities yuan et al 2013 dom fractions of different mw mediated the process of ee2 photodegradation and biodegradation also should be investigated this study was designed to explore ee2 photodegradation and biodegradation under anaerobic conditions and the dom fractions involved the dom was characterized in terms of its functional groups uv absorption fluorescence edc and eac were measured by potentiometric titration uv vis spectroscopy fluorescence spectrophotometer and electrochemical instrument respectively anaerobic ee2 biodegradation by s oneidensis mr 1 was investigated in the presence of different types of dom furthermore the contribution of triplet state dom 3dom to ee2 photodegradation was explored with different types of dom the coupling of photodegradation and biodegradation was another topic explored along with the effects of cell polymeric secretion cps ultimately the toxicity of ee2 degradation products was detected using the typical in vitro model mcf 7 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and microorganisms ee2 sorbic acid sa tert butyl

inorganic reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from china s sinopharm chemical reagent co mcf 7 cells were obtained from american type culture collection manassas va usa milli q water electrical resistance 18 0 mω was used throughout this work after four 5 day subculture cycles with increasing concentrations of ee2 0 2 0 5 0 8 and 1 0 mg l under anaerobic conditions the domestication of the s oneidensis mr 1 was terminated when the ee2 removal was reached 50 the culture was then stored until use at 80 c in a 1 4 v v glycerol solution in ultrapure water 2 2 experiments 2 2 1 fractionation and electrochemical modification of the dom the ha fa and sha samples were ultra filtered into two fractions of different mw using an amicon ultra 15 centrifugal filter merck corporation usa with 3 kda hydrophilic ultrafiltration membranes the low molecular weight material 3 kda of ha fa and sha fractions obtained from the fractionation were termed lha lfa and lsha l dom the higher molecular weight material 3 kda was termed hha hfa and hsha h dom the total organic carbon toc concentration uv absorbance fluorescence and functional group breakdown of each fraction was measured the electrochemical modification of the dom was carried out in an open and undivided batch of electrolytic cells 50 60 100 mm in a glass tank containing 100 ml of hha hfa or hsha solution with concentration of 100 0 mgc l and 0 1 mol l kcl 0 1 mol l nah2po4 under galvanostatic conditions using a dc power supply the anodes were 150 50 mm ti sb sno2 plates with an active surface area of 20 cm2 after coating with sn and sb using techniques previously reported he et al 2016 the carbon polytetrafluoroethylene c ptfe cathodes measured 80 40 0 3 mm which used in the zhan s report zhan et al 2016 the dom modification process lasted 90 min at magnetic stirring and aerobic condition with the values of ph 7 0 and the distance between electrodes is 10 0 cm the electrochemically modified materials designated eha efa and esha e dom were stored at 4 c for two weeks 2 2 2 cps extraction the extraction of polymeric secretions from the cells applied the procedures reported by jianguo zhao in 2014 zhao et al 2014 s oneidensis mr 1 cells were cultivated in 250 ml of a solution containing 10 g l nacl 5 g l of yeast extract and 10 g l peptone over 12 h the resulting liquid was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min to separate out the microorganisms after being washed three times using 0 1 mol l naoh the microorganisms were injected into an inorganic salt medium with 1000 mg l of nacl 800 mg l nh4cl 500 mg l kh2po4 600 mg l k2hpo4 200 mg l mgcl2 6h2o and 50 mg l cacl2 2h2o and left to incubate for three days a 20 khz ultrasound probe was then used to deliver 480 w ultrasound at a depth of 5 cm in the mixed liquor over a period of 10 min that disrupted the cultured cells releasing polymeric secretions after that dowex resin 50 80 na form 20 50 mesh was scattered into the mixed liquor the suspension was stirred in a conical flask for 2 h at 4 c and 200 rpm the cps was then separated by centrifugation at 15 000 rpm for 20 min at 4 c the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm glass fiber filter and the filtered liquor was stored at 4 c for one week 2 2 3 degradation experiments the following degradation experiments were conducted exploring the influence of different molecular weight fractions and of electrochemical modification of dom on ee2 degradation 1 the s oneidensis mr 1 2 9 109 1 4 108 cfu ml was used to degrade a 0 5 mg l solution of ee2 in the presence of 5 0 mgc l of lha lfa lsha hha hfa hsha eha efa or esha or 1 mmol l aqs in the inorganic salts medium under anaerobic conditions at ph 7 while being shaken in an incubator over 132 h 2 i 45 ml of ee2 0 5 mg l was irradiated in milli q water or inorganic salts medium within the presence of 5 0 mgc l lfa ii ee2 0 5 mg l in the inorganic salts medium was irradiated in the presence of 5 0 mgc l of lha lfa lsha hha hfa hsha eha efa or esha or 1 mmol l aqs iii ee2 0 5 mg l was irradiated in the inorganic salts medium with 5 0 mgc l dom and 20 μmol l sa to explore the contribution of 3dom in the ee2 photodegradation in all of these experiments the photoreactor was a 50 ml cylindrical quartz tube 15 mm in diameter with a 150 rpm magnetic stirrer the irradiation was provided by a 300 w medium pressure hg lamp with 290 nm cut off filters ren et al 2017b the lamp was cooled by recirculating cooling water and stabilized for 30 min prior to the experiments the initial ph values of all the tested solutions were controlled at 8 0 0 1 using 1 mol l naoh and 1 mol l h2so4 the samples were maintained at 25 0 5 c in a recirculating cooling water bath and anaerobic conditions were maintained by sparging with n2 3 the coupled biodegradation and photodegradation experiments were conducted in the same photoreactor with the s oneidensis mr 1 ee2 0 5 mg l in the inorganic salts medium was irradiated with 5 0 mgc l of lha lfa lsha hha hfa hsha eha efa or esha or with 1 mmol l aqs in the presence of 2 9 109 cfu ml of s oneidensis mr 1 the reaction conditions were the same as those used in the second set of experiments 4 ee2 photodegradation mediated by different cps concentrations 0 1 0 2 0 5 0 or 10 0 mgc l was explored in the same way 20 μmol l sa 30 mmol l tba or 40 μmol l ffa were tested with 0 5 mg l ee2 and 10 0 mgc l cps in the inorganic salts medium to quantify the contribution of triplet state cps hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen to ee2 photodegradation at anaerobic condition all of the experiments were carried out in triplicate to assess reproducibility 2 3 cell proliferation assay for ee2 degradation products the ee2 degradation products were collected through solid phase extraction as previously reported huang et al 2015 the ee2 standard was also obtained through solid phase extraction from the 0 5 mg l ee2 solution at the same volume of photolysis and combining system solutions then the mcf 7 cells were treated with serial concentrations of ee2 standard 10 5 10 6 and 10 7 mol l or ee2 degradation products the dilution ratios were the same with ee2 standard 10 5 10 6 and 10 7 mol l for 72 h subsequently 20 μl of 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 5 3 carboxymethoxyphenyl 2 4 sulfophenyl 2h tetrazolium mts solution was added to each well and incubated for another 3 h at 37 c and then the absorbance was measured at 490 nm using a microplate reader spectra max m5 molecular devices usa cell viability was calculated using the equation 1 1 c e l l v i a b i l i t y a t a c 100 where at and ac represent the absorbance in the treated and control cultures respectively feng et al 2017 2 4 analysis methods 2 4 1 the detection of dom potentiometric titration was used to quantify the amount of carboxyl group and phenolic hydroxyl group as previously reported ma et al 2001 the procedure used for quinone determination was the same as that described by rashid 1972 the quinone groups present in 30 ml of dom suspension 50 0 mgc l were first reduced with freshly prepared 1 mmol l sncl2 solution at ph6 0 the samples were then heated in closed ampoules for 4 h in an 80 c bath the mixture was filtered washed brought up to a volume of 50 ml and the excess sncl2 was detected immediately using a uv spectrophotometer at 460 nm with the addition of sodium molybdenate and potassium thiocyanate blank experiments were also performed and the amount of stannous chloride consumed in the reaction with the quinone groups was calculated by difference because it contains aromatic chromophores and or other organic compounds dom absorbs strongly in the uv visible uv vis range 200 800 nm particularly in the uv region 200 380 nm lu et al 2015 therefore uv vis spectroscopy was used for preliminary characterization of the dom in this study dom 30 0 mgc l was dissolved in 0 01 mol l kcl at ph6 0 and scanned over the range 200 700 nm with uv 2600 uv vis spectrometer shimadzu japan the same solutions were also scanned using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan with a bandpass slit width of 5 nm for both excitation and emission the scanning ranges were 200 600 nm for excitation and 200 600 nm for emission readings were collected at intervals of 5 nm for excitation with 5 nm for emission at a scanning speed of 1200 nm min the dom s eac and edc are the moles of electrons that can be transferred eac to or withdrawn edc from dom normalized to the toc concentration at a given potential they were quantified using a chi660e electrochemical workstation chenhua shanghai china with a conventional three electrode cell at ambient temperature lu et al 2015 yuan et al 2013 the electrochemical experiments were performed with a graphite plate with a projected surface area of 5 cm2 as the working electrode pt mesh was the counter electrode and ag agcl served as the reference electrode the eac and edc were measured by the electrochemical method chronoamperometry at the potential of 0 6 v and 0 5 v vs ag agcl respectively 2 4 2 ee2 s oneidensis and dom concentrations the ee2 concentration during each reaction was monitored using an agilent 1260 series liquid chromatograph with a silicagel c18 waters 5 μm with inner dimensions of 250 mm 4 6 mm the details have previously been described he et al 2016 the concentrations of s oneidensis mr 1 were measured by uv vis spectroscopy at 600 nm od600 the dom and cps concentrations were computed using the total organic carbon content which was determined with a toc analyzer elementar vario germany 3 results and discussion 3 1 the analysis of dom fractions 3 1 1 the carboxyl group phenolic hydroxyl group and quinone group results from the potentiometric titration results summarized in fig 1 the content of carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups in the dom were calculated the calculation results suggested that l dom contributed much more to the carboxyl group content and less to the phenolic hydroxyl group content than h dom as shown in table 1 similar results have been reported previously yuan et al 2013 the l dom also had much higher quinone group content after electrochemical modification 13 8 of the hfa 8 0 the hha and 6 3 of the hsha had been broken down into lower molecular weight species as characterized by the toc after ultrafiltration the electrochemical modification decreased the level of carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups in the h dom but quinone groups were increased the fa fraction contained much more carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups than the ha fraction but less quinone groups 3 1 2 uv vis and fluorescence spectroscopy results for dom suva254 is defined as the uv absorbance at 254 nm in inverse meters m 1 divided by the toc concentration measured in milligrams per liter mg l as in equation 2 suva254 is a good indicator of the dom s humic fraction which has been used as a surrogate measurement for dom aromaticity traina et al 1990 the value of δlgk is also used as a measurement for dom oxidation and aromaticity it is calculated using equation 3 chen et al 2012 2 s u v a 254 a 254 t o c 3 δ l g k l g a 400 l g a 600 the fluorescence index fi is also used as a measure of dom aromaticity it is calculated using equation 4 there is an inverse relationship between fi and dom aromaticity birdwell and engel 2010 4 f i f e m e x 450 370 f e m e x 550 370 the humification index hix is defined as the ratio of the area of the upper quarter of the fluorescence emission spectrum in response to 254 nm excitation the portion from 435 to 450 nm to the area of the lower usable quarter 300 345 nm bi et al 2013 the hix is an indicator of humic substance content or the extent of humification it was calculated according to equation 5 higher values indicate greater humification hansen et al 2016 5 h i x f e m e x 435 450 254 f e m e x 300 345 254 the suva254 data presented in fig 2 and table 2 show that the aromaticity of the h dom was greater than that of the l dom and that the aromaticity of the ha was also greater than that of the fa the values of δlgk show the same results table 2 the dom s aromaticity decreased after the electrochemical modification that could be explained by the powerful oxidative ability of the electrochemical process which could have destroyed aromatic structures in the dom fig 3 presents the dom s three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectra the components of fa ha and sha before and after electrochemical modification have no obvious difference as well as the l dom and h dom fa contains the fulvic acid and fulvic acid like components ha contains the fulvic acid humic acid and humic acid like components sha contains humic acid and humic acid like components as shown in fig 3 which were analyzed by the previous study chen et al 2003 the dom aromaticity results by fluorescence spectroscopy table 2 agree with the results by uv vis spectroscopy they also show that the h dom had greater humification than the l dom or e dom and that the ha had greater humification than the fa 3 1 3 the electron donating and accepting capacity of the dom eacs and edcs for dom from peat bauer et al 2007 forest soil bi et al 2013 and sewage sludge yuan et al 2011 have been determined using electrochemical workstations table 3 and fig 4 a present the qeac values where q was the transferred amount of electrons determined in this study all of the eacs were measured at a potential of 0 6 v vs ag agcl aeschbacher has reported aeschbacher et al 2010 qeacs for dom of aquatic and terrestrial origin ranging from 493 to 1961 μmole g c using electrochemical methods the lower eac values obtained in this study could be attributed to the differences in the specific experimental conditions and the dom used the qedc values table 3 and fig 4b were calculated by integrating the oxidation current at 0 5 v vs ag agcl the results showed that the lfa and lha fractions had greater eac than the hfa and hha but the eac of the lsha was less than that of the hsha the electron transfer capacity of the fas was much greater than that of the has nurmi and tratnyek have previously reported nurmi and tratnyek 2002 that the fractions rich in polyphenolic moieties and quinones are the primary determinants of a dom s redox properties differences in the structures and components of the dom fractions probably led to the variations in eac and edc observed in this research the eacs and edcs of eha efa and esha were however dramatically increased after electrochemical modification probably because carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups in the dom were destroyed in the electrochemical process but quinone groups were increased as shown in table 1 and fig s1 3 2 ee2 biodegradation by s oneidensis mr 1 in the presence of dom and aqs as shown in fig 5 a anaerobic ee2 biodegradation by s oneidensis mr 1 was mediated by 1 mmol l aqs ee2 degradation efficiencies were calculated based on the differences with the addition of dom fractions or aqs the highest ee2 removal efficiency 41 6 after 132 h was observed in the presence of lfa as shown in fig 5b ee2 removal efficiencies increased with addition of efa eha and esha probably resulting from the eac increasing after electrochemical modification fig 5d related the observed ee2 biodegradation efficiencies with the eacs of the dom fractions the relationship was approximately linear with a correlation coefficient r 2 0 90 these results agree with those reported from a previous study yuan et al 2013 which concluded that dom can act as a redox buffer by accepting electrons from microbial respiration under anoxic conditions and by donating electrons to oxygen to be re oxidized upon re aeration fig 5b shows that toc removal was much greater in the presence of l dom fractions than that in presence of h dom e dom also showed greater toc removal efficiency the reason could be that e dom and l dom are more easily used by s oneidensis mr 1 in its growth and metabolism as described in fig 5c the ee2 degradation rate also improved with the addition of aqs but aqs cannot promote s oneidensis mr 1 metabolism leading to the low toc removal efficiency to summarize l dom and e dom fractions promote ee2 removal by s oneidensis mr 1 more effectively than h dom resulting from their greater eacs and better bioavailability 3 3 ee2 photolysis with dom and aqs fig 6 illustrates the effect of lfa on ee2 photolysis in an inorganic salts medium the kinetics can be represented by a pseudo first order model without lfa the ee2 photodegradation rate was not significantly different in the inorganic salts medium and in ultrapure water but the rate 0 446 h 1 was much higher with 5 0 mg c l of lfa present these results suggested that the ions in the inorganic salts medium could promote dom aggregation to increase ee2 photolysis aggregation would promote interactions between functional groups such as phenolic and enolic hydroxyl groups on different dom molecules that protect 3dom as kimberly has reported parker et al 2013 fig 7 a presents the result of anoxic ee2 photolysis over 5 h mediated by 1 mmol l aqs or in the presence of different molecular weight fractions of electrochemically modified dom 5 mg c l the results suggested that ee2 photolysis was promoted by the various dom fractions except hsha and by aqs furthermore ee2 photolysis proceeded faster in the presence of l dom than that with h dom fas also accelerated ee2 photolysis better than has as summarized in table 4 l dom and fas contained more chromophoric and quinone groups as shown in fig 3 and table 1 leading to the production of more 3dom these results are also consistent with previously published findings ren et al 2017a the rate of 0 159 h 1 with aqs mediation could also explain the results reported by kelli golanoski et al 2012 fig 7a and table 4 also illustrate that ee2 photolysis is more effectively promoted by e dom moieties compared with h dom compounds to obtain a more detailed understanding of 3dom s contribution to ee2 photolysis ee2 photodegradation with various dom fractions and 20 μmol l sa was explored with the results shown in fig 7b the phenomenon of 3dom contribution on ee2 photolysis was similar to the ee2 photolysis rate in presence of different dom which was in order of l dom h dom and e dom h dom as calculated in table 4 it showed that the 3dom contribution to ee2 photolysis was increased after electrochemical modification due to increase in chromophoric and quinone groups the obvious differences between ha and sha in terms of the photolysis rate and 3dom s contribution resulted from source and structural group differences 3 4 coupled photolysis and biodegradation of ee2 the anaerobic conditions of an aquatic bottom zone with illumination were simulated to explore ee2 degradation mediated by dom in more natural settings the presence of dom or aqs was found to promote coupled photolysis and microbial degradation under such conditions as shown in fig 8 a equation 6 was used to quantify the improvement resulting from combining photodegradation with biodegradation 6 i m p r o v e m e n t i n e f f i c i e n c y k o b s p h o t o s k o b s p h o t o k o b s p h o t o 100 k obs photo here is the ee2 degradation rate constant attributable to photolysis alone k obs photo s is the constant for combined photodegradation and biodegradation assuming pseudo first order kinetics the results summarized in table 4 show that lsha hsha and esha are the dom fractions most effective in promoting ee2 combined degradation aqs also improves the rate in an aquatic environment furthermore the ee2 degradation rate was improved markedly with the addition of electrochemically modified dom due to the increasing of quinone groups the toc removal efficiency in photolysis was in order l dom h dom e dom h dom and ha fa as shown in the fig 8b however the toc removal efficiency in the combined system was observably less in the presence of dom probably resulting from an optical shielding effect of the s oneidensis mr 1 and incomplete dom degradation the fig 8c implied that the s oneidensis mr 1 survived the illumination 290 nm well when dom except for hha was present the s oneidensis mr 1 had a better growth in the combined system in the presence of e dom compared with h dom except for hfa in other research joint effects of photolysis and biodegradation in accelerating the removal of contaminants have been demonstrated in water gan et al 2014 and in our study dom can be used as an electronic shuttle to participate in ee2 biodegradation meanwhile dom also can be stimulated to become the 3dom leading to the ee2 photodegradation accelerated so the joint effect of biodegradation and photodegradation mediated by dom could accelerate ee2 degradation 3 5 the effect of cps on ee2 photolysis ee2 photodegradation in the presence of various cps concentrations was also explored under anaerobic conditions to clarify whether or not such material from s oneidensis mr 1 might promote ee2 photolysis as shown in fig 9 a the ee2 removal rate increased with the increase of cps concentration in order to explore the contribution of radical substances quenching experiments were conducted involving the addition of sa tba and ffa from fig 9b it indicated that triplet state cps contributed about 51 9 of the observed photodegradation hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen contributed about 17 6 and 10 7 respectively the predominant contribution of triplet state cps indicates that it contains some photosensitive substances which can be stimulated to a triplet state resulting in accelerating ee2 degradation 3 6 toxicity of ee2 degradation products in vivo studies involving animal models have suggested that endocrine disrupting chemicals can adversely affect their physiological characteristics but animal models imperfectly represent human subjects in some respects in vitro model systems using cultured cells treated with endocrine disrupting chemicals may be more suitable for evaluating any adverse effects on humans or animals xu et al 2017 mcf 7 was selected as a typical in vitro model and used to evaluate the toxicity of ee2 s degradation products from photolysis and from the combined system columns s 5 s 6 and s 7 in fig 10 showed that the inhibition of cell viability was promoted with the increasing of ee2 concentration cell viability was less affected by the products of the combined system compared with the effect of photolysis products at 10 6 mol l which was closed to the experimental ee2 aquatic concentration with 0 5 mg l these results imply that the products of ee2 photolysis or of the combined system are relatively less toxic and that the degradation products from the combined system pose less environmental risk compared with that from photolysis products 4 conclusions combining photodegradation with biodegradation rates of ee2 mediated by dom were promoted obviously especially in the presence of e dom the efficiency of ee2 biodegradation in presence of dom strongly correlates with the dom s eac electrochemical modification of dom can increase its eac probably because carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups in the h dom were destroyed in the electrochemical process but quinone groups were increased ee2 photolysis is also promoted in the presence of e dom as a result of its tendency to generate 3dom radicals cps as a photosensitive substance secreted from s oneidensis mr 1 can be stimulated to a triplet state which also accelerates ee2 degradation the degradation products from the combined system pose less environmental risk than that from photolysis alone the emission of dom in wastewater after electrochemical treatment could accelerate estrogen degradation and play a positive role on the pollutant transformation in the environment acknowledgement this research was sponsored by the national natural science foundation of china grant number 41761092 41401558 and 21567014 and yunnan provincial fund
